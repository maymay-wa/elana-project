vanquished presidential candidate pat 
robertson appealed to his conservative largely fundamentalist 
christian supporters tuesday and urged them to rally with 
wholehearted support behind george bush 
this party is about to nominate a man that i have come to 
respect and admire robertson told the republican national 
convention in television prime time this man can and will lead 
our nation proudly into the future 
robertson the tv evangelist whose presidential star faded 
quickly in an oftenacrimonious primary campaign described bush as 
a principled conservative and dismissed suggestions that his 
backers would sit out this election 
we care because it does matter robertson said 
as expected robertsons backers who had hoped to make the 
convention their own staged only a brief demonstration waving blue 
and white signs and brightly colored umbrellas 
his latenight speech came as many attending the convention 
began slipping out of the hall for the evening leaving big blocks 
of empty seats two of the networks cut away from his speech in 
favor of other convention coverage as robertson went several 
minutes past prime time 
robertson has spent the conventions opening days preaching 
party unity and praising the conservative direction the party 
charted in its platform 
now he said its time for conservatives and fundamentalists to 
join the bush campaign 
i release my delegates and alternates who have come to this 
convention and urge you and all of my friends across america to 
give your enthusiastic support to our party our candidates and our 
presidential nominee robertson said 
it matters to us and our children whether we vote democrat or 
whether we vote republican robertson said 
robertson also attacked democratic nominee michael dukakis as 
the most liberal candidate ever put forward for the presidency by 
any major party in american history and said democrats do not 
speak for america today 
in one of the sharpest attacks of the convention on democrats 
who held their convention last month robertson insisted the 
liberal mind set reigns supreme in that party 
now the democratic party has discovered the family 
robertson said but lets keep in mind that they want you and me 
to be in one family with jim wright as the daddy barbara mikulski 
as the momma and ted kennedy as the big brother 
they offer unlimited government massive transfers of wealth 
from the productive sector of society to the nonproductive and 
everincreasing regulation of the daily lives of the people and 
their children 
in his primetime speech and in a joint appearance with george 
w bush the vice presidents son earlier tuesday robertson 
sought not only to bring his supporters into the bush camp but also 
to cement his role as a leader of the gops conservative wing and 
guarantee a future that might include another run for the white 
house backers said 
robertsons presidential hopes died early this year in an often 
bruising campaign and some strategists worried that his backers 
many of them fundamentalist christians involved for the first time 
in politics would simply drift away without strong urging from 
robertson 
michael dukakis is a cardcarrying member of the aclu 
american civil liberties union an organization dedicated to 
removing all public affirmation of religious faith in america 
robertson said as president michael dukakis will pack the 
federal courts with aclu radicals

the big summer heat wave rolled on tuesday with temperatures 
boiling past 100 to record highs from the eastern plains to the 
ohio valley but the steamy northeast finally got a break with a 
surge of cooler drier air from canada 
utilities posted more records for demand for electricity as air 
conditioners and fans were turned on full blast 
some school districts in illinois plan to open schools early and 
reduce class periods by almost half when school opens next week to 
avoid the hottest part of the day 
by noon during summer school it was very uncomfortable if it 
was 90 outside it was 95 to 100 in the classrooms thats not a 
good atmosphere for learning said associate principal don 
tokarski of rantoul township ill high school 
i think this will be the hottest weather of the summer taking 
both temperature and humidity into account said norm reitmeyer 
a meteorologist with the national weather service in louisville ky 
weve had an oppressively hot and humid summer without a 
doubt reitmeyer said but particular days such as this or 
tomorrow are rare 
the temperature at paducah ky reached 102 degrees and 
reitmeyer said that and the humidity would push the heat index a 
measure of how hot it feels the opposite of winters wind chill 
factor to 115 he said that is near lifethreatening for some 
people 
kentucky has had a total of 48 days of above90 degrees this 
summer 
milwaukee reached a record high of 100 degrees and that made it 
a record five times the city has hit 100 or higher this year the 
old record was four times in 1936 
some other records included 90 at duluth minn 104 at fargo 
nd 103 at fort dodge iowa 103 at huron sd 102 at 
indianapolis 102 at madison wis 101 at peoria ill and sioux 
falls sd and 102 at springfield ill the national weather 
service said 
the 103 degrees at rockford ill was the hottest reading since 
july 27 1955 la crosse wis marked the 44th day that the 
temperature achieved the 90 degree mark another record 
the 102degree heat wilted about 10000 competitors wearing 
heavy uniforms and carrying musical instruments at the drum corps 
international world championships on the artificial turf at 
arrowhead stadium in kansas city mo 
you can feel it right through your tennis shoes said donald 
macdougall a member of the edmonton strutters of canada one of 
our melophone players almost passed out 
the 136th indiana state fair opened tuesday with livestock 
exhibitors taking extra precautions like putting ice in front of 
large fans to keep animals cool four chickens that were to be 
entered died when their owners left them in cars with the windows 
rolled up fair officials said 
the official high in the 48 contiguous states at 3 pm edt was 
105 degrees not in texas arizona or southern california but at 
chamberlin sd 
but natures own airconditioning in the form of a cool front 
from canada settled over the northeast unfortunately forecasts 
said the heat would soon return 
after 32 days of 90degree temperatures and swamplike humidity 
including a high of 97 monday new york city had a high tuesday of 
merely 86 degrees and the humidity was only around 39 to 42 
percent making it feel almost like early autumn compared to 
preceding weeks 
the downturn in temperatures is certainly going to help not 
only con ed but all new york utilities said bill murphy 
spokesman for the utility that supplies new york citys power 
con edison had a record demand monday of 10160 megawatts of 
electricity the failure of several feeder cables on staten island 
knocked out service to more than 13000 customers and earlier 
monday the utility cut off power to 16 large apartment buildings 
on manhattans upper east side to prevent a wider blackout after 
several feeder cables failed blacking out some 10000 residents 
the cooler air also brought relief for utilities in 
pennsylvania where philadelphia electric co was forced to impose 
a 5 percent voltage reduction monday but the clash of the hot and 
cool air also touched off thunderstorms which knocked out power to 
thousands of customers across the state monday 
farther south utilities across kentucky reported record 
electrical demand monday and expected to exceed those amounts 
tuesday but no problems were reported 
weve been going wild this summer said dick lovegrove a 
spokesman for ashlandbased kentucky power which had records for 
power use almost every day during the past week 
louisville gas amp electric has set alltime peaks 13 times this 
summer said spokesman calvin anderson 
the tennessee valley authority the big federal utility hit 
another record peak summer demand tuesday of 21304 megawatts a 
record monday of 20618 megawatts forced the utility to buy about 
2500 megawatts from neighboring utilities said robert c steffy 
jr senior vice president of power for tva tvas alltime power 
peak was in the winter of 1983 at 22478 megawatts

former president gerald r ford said tuesday 
that democratic chants of where was george unfairly distorted 
and belittled george bushs accomplishments in a long career of 
government service 
in a speech to the republican national convention ford praised 
bush for his experience and competence saying for 45 years 
george bush has been at the center of the action in the service of 
this great republic 
ford said bush does not deserve to have democrats ask where 
was george 
the 38th president was joined at the lectern by his wife betty 
who said she was delighted to work to send george and barbara bush 
to the white house where they belong 
the convention was a half hour behind schedule when ford began 
and many of the delegates had already left the hall but the 
television networks who had been scheduled to end their coverage 
at 11 pm edt stayed with the convention 
obviously stung by the chanted question at last months 
democratic convention when sen edward m kennedy dmass 
questioned bushs influence in the reagan administration ford 
offered this retort 
ill be damned if i will stand by and let anyone with a smirk 
and a sneer discredit the honor service accountability and 
competence of george bush 
if the three democratic standardbearers in this campaign 
think it is about competence ford said let any one of them 
or all three of them put together top the demonstrated competence 
of george bush 
the former president was referring to democratic nominee michael 
dukakis vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen and former 
presidential contender jesse jackson 
ford accused the democrats of attempting to steal the american 
dream at their convention a dream he said belongs to the nation 
and all of its people 
no party no politician has a patent on our dream he said 
the american dream belongs to you and nobody can take it away 
from you 
in an echo of his losing campaign against jimmy carter in 1976 
ford asked his audience do we really want to go back to the days 
of spend and spend and tax and tax of a government in washington 
with its head in the clouds and its hand in your pocket 
i can put it no plainer than this this years democratic 
ticket is a tax increase waiting to happen he said 
in a backhanded slap at dukakis ford said bentsen was pretty 
solid on defense matters 
rhetorically addressing bentsen ford said governor dukakis 
says youll be the kind of vice president who will march into the 
oval office and tell him mr president that is a perfectly 
ridiculous policy 
ford added lloyd with all the differences between the 
democratic leaders why wait speak up now

jewish settlers are 
digging in their heels determined to stay in this seaside strip 
even in the face of resurgent palestinian violence that led the 
army to clamp an indefinite curfew 
they say they are drawn by an improved quality of life in their 
tiny closeknit communities and a pioneering spirit but heightened 
violence in the israelioccupied territory has taken its toll 
six israelis leaving neve dekalim after a visit this week were 
injured in a firebomb attack from the settlement israelis can 
often see tires burning and hear gunfire in the nearby khan yunis 
refugee camp 
jewish settlers here however say they will not be frightened 
away 
we must not let the situation change the normal course of our 
lives thats just what the arabs want shimshon kahilker a 
21yearold seminary student said in an interview tuesday 
the palestinian uprising against israels 21year occupation 
began in gaza eight months ago and tensions have remained high 
of the more than 240 palestinians killed in the rebellion about 
a third were in the strip four israelis also have died 
about 2000 jewish settlers share gaza with 650000 
palestinians about twothirds of whom are refugees living in 
poverty in overcrowded camps 
if the gaza strip is a hurricane then the jewish settlements 
are its eye neve dekalim could be a pleasant suburb if one forgot 
its location 
some families in this settlement about a mile from the 
mediterranean live in homes with manicured lawns and palm trees 
whereas the arabs have been confined roundtheclock to their 
homes during a curfew that began sunday night the small community 
of jewish settlers in gaza can come and go as they please 
on tuesday yitzhak tasa sat outside the municipal building 
selling plastic chairs coolers and umbrellas for the beach 
security concerns however are prevalent neve dekalim is 
circled by barbed wire fences and regularly patroled by israeli 
troops an armed soldier rode in the front seat of a bus bringing 
settlers home 
two weeks ago i was driving with my children in a car and 
someone threw a gigantic rock which broke the window said ruth 
elizur a 28yearold teacher and mother of three who moved to neve 
dekalim from jerusalem two weeks ago 
immediately after that we saw a burning tire blocking the 
road it was a frightening drive i shook all over she said 
but mrs elizur said she had no intention of leaving because 
the settlement offers me the kind of life i want 
its wonderful for children agreed sima elmaliach 28 
they have an excellent religious education 
mrs elmaliach said the latest firebomb attack troubled her 
but we very much believe in god and we believe that if something 
has to happen to somebody it will happen anywhere 
far fewer settlers live in gaza than in the occupied west bank 
and foreign minister shimon peres has suggested resolving the 
palestinian conflict by giving up the strip in return for a 
negotiated settlement 
but bini wiesel a settler who has lived here for 3 years 
opposes any such solution 
the numbers dont matter said the 32yearold music teacher 
and father of six the question is whether we have a right to 
live in our country all of it any arab who accepts that can 
stay and those who dont should leave 
elyada yovel a 14yearold from neve dekalim also opposes 
moving he said he never thinks of the rebellion on busy 
schooldays but on saturdays we go up on the hill to see the 
action we hear shooting in the refugee camp 
but i still go to the beach near the refugee camp he said 
whats there to be afraid of where could you find such quality 
of life except in switzerland

a un human rights panel voted monday to have the 
secretarygeneral investigate the case of a romanian specialist who 
disappeared without completing a report on youth and human rights 
dumitru mazilu had been given a mandate by the un 
subcommission on the prevention of discrimination and protection of 
minorities to present a report to the panels current meeting in 
geneva 
in a letter sent to the subcommission last april and distributed 
by members mazilu said the romanian government had pressured him 
to drop the study forced him to retire from a foreign ministry 
post confiscated his passport and put him under police 
surveillance 
by a vote of 162 the subcommission asked secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar to inform romanias communist authorities 
of the urgent need to establish personal contact with mazilu 
and to report back by wednesday 
the motion sponsored by the french and norwegian delegates 
also urged perez de cuellar to establish mazilus whereabouts and 
arrange a visit to him by a member of the subcommission 
romanian officials told the subcommision that mazilu could not 
complete the report or attend the geneva meeting because of a heart 
condition they said mazilu recently left bucharest the romanian 
capital to undergo treatment at a health resort but they did not 
identify the resort 
after several days of debate the motion was passed with the 
soviet union and romania voting against it four delegates 
abstaining and three not voting 
soviet delegate stanislav chernichenko said the case was an 
administrative matter that had nothing to do with human rights 
and the subcommission had overstepped its mandate by attempting to 
give mazilu quasidiplomatic status

aids would rank as the 15th leading cause of 
death in the united states if it were counted as a separate 
category according to new figures from the national center for 
health statistics 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome killed between 12450 and 
13820 americans last year the center estimated in its first 
annual summary including separate figures for the disease 
while aids has not yet been added to the rankings of major 
causes of death published by the agency the 1987 toll would have 
placed it 15th on the list ahead of birth defects the agency 
noted 
the centers annual summary of vital statistics also disclosed 
that in 1987 america had the most births in nearly 25 years and 
the most deaths ever and that marriage and divorce rates were at 
the lowest level in more than a decade 
the report said that 65 percent of aids victims were white males 
and 25 percent black males with between 4 percent and 5 percent 
each being black and white females 
the age groups most affected were 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 the 
study added 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections 
the disease is spread most often through sexual contact needles 
or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from infected pregnant women to their offspring the 
chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users 
as of aug 8 aids had been diagnosed in 70208 americans of 
whom more than half or 39620 have died according to the centers 
for disease control 
a slight increase in fertility coupled with the huge number of 
women in their prime childbearing years resulted in the estimated 
3829000 babies born last year the most since 1964 the report 
showed 
millions of people born in the post world war ii baby boom are 
now in their 20s and 30s and after completing school and launching 
careers have begun families 
that has led to a sharp increase in total births in recent 
years although the nations fertility rate of 661 births per 
1000 women aged 15 to 44 remains about half that of the late 1950s 
when the baby boom was at its peak 
social scientists have begun referring to the recent surge as an 
echo of the baby boom 
deaths in 1987 totaled 2127000 up from 2099000 a year 
earlier and the most ever recorded for a single year in the united 
states record numbers of deaths have become common in recent years 
as the nations population includes an ever larger share of elderly 
people 
the national death rate of 87 per 1000 people in 1987 was 
unchanged from a year earlier the report noted life expectancy at 
birth also was unchanged at 749 years 
the report disclosed small increases in life expectancy last 
year for white men and black women and small declines for white 
women and black men 
harry rosenberg of the centers mortality branch said 
statisticians wont be able to determine a reason for those changes 
until they have more time to study the detailed figures 
among causes of death heart disease declined somewhat last 
year as it has for the last several years the report found there 
also was a decline in the rate for accidents other than those 
involving motor vehicles death rates for other major causes of 
death did not show statistically significant changes 
the nations marriage rate for 1987 was 99 weddings per 1000 
people the lowest since 1977 when it was also 99 
divorce also was low last year at a rate of 48 per 1000 
people the lowest since 1975 it peaked at 53 in 1979 and again 
in 1981 
here is a rundown of the estimated number of deaths in the 
united states last year for the 15 leading causes aids is included 
under the category of all other infectious and parasitic 
diseases which showed a growth in deaths from 9030 in 1986 to 
19160 last year but such all other generalized categories 
were not part of the ranking system

electromagnetic clatter from millions of 
manmade sources is drowning out whispers from the heavens and 
crippling research by radio astronomers who probe distant stars 
scientists say 
marcus price a radio astronomer at the university of new 
mexico says the machines of modern america from car engines to 
computers to automatic garage door openers are helping to 
pollute the airwaves with electromagnetic garbage 
the radio spectrum is a natural resource and as with any 
natural resource it can get polluted price said in an interview 
while attending an astronomy conference monday its not like air 
or water pollution because you cant see it but its there 
for that reason he said astronomers are anxious that 
unnecessary uses of radio signals be eliminated in many cases 
gross radio interference sources could be controlled with the use 
of filters or shields that would add only a dollar or two to 
manufacturing costs he said 
the radio spectrum is a vital part of our everyday life 
said price every time you order a pizza or call for an 
ambulance its probably radio dispatched and theres another 
signal thats why we worry about this limited resource being used 
for frivolous purposes 
electromagnetic gridlock is only one type of pollution affecting 
astronomers at a meeting this week sponsored by the international 
astronomical union astronomers from around the world said their 
work also is hampered by manmade light and by debris left in space 
that reflects sunlight and causes streaks on astronomy photographs 
for radio astronomers the electromagnetic spectrum can help 
unlock secrets of star formation millions of light years away each 
type of molecule when excited by heat puts out a unique radio 
signal by capturing and analyzing these signals radio astronomers 
can determine the chemical composition of processes taking place at 
points in the universe not even visible to optical telescopes 
this work has defined the shape of earths home galaxy 
discovered key components in the lives of stars and confirmed 
formation of complex chemicals within galaxies and stars 
radio astronomers explore virtually every portion of the 
spectrum to catch the faint distant star symphony but price said 
continuation of this work is threatened now by the sudden rise of 
manmade radio signals 
in the last five years weve seen an explosion of use of the 
radio spectrum for consumer devices he said 
many of these signals could be shielded from the environment 
spark plugs in automobiles for instance he said create a 
slight radio signal every time they fire this could be corrected 
for about 2 per vehicle said price 
cellular telephones computers handheld calculators and 
electronic toys all add to the clutter he said and all could be 
filtered and shielded for small cost 
price said radar signals used for defense air traffic control 
and even highway speedchecking guns all put out signals in 
portions of the spectrum important to astronomy so do television 
stations 
a new soviet navigation system is threatening to blot out study 
of the hydroxyl radical a key part of the chemistry of water and 
of some organic chemicals research on this molecule could give 
important clues to the existence of life beyond the earth 
radio astronomers are able to detect the hydroxyl radical at 
1600 to 1700 megahertz on the spectrum a system of navigation 
satellites now being deployed by the soviet union would operate 
constantly at this same portion of the radio band 
it is impossible to study this molecule when they the 
satellites are above your horizon he said the strong soviet 
navigation signal simply blots out everything else in that portion 
of the spectrum said price 
eventually the navigation system will cover the whole earth

millions of americans with adjustable 
mortgages and other variablerate loans are in for further shocks 
this year if the federal reserve keeps up its antiinflation 
campaign as many economists are predicting 
many americans already have seen their credit costs rise this 
year because of credit tightening on the part of the central bank 
as fed policymakers gathered to map monetary strategy behind 
closed doors today some economists were predicting that the 
central bank already has decided that even higher rates are 
necessary to slow an economy being buffeted by rising inflationary 
threats 
the meeting of the federal open market committee comes one week 
after the fed in a surprise move boosted its discount rate by 
onehalf percentage point to 65 percent its highest level since 
july 1986 
an increase in the discount rate the interest the fed charges 
to make loans to commercial banks is the most dramatic signal the 
central bank can send of its intention to push interest rates 
higher as a way of dampening demand and thus fighting inflationary 
pressures 
the timing of the discount rate increase was a surprise for many 
economists who had expected the allrepublican fed board led by 
chairman alan greenspan to shy away from such an overt 
credittightening move in an election year 
while analysts said they dont expect another boost in the 
discount rate until after the november election they said the fed 
very likely will continue tightening credit by more subtle means 
since late march the fed has been reducing the reserves banks 
have available for making loans driving up a variety of shortterm 
interest rates the federal funds rate which is the interest banks 
charge to make overnight loans to each other has now risen to 8 
percent and many economists predicted it would climb by another 
onehalf percentage point in coming weeks 
major banks followed the feds lead last week and boosted their 
prime lending rate from 95 percent to 10 percent a threeyear 
high analysts predicted that with further fed pressure the prime 
rate will climb to 105 percent in the next two months 
i am looking for further tightening steps based on a 
perception by fed policymakers that the economy is growing too 
strongly said david jones an economist at aubrey g lanston amp 
co a government securities dealer 
because the prime rate is used to calculate a wide range of 
consumer loans from adjustable mortgages to home equity loans the 
rate hikes will be felt quickly by consumers analysts said 
they also predicted further increases in traditional fixedrate 
mortgages a national survey by the federal home loan mortgage 
corp said fixedrate mortgages jumped to 1057 percent at the end 
of last week up almost a percentage point from their february low 
allen sinai chief economist at the boston co said fixedrate 
mortgages will hit 11 percent within a month with the only question 
being how much higher they may go before the end of the year 
the economy has a tremendous head of steam particularly in 
the industrial sector he said history has shown us that once 
our economy develops boomlike conditions it takes tougher 
restrictive policies to bring accelerating inflation under 
control 
analysts pointed to a variety of recent statistics which 
indicate inflation is a growing problem 
the government reported last week that wholesale prices shot up 
at an annual rate of 57 percent in july compared with an increase 
of 22 percent in 1987 some economists predicted that consumer 
prices could be climbing at a 6 percent annual rate within six 
months 
and on monday the government said industrial output climbed 08 
percent in july the biggest increase since last october and an 
advance which put further strains on many industries already 
operating at close to top capacity 
if the fed doesnt continue to tighten in this environment at 
least in a moderate way then it will have to tighten two or three 
times as much if it waits and inflation gets more out of hand 
jones said 
but jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national 
association of manufacturers said he believes the fed will wait 
awhile before it takes any further tightening moves 
i think they wanted to send a signal to the markets last week 
that inflation was their top priority he said now that they 
have done that they will lay back on their oars and see how the 
economy develops in the third quarter 
many economists are predicting that overall economic growth as 
measured by the gross national product will slow somewhat in the 
last half of the year compared with an annual rate of increase of 
33 percent in the first half of 1988

the drought has brought mixed results to farm 
machinery sales this year although preliminary readings by the 
agriculture department show that crop expansion plans for 1989 
could have some effect 
spending on farm machinery rose in 1987 after seven years of 
decline to 577 billion from 461 billion in 1986 according to a 
report by the departments economic research service 
currently largely because of brisk sales early in the year the 
agency forecasts 1988 machinery expenditures may range from 57 
billion to 62 billion 
the farm machinery industry will be hurt if farmers with 
reduced cash receipts put off buying new equipment the report 
said demand for harvesting drying and storage equipment is most 
likely to be affected 
however the report added that the drought has prompted greater 
sales of irrigation equipment in some parts of the country 
farm machinery sales rose to a record of almost 12 billion in 
1979 before staring a 60 percent slide to 461 billion in 1986 
reflecting the crunch on farm income high interest rates and tight 
credit in the early 1980s 
analysts said last years improved sales stemmed from enhanced 
financial conditions for farmers in 1987 notably a record net 
cash income nationwide of 56 billion net cash income the 
difference between gross cash receipts and cash expenses is 
forecast at 53 billion to 59 billion this year 
despite the drought analysts said there are some good signs 
farmland values as of february were up 3 percent on the average 
from a year earlier and total farm debt is at its lowest level 
since 1979 
higher interest rates and drought likely will repress some 
demand for machinery in the remainder of 1988 but sales are still 
likely to rise the report said 
drought in the corn belt and spring wheat states probably will 
hurt machinery sales because of reduced cash flow to pay bills or 
take on new debt 
however those farmers who produce a crop will benefit from 
higher commodity prices the report said farm machinery 
purchases not affected by the drought are expected to rise 
looking ahead at total input requirements which includes 
machinery as well as other items for production the report said 
prospects for spring planting in 1989 appear promising since the 
1988 drought will reduce commodity stocks and increase commodity 
prices this should increase planted acreage in 1989 and thereby 
increase input demand

higher grain prices are putting a crunch on 
cattle feeders and are helping to trim placement of cattle and 
calves in feedlots this summer according to agriculture department 
analysts 
as of aug 1 cattle being fed for the slaughter market in the 
seven major beef states totaled 684 million head up 2 percent 
from a year ago and 8 percent more than inventories of two years 
ago the department said monday 
the placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last 
month was reported at 125 million head down 2 percent from a year 
ago and down 19 percent from two years ago 
marketings of fed cattle in july totaled 177 million head 
up 4 percent from a year ago and also up 4 percent from two years 
ago officials said those were the most july feedlot marketings 
since the 7state estimates began in 1972 
according to usda economists market prices of choice steers on 
the omaha neb market are expected to average 65 to 69 per 100 
pounds this summer compared with 7281 in the apriljune quarter 
prices are projected at 66 to 72 in the fourth quarter 
meanwhile drought has reduced grain production and sent prices 
higher translating into higher cattle feeding costs as it looks 
to usda economists the forecasts of fed cattle prices are about 
100 per head below breakeven levels 
as of aug 1 feedlot inventories were larger than a year 
earlier in california colorado kansas and nebraska but were less 
in arizona iowa and texas the seven states produce about 
threefourths of the nations beef 
state feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven 
states the first number is the number of cattle in thousands as 
of aug 1 and the second number is the percentage of a year 
earlier

the opening of malaysia to us corn sales 
last year was an encouraging development in a market historically 
dominated by thailand says a trade report by the agriculture 
department 
although it is likely that the united states will have a hard 
time maintaining a market presence in malaysia once thai supplies 
return to normal the sales last year provided an opportunity for 
malaysian users to become more familiar with the qualities of the 
us product the report said 
malaysians liked us corn for its consistent quality lower 
moisture and exporter reliability among other reasons the report 
said but on the plus side for thai corn was its shipment size of 
only 500 to 1000 metric tons already bagged and its lesser 
shipping time 
the brief report is included in a forthcoming issue of foreign 
agriculture magazine

turned down for nine promotions because he is hispanic and that the 
agency kept a dossier on his wife because she started el pasos 
first rape crisis center 
puerto rico supervisory special agent armando lara also 
testified that his supervisor told him he was the first choice for 
one job but was turned down because he was a subject of an 
investigation into alleged illegal arms sales to the contra rebels 
in nicaragua he denied any such dealings and said the fbi found 
no evidence to support the charge 
lara is among 311 hispanic agents who have joined a classaction 
lawsuit before us district judge lucius bunton the lawsuit 
contends the fbi discriminates against hispanics in hiring 
promoting and disciplinary matters 
the nonjury trial is expected to last two weeks and about 100 
witnesses are expected to be called 
the lawsuit was filed in january 1987 by bernardo matt 
perez assistant agent in charge of the el paso office from 1979 
until 1982 perez worked at the san juan puerto rico office a 
bureau considered an undesirable assignment by agents because of 
the islands high crime rate and isolation

discriminate against hispanics and said hispanic agents are 
transferred to puerto rico because they are more likely than other 
agents to speak spanish 
lara said he was heavily pressured into applying for a transfer 
from el paso to san juan after two months in san juan he was 
transferred to isolated aguadilla on the islands northwest coast 
after five years there lara was transferred to gallup nm

it took lots of drinking water and wet 
towels but laurie cousins and sheryl fordin weathered a broiling 
shadeless afternoon to be first in line monday night for a 
candlelight procession past elvis presleys grave 
its an honor to be first and to look back and see all those 
candles lit is just unbelievable said ms cousins 37 of 
winnipeg canada 
the gates to graceland presleys former memphis residence 
opened at 1030 pm for the procession expected to draw more than 
5000 fans marking the 11th anniversary of the singers death 
ms cousins and ms fordin of new york took up their position at 
the graceland gates at noon and waited through a humid afternoon 
with a high of 99 degrees 
the thing is not to dehydrate said ms fordin 37 
i love elvis he will live forever in our hearts she said 
i bought an elvis pillowcase and i cant wait to sleep on it 
presley died of heart disease at graceland on aug 16 1977 and 
the faithful return each year to mark the anniversary 
with presley recordings playing in the background the fans 
queued up at the graceland gates touched candles to a torch 
lighted by an eternal flame and walked single file up a winding 
200yard driveway past the singers grave 
it helps keep his memory alive said gene carothers 37 of 
gnadenhutten ohio who sported an elvis pompadour and a 
6inchwide leather belt with dangling loops of chain 
before joining the procession carothers signed autographs and 
posed for pictures with other fans at a souvenir shopping center 
across the street from graceland 
its just something to look back on said cory tarrants 26 
of dallas who had her picture taken with carothers and besides 
mama said to take a lot of pictures 
presley his mother father and paternal grandmother are buried 
beside the swimming pool at graceland in a small plot called 
meditation garden the garden was covered with stands of 
flowers sent by fans and many participants in the candlelight 
vigil carried flowers to leave at the grave 
presley originally was buried at a cemetery three miles from 
graceland but his body and his mothers were moved to the garden 
in october 1977 the singers father and grandmother died after the 
grave site was established 
no one takes a count of participants in the annual graveside 
procession which lasts into the early hours of aug 16 said jack 
soden graceland manager 
the estimates have always ranged from 5000 to 10000 i just 
dont know how many take part but i would say at least several 
thousand he said 
many fans are upset this year by a recently published book 
called is elvis alive 
the book includes claims that presley staged his death 
its a sad and cruel exploitation soden said weve 
endured a lot of tasteless exploitation over the last 11 years 
graceland draws more than 600000 tourists a year and for the 
past six years elvis fans have been offered a nineday series of

even before george bush announced his choice 
of a running mate aides were preparing to craft the words the 
mystery person will say while accepting the nomination 
speechwriters planned to write a generic speech that would 
be tailored at the last minute to fit the running mate along with 
similar speeches to place that name in nomination 
the name can be filled in later 
fred malek bushs convention manager said the draft speeches 
would set out broad themes the campaign wants to stress on the 
conventions closing night with the running mate to polish the 
language later 
by wednesday morning we will have one or two writers 
working on a generic kind of acceptance speech which the nominee 
would then have to take and modify and put into his or her own 
style of words said malek 
organizers of the convention are orchestrating even the smallest 
detail in an effort to put on a polished television performance 
each speech delivered from the podium is reviewed by bushs 
speechwriters who edit and revise it to fit that evenings chosen 
theme and to squeeze it into allotted time limits 
malek insisted they need a head start on the running mates 
thursday speech to have the time necessary to prepare such a 
highprofile address 
its a generic kind of a speech its a draft malek said 
the nominee will not learn of his or her selection until thursday 
morning 
bush has said he wont reveal his selection until thursday 
morning only hours before that candidate must deliver the 
primetime acceptance speech in addition organizers will be 
scrambling to line up another luminary to nominate the no 2 
candidate and still others to second the nomination and make the 
introduction 
weve got two other three other addresses really to go 
along with it malek said they will be also in the same 
sequence well have one or two writers working on an acceptance 
speech and another working on a nominating speech 
we wont start this until wednesday he said they will 
have no clues nor will i on who its going to be 
malek said he would have been happier with more time for writers 
to work on the speech but that its not his decision 
a good writer with some general directions and general clues 
can get a running start malek said 
he said organizers havent decided yet who will give the 
nominating speeches but we are developing some ideas of who are 
good speakers and could do it 
part of the problem malek said is that not only must those 
picked to introduce the vice presidential nominee be good speakers 
they must also have some logical connection to the new candidate 
or to the campaign theme that bush signals with the pick 
i think its going to be all right i think we have the 
caliber of people to do the nomination he said i dont have 
any great trepidations about that obviously they could do a better 
job with more time

it wasnt exactly love at first sight they 
are after all both conservatives 
but what started as rhetoric blossomed into romance for alvin 
kukuk a robertson delegate and janet rungtranont who was for 
kemp 
they met following a michigan republican convention exchanged 
phone numbers at a delegates meeting and courted at a conservative 
union conference what better place to pop the question kukak 
thought than at the biggest shindig of them all the republican 
national convention 
the mingling of love and politics in new orleans seemed 
especially fitting to kukuk inspired as he was by the nations 
first married vice presidential prospects bob and elizabeth dole 
and so it came to pass on a mississippi riverboat with jazz 
music playing softly in the background and the entire michigan 
delegation on board that kukuk a 51yearold township supervisor 
picked rungtranont a 45yearold college registrar to be his 
running mate 
theyll be tying the knot in november right after the election 
they thought it best to wait kukuk is running for county 
commissioner 
the morning after the big night they strolled through the 
superdome in matching styrofoam campaign hats there was no 
shortage of people taking the same walk in the same hats but 
somehow you just couldnt miss them as they floated along bumping 
into the walls each of them displaying a yardandahalf of teeth 
when you get to be 51 youre so set in your ways said 
kukak whos been single for 20 years it gets harder and harder 
to find someone wholl put up with you 
when you get to be 45 the odds of finding someone whos right 
for you diminish greatly said his fiancee i never thought id 
find the right man 
she found him at a seafood restaurant just off the thruway i 
stopped to eat on the way home from the state convention and in 
walked al she said the place was empty except for us and he 
figured out from the bumper stickers on my car where id been my 
heart wasnt going pitterpatter but my heart was kind of 
curious 
they met again at a delegates meeting where they arranged to 
attend the conservative conference by this point rungtranonts 
interest was no longer purely platonic i probably wouldnt have 
driven down to detroit if i hadnt been getting interested she 
said 
after the conference they had dinner they talked mostly of 
politics still there was something other than hot air in the air 
on easter al made the 160mile round trip from his home in 
mount clemens to hers in caro where he met her three children 
that clinched it they havent missed a weekend since 
she had a feeling the proposal was coming he dropped some 
pretty broad hints she said the hints included telling a 
reporter on board the boat that something big might happen 
tonight 
something did al took janet to a quiet corner and presented her 
with a goldanddiamond engagement ring the rest of the delegation 
was off listening to the jazz musicians all we heard was the 
flutter of the wind and the whoosh of the water he said 
that and the pitterpat of their hearts

his partys gubernatorial nomination in 1977 
but keans election to the statehouse four years later and his 
1985 reelection make one of the states most dramatic political 
tales 
in 1981 kean emerged from a field of eight wouldbe gop 
governors to win the nomination by less than 40000 votes it was a 
landslide compared with what was to come 
kean won a narrow victory in the general election over 
democratic rep james florio eking out a win by 1677 votes 
florio called for a recount and both candidates set up transition 
teams in preparation for taking office 
weeks later the recounted results confirmed keans election by 
1797 votes the smallest margin in state history 
four years later voters retained kean by the biggestever 
margin with 70 percent of the vote and majorities in all but three 
of new jerseys 567 municipalities 
to accomplish the win one aide said kean attempted to tread 
every inch and shake every hand in his small but diverse state as 
nervous aides fidgeted the governor kept motorcades and planes 
waiting while stopping to answer every question his constant press 
following could come up with 
with a style too awkward to be bogus kean convinced voters he 
was for real 
one staff members recalls a night when the governor tried to 
share a beer with his staff but when the sixpack was passed kean 
couldnt figure out the screwtop bottles 
kean 53 has repeatedly said his programs are aimed at creating 
opportunity both for business owners and workers as well as the 
poor its a political theme not unlike that of democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis 
kean has concentrated on the philosophy and history of the 
republican party a philosophy that allows republicans to go 
beyond the country clubs and the suburbs as he wrote in his book 
though mentioned as a possible bush running mate the moderate 
kean has few admirers on the gops far right while loyal to 
president reagan the governor breaks often and openly with the 
white house 
sen gordon humphrey rnh one of the senates most 
conservative members has threatened to walk out on keans speech 
because of the governors ideologically impure stance on abortion 
though personally opposed kean does not back a constitutional ban 
praise for kean has come from unexpected places dukakis joking 
in 1986 said that hes the best democrat in the republican 
governors association

former presidential candidate alexander haig 
on monday called democratic nominee michael dukakis a diminutive 
clerk in a sharp and personal convention speech that drew an 
immediate disclaimer for george bushs campaign 
when haigs presidential star faded early he declared his 
support for senate republican leader robert dole of kansas 
in his convention speech monday haig endorsed bush and then 
despite bushs efforts to dissuade him delivered a strong attack 
against dukakis 
haig referred to dukakis as a diminutive clerk from 
massachusetts 
haig also compared the democratic party to a bat flying 
erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down 
for extended periods in dark damp caves up to its navel in guano 
in contrast haig said bush represented safe and progressive 
change safe in that george bush will build on the solid 
accomplishments of the reagan presidency 
bush workers were clearly unhappy with the tenor of haigs 
remarks 
we dont think that was an appropriate sequence of words 
said bush convention manager fred malek that was al haigs 
choice it wasnt ours 
malek said organizers of the convention who carefully review 
every word spoken from the podium first saw haigs speech nearly a 
week ago and tried to convince him to tone down the rhetoric 
we definitely told him we did not think that was a good thing 
to do malek said at one point i thought he agreed with us 
but then he slept on it and decided it was what he wanted to do 
in orchestrating this weeks convention gop leaders have 
carefully chosen a theme for each night and have insisted they 
want to stay away from personal assaults on dukakis monday nights 
theme was to highlight the successes of the reagan administration 
maleks criticism was echoed in somewhat milder terms by house 
minority leader robert michel of illinois 
michel argued that theres a time and a place for harsh assaults 
and mondays convention speech was neither 
i dont look upon that as the kind of campaign we would 
wage michel said 
those were his words and his choice malek said

elizabeth dole confronting george bushs 
gender gap with women voters is urging women to have an open 
mind and work with the party for changes in child care and other 
matters affecting the family 
one of george bushs potential running mates mrs dole was 
cheered as she spoke to the republican national convention on 
monday night about the freedom women had achieved through job 
programs during the reagan years 
good jobs not bad jobs real work not make work thats our 
freedom are we going to let them take it away she asked as the 
convention hall responded with a resounding no 
mrs dole dealt headon with one of the most troubling problems 
for the republicans this year polls show that female voters are 
disproportionately supporting democrat michael dukakis over bush 
todays strong economy means stronger families and we affirm 
the woman who chooses to work in the home said mrs dole who 
spent seven years working in the reagan administration including 
four years as secretary of transportation 
but our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for 
millions of women she said and let me say to the women of 
america i respect the fact that some of you have questions i also 
ask you to have an open mind 
she said that reagans incredible jobs machine has created 
more jobs for americans and twothirds of the 17 million new jobs 
created since 1982 went to women 
i ask you women of america not just to support us work 
with us to change what needs to be changed she said the 
future belongs to our children and child care is one of those 
changes 
dukakis has endorsed the concept of the 25 billion better 
child bill now pending in congress which would provide aid and 
impose new regulations for child care programs 
bush wants to give 22 billion in tax credits to families 
earning less than 20000 a year to help them pay for child care in 
any setting they wish 
dukakis wants to march our kids lock step to a government 
institution where washington will set all the rules but people 
work parttime fulltime night shift day shift swing shift one 
size does not fit all mrs dole said 
bush who has five children and 10 grandchildren believes the 
parents should choose mrs dole said she said he will give 
american parents what they want child care supervised by people 
who share their values in a communitybased setting a relatives 
or neighbors home a churchsponsored center or by the mother or 
father who works fulltime at home 
mrs dole ridiculed dukakis for seeking to paint over his 
liberal policies with pretty rhetoric 
dukakis convention speech was just like the democrat 
platform hedging on defense hedging on taxes hedging on 
spending were not running against lloyd bentsen and dukakis 
were running against bentsen and hedges she said in a play on 
words with the name of a cigarette brand

the politics of optimism is alive at the 
republican national convention 
but in the case of some gop candidates for senate seats held by 
veteran democrats the odds against them are so long that some 
might call it wishful thinking 
i am not a sacrificial goat said massachusetts businessman 
joe malone on monday as he detailed his plans to defeat sen edward 
m kennedy dmass and score the upset of the century 
kennedy has represented massachusetts in the senate for the last 
quarter century and is considered virtually unbeatable 
but malone who is of italian descent despite his irish surname 
was undeterred 
im in it to win malone said at a news conference in which 
16 republican senate candidates were introduced im hearing 
people saying that 25 years of ted kennedy are enough 
jay wolfe a west virginia businessman was equally optimistic 
his opponent is sen robert c byrd dwva the senate 
majority leader 
byrd hasnt been defeated since his first victory in 1958 30 
years ago 
if you think im in this to lose just watch on nov 8 
wolfe said 
republican alan keyes a black former ambassador was positively 
defiant as he roared his optimism that he will unseat sen paul s 
sarbanes dmd an entrenched democrat in a normally democratic 
state 
start looking for a surprise keyes said if any of you 
people in the media want to get a head start on looking good in 
november start writing that keyes is going to win we are going to 
prove republicans can split any bloc take any vote 
that surprise is going to shake our states oneparty system 
to its very roots 
rep beau boulter rtexas announced his intention to defeat 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who under state law may run for 
reelection while he seeks the vice presidency as the running mate 
of gov michael dukakis 
lloyd bentsen will fall off both horses hes trying to ride 
boulter said 
montanas conrad burns a broadcast executive and a yellowstone 
county commissioner said one reason he is trying to defeat sen 
john melcher dmont is that a republican senate candidate has 
not carried montana for a century 
one republican every 100 years is only fair he said 
hawaii generally votes democratic but maria m hustace a 
teacher social worker and rancher said she intends to beat the 
trend and replace sen spark matsunaga dhawaii a senator since 
1976 
she called matsunaga the laziest member of the senate said 
he is noted primarily for taking constituents to lunch and said 
there is a rumor in the state that he is ill and will retire two 
years after winning reelection 
she immediately added this is not to be a negative campaign 
it will be a positive campaign 
earl strinden the executive vice president of the university of 
north dakota alumni association is generally credited with having 
a relatively good chance to end the 28year senate career of sen 
quentin burdick dnd 
he assured reporters that were not making age an issue 
strinden immediately added but every time a story is written 
it is immediately mentioned that my opponent is 80 years old 
at the news conference sen rudy boschwitz rminn chairman 
of the republican senatorial campaign committee said that although 
races are too close to call in 12 to 15 of the 32 seats states at 
stake in november the gop has an excellent chance of recapturing 
the senate now held by the democrats 5446 
we think it is in the realm of reason boschwitz said

pat robertson readied himself for a 
primetime convention speech by talking party unity while also 
tending to his own future in the party 
i told them i want george bush to win robertson said after 
a closeddoor meeting with supporters 
im a young guy i can wait eight years he added as he 
scheduled meetings with important early states in the primary 
process 
robertsons presidential campaign faltered early on and he has 
since endorsed bush during the meeting monday night robertson 
said that he urged backers to be good republicans and that he 
will formally release his delegates later in the week 
most delegates who have remained loyal to robertson have 
indicated they will vote for bush if robertson asks an associated 
press count gives robertson 88 delegates bush has far more than 
the 1139 delegates needed for nomination 
but robertson was moving aggressively to carve out a role in 
this weeks convention in addition to the usual circuit of 
television interviews and receptions he scheduled meetings with 
delegations from michigan iowa texas washington virginia and 
minnesota 
robertson launched his week with a downtown rally where he said 
he wont ever surrender the conservative views which formed the 
basis for his campaign 
you and i got into the republican party because we believe in 
principles robertson told backers 
spokeswoman marlene elwell said robertson will focus on the 
immediate goal of pushing for bushs election during the convention 
the message is for them to join him she said were here 
working for unity he robertson has pledged his full support 
lets go fight democrats robertson told backers 
were getting ready to show why republicans should be elected 
next fall and why george bush should be elected the next president 
of the united states he said 
despite his weak showing in the primary season robertson told 
backers there was marvelous cooperation on drafting the 
conservative platform 
he sent a clear message that he expects bush to run on that 
document 
though i withdrew as a candidate robertson said the 
ideas the concepts the principles the standards that you and i 
have held aloft do not ever quit and they dont ever surrender and 
we are going to continue to fight until we see victory in the 
nation for the things we believe in 
while robertson was speaking a small group of protesters 
shouted bigot go home and go back to south africa there 
were a few tense exchanges with robertson backers but they were 
quickly diffused

george bushs convention generals said they 
tried but failed to dissuade former rival alexander m haig jr 
from delivering a sharp personal attack on michael dukakis in the 
conventions opening hours 
haig referred to the democratic presidential nominee on monday 
as a diminutive clerk from massachusetts 
we dont think that was an appropriate sequence of words 
said bush convention manager fred malek that was al haigs 
choice it wasnt ours 
for each of the four nights of this weeks convention malek and 
other organizers have carefully scripted a single theme they want 
to present to the television audience they have tried to 
discourage variations 
in addition malek has said he does not want to see personal 
assaults on dukakis 
in his speech referring to both dukakis and his running mate 
sen lloyd bentsen haig said you have to admit atlanta was good 
theater it was an offbroadway revival of the odd couple 
starring the diminutive clerk from massachusetts and the tall 
stranger from texas 
he also compared the democratic party to a bat flying 
erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down 
for extended periods in dark damp caves up to its navel in guano 
in contrast haig said bush represented safe and progressive 
change safe in that george bush will build on the solid

republican delegates are pressing their 
preferences for george bushs vice presidential pick but many have 
rejected the idea of a conservative rebellion if his choice fails 
to pass rightwing muster 
with humor and at times with heat dozens of delegates 
interviewed sunday and monday stressed that the ultimate choice is 
bushs alone those who say otherwise said sen alfonse damato of 
new york are kooks 
if some conservatives want to withhold their support from a 
moderate gop ticket let em do it damato said its only a 
small handful of wackos i dont believe this is an ideological 
kind of thing 
the issue of an ideological test for bushs running mate was 
broached by sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire who suggested 
that the ticket could lose core support if bush selected an 
insufficiently conservative partner 
some delegates agreed it had better be a conservative said 
margaret stephens of elmore city okla 
i want a conservative vice president insisted marc nuttle 
from oklahoma city 
but nuttle said he would be happy with sen bob dole of kansas 
whose conservative credentials humphrey had questioned dole 
moreover was backed monday by pat robertson one of the most 
conservative gop primary candidates 
the label you apply to a running mate is irrelevant said 
gov james r thompson of illinois who withdrew his name from 
consideration last week another of those considered by bush south 
carolina gov carroll campbell stressed unity our duty is to 
stand up with the team 
delegates said one reason they left the choice to bush was their 
faith he would choose well do you think george bush is out there 
looking for an abortionist liberal who wants to raise taxes 
asked former state sen john decamp of nebraska 
you dont want a foolish pick said rep dan lungren of 
california but bush isnt going to make a foolish pick 
their confidence in bush aside delegates were unabashed about 
promoting their favorites rep jack kemp of new york or former 
un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick as conservative thinkers dole as 
a help in farm states doles wife extransportation secretary 
elizabeth dole as a proven administrator 
some supporters of kirkpatrick and mrs dole said their 
selection could boost bushs support among women we have a 
gender gap and we republicans had better deal with it said 
illinois state sen adeline geokaris 
the ticket needs something to give it pep something that 
would help the weak spots said state sen judy baar topinka 
also of illinois 
others though cautioned that choosing a woman could be seen as 
tokenism and that compatibility should outweigh strategy you 
would be better served to pick somebody you really want to serve 
with for eight years than to pick somebody that you thinks going 
to pick up one or two votes said sen phil gramm of texas 
one reason for the long view gramm and others said is that the 
choice of the vice presidential nominee while enticing fodder for 
the convention rumor mill is likely to have little effect on the 
presidential race 
my hope is that we dont get so wrapped up with vice president 
that we lose sight of the issues said sen don nickles of 
oklahoma the real question is whos going to be the next 
president of the united states

new englanders cut back on power to avert threatened blackouts 
new yorkers slept in central park to cool off and grain futures 
soared on the chicago board of trade monday amid speculation that 
the midwest would continue to bake in tripledigit heat 
temperatures and power usage reached record highs in the eastern 
half of the nation as a heat wave continued its weekslong 
stranglehold from iowa to the east coast record high temperatures 
were broken in 20 states and in washington dc where it reached 
a sweltering 103 degrees the national weather service reported 
all 48 contiguous states had temperatures of 87 degrees or 
higher hundreddegree temperatures were in 22 states and in south 
dakota pierre reached 114 degrees and chamberlain hit 112 degrees 
raising thermostats lowering lighting and other voluntary 
conservation measures by homes and businesses meant new england 
utilities did not have to impose rotating blackouts which they had 
predicted might be necessary to save power 
william sheperdson spokesman for the new england power pool 
which coordinates new englands electricity usage said power 
demand appeared to be somewhat below the record set last thursday 
lexingtonbased raytheon corp one of new englands larger 
energy consumers cut back 85 percent by turning down the air 
conditioning and shutting off nonessential equipment but the high 
technology and weapons manufacturer did so grudgingly 
were not capable of trimming back our power demand without 
cutting back on production said george sarney a senior vice 
president who said his office was 80 degrees if not 90 
the university of massachusetts at amherst closed down for the 
day because of power drain 
in new york city which hit a record high of 97 monday a 
consolidated edison spokeswoman said utility customers used more 
than 10000 megawatts of electricity for the first time in history 
con ed said more than 13000 customers lost power monday night 
on staten island and more than half still were in the dark about 
1130 pm 
spokeswoman martha liipfert said weak links in the utilitys 
heavily burdened delivery system caused power to fail earlier in 
the day in parts of manhattans upper east side and the southwest 
bronx 
before power there was restored about 730 pm police brought 
generators and fans to cool the lobbies of powerless highrises 
and airconditioned buses were parked outside to provide a refuge 
for residents 
a power outage in grand central terminal was quickly restored as 
the evening rush hour began but not before a handful of trains 
were delayed or canceled spokeswoman patricia raley said workers 
had not determined if the power failure was heatrelated 
some people have been escaping hot apartments by staying all 
night in central park said harold tier supervisor for the north 
end of the park 
however jim poirier a national weather service meteorologist 
offered a glimmer of hope he said a weak cold front was expected 
to move through the area by tuesday bringing highs in the low 90s 
instead of pushing 100 as in the past few days 
in parts of iowa the mercury surpassed the century mark des 
moines reached 102 degrees breaking the record of 101 set in 1886 
other record highs monday included 97 at allentown pa 99 at 
atlantic city nj 101 in downtown baltimore and 98 at the 
airport 99 at charleston wva 97 at hartford conn 96 at 
indianapolis 97 at louisville ky 102 at peoria ill 98 at 
philadelphia 97 at rockford ill 99 at washingtons national 
airport and 97 at wilmington del 
high school football coaches around iowa took care to monitor 
their athletes for heatrelated stress as they ran through 
conditioning drills 
you watch them to make sure theyre sweating said davenport

president reagan in an emotional valedictory 
speech to the republican national convention told cheering 
delegates monday that contrary to democratic claims george bush 
was there to his vice president he said win one for the 
gipper 
acknowledging the tumultuous reception reagan declared 
nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the delegates in this 
hall except maybe a victory celebration on nov 8 the president 
said 
in this spirit reagan told the delegates i think we 
could be forgiven if we give ourselves a little pat on the back for 
having made republican a proud word again and america a proud 
nation again 
bush praised by reagan as a man who has seen this office from 
the inside watched the presidents speech on television at the 
vice presidential residence in washington he will arrive in the 
convention city tuesday one day before his coronation as the 
republican presidential nominee 
after reagan spoke bush said in a statement it was a great 
and generous speech by a great and generous president barbara and 
i were very touched and very moved now i will go to new orleans 
spell out my message for america and do my level best to fill the 
big shoes of ronald reagan 
the president spoke forcefully generally in serious tones 
there was an occasional scratchiness in his voice but there were 
lighter moments too such as when he invoked his old movie career 
to urge bush to victory 
reagans final words god bless america touched off a 
tumultuous demonstration on the floor which erupted in even 
greater cheering as he was joined on the podium by the first lady 
in the climax of the evening red white and blue balloons were 
released from the superdome ceiling and the reagans playfully 
swatted them around the podium and into the swell of delegates 
blue white and red bush 88 signs were hoisted into the 
air and one delegate sported a reagan for vp 88 placard bush 
still has not made known his choice for a running mate 
seeking to counter the where was george cry that became a 
theme of the democratic national convention reagan told the 
convention george played a major role in everything that weve 
accomplished 
when he belted out the line and george was there the crowd 
roared back four more years four more years 
he then ticked off a list of administration successes from the 
economic recovery to the ussoviet treaty to eliminate mediumand 
shortrange nuclear weapons without george bush to build on 
those policies everything we have achieved will be at risk 
reagan said 
we need someone whos big enough and experienced enough to 
handle tough and demanding negotiations with soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev because this is no time to gamble with 
onthejob training 
it was clear who reagan was referring to although he did not 
mention by name the democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis 
there was a brief chant of reagan reagan reagan from the 
crowd after the president declared that in the 2765 days of our 
administration not one inch of ground has fallen to the 
communists 
there was a chorus of booing when reagan predicted that if the 
democrats win the election their answer will be the one they have 
relied on in the past and that is higher taxes 
in domestic policy reagan said we set out to reduce federal 
regulations that had been imposed on the people on businesses and 
on local and state governments 
and george was there he said of the republican presidential 
nomineeinwaiting he headed up the task force that eliminated 
those regulations 
so george im in your corner he said 
then invoking a movie line that has become one of his political 
trademarks the president said but george just one personal 
request go out there and win one for the gipper 
he grinned broadly 
the president insisted on the timing of his convention speech 
on opening night to avoid stealing the spotlight from bush 
reagan and his vice president are scheduled to meet only once in 
this convention city at a ceremonial passing of the baton at the 
new orleans airport tuesday when bush arrives for his coronation 
and the president and nancy reagan depart for a california vacation 
mrs reagan preceded her husband on the podium her brief 
remarks were followed by a film highlighting the key moments of the 
reagan presidency 
reagan told the delegates im grateful to god for blessing me 
with a good life and a long one but when i pack my bags in 
washington dont expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about 
the twilight of my life 
together weve fought for causes we love he said but we 
can never let the fire go out or quit the fight because the battle 
is never over 
and he used a reference to his beloved rancho del cielo to 
describe what lies ahead for the nation 
theres still a lost of brush to clear out at the ranch 
fences that need repair and horses to ride 
the president said his administration was able to forge ahead on 
both the international and domestic fronts in spite of the 
resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that its 
time for a change 
they resisted our defense buildup they resisted our tax cuts 
they resisted cutting the fat out of government and they resisted 
our appointments of judges committed to the law and the 
constitution 
facts are stubborn things the president said repeatedly 
declaring that it was his administration that led the country into 
its longest peacetime economic expansion and reversed democratic 
policies that produced gas lines as well as unemployment lines 
reagan opened his speech by telling the delegates that he and 
the first lady wanted to share a little of your special time 
having temporary custody of this office has been for me a 
sacred trust and an honor beyond words or measure he said 
earlier monday reagan made a surprise appearance at a luncheon 
given in honor of the first lady 
i really cant imagine these last eight years without nancy 
reagan said every president should be so lucky 
she once said that the president has all kinds of advisers and 
experts to look after his interests when it comes to foreign 
policy the economy or whatever but no one to look after his needs 
as a human being he said well nancy has done that 
mrs reagan clearly surprised at the presidents appearance and 
moisteyed at the tribute put her arms around him as he spoke and 
as they joined the audience in singing america the beautiful 
she told the luncheon that the years she and her husband spent 
in the white house were eight of the most wonderful years we have 
ever had 
but she added today the curtain begins to close on the 
reagan era of the republican party we have had a wonderful run 
but today it is time for the bushes to step into the political 
leading roles and for the reagans to step into the wings

associated press reporter lisa wolfson attended 
one of the weekends screenings of the last temptation of 
christ as a theater patron 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the man held a 3foot cross in one hand and a 
bible in the other but he managed to point a finger at a 
middleaged man and tell him in that his 650 movie fare made him 
a candidate for damnation 
you must be a child molester the man with the cross called 
out the subject of the protesters fury blushed and his friends 
huddled around him in the line to see the last temptation of 
christ on its opening night last weekend 
how many children have you molested the man with the cross 
persisted adding for emphasis pervert pervert 
our group of six knew in advance that plans to attend a 
screening of the last temptation of christ would not be a 
typical night at the movies 
tickets were purchased six hours earlier and our arrival one 
hour before screening time put us far from the front of the long 
line 
but the hour passed quickly as hundreds of people protesting the 
new film by director martin scorsese provided a street show as 
colorful as that on the venice beach boardwalk 
some protesters passed out literature condemning the films 
depiction of jesus as dreaming of evading his messianic role in 
order to live as a husband and father one pamphlet cover showed a 
bleeding thorncrowned christ under the word blasphemy 
other demonstrators however took the opportunity to verbally 
attack movie patrons calling them devil worshipers fornicators 
and child molesters 
one told a woman in line that if she went into the theater she 
must be a lesbian 
the woman replied then i guess im a lesbian 
many of those people in line applauded a young woman who wove 
through protesters holding high a sign that read i support 
artistic expression 
a protester approached one man who applauded called him an 
adulterer and said youre the type of person who believes we 
came from monkeys 
earlier a woman pushed a baby stroller through the plaza 
complex and paused to tell her little girl see all these people 
in line well theyre all going to go to hell 
those who patronized the movie on opening day were in effect 
taking a stand and for the most part swallowed the comments in 
stride 
twenty minutes after the film was supposed to begin the 
sellout crowd was let in to the theater but not before guards 
checked bags for weapons and other items that might be used in 
vandalism 
guards stood by exits and sat at the front of the theater on 
either side of the screen 
seconds after the lights went down the universal pictures logo 
appeared on the screen patrons in the 600seat auditorium 
applauded and clapped again when scorseses name appeared 
few people left before the twohour 40 mimute film ended and 
most managed to escape the onslaught of demonstrators outside who 
were busy making do with the next batch of moviegoers waiting for 
the midnight show

sen bob dole said monday he doesnt care for 
the process the george bush organization has used to select and 
announce a republican vice presidential nominee 
he said the choice should have been made and revealed soon after 
democrats finished their convention in midjuly to avoid spotting 
michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen a head start in the fall 
presidential election campaign 
dole also told a news conference for kansas reporters at a 
french market restaurant he suspects bush already has made up his 
mind on who his vice presidential running mate will be but said 
he has no idea who it is 
he said he expects bush to make his choice public on wednesday 
asked if the selection process used by bush was demeaning 
dole said i dont care for it frankly 
he said he had provided records and answered questions posed by 
the bush campaign but has not otherwise campaigned for the vice 
presidential nomination 
i did indicate to jim baker bushs campaign manager that im 
not certain i like the process he said 
bush who was in washington dc monday heard dole 
complaining about the process of selecting the vice presidential 
nominee but he didnt say anything said sheila tate his 
press spokeswoman 
doles spokesman walt riker said later that dole was not 
critical of the vice president or anyone else in that process 
were not saying that anyone made a mistake 
he said dole was merely pointing out that bush had the option 
because of the timing of the conventions to name his nominee 
several weeks earlier 
bush campaign strategists have held up announcing the veep 
choice to try to heighten interest in the gop convention here this 
week 
dole said any suspense created by withholding the announcement 
is of dubious value 
there may be some suspense around here but thats not going 
to decide the election dole said bushs speech thursday 
night is the big event thats when 70 percent of the viewers out 
there will be watching 
dole said he hasnt talked with bush for about two weeks asked 
who he thought bush might select as his running mate dole said 
i dont know i havent speculated i think we have a lot of 
support my name recognition probably accounts for that 
if hes not picked by bush for the ticket dole said id 
probably concentrate on the senate races in hopes of boosting 
republicans into the majority which democrats hold by a 5446 edge 
dole conceded he still feels remorse over his failure to defeat 
bush in their battle for the gop presidential nomination during the 
primary and caucus season last winter and spring 
im normal he said i think about it even as i drive 
around new orleans but it doesnt do any good to dwell on it it 
always comes out the same theres no reason to relive it

near the hondurannicaraguan border ap hundreds of contra 
rebels and civilian supporters are trudging into southern honduras 
base camps in a mass exodus and their leaders say fewer than 2000 
fighters remain in nicaragua 
rebel officials blame the us congress for the retreat which 
began four months ago and leaves the smallest contra force in 
nicaragua since the usbacked fighters began their war against 
the leftist sandinistas in 1981 
more than 1000 soldiers and civilians returned last week from a 
central nicaraguan combat zone the largest single group to date 
about 2500 was said to be approaching the coco river frontier 
contra officials say the combatants no longer supplied by air 
drop inside nicaragua had to retreat to receive food and other 
goods now available through the us agency for international 
development known as aid in honduras 
they say the new arrivals joined about 8000 combatants and 
5000 civilians camped out in tents of plastic and us army 
ponchos in the rugged terrain 
by picking up stakes and guiding their civilian supporters 
along the contras have not only lost any fighting edge but their 
social base as well 
no they cant go back except with a rifle in their hands 
said a contra official whose nom de guerre is cmdr johnson 
another official cmdr oswaldo said the civilians beg our 
troops to take them along without the troops they are 
harassed forcibly recruited 
rebel leaders said congress is to blame for the retreat and the 
possible end of the contras as a fighting force 
its important to press the congress for them to understand 
that four months ago there were no combatants here said cmdr 
johnson now look he said and pointed to scores of tents 
the united states which has supplied and trained the rebels 
since the beginning stopped a ciarun military aid program at the 
end of february a month later the contras and sandinistas signed 
a preliminary ceasefire but peace talks broke off in june 
more than 17 million in nonlethal assistance handled by aid 
started arriving in april on condition it be distributed in 
honduras and not nicaragua 
contra leaders allowed several journalists to visit the camps 
over the weekend their purpose clearly was to show the force 
together and with high morale but unable to fight until military 
aid is restored and supplies airdropped once again inside 
nicaragua 
about 170 people who arrived sunday trudged along a rutted road 
sweat soaking their torn clothes soldiers carried rusty 
sovietmade ak47 automatic rifles and plastic bags of personal 
possessions brought on a monthlong march 
they moved singlefile across a field and into a camp past two 
armed guards some of the civilians sat in the shade of a banana 
tree and ate raw oatmeal one was 10 years old another 15 
ten civilians died of hunger during the march three drowned and 
200 were in need of medical care said contras in the group 
we dont have enough medicine to treat the people who are 
coming in and they arent getting the right food said a contra 
doctor known as ahuas tara tall pines in an indian dialect 
ahuas tara rebel officials and fighting men said the new 
assistance program is not working they said aid provides only rice 
and black beans not vegetables and meat and medicine supplies are 
mired in bureaucracy 
someone from aid will ask me what medicine i urgently need 
then he carries the list to the contra office in tegucigalpa the 
doctor said then they submit the list formally to aid and it 
takes four to six weeks 
at a stifling makeshift clinic 31 soldiers and civilians lay 
on cots in a room made for 20 
moral appeared high among the combatants on sunday several 
played chess on a homemade board using toothpaste caps as markers 
some played volleyball there was an odd mix of woman making corn 
tortillas some toddlers veteran combatants and the new recruits 
nearby a baseball game officially started with rebel commander 
enrique bermudez tossing the first pitch 
bermudez who traveled by usleased helicopter to the camps 
sunday recently was elected to the sevenmember contra political 
directorate and was said to have resigned his post as the military 
commanderinchief 
however he clearly remains in control 
asked what would happen if new military aid is not approved by 
the us congress he said we will explore some other 
possibilities another government or private aid

a cbs network affiliate 
i fully understand that action and have no quarrel with it 
he said in acknowledging a report that had aired just moments 
earlier on a rival television station 
robinette who usually coanchors wwls primetime 6 pm and 10 
pm newscasts acknowledged he owned a gun usually kept it in his 
briefcase and simply forgot it was there when he arrived sunday to 
appear on a broadcast from the louisiana superdome

civil rights leaders claimed victory but 
said they would press a 1 million lawsuit against the city even 
though the police chief rescinded an order to randomly stop black 
teenagers in a mixed neighborhood 
police chief martin felker withdrew the order monday after 
separate meetings with city manager philip hawkey leroy williams 
president of the toledo chapter of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and residents of the old west end 
neighborhood 
the procedure was implemented to address a series of crimes 
that had been committed felker said unfortunately the focus 
of the directive has been perceived as racially motivated instead 
of the intent of focusing on the suspects involved 
the interdenominational ministerial alliance and other opponents 
of the policy said monday that they considered felkers latest 
action a triumph 
we put the pressure on the city because it was a patently 
racist order an insult to blacks said the rev floyd rose 
pastor of the family baptist church and a member of the alliance 
it was another example of the citys insensitivity to the black 
community we fought back and will continue to fight 
lafayette tolliver vice president of the thurgood marshall law 
association a group of black lawyers said the association was 
still pursuing the suit filed last week because of the police 
policy 
us district judge john potter on monday rejected the 
associations request for a temporary restraining order after 
talking to felker and learning he had rescinded his directive 
i think we won tolliver said we are satisfied as far as 
the temporary restraining order is concerned because now it is not 
necessary 
the suit will continue and we expect more plaintiffs to join 
us 
blacks make up about 17 percent of the citys population of 
340000 
the association sued friday on behalf of walter wade jr a 
black teenager who was followed and then stopped by police in 
front of his house last week wade 19 was questioned but not 
charged with any offense the lawsuit said 
the lawsuit said the policy violated civil rights laws and the 
constitutions guarantee of freedom of association and protection 
against unlawful search and seizure 
wades lawyers are seeking 1 million in punitive and 
compensatory damages 
on july 8 felker issued the order for police to stop and 
question groups of black teenagers in an attempt to end racial 
violence in the old west end 
later last month the ministerial alliance which includes 
ministers from a variety of church congregations in toledo asked 
the us justice department to investigate what the ministers 
called a conspiracy against black officials in ohios 
fourthlargest city 
two justice department representatives met once with city 
officials and once with ministers to try to mediate a solution no 
action resulted 
the alliance also has been threatening to boycott businesses 
that do not hire and promote blacks as a way of ending what it 
calls economic injustice in the city

gov michael s dukakis administration will have 
to release sensitive internal documents under terms of a state 
supreme court ruling that rejected his claim of executive privilege 
in a unanimous opinion issued monday the high court found no 
basis in the state constitution or laws for the executive branch to 
withhold memos and other papers 
i havent read it yet but certainly we will comply with the 
decision in every respect the democratic presidential candidate 
said monday 
he promised to release any requested documents in accordance 
with the decision 
the ruling prompted by a lawsuit filed by two homosexual men 
challenging dukakis foster care policy could have a farreaching 
impact on the operations of government 
the high court rejected the principle that the executive branch 
may keep certain papers secret a practice that is accepted in 
about onequarter of the states and in the federal executive branch 
attorneys for the state had argued that the forced disclosure of 
internal memos would have a chilling effect on government 
policymaking by inhibiting full discussion of options and 
consequences before policies are adopted and made public 
the high courts ruling came in a lawsuit by donald babets and 
david jean two homosexuals challenging the dukakis 
administrations decision to remove two young boys from foster care 
in their boston home the men argued that they needed access to the 
documents to prove their claim that their rights were violated 
its a victory for accountability and open government said 
attorney anthony m doniger who represents babets and jean the 
public now has a right to know how its government comes to its 
decisions that is a good thing in a democracy 
ken schwartz chief of staff in the states office of human 
resources said the ruling could distort the decisionmaking 
process 
the chilling effects of the disclosure of these types of 
documents is real and has the potential to harm the quality of 
decisions schwartz said according to doniger the court said 
the administration could still invoke the exemptions listed in the 
public records law which allows the government to withhold 
documents relating to litigation medical information about 
individuals policies still under discussion and pending real 
estate deals among others 
otherwise the justices said they could find no legal 
justification for withholding government documents and they 
declined to set a precedent by recognizing such a privilege 
had the framers of our governments structure intended to 
recognize in our constitution an executive privilege it is 
reasonable to expect that they would expressly have created one

a test of how long infants look at patterns and 
faces can help identify children at risk of showing mental 
disability by age 3 a researcher says 
early identification of highrisk children allows concentration 
of medical resources on the youngsters who need them and a way to 
quickly measure the impact of attempts to help a childs 
development said researcher joseph fagan 
the test should not be used on infants in general but only 
those considered at risk said fagan of case western reserve 
university in cleveland 
such children include those who were treated in neonatal 
intensive care who suffered a breathing difficulty called 
respiratory distress syndrome or who were born well past their due 
dates 
fagan described research on the test monday at the annual 
meeting of the american psychological association other 
researchers said the test has not yet been rigorously compared to 
other methods for predicting mental difficulties and that it is 
not perfectly accurate 
the fagan test of infant intelligence relies on the fact that 
most babies look longer at new images than at familiar ones that 
shows they can remember and discriminate between the images 
reflecting two key abilities important for later life that are 
tapped by iq tests fagan said 
the test presents infants with pairs of images either faces or 
abstract designs one is familiar the other new the time the 
infant spends looking at each image is precisely measured 
infants who tend to look at each image in a given pair for about 
the same amount of time are considered at risk for later mental 
difficulties 
fagan cited research in which the test was given to infants 3 
months to 7 months old who had been considered at risk the 
predictions of the test were compared to the childrens iq levels 
at age 3 
of the 104 children predicted to be normal 101 had normal 
intelligence at age 3 of the 24 infants predicted to be at risk 
for mental difficulties half had low iq at age 3 
fagan said most children who take the test because of some risk 
factor will receive a prediction of normality so the test is 
valuable in relieving needless anxieties of parents he said 
the test also will help research into whether exposure to 
certain substances early in life causes later mental troubles 
because it shortens the time between exposure and detection of 
those troubles he said 
fagan said he receives a royalty on test kits sold by the 
corporation that markets the test 
claire kopp of the university of california los angeles said 
fagans test has not yet been systematically compared for accuracy 
to other predictive techniques that focus on a childs environment 
and parents or development in such areas as language and 
perception 
robert mccall director of the university of pittsburghs office 
of child development said he and fagan agree the test should not 
be used as the sole means of diagnosing a problem rather it 
should be part of a continuing process of observation by a 
professional he said 
he also said that because mental disability is so rare even 
among infants thought to be at risk because of their histories a 
flat prediction that they will all turn out fine will be correct 80 
percent to 90 percent of the time 
fagans test allows predicting normal outcome with 97 percent 
accuracy however and i think that is useful mccall said 
but when the test predicts that an infant will turn out to be 
mentally disabled it will be wrong at least half the time he 
said that causes needless heartbreak for the parents he said and 
parents without adequate support may give up on the child and adopt 
lowered expectations 
no way to make certain predictions has been found mccall said 
adding he suspects humans change and adapt so much that such 
predictions may never be possible fagans test can give valuable 
insights into that developmental process he said

with the national news media focusing on 
the republican convention in new orleans democratic vice 
presidential candidate lloyd bentsen is doing all he can to grab 
the attention of the local press in his home state of texas 
bentsen was visiting the big hill strategic petroleum reserve 
facility near here today to demonstrate the democratic tickets 
support of the program which fills underground vaults with crude 
oil which can be retrieved in a national emergency 
bentsen contends in his campaign that the reagan administration 
has no coherent energy policy while reagan can point to overall 
prosperity oil areas such as this have suffered and the 
administration has given inconsistent support for the petroleum 
reserve program 
bentsen on monday was in houston talking about another industry 
in texas that has suffered lately the space program 
he visited the johnson space flight center and announced that 
dukakis would favor building a permanent manned space station 
we will support an allout effort to restore american 
leadership in exploring the universe he said in a speech to the 
greater houston chamber of commerce 
president reagan is a longtime supporter of the space station 
but bentsen said the administration has failed to bring the space 
agency back to top form since the challenger disaster 
bentsen also announced that if dukakis were elected the new 
president would quickly reinstitute a cabinetlevel council on 
space with the texas senator at its head 
lyndon johnson another texan was put in charge of the space 
council when he was vice president the board was later abolished 
by president nixon and reagan has killed efforts in congress to 
put it back in operation 
texas has 29 electoral votes and bentsen is trying to make good 
on his boast that the democrats will carry the state this fall the 
nineday campaign trip almost entirely in texas was designed to 
keep his name in the papers and on local television while vice 
president george bush another texan is receiving all that 
attention in new orleans 
were doing everything we can in these local markets to blow 
the republicans off the front page said campaign spokesman mike 
mccurry 
bentsen made one of the only two nontexas stops of his current 
campaign trip on monday scooting over to little rock ark for a 
political rally with democratic colleagues sens dale bumpers and 
david prior 
bentsen told the 400 supporters who endured ovenlike 
conditions in an office building courtyard that the republicans in 
new orleans were out of touch with reality 
while they were boasting of a booming economy he said they 
were ignoring places like little rock which have lost manufacturing 
jobs and theyre trying to tell you its never been better he 
said

george bush amp co are counting on this weeks 
superdome convention to provide a bounce that will vault the 
republicans to victory in the fall thats not impossible 
although it never has worked that way before 
the vice presidents men are wagering heavily on the pageant of 
new orleans to help bush overcome democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis who leads bush in the early public opinion polls 
bush controls the convention show of course the delegates are 
his the challenge he faces now is to show himself a leader in his 
own right after eight years as the understudy 
not since harry s truman has the candidate who trailed in polls 
prior to his nominating convention reversed the numbers and won the 
election and truman won his upset 40 years ago by overcoming the 
damage from a bitterly divided democratic convention 
president reagan said his convention farewell monday night with 
a proud review of an administration record he said bush shares 
now bush moves on stage to speak for himself his strategists 
say that new orleans is the place and thursday night the time when 
george bush will emerge as his own man and as a commanding presence 
in the race against dukakis 
thats highrisk politics since voters who tune in for the 
transformation may tune out if they dont see one the safe and 
standard procedure is to play down the event and keep expectations 
as low as possible 
 
dukakis did that in atlanta putting out word that his 
convention address was so dull his wife dozed off while reading it 
his speech was a strong one his delivery smooth and at times even 
dramatic his cheerleaders promptly claimed a masterpiece 
hardly not a line was memorable enough to have survived this 
long but it was a solid performance impressed a lot of people 
and thus a success 
republican tacticians are setting a more difficult target for 
bush george bush has not yet been center stage to the american 
people said lee atwater his campaign manager this will be 
the first time 
in his convention valedictory reagan said his successor must be 
a man of strength and experience bush 
it will take someone who has seen this office from the inside 
who senses the danger points will be cool under fire and knows the 
range of answers when the tough questions come reagan said 
thats the george bush ive seen up close when the staff and 
cabinet members have closed the door and when the two of us are 
alone 
someone whos not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to 
the core of an issue someone who never runs away from a fight 
never backs away from his beliefs and never makes excuses 
thats exactly the image bush wants to display to quash the 
where was george taunt of democrats and the misgivings even of 
some republican detractors who still raise the socalled wimp 
factor 
but reagan provided not a single example of bushs closeddoor 
performance and voters may want more than reagans word for it 
the republicans say that dukakis edge in the public opinion 
polls will erode and finally disappear as bush emerges from his 
supporting role and as people begin to focus on the issues that 
divide the candidates that is supposed to unfold over the four 
days of new orleans 
that assumes a convention imprint more lasting than most in 
1960 john f kennedys convention performance become a trademark 
of his new frontier campaign that hasnt happened since 
so bush has set himself a difficult task 
im not going to try to be a ronald reagan the vice 
president said there is only one i want to be george bush 
it is ironic that the man with the runon resume still is trying 
to introduce himself bush has after all run for president twice 
and for vice president twice listing bushs other jobs 
congressman republican chairman united nations ambassador 
representative to china cia director president reagan said i 
think the fellow with that resume has it all 
but the fellows own people say that his image remains 
indistinct 
the american people really dont know who george bush is 
said rep john paul hammerschmidt of arkansas a longtime friend 
that normally wouldnt be regarded as a very friendly thing to 
say about a veteran politician in this case its part of a risky 
political game plan

foreign travelers totalled 851606 an increase of 10 percent the 
china daily said today 
tourism earnings were up 266 percent according to state 
statistical bureau figures 
the official said 168000 residents of taiwan visited the 
mainland taking advantage of the taipei governments decision last

skirted the ban by entering china by way of hong kong or other 
third countries

by the united states with 133414

disasters in china and an outbreak of epidemics shanghai was hit 
by a hepatitis epidemic earlier this year for the decline in 
americans

exchange when it adopted its economic reform and open door policy 
10 years ago 
in all of 1978 there were just 18 million overseas visitors 
including 220000 outside of hong kong and macao

congressman beau boulter is busy reminding 
everyone that he is democratic sen lloyd bentsens other opponent 
this year 
thats not so easy because bentsens otherother opponent 
hasnt been named yet if hes been picked its george bushs 
secret 
boulter a twoterm representative from amarillo texas opened 
his challenge to bentsens reelection long before the texas 
senator was picked as a running mate by democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis but that selection boulter says was good 
news for him 
the point is lloyd bentsen doesnt want to be our senator any 
more thats my issue now as best as i can analyze it hes 
saying elect me so i can resign from the senate boulter said 
bentsen chosen by dukakis at last months democratic national 
convention was allowed to remain on the texas ballot in his bid 
for a fourth senate term under the socalled lyndon law which 
was passed to allow thensen lyndon johnson to run for both 
reelection and the white house in 1960 if he had gotten off the 
ticket the seat automatically would have been forfeited to boulter 
but boulter said texans today believe that law is unfair 
nobody is entitled to ask to be elected to two offices on the 
same ballot nobody he said 
boulters challenge of bentsen has been uphill all the way and 
the republican congressman acknowledges that he had to fight 
through a fourway primary and runoff election just to become the 
reublican opponent to bentsen whose campaign machine often is 
credited with helping democrats sweep all statewide offices in the 
1982 election 
boulters bid drew a cool reception from many establishment 
texas politicians and he has yet to win a strong endorsement from 
republican gov bill clements 
an early supporter of jack kemps presidential bid in george 
bushs home state boulter wasnt selected as a texas delegate to 
the republican national convention and is in new orleans only as an 
alternate 
ive always been a longshot but ive never thought i was such 
a longshot that i couldnt win said boulter who in 1984 won a 
stunning upset to oust veteran democratic rep jack hightower in 
the panhandlebased congressional district 
bentsens finances alone are intimidating as of june 30 the 
senator had reported raising about 75 million for his reelection 
bid compared with less than 600000 for boulter the republican 
said he hopes to raise 4 million or so by november 
in addition some republicans quietly had favored bentsen 
generally viewed as a moderatetoconservative whose chairmanship 
of the senate finance committee is welcome influence in texas 
but boulter says much of that has changed since bentsen joined 
dukakis on the democratic ticket 
its made me better known it has tended to lend credibility 
to what ive been saying about bentsens compatability with the 
kennedydukakis party it has made some people who were supporting 
him feel betrayed now theyre seeing the other lloyd bentsen 
and they feel like hes turned his back on what they thought he 
believed in boulter said 
boulter and other texas republicans including state party 
chairman fred meyer of dallas say they think the dukakisbentsen 
alliance raises legitimate questions about bentsens positions on 
taxes gun control and other issues important to texas voters 
lloyd bentsens got from my perspective a good record of 
fighting gun control but now he is running to elect a president 
who is an avid proponent of gun control this is a particularly 
important issue to a lot of people in texas boulter said 
the notion that bentsen can change dukakis into a gun owner is 
ridiculous

maria desillers faces a possible contempt citation 
for failing to turn over a bmw jewelry and other luxury items she 
allegedly purchased with money donated for her late sons liver 
transplants a trustee says 
karen gievers who oversees the donated funds planned to file a 
motion today in dade circuit court asking that ms desillers be 
fined or put behind bars for contempt 
mondays deadline required ms desillers to surrender the 
property or post a 100000 bond 
ms desillers failed to return to court after appearing earlier 
in the day in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the bond two 
deadlines for ms desillers to hand over the items last week had 
been extended by judge francis christie until monday 
the order clearly has been violated ms gievers said monday 
on monday ms desillers attorney frank johnson told christie 
the articles in her apartment were valued at about 4500 and that 
bonding companies refused to issue a 100000 bond for them 
the disputed property including a 1985 bmw 10850 in jewelry 
nearly 6000 in clothing and 4000 in furniture were worth more 
than 60000 ms gievers also is seeking about 130000 in cash 
that ms desillers allegedly paid to herself relatives and 
acquaintances 
after the deadline expired johnson said we are going to 
weather this one out in judge christies courtroom 
ms gievers believes 242000 remains of the nearly 690000 
donated for ronnie desillers three liver transplants 
ronnie died in april 1987 at pittsburgh childrens hospital at 
age while awaiting his fourth transplant ms desillers refuses to 
pay the hospital about 262000 in medical bills because she says 
her son received improper care a charge hospital administrators 
deny 
contributions including 1000 from president reagan had 
poured in after a small fund collected by ronnies school was 
reported stolen

three of the men who fought to be where 
george bush will stand on thursday night praised their onetime 
rival at the opening session of the republican national convention 
former delaware gov pete du pont former secretary of state 
alexander haig jr and rep jack kemp of new york will be followed 
at the podium by the two other unsuccessful republican presidential 
candidates television evangelist pat robertson tonight and sen 
bob dole of kansas on wednesday both will speak in coveted 
primetime slots as did kemp 
du pont and haig were afforded morning time at the opening of 
the convention monday 
the band of former candidates who in days past spent their time 
attacking one another and especially bush have come together in 
new orleans for the cause of republican unity 
all are keeping busy schedules during convention week bustling 
about new orleans from receptions to speeches and parties in their 
honor along with a hefty schedule of media interviews 
kemp who spoke before president reagan on monday night told 
the president this is a powerful legacy that you are handing us 
here in new orleans i just want you and nancy to know that under 
the able leadership of george bush this party is going to take it 
and run with it were going to win in november 
kemp along with dole was doing some running of his own in new 
orleans 
both are said to be on bushs short list of runningmate 
possibilities 
kemp told a news conference he would be a terrific vice 
president but dole indicated he was wearying of bushs long 
selection process 
doles wife elizabeth however appeared to be touting the 
senator for the runningmate post saying how proud she was that 
literally a week after bob withdrew from the presidential race he 
was out working hard and i mean hard for george bush he doesnt 
look back 
and all are doing their dutiful share of democratbashing 
haig in his speech to the delegates went a little overboard as 
far as the bush camp was concerned he referred to democratic 
nominee michael dukakis as a diminutive clerk from 
massachusetts a choice of words the bush staff called 
inappropriate 
haig also compared the democratic party to a bat flying 
erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down 
for extended periods in dark damp caves up to its navel in guano 
haig who directed some of the most pointed barbs at bush during 
the primary said bush represented safe and progressive change 
safe in that george bush will build on the solid accomplishments of 
the reagan presidency 
du pont who said he will be campaigning virtually full time for 
the bush ticket said the democrats are looking to the policies of 
yesterday bush and the republicans are willing to explore 
examine and put new ideas to work he said 
in an interview he admitted to feeling a little wistful as 
he looked forward to bushs nomination on wednesday night he said 
he enjoyed the campaign but george was a little stronger this 
year 
at a reception monday dole thanked his primary supporters but 
he added thats behind us and now were on to the big event 
where george bush will become the 41st president of the united 
states 
robertson who raised 25 million but failed to attract 
significant voter support has set up a large campaign office near 
the french quarter but so far there seems to have been little 
activity in the office although he is scheduled to attend a series 
of rallies and events this week 
robertson announced last week he would not enter his name into 
nomination removing the last wrinkle in bushs otherwise smooth 
convention waters

distribution of free hypodermic needles to 
drug abusers aimed at reducing the spread of aids will begin no 
sooner than october because a clinic has not been able to obtain 
liability insurance 
kathy oliver executive director of the outside in clinic said 
monday that negotiations with the clinics insurance company st 
paul fire and marine of st paul minn had failed 
what became clear was that we needed to find another 
insurance carrier she said 
the program which officials had said would be the first of its 
kind in the united states already had been delayed twice because 
the clinic was unable to negotiate a policy with st paul fire and 
marine 
it was originally scheduled to start in july the distribution 
program is intended to study whether providing needles can help 
reduce the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome among 
intravenous drug abusers a similar program is scheduled to start 
in new york in a few weeks 
oliver said several other insurance companies have been 
contacted and the only thing that needed to be negotiated was the 
price she declined to name the other companies 
once insurance is obtained the clinic will need two weeks to 
get the program started oliver said oct 1 is probably the 
earliest the program will begin she added 
last month a spokeswoman for st paul fire and marine the 
nations largest medical liability insurer said the program 
involved areas of unknown liability 
were especially concerned for the potential of the spread of 
aids from needles supplied by the clinic and later reused 
spokeswoman beth murray said 
the company has provided the clinics comprehensive medical 
malpractice and liability insurance for 10 years the clinic has 
never filed a claim 
the needle program is being financed by a 67000 grant from the 
american foundation for aids research under the yearlong program 
125 drug addicts will exchange used needles for new ones and 
receive counseling

a funeral procession for a former 
president who was three times deposed by the army turned quickly 
into a peaceful protest against gen manuel antonio noriega the 
countrys de facto ruler 
without their usual fear of repression by the generals soldiers 
and police noriegas opponents gathered in the plaza in front of 
the metropolitan cathedral on monday for a requiem mass for arnulfo 
arias madrid 
arias madrid who would have been 87 on monday died of a heart 
attack last wednesday 
as the service ended and arias madrids coffin was placed atop a 
bright orange firetruck for the trip to the garden of peace 
cemetery a great seemingly spontaneous cry went up from the 
throng in the plaza 
justice they shouted 
the crowd followed the cortege out of the plaza through the 
narrow brick streets of the old section of panama city and onto 
the capitals main business artery with each block the procession 
grew until it filled the fourlane street for nearly a mile 
noriega must go the marchers shouted arnulfo president 
noriega delinquent 
the panamanian government is dominated by noriega who commands 
the countrys 15000member defense forces he was indicted by two 
federal grand juries in the united states in february on charges of 
narcotics trafficking 
noriegas soldiers and police who have crushed dozens of 
protests in the past 14 months did not interfere with the funeral 
many in the procession waved white banners or the flags of 
political parties opposed to noriega 
thousands of people lined the streets often impeding progress 
it took the procession nearly six hours to wend its way the three 
miles to the cemetery it arrived at sundown more than two hours 
behind schedule 
prominent in the procession were members of the national civic 
crusade which led dozens of demonstrations against noriega in 1987 
and early this year but hasnt been on the streets since the 
government smashed a protest march last spring and arrested most of 
its leaders 
they couldnt very well halt a funeral procession for arias 
and with the cap off the people have again come out to show how 
they feel about the government said roberto aleman one of the 
few original crusade leaders who has not been forced into exile 
the authentic panamanian party which arias madrid founded in 
1935 refused a government offer to provide military honors at the 
funeral instead it decided on the requiem mass conducted on the 
cathedral steps by archbishop marcos mcgrath the countrys roman 
catholic leader 
we cant accept that those who always overthrew the doctor 
arias share in our grief said francisco artola party vice 
president the ceremony is going to be for the people 
us ambassador arthur davis and his daughter susan were among 
the mourners 
in death arias madrid won praise even from 
governmentcontrolled newspapers 
they referred in vague terms to his errors during 57 years 
in politics but praised his nationalism and defiance of the united 
states elected to three fouryear terms the military allowed him 
to serve a total of only 2 years 
in january 1941 during the first term he turned down a us 
war department request for land for military bases along the panama 
canal 
at the united states urging the military ousted him in a coup 
later that year 9 months after he took office soon after 
washington had its 37000 acres for the bases 
arias madrid was elected again in 1949 but tossed out by the 
army in 1951 
his third term began on oct 1 1968 but lasted only 11 days 
until his overthrow in a coup led by gen omar torrijos whom 
noriega replaced as head of the defense forces 
just four years ago arias madrid entered the presidential race 
again the government said nicolas ardito barletta noriegas 
candidate won by 1713 votes but the election was widely seen as 
fraudulent 
arias madrid spent long periods in selfimposed exile he had 
gone to florida for medical treatment in april and remained there 
until his death

political differences were put aside monday 
as democratic congresswoman lindy boggs welcomed republicans into 
her home on bourbon street the favored path of partying 
conventioneers 
the blowout at mrs boggs 193yearold house honored republican 
senators and representatives a party tuesday night will honor sen 
bob dole of kansas and his wife elizabeth 
other celebrations monday included evening cruises on the 
mississippi river and the start of a threenight engagement by jazz 
trumpeter al hirt in between were free brunches buffets and open 
bars at all hours for delegates and hangerson 
mrs boggs said her party was to repay a 12yearold debt of 
gratitude in 1976 she helped plan the democratic national 
convention in new york her hosts included republicans and their 
city was in deep financial trouble 
once we were established in new york everyone regardless of 
partisan politics worked very hard to make it very successful the 
same thing i think is true here mrs boggs said 
its a tiny bit of reciprocity on my part new orleans has 
been in a very serious economic downturn this is a real lift in 
spirits and the economy as well when your city needs help 
everyone pulls together 
lindy told me no problem i have house parties all the 
time said rep john porter of illinois as he worked his way 
around a police barricade near the grey double doors of the old 
house 
the democrats are paying their respects to the republicans 
said porters wife kathryn 
this is like washington a lot of intermingling between 
republicans and democrats said herb hecht a conventioneer from 
virginia 
i think the party is wonderful said former california lt 
gov mike curb 
registered democrats outnumber registered republicans 189741 to 
34853 in new orleans where mayor sidney barthelemy is a vice 
chairman of the democratic national committee about 15 percent of 
louisianas registered voters are republicans but the gop has won 
five of the states last eight presidential races 
all of which prompts this reassurance from mrs boggs theyre 
not overrunning my house theyre most cordially invited 
another elegant party was sponsored by the eagle forum a 
conservative organization headed by phyllis schlafly which paid 
5000 to rent the new orleans museum of art for a lateafternoon 
salute to gop celebrities 
mrs schlafly asked whether her familyoriented group found 
anything wholesome to do in new orleans said well the food is 
wholesome 
walter klaus a 76yearold alternate from farmington minn 
who was at the museum said he had no plans to visit wicked 
bourbon street i hear all about it and people say we should see 
it but ive got other things to do 
the celebrities were rep jack kemp of new york former judge 
robert bork former united nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick 
sen phil gramm of texas and former secretary of education william 
bennett 
each was given a clock by mrs schlafly the clocks have four 
faces which she said would keep the honorees on time across the 
country as they campaign for the republican ticket this fall 
the eagle forum had scarcely vacated the museum when bars and 
buffets were restocked for a lateevening costume bash for 1000 
contributors to the republican senatorial campaign committee 
fearful that delegates would tire of spicy cajun and creole 
snacks caterer brian huber served stirfried chicken and peanuts 
pasta topped with spicy cured ham crawfishtail fritters and fried 
pork rinds the last recently revealed as a favorite snack of vice 
president george bush

have seemed a big and lonely spot without her waiting for me every 
day 
mrs reagan was visibly moved by her husbands simple but deeply 
personal tribute the couple embraced as the room erupted in 
applause 
the scene reinforced the public image of the reagans as a close 
and deeply committed couple they met when both were actors in 
hollywood and married in 1952 
what do you say about someone who gives your life meaning 
someone who is always there to support and understand you someone 
who makes sacrifices so that your life will be easier and more 
successful reagan said what you say is that you love that 
person and treasure her 
he also said mrs reagan had looked after him through 
recuperations and crises every president should be so lucky 
nancy in front of all your friends here today let me say 
thank you for all you do thank you for your love and thank you 
for just being you reagan said 
also paying tribute to mrs reagan at the luncheon emceed by 
reagans daughter maureen reagan the republican national 
committee cochairman were several party officials and singer 
barbara cook and comedian rich little 
in brief remarks mrs reagan praised vice president george 
bush who is to receive the partys presidential nomination 
wednesday night and his wife barbara 
today the curtain begins to close on the reagan era of the 
republican party weve had a wonderful run but the time has come 
for the bushes to step into the leading roles and for the reagans 
to step into the wings she said

the three major television networks grumbled 
after the democratic convention and cut the staff brought here but 
they nevertheless are reserving prime time all week for the 
republicans and praying for news 
the biggest surefire story was president reagans farewell 
speech to the party he led for eight years but that was monday 
and the rest of the week loomed with two hours to fill each night 
sometimes more 
the networks are making a goodfaith effort to appear gungho 
with much talk of democracy and responsibility and how things 
arent really so boring 
there is after all the unanswered question of whom george bush 
will select as his running mate nbc anchor tom brokaw labels the 
suspense ersatz but the question remains 
and then there are the questions about bush himself how will he 
acquit himself will he emerge from reagans shadow will the 
convention give him the boost he needs 
theres lots of news going on here said lane venardos 
executive producer for cbs news special events just because 
something isnt big news doesnt mean it isnt news 
cbs is leading the campaign for primetime convention coverage 
boring or not with nbc not far behind 
some things in television are more important than ratings 
even more important than money coverage of the political 
conventions is one of them cbs anchor dan rather said in a my 
turn article published this week in newsweek 
rather derided a suggestion by one television executive 
after the atlanta convention with its disastrous ratings that the 
parties and maybe the networks should come up with something more 
appealing to the american people 
no way wrote rather not everything about democracy is 
exciting some things are simply important that is reason enough 
to cover them 
abc anchorman peter jennings said the comment by abc news 
president roone arledge was taken out of context roone was 
exhibiting a certain frustration which all of us feel that more 
americans do not participate in the process he said 
arledge went further than any other network executive in openly 
speculating that abc might cut its coverage in new orleans 
the prospect so worried the gop that we were very adamant 
with the network said mark goode hired by the republican national 
committee to produce the convention we felt it was unfair to 
change the rules in the middle of the game we told them it could 
hurt them if they did it 
jennings said he was unaware of any pressure on abc and added 
i cant imagine the party would act in such bad taste he also 
said there was never any doubt in my mind or in any 
correspondents mind that we were going to cover this exactly as we 
covered the convention in atlanta 
with their highprofile anchors and correspondents their 
trailer encampments the size of small towns their glass skyboxes 
visible in the convention hall the networks remain a dominating 
presence even in their lean new incarnation 
you cannot put in all this effort all these people all this 
money and say youre going through the motions said lloyd 
siegel senior producer of nbcs coverage 
siegel said much of what goes on at the conventions is not of 
national interest but he added its two weeks every four 
years when people stop to consider how the country should be run 
who will be the next president theres no bigger story than that

city council early today rejected a federal 
courtordered housing desegregation plan despite the imposition of 
potentially bankrupting fines issued after it voted the same way 
two weeks ago 
opponents of the plan far outnumbered supporters at the meeting 
which began monday night and ran past midnight to allow all 80 
people who signed up to speak five minutes each 
on wednesday the 2nd us circuit court of appeals will hear 
arguments on contempt against the city issued two weeks ago by us 
district judge leonard sand 
on aug 1 the council voted 43 to reject the affordable 
housing plan that would integrate the states fourthlargest city 
the plan was in accordance with a federal court order which calls 
for 200 units of lowincome housing and 800 units of 
moderateincome housing 
sand subsequently held the city and the four council members who 
voted against the plan in contempt he also issued heavy fines 
against the city the fines had accumulated to 25600 when the 
federal appeals court ordered them temporarily halted last week 
the court also ordered the council to meet once a week to cast 
another vote on the housing plan mondays meeting was the first 
mayor nicholas wasicsko who supports the desegregation plan 
expressed disappointment over todays 43 vote 
i think the councilmen have had an opportunity to make their 
political statements he said they have had their publicity 
their national exposure this would have been an opportune time for 
them to come out as far ahead as they can publicitywise and 
not do any real harm to the city 
much of the crowd filed out as the mayor spoke some sang good 
night mayor to tune of good night ladies 
but councilman nicholas longo one of the four opponents got a 
standing ovation when he called the plan a plain disaster for the 
city of yonkers 
its a planning disaster and no one should force it on the 
taxpayers of this city he said 
earlier monday city manager neil deluca proposed an alternative 
to the plan that has divided this racially mixed city and 
threatened to send it into bankruptcy 
the proposal would provide 100 new units of lowincome rental 
housing and allow another 100 lowincome families to buy their own 
cooperative apartments 
deluca unveiled his plan at a meeting of yonkers civic leaders 
he also proposed an alternative to the 800 units of moderate 
income housing that sand ordered built during the next four years 
under delucas plan 750 units would be built over a 10year period 
sheila morris president of the black womens political caucus 
in yonkers attended mondays meeting but took no position on 
delucas plan

here is a transcript of the tribute to former 
arizona sen barry goldwater delivered by sen william armstrong of 
colorado at the republican national convention 
thank you very very much thank you kay thank you ladies and 
gentlemen 
ladies and gentlemen let me take you back for a minute to the 
year 1952 
remember at that time the democrats had been in charge of 
everything around here for over 30 years and what the liberal wing 
of the democratic party believed in had become the conventional 
wisdom and dominated the councils of government and you remember 
some of us remember that what they believed in of course was 
government big government and more big government 
in some parts of the country in 1952 there were people who had 
grown to adulthood without ever having known a republican who had 
been elected to a high public office and unfortunately in some 
places the republicans they did know were always apologizing for 
their views 
and then from out of the west a pioneer appeared and he didnt 
apologize he had a message he talked about individualism and 
selfreliance and personal responsibility at first his was a very 
lonely voice and they had a name for him they called him a 
conservative whats more he proudly admitted he was a 
conservative because he wanted to serve the principles upon which 
this nation was founded because to this day these are the 
principles that have meant freedom and equality and liberty for 
the people of this country 
the year was 1952 and that pioneer was barry goldwater 
and his ideas seemed pretty radical at the time he just didnt 
believe that all the power came from government he dared to 
believe in the people he dared to believe that the american people 
were smart enough and capable enough to shape their own future 
well this conservative idea picked up steam and slowly 
gradually it caught on gradually even political leaders began to 
realize that the real deep down fundamental beliefs of mainstream 
america are the same beliefs that this pioneer brought with him in 
1952 when he first won election as senator from arizona 
film clip of goldwaters life is shown 
barry goldwater has served our party applause 
ladies and gentlemen if i may have your attention let me have 
the last word about barry goldwater 
barry youve served our party and this nation and when weve 
needed you youve always come through next january george bush is 
going to be sworn in as president of the united states and when it 
happens it will be in large part because of the pioneering 
leadership and partybuilding of barry goldwater a man of honor 
a man of integrity a fighter an idealist a patriot mr 
conservative 
and barry for a lot of us thousands of us here in this room 
and millions more around the country whove been inspired by your 
leadership over the years you will always be mr republican

here is a transcript of the speech by former 
gov pete du pont of delaware to the republican national convention 
on monday 
thank you ladies and gentlemen 
judge roy barrera fellow republicans and fellow americans 
over the next four days we republicans will be talking to our 
fellow citizens about the issues we care about about our work our 
families and homes our schools our worries about crime and drugs 
our desire to extend and expand the peace we have achieved 
today we republicans are the party of the issues the party 
willing to explore and examine and put new ideas to work we are 
the party that has brought america back to economic strength and 
george bush a man with unequalled experience in government is the 
man who will put its newest ideas to work 
last month the democrats held their convention in atlanta the 
most interesting thoughts of that gathering came not from its 
presidential candidate who really represents the failed liberal 
policies of the past no the most interesting thoughts came from 
the reverend jesse jackson 
i would like to read to you a message ive sent today to 
reverend jackson perhaps it came from all of us 
dear reverend jackson 
the du pont family was deeply moved by the words of the jackson 
family at your convention the eloquence of your childrens 
affection was matched by the eloquence of your grandmothers quilt 
reverend jackson you understand the struggle and pain of 
poverty and the fact that it is less rampant than you portray does 
not make it less important than you suggest when you reach out to 
the poor your hands and your heart touch us all you say you come 
from the poor from the projects from a teenaged mother and a 
broken home but reverend jackson you also come from america 
america has offered you her hand and you have helped move 
america you are a leader in our nation as long as your lungs have 
breath yours will be a prominent voice but as long as you speak as 
a democrat you will never be a successful leader for the party 
you have joined reverend jackson and the philosophy you have 
adopted cannot help the people for whom you speak

i cannot speak as eloquently as you so let me just speak 
plainly your party has lost its way our party has found its way 
your party talks about a peaceful world and that is right our 
party opened the door to china built the bridge to moscow and is 
paving the road to peace 
your party fights for freedom in south africa and that is right 
but our party fights for freedom wherever it is in peril and 
wherever it is sought 
your party walks on the picket lines and that is symbolic but 
our party creates the jobs millions and millions and millions of 
them 
your party sleeps with the homeless and that is noble but our 
party lowers interest rates and that lowers rents 
your party recognizes the invaluable role that teachers play in 
the lives of our children and you are right but only our party 
protects the indispensable role of parents in the lives of our 
children 
your party raises the voices of our senior citizens and that is 
right but our party lowers inflation and cuts their cost of living 
your partys candidate believes he made a miracle happen in 
massachusetts well he is right but you know and i know that that 
miracle is named president ronald reagan 
your party bemoans a myth the absence of good times with good 
jobs and good wages our party celebrates a fact the creation of 
good times with good jobs at good wages 
reverend jackson you and i and everyone all across america know 
that the challenge is not ended there is work to be done 
not everyone is reaping the rewards of americas prosperity you 
dramatize that better than almost anyone except those who are 
suffering

america struggled long to achieve equality of rights we must 
now guarantee not only equality of opportunity but a continued 
abundance of opportunity 
your party does not know how to do that and our party does 
reverend jackson you seek common ground you seek higher 
ground well may i suggest in all sincerity that the ground you 
seek is here in new orleans is the party of lincoln and reagan 
and bush and kemp and bork 
we ask you to join us because we need you and you need us you 
can help america understand the need and we republicans have shown 
america how to meet the need 
together we cannot only keep hope alive we can make dreams 
come true 
signed sincerely pete du pont 
now let me add my friends that dreams become reality when 
experienced leaders grasp the challenges before us michael 
dukakis record shows that the high taxes and free spending 
policies of yesterday guide him 
george bush as a congressman a diplomat intelligence chief 
and vice president has shown that as president he will not only 
keep hope alive but help make the dreams of millions of americans 
come true 
thank you and god bless

here is the transcript of the speech by 
former secretary of state alexander m haig jr to the republican 
national convention on monday 
mr chairman fellow republicans ladies and gentlemen 
i am honored to address the opening session of our partys 
convention for me this occasion is also a reunion with my former 
colleagues from the republican primary debates we had our 
differences then but we are all agreed on one thing now we are 
dedicated to making george bush the next president of the united 
states 
i am confident that in november the people will choose george 
bush because he represents safe and progressive change for america 
safe in that george bush will build on the solid accomplishments of 
the reagan presidency 
americans know michael dukakis will trash them 
thanks to the reaganbush achievements of the past eight years 
americas international standing has been literally transformed 
when i last spoke to a republican convention in 1980 we saw a 
nation thrown off balance by blunder and gloom the soviets were on 
the march everywhere afghanistan had been seized soviet 
surrogates were triumphant in kampuchea southern africa and 
central america a cruel war raged in the persian gulf our allies 
were disheartened and freedom was in retreat and all the democrats 
could offer was indecision and malaise 
today eight years later the policy of peace through strength 
has begun to pay off the russians are leaving afghanistan their 
surrogates in africa and asia are in trouble the persian gulf 
conflict is drawing to a conclusion 
the soviets are negotiating our arms control agenda of reduction 
and cuts designed not to increase soviet superiority democracy 
not communism is on the march george bush helped make this happen 
and he is indeed the safe candidate for america 
but he also knows what changes are needed to strengthen the most 
successful administration in recent history the bush team has made 
progressive change central to our party platform at this convention 
in contrast hard evidence confirms that governor dukakis is not 
the candidate of safe progressive change but the candidate of 
radical and dangerous change 
he does not believe in peace through strength as chief 
executive of the state of massachusetts he has steadfastly refused 
to permit the critical warning and communication facility the 
ground wave emergency network gwen to be built in his state 
leaving a serious gap in our nations defense 
he will turn over our global peacekeeping obligations 
exclusively to international organizations the un or the oas in 
the third world he will resurrect the sterile policies of george 
mcgovern

michael dukakis will weaken america by withdrawing support for 
the mx and the migitman missiles and reduce sdi to a constrained 
research and development program until recently he has even 
opposed the b1 and stealth bombers 
of course the democrats know that people would reject the real 
michael dukakis so as president reagan has said he is traveling 
incognito you have to admit atlanta was good theater it was an 
offbroadway revival of the odd couple starring the diminutive 
clerk from massachusetts and the tall stranger from texas 
but when you look at the real dukakisbentsen foreign policies 
you have to ask yourself are they running against us or are they 
running against each other 
and then theres the reverend jesse jackson who likes to say a 
bird likes to fly on two wings maybe he forgot some birds with 
two wings cant fly at all like the extinct dodo bird that was 
too stupid to defend itself or the ostrich which prefers to live 
with danger by ignoring it 
in fact the more you look at it the less the democratic ticket 
looks like a bird at all its more like a bat blind as a bat 
endowed with the sophisticated sensing mechanisms we saw in atlanta 
but totally unable to differentiate flying erratically for brief 
periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods 
in dark damp caves up to its naval in guano 
lord america doesnt need any more of that and so my friends 
you and i know that next novembers election may be the most 
important since world war ii our efforts this week may be decisive 
in its outcome 
we are in new orleans 
to unify our party 
to endorse our worthy candidate george bush 
to dedicate america to safe and progressive change 
to dedicate ourselves and in behalf of mankind to a world 
guided by rule of law and peace through strength i thank you

here is a transcript of the speech by rep 
jack kemp of new york to the republican national convention on 
monday night 
thank you very much 
i want to tell you 
thank you elizabeth dole 
i want to tell you my favorite ronald reagan story 
but first of all i want to thank elizabeth dole not only for 
her very gracious introduction but for the great service she has 
rendered america by serving in ronald reagans cabinet thank you 
elizabeth 
itll probably come as no surprise to you that my favorite 
ronald reagan movie is knute rockne allamerican starring 
pat obrien as knute rockne and ronald reagan as george gipp 
we all remember the famous line about winning one for the 
gipper but ill always remember that movie for another scene at 
practice one day coach knute rockne turns to george gipp a 
freshman running back at notre dame and tells him to go in and 
scrimmage against the varsity and rockne says to the gipper 
theyll give you the ball you just run with it 
ronald reagan looks at coach rockne and says how far coach 
well mr president when america gave you the ball eight years 
ago no one could have imagined how far you would carry it 
and today thanks to you mr president our nation is in the 
midst of the most powerful renewal and expansion in our history an 
america poised better than any nation on earth for the exploding 
potential of the last decade of this century and the boundless 
horizons of the next 
now we all know the dreary litany of domestic troubles that 
you mr president and george bush faced in 1980 doubledigit 
inflation rising unemployment a 21 percent prime rate and a 
mortgage rate of 16 percent a falling living standard and the 
very real fear that the world was somehow running out of energy 
worst of all there was a sense of despair and defeat something 
the american people have never felt before and they didnt like 
it 
when you mr president and george bush took office in 1981 we 
had to free this nation from the stifling hand of excessive 
government the crushing tax burden on families and on business 
the smothering regulations all of which had sent america into the 
worst competitive decline of our history 
contrary to all the doomsayers we have witnessed an 
entrepreneurial renaissance its electrified the world its 
raised our standard of living weve created more than 5 million 
new small businesses and 17 million new jobs and as elizabeth 
dole said they are good jobs good for all the american people in 
the last five years america has led the world in industrial output 
and the creation of new manufacturing jobs in america 
today even the rest of the world is investing in our country 
theyre building factories in our nation theyre creating jobs for 
americans and ladies and gentlemen were now increasing our 
exports to the world at the astonishing rate of 30 percent a year 
and whats so great weve created a working model of freedom 
and prosperity a model that will not only carry the united states 
into the 21st century but it will help carry other countries as 
well

abraham lincoln the founder of the republican party gave this 
nation a new birth of freedom well mr president youve helped 
give the whole world a new birth of freedom 
nations around the world are following our example choosing low 
tax rates less government and more freedom theyre learning what 
our people knew right from the beginning that freedom works and 
ladies and gentlemen freedom will work wherever its tried on this 
earth that is our model for the world 
our opponents tell us and tell the american people that 
reaganomics has failed that because of problems we have yet to 
solve america has failed but if thats the case why are so many 
nations in the world following our example why are delegations 
pouring in from europe and asia from africa and latin america 
to study the american miracle that has created more new jobs and 
more new businesses than all of europe and japan combined 
without inflation and that is a miracle 
today with america leading the way democracy and freedom are 
on the march around the world the worlds political climate is 
changing and even its most dangerous political dinosaurs 
socialism and marxism are threatened with extinction the soviet 
union and communist china are trying to reform their societies and 
their economies not out of some ideological awakening but because 
they have to 
ladies and gentlemen what a sight it was what it was an 
opportunity to watch ronald reagan an american president 
standing at moscow state university under the very nose of 
vladimir ilyich lenin standing there and proclaiming faith 
democracy freedom human rights for soviet jews and christians 
and making us proud of the american ideal he said throughout the 
world free markets are the model for economic growth that 
democracy is the standard by which all governments are measured 
and those russian students knew that finally they were hearing 
the truth 
well ladies and gentlemen our party like our nation has only 
one reason for existence both were born out of a dedication to a 
very simple yet profound proposition that all human beings are 
equal in the eyes of our creator and therefore all people are 
equally endowed with inalienable human rights 
and the secret of the american miracle is that we put our faith 
in the american people in their talent their creativity and in 
their godgiven potential and that has been the secret of the 
american miracle we rediscovered under ronald reagan that our 
people are our greatest resource 
and as the party of abraham lincoln and reagan we believe 
that freedom and hope and opportunity cant be for just some of us 
theyve got to be for all of us america must keep moving ahead we 
cant leave anyone behind 
democrats measure compassion by how many people are receiving 
government assistance we measure compassion by how few need it 
democrats see america locked in a class struggle between owners and 
workers between the rich and the poor we want an america where 
workers can become owners and poor can become rich

governor dukakis talks about plant closings we want to 
continue plant openings and democrats see america in terms of its 
limits we see america in terms of its boundless possibilities 
ladies and gentlemen if we do our job right i predict that by 
1992 at the reelection of george bush as our president of the 
united states i want to predict here tonight that onequarter of 
our party will be black hispanic and asianamericans who see in 
our party the best chance theyve ever had for their themselves and 
their families 
whats the real purpose of the reagan revolution it wasnt to 
defeat democrats it was to provide superior leadership to provide 
new ideas and to restore confidence in america like the american 
revolution itself the greatness of our revolution is not to be 
measured by who were against but by what we are for 
last month in atlanta last month in atlanta the leaders of the 
democratic party failed to say what theyre for all they said is 
who theyre against they all said we cant stand another eight 
years of republican policies well of course they cant another 
eight years of republican policies itll be clear to ted kennedy 
and jim wright and michael dukakis that with 17 million new jobs 
and 5 million new small businesses at that rate ladies and 
gentlemen all their constituents will be republicans 
well this is no time to stop no time to go back got a lot of 
work to do we dont want low inflation we want no inflation we 
dont want low unemployment we want no unemployment we need a 
safety net to keep people from falling but we need a ladder of 
opportunity upon which all people can climb 
ladies and gentlemen we dont just want to oppose communism 
we want to support those men and women who are fighting for freedom 
and democracy whether theyre in afghanistan angola or central 
america we want to free people we want to free people not only 
from too much dependence on government we want to free them from 
dependence on drugs from disrespect for human life 
mr president youve brought us to the threshold of a new era 
in fact youve brought us over the threshold youve shown us mr 
president that we can do more than contain our adversaries we 
can transcend them youve shown us mr president how we can even 
make the threat of nuclear war obsolete through the nowproven 
technology of strategic defense for america and youve reminded us 
that the very first and best department of health education and 
welfare is a strong american family 
mr president most of all above everything else youve shown 
us that the power of a right idea is the single greatest force on 
this earth its a powerful legacy that you leave us its a 
powerful legacy that youre handing us here tonight in new orleans 
and we just want you and nancy to know that under the able 
leadership of george bush this republican party is going to take 
it and run with it and were going to win in november 
were going to finish the job were going to finish what we 
began in 1980 to help all americans to help in the spirit of 
abraham lincoln we want to help all people everywhere to share 
in the success of freedom and democracy and peace 
that is our legacy and that is our future 
god bless youmr president may god bless america thank you

nominated for the first time 
and four years ago i stood up here and thanked you for all that 
youd done for me not knowing that i was going to have a chance to 
do it again but youve given us such a wonderful life a life that 
i really never dreamed possible and its the most extraordinary 
feeling to represent a nation and its people and i can never thank 
you enough for all the experiences and memories that youve made 
possible 
the last eight years have been the most fulfilling ones of my 
life tom mentioned the drug letters that i have received and the

chance and you really gave me the chance to be more than i thought 
i could be and brought something out in me that i didnt know was 
there 
and you helped me and i thank you a great deal for that and 
youve always been there for us 
its true there were some rough times for my husband and me but 
as i said to you four years ago i always felt that i could draw on 
you for your support and your affection and i did draw on you a 
great deal more than you knew and i thank you for that too

united states george bush 
first let me thank the democratic party leaders for televising 
their convention what i saw and heard reminded me and millions of 
other former democrats why were proud to be republicans 
the dukakis convention speech was just like the democrat 
platform hedging on defense hedging on taxes hedging on 
spending were not running against bentsen and dukakis were 
running against bentsen and hedges 
governor hedges governor hedges governor hedges 
tried mightily to paint over his liberal policies with pretty 
rhetoric but the makeup job failed as an old federal trade 
commissioner i want to know whatever happened to truth in 
advertising 
but weve come to new orleans not to pin the tail on the donkey 
were here to pin our hopes on the american future and were not 
buying the dukakis deception despite what he says this election 
is about ideas and ideology they do matter they will matter to 
americans who face a choice this year as stark and dramatic as any 
in memory 
we americans faced a similar choice in 1980 and what did we get 
for our choice we got a president who doesnt apologize for 
american interests he asserts them 
we got a breakthrough in soviet relations and the inf treaty we 
got the longest economic boom in peacetime history 
it was my privilege for seven years to serve the man who made 
this happen one of americas greatest presidents ronald reagan 
thank you mr president thank you mr president for that 
opportunity 
todays strong economy means stronger families and we affirm 
the woman who chooses to work in the home but our strong economy 
has also provided needed jobs for millions of women and let me say 
to the women of america i respect the fact that some of you have 
questions i also ask you to have an open mind 
you know better then anyone that a job a good job is 
absolutely basic to a familys happiness and stability thats our 
freedom are we going to let them take it away crowd yells 
no 
in the past eight years president reagan has created an 
incredible jobs machine more jobs for more americans than ever 
before and twothirds of the 17 million new jobs created since 
1982 went to women good jobs not bad jobs 
real work not make work thats our freedom are we going to 
let them take it away crowd yells no 
you did it you were the expansion you the women of america 
who are holding jobs as never before whove started businesses as 
never before who have invested as never before this expansion 
its your triumph but it was ronald reagan and george bush who set 
in motion the forces which allowed that growth to occur and the 
economy to bloom thats our freedom are we going to let them take 
it away crowd yells no 
america is on a roll if this great economic upsurge is stopped 
if we have a president who raises taxes again and in creases 
regulation again and stifles growth again and believe me thats 
what michael dukakis will do if we let the liberals back in we 
lose all that progress your progress

we women would be especially vulnerable were always vulnerable 
when jobs are cut back and the economy stagnates 
remember the carter years when workers were afraid to open pay 
envelopes because there just might be a pink slip inside when 
families gave up hope of ever owning their own home when parents 
feared their childrens generation would be worse off than their 
own that was real economic violence we have been there before 
and we must never go back again 
so i ask you women of america not just to support us work 
with us to ensure that this growth continues work with us so 
that each american has a chance and a choice work with us to 
change what needs to be changed 
the future belongs to our children and child care is one of 
those changes michael dukakis wants to march our kids lock step to 
a government institution where washington will set all the rules 
only one kind of child care deserves federal aid he says but 
governor people work parttime fulltime night shifts day 
shifts swing shifts one size does not fit all 
george bush a father of five a grandfather of 10 will give 
american parents what they want child care supervised by people 
who share their values in a communitybased setting a relatives 
or neighbors home a churchsponsored center or by the mother or 
father who works fulltime at home george bush believes the 
parents should choose 
but taking care of children also means making bad schools good 
and good schools better george bush and barbara bush too who has 
worked tirelessly to end illiteracy understand what we have to do 
we must rescue a generation of children from the social 
experiments and educational fads that gave us erratic school 
policies declining skills and low sat scores ronald reagan and 
george bush have reordered our educational priorities commitment 
to excellence will continue to be our watchword 
but education is more than molding the intellect it means 
shaping the character as well it is character that will enable our 
children to say yes to the intellectual challenges of a new 
century and no to the physical and moral dangers of drugs 
the war on drugs must be fought by the coast guard patrolling 
our waters and police officers in the alleys of our cities these 
brave men and women can win battles but george bush knows that 
ultimately the war can only be won when the fathers the mothers 
the sons and the daughters of america unite to speak with one voice 
to just say no 
nancy reagan saw this solution when most politicians didnt even 
see the problem what a great first lady she has been 
next spring marks the 200th anniversary of the first 
inauguration of a united states president there have been many 
changes in our nation since that day when george washington took 
the oath of office yet the values on which this great nation was 
founded are just as vital today as they were 200 years ago 
we would do well to remember the parting words of that first 
president who said of all the dispositions which lead to 
political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable the 
mere politician equally with the pious man ought to respect and 
cherish them 
what wise words from our first president 
it is reassuring in this day when we find faith and morality 
under attack to know that george bush is a man who truly respects 
and cherishes these guiding principles 
as we go forward to elect a new president let us then select a 
man who will keep faith with the timeless values on which this 
great nation was founded even as he leads our nation into a 
greater future 
tonight i am proud to be an american tonight i am proud to be 
a republican 
and tonight i am proud that a great man george bush will be 
our candidate for the next president of the united states 
thank you god bless you all

here is a transcript of the speech by 
president reagan to the republican national convention on monday 
night 
thank you thank you thank you all 
madam chairman delegates to this convention and fellow 
citizens thank you for that warm and generous welcome nancy and i 
have been enjoying the finest of southern hospitality since we 
arrived here yesterday 
and believe me after that reception i dont think the big easy 
has ever been bigger than it is tonight 
and with all due respect to cajun cuisine cooking and new 
orleans jazz nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the 
delegates in this hall except maybe a victory celebration on nov 
8 
in that spirit i think we could be forgiven if we give 
ourselves a little pat on the back for having made republican a 
proud word once again 
and america a proud nation again 
nancy and i are so honored to be your guest tonight to share a 
little of your special time and we thank you 
now i want to invoke executive privilege to talk for a moment 
about a very special lady who has been selfless not just for our 
party but for the entire nation she is a strong courageous and 
compassionate woman and wherever shes gone here in the united 
states as well as abroad whether with young or old or comforting 
the grieving or supporting the youngsters who are fighting the 
scourge of drugs she makes us proud ive been proud of her for a 
long time but never more so than in these last eight years with 
your tribute to nancy today you warmed my heart as well as hers 
and believe me she deserved your tribute 
i am deeply grateful to you for what you have done 
when people tell me that i became president on jan 20 1981 i 
feel i have to correct them you dont become president of the 
united states you are given temporary custody of an institution 
called the presidency which belongs to our people 
having temporary custody of this office has been for me a sacred 
trust and an honor beyond words or measure that trust began with 
many of you in this room many conventions ago 
manys the time that ive said a prayer of thanks to all 
americans who placed this trust in my hands and tonight please 
accept again our heartfelt gratitude nancys and mine for this 
special time that youve given in our lives 
just a moment ago you multiplied the honor with a moving 
tribute and being only human theres a part of me that would like 
to take credit for what we have achieved 
but tonight before we do anything else let us remember that 
tribute really belongs to 245 million citizens who make up the 
greatest and the first three words in the constitution we the 
people 
it is the american people who endured the great challenge of 
lifting us from the depths of national calamity renewing our 
mighty economic strength and leading the way to restoring our 
respect in the world they are an extraordinary breed we call 
americans 
so if there is any salute deserved tonight its to the heroes 
everywhere in this land who make up the doers the dreamers and 
the lifebuilders without which our glorious experiment in 
democracy would have failed 
so this this convention brings back so many memories for a 
fellow like me i can still remember my first republican 
convention abraham lincoln giving a speech that sent tingles down 
my spine no i have to confess i wasnt actually there the truth 
is way back then i belonged to the other party 
but surely we can remember another convention eight years ago 
we gathered in detroit in a troubled time for our beloved country

and we gathered solemnly to share our dreams 
and when i look back i wonder if we dared be so bold to take 
on those burdens 
but in that same city of detroit when the 2oth century was only 
in its second year another great republican teddy roosevelt told 
americans not to hold back from dangers ahead but to rejoice 
our hearts lifted with the faith that to us and to our 
children it shall be given to make this republic the mightiest 
among the peoples of mankind teddy said those years ago 
in 1980 we needed every bit of that kind of faith 
that year was our dream that together we could rescue america 
and make a new beginning to create anew that shining city on a 
hill the dream we shared was to reclaim our government to 
transform it from one that was consuming our prosperity into one 
that would get out of the way of those who created prosperity 
it was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to 
preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national 
destiny 
we made a determination that our dream would not be built on a 
foundation of sand something called trust me government but 
we would trust instead the american spirit 
and yes we were unashamed in believing that this dream was 
driven by a community of shared values of family work 
neighborhood peace and freedom 
and on the night of july l7 1980 we left with a mutual pledge 
to conduct a national crusade to make america great again 
we had faith because the heroes in our midst had never failed 
us before tom paine knew what these americans with character of 
steel could do when he wrote the harder the conflict the 
more glorious the triumph 
and my fellow citizens while our triumph is not yet complete 
the road has been glorious indeed eight years ago we met at a 
time when america was in economic chaos and today we meet in a 
time of economic promise we met then in international distress and 
today with global hope 
now i think we can be forgiven if we engage in a little review 
of that history tonight 
as the saying goes just a friendly reminder 
ive been doing a little remembering of my own because of all 
that inflated rhetoric by our friends in atlanta last month but 
then inflation is their specialty 
before we came to washington americans had just suffered the 
two worst backtoback years of inflation in 60 years those are 
the facts 
and as john adams said facts are stubborn things 
interest rates had jumped to over 21 percent the highest in 
120 years more than doubling the average monthly mortgage 
payments for working families our families 
when they sat around the kitchen table it was not to plan 
summer vacations it was to plan economic survival 
facts are stubborn things 
industrial production was down and productivity was down for 
two consecutive years the average missed me reagan responded to 
a sound the average weekly wage plunged 9 percent 
median family income fell 5 percent facts are stubborn things

that was our change 
so together we pulled out of a tailspin and created 17 million 
good jobs thats more than a quarter of a million new jobs a month 
every month for 68 consecutive months america is working 
again just and just since our 1984 convention we have created 
over 11 million of those new jobs now just why would our friends 
on the other side want to change that why do they think putting 
you out of work is better than putting you to work 
new homes are being built new car sales reached record levels 
exports are starting to climb again factory capacity is 
approaching maximum use you know ive noticed they dont call it 
reaganomics anymore 
as as for inflation well that too has changed we changed 
it from the time it hit 18 percent in 1980 down to between 3 and 
4 percent interest rates are less than half of what they were in 
fact in fact nearly half of all mortgages taken out on family 
homes in 1986 and more than a third of those in 1987 were actually 
old loans being refinanced at the new lower rates young families 
have finally been able to get some relief 
these too were our changes 
we rebuilt our armed forces we liberated grenada from the 
communists and helped return that island to democracy we we 
struck a firm blow against libyan terrorism weve seen the growth 
of democracy in 90 percent of latin america the soviets have begun 
to pull out of afghanistan the bloody iraniraq war is coming to 
an end and for the first time in eight years we have the prospects 
of peace in southwest africa and the removal of cuban and other 
foreign forces from the region and in the 2765 days of our 
administration not one inch of ground has fallen to the communists 
today crowd chants four more years today today 
crowd continues chant today today we have the first treaty in 
world history to eliminate an entire class of us and soviet 
nuclear missiles were working on the strategic defense initiative 
to defend ourselves and our allies against nuclear terror and 
american and soviet relations are the best theyve ever been since 
world war ii 
and virtually all this change occurred and continues to occur 
in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly 
proclaim that its time for a change they resisted our defense 
buildup they resisted our tax cuts they resisted cutting the fat 
out of government and they resisted our appointments of judges 
committed to the law and the constitution 
and its time for some more straight talk this time its about 
the budget deficit yes its much too high but the president 
doesnt vote for a budget and the president cant spend a dime 
only the congress can do that they blame they blame the defense 
increases for the deficit yet defense spending today in real 
dollars is almost exactly what it was six years ago in a sixyear 
period congress cut defense spending authority by over 125 
billion and for every 1 reduction in defense outlays they added 
2 to domestic spending now if they had passed my first budget 
my first spending plan in 1982 the cumulative outlays and deficits 
would have been 207 billion lower by 1986

every single year ive been in office i have supported and 
called for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution and the 
liberals have said no every year 
ive called for the lineitem veto which 43 governors have to 
cut fat in the budget and the liberals have said no 
every year i have attempted to limit their wild spending 
sprees and theyve said no 
they would have us believe that runaway budget deficits began in 
1981 when we took office well let me tell you something the 
fact is when they began their war on poverty in the middle 60s 
from 1965 through 1980 in just those 15 years the budgets 
increased to five times what they had been and the deficits went 
up to 52 times what they had been before their war on poverty 
now dont we know that if theyre elected their answer will 
be the one they have relied on in the past and that is higher 
taxes 
the other party has controlled crowd boos the other party 
has controlled the house of representatives for 52 out of the last 
56 years crowd boos again theyve controlled the senate also 
for 46 of those years crowd boos again where we really need a 
change is to elect republican majorities in both houses crowd 
cheers 
then and then george bush can have a team that will protect 
your tax cuts keep america strong hold down inflation and 
interest rates appoint judges to preserve your rights and yes 
reduce the budget deficit 
early in the first term we set out to reduce federal 
regulations that had been imposed on the people on business and 
on liberal and or local and state governments 
today im proud to say that we have eliminated so many 
unnecessary regulations that governmentrequired paperwork imposed 
on citizens businesses and other levels of government has been 
reduced by an estimated 600 million manhours of paperwork a year 
and george was there crowd chants four more years 
no you havent heard it all yet george bush headed up that 
task force that eliminated those regulations 
in 1980 and before it took seven weeks to get a social security 
card now it takes 10 days it only takes 10 days to get a 
passport it used to take 43 days it took 75 days to get an export 
license now its only 17 days and for some countries only five 
it took over 100 days to process a claim for a department of 
housing and urban development title i loan 100 days it now takes 
less than onefourth of that 22 days 
i think these specifics suggest there is a new level of 
competent management in the departments of our government 
george played a major role in everything that we have 
accomplished in these eight years 
now early on we had a foreign policy problem our nato allies 
were under the threat of soviet intermediaterange missiles and 
nato had no equivalent deterrent our effort to provide a deterrent 
pershing and groundlaunched cruise missiles on the nato line 
resulted in political problems for our nato allies 
there was objection on the part of many of their people to 
deployment of our missiles george represented us in brussels with 
the heads of the nato countries and they agreed when he finished 
to take the missiles this subsequently persuaded the soviets to 
sign the inf treaty and begin removing their ss20s 
none of our achievements happened by accident but only because 
we overcame liberal opposition to put our programs in place and 
without george bush to build on those policies everything weve 
achieved will be at risk all the work sacrifice and effort of the 
american people could end in the very same disaster that we 
inherited in 1981 
because i feel so strongly about the work that must continue and 
the need to protect our gains for the american family and for 
national security i want to share with you the qualities we should 
seek in the next president

we need someone whos big enough and experienced enough to 
handle tough and demanding negotiations with mr gorbachev 
because this is no time to gamble with onthejob training we need 
someone whos prepared to be president and who has the commitment 
to stand up for you against massive new taxes and who will keep 
alive the hope and promise that keeps our economy strong 
but it takes somebody whos this office from the inside who 
senses the danger points will be cool under fire and knows the 
range of answers when the tough questions come 
well thats the george bush that ive seen up close when the 
staff and cabinet members have closed the door and when the two of 
us are alone someone who is not afraid to speak his mind and who 
can cut to the core of an issue someone who never runs away from a 
fight never backs away from his beliefs and never makes excuses 
this office is not mine to give only you the people can do 
that but i love america too much and care too much about where we 
will be in the next few years i care that we give custody of this 
office to someone who will build on our changes not retreat to the 
past someone who will continue the change all of us fought for 
to preserve what we have and not risk losing it all america needs 
george bush and barbara bush as first lady 
crowd chants four more years all right 
with george bush ill know as we approach the new millenium 
our children will have a future secure with a nation at peace and 
protected against aggression well have a prosperity that spreads 
the blessings of our abundance and opportunity across all america 
well have safe and active neighborhoods drugfree schools that 
send our children soaring in the atmosphere of great ideas and deep 
values and a nation confidently willing to take its leadership 
into the uncharted reaches of a new age 
so george im in your corner im ready to volunteer a little 
advice now and then and offer a pointer or two on strategy if 
asked ill help keep the facts straight or just stand back and 
cheer but george just one personal request go out there and win 
one for the gipper 
as you can imagine im sorely tempted to spend the rest of this 
evening telling the truth about our friends who met in atlanta 
but then why should i have all the fun 
so for the next few moments lets talk about the future 
this is the last republican convention i will address as 
president maybe youll see your way to inviting me back sometime 
but like so many of us as i said earlier i started out in the 
other party but 40 years ago i cast my last vote as a democrat 
it was a party in which franklin delano roosevelt promised the 
return of power to the states it was a party where harry truman 
committed a strong and resolute america to preserving freedom 
fdr had run on a platform of eliminating useless boards and 
commissions and returning autonomy and authority to local 
governments and to the states 
that party changed and it will never be the same they left 
me i didnt leave them 
so it was our republican party that gave me a political home 
when i signed up for duty i didnt have to check my principles at 
the door and i soon found out that the desire for victory did not 
overcome our devotion to ideals

and what ideals those have been 
our party speaks for human freedom for the sweep of liberties 
that are at the core of our existence we do not shirk from our 
duties to preserve freedom so it can unfold across the world for 
yearning millions 
we believe that lasting peace comes only through strength and 
not through the good will of our adversaries 
we have a healthy skepticism of government checking its 
excesses at the same time we are willing to harness its energy when 
it helps improve the lives of our citizens 
we have pretty strong notions that higher tax receipts are no 
inherent right of the federal government we dont think that 
inflation and high interest rates show compassion for the poor the 
young and the elderly 
we respect the values that bind us together as families and as a 
nation 
for our children we dont think its wrong to have them 
committed to pledging each day to the one nation under god 
indivisible with liberty and justice for all 
and we have so many requirements in their classrooms why cant 
we at least have one thing that is voluntary and that is allow 
our kids to repair quietly to their faith to say a prayer to start 
the day as congress does 
for the unborn quite simply shouldnt they be able to live 
to become children in those classrooms 
those those are some of our principles you in this room and 
millions like you watching and listening tonight are selfless and 
dedicated to a better world based on these principles 
you arent quitters you walk not just precincts but for a 
cause you stand for something the finest warriors for free 
government that i have known nancy and i thank you for letting us 
be a part of your tireless determination to leave a better world 
for our children 
and thats why were here isnt it a better world 
i know ive said this before but i believe that god put this 
land between the two great oceans to be found by special people 
from every corner of the world who had that extra love of freedom 
that prompted them to leave their homeland and come to this land to 
make it a brilliant light beam of freedom to the world 
its our gift to have visions and i want to share that of a 
young boy who wrote to me shortly after i took office in his 
letter he said i love america because you can join cub scouts if 
you want to you have a right to worship as you please if you have 
the ability you can try to be anything you want to be and i also 
like america because we have about 200 flavors of ice cream 
truth truth through the eyes of a child freedom of 
association freedom of worship freedom of hope and opportunity 
and the pursuit of happiness in this case choosing among 200 
flavors of ice cream

thats america everyone with his or her vision of the american 
promise thats why were a magnet for the world for those who 
dodged bullets and gave their lives coming over the berlin wall and 
others only a few of whom avoided death coming in tiny boats on 
turbulent oceans 
this land its people the dreams that unfold here and the 
freedom to bring it all together well those are what make 
america soar up where you can see hope billowing in those freedom 
winds 
when our children turn the pages of our lives i hope theyll 
see that we had a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect 
as we could where theres decency tolerance generosity honesty 
courage common sense fairness and piety 
this is my vision and im grateful to god for blessing me with 
a good life and a long one but when i pack up my bags in 
washington dont expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about 
the twilight of my life 
twilight twilight not in america 
here its a sunrise every day fresh new opportunities dreams 
to build 
twilight thats not possible because i confess there are times 
when i feel like im still little dutch reagan racing my brother 
down the hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over 
the rock river 
you see theres no sweeter day than each new one because here 
in our country it means something wonderful can happen to you 
and something wonderful happened to me 
we lit a prairie fire a few years back those flames were fed by 
passionate ideas and convictions and we were determined to make 
them run burn i should say all across america 
and what times weve had together weve fought for causes we 
loved but we can never let the fire go out or quit the fight 
because the battle is never over our freedom must be defended over 
and over again and then again 
theres still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch fences 
that need repair and horses to ride 
but i want you to know that if the fires ever dim ill leave my 
phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot 
soldier just let me know and ill be there as long as words 
dont leave me and as long as this sweet country strives to be 
special during its shining moment on earth 
twilight you say 
listen to hg wells hg wells says the past is but the 
beginning of a beginning and all that is and has been is but the 
twilight of the dawn 
well thats a new day our sunlit new day to keep alive the 
fire so that when we look back at the time of choosing we can say 
that we did all that could be done 
never less 
thank you good night god bless you and god bless america

here are excerpts from the text of the speech 
by president reagan to the republican national convention on monday 
night 
nancy and i are so honored to be your guest tonight to share a 
little of your special time and we thank you 
eight years ago we gathered in detroit in a troubled time 
for our beloved country 
that year it was our dream that together we would rescue 
america and make a new beginning to create anew that shining city 
on a hill 
it was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to 
preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national 
destiny 
and on the night of july l7 1980 we left with a mutual pledge 
to conduct a national crusade to make america great again 
and my fellow citizens while our triumph is not yet complete 
the road has been glorious indeed 
before we came to washington americans had just suffered the 
two worst backtoback years of inflation in 60 years those are 
the facts 
and as john adams said facts are stubborn things 
when they sat around the kitchen table it was not to plan 
summer vacations it was to plan economic survival 
when we met in detroit in that summer of 1980 it was a summer 
of discontent for america around the world our national defense 
had been so weakened the soviet union had begun to engage in 
reckless aggression 
our embassy in pakistan was burned to the ground and the 
one in iran was stormed and occupied with all americans taken as 
hostages 
we rolled up our sleeves and went to work in january of 1981 we 
focused on hope not despair 
we said something shocking taxes ought to be reduced not 
raised 
we rebuilt our armed forces we liberated grenada from the 
communists and helped return that island to democracy we struck a 
firm blow against libyan terrorism weve seen the growth of 
democracy in 90 percent of latin america the soviets have begun to 
pull out of afghanistan the bloody iraniraq war is coming to an

none of our achievements happened by accident without george 
bush to build on those policies everything we have achieved will 
be at risk 
it will take someone who has seen this office from the inside 
who senses the danger points will be cool under fire and knows the 
range of answers when the tough questions come 
thats the george bush ive seen up close when the staff and 
cabinet members have closed the door and when the two of us are 
alone someone who never runs away from a fight never backs 
away from his beliefs and never makes excuses 
so george im in your corner im ready to volunteer a little 
advice now and then and offer a pointer or two on strategy if 
asked ill help keep the facts straight or just stand back and 
cheer but george just one personal request go out there and make 
it one more for the gipper 
when i pack up my bags in washington dont expect me to be 
happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life 
twilight not in america 
here its a sunrise every day fresh new opportunities dreams 
to build 
twilight thats not possible because i confess there are times 
when i feel like im still dutch reagan racing my brother down the 
hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over the rock 
river 
you see theres no sweeter day than each new one because here 
in our country it means something wonderful can happen to you 
and something wonderful happened to me 
we lit a prairie fire a few years back those flames were fed by 
passionate ideas and convictions and we were determined to make 
them burn all across america what times weve had 
together weve fought for causes we love but we can never let 
the fire go out or quit the fight because the battle is never 
over our freedom must be defended over and over again and then 
again 
theres still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch fences 
that need repair and horses to ride 
but i want you to know that if the fires ever dim ill leave my 
phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot 
soldier just let me know and ill be there as long as words 
dont leave me and as long as this sweet country strives to be 
special during its shining moment on earth 
twilight you say 
listen to hg wells the past is but the beginning of a 
beginning and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the 
dawn 
thats a new day a sunlit new day to keep alive the fire so 
that we may look back at the time of choosing we can say that we 
did all that could be done 
never less

universal pictures may have won a temporary 
financial victory with the last temptation of christ but the 
film could be costly to the studio in the longrun some 
fundamentalist religious leaders say 
the movie played to soldout crowds last week in seven us 
cities and two in canada taking in 44579 per screen for a 
threeday total of 401211 universal said 
were gratified at the response of the american people every 
show sold out were pleased universal president tom pollock 
said 
john krier of exhibitor relations co which surveys box office 
performance described the films debut as phenomenal this is a 
tremendous showing he said 
a movie in general release for example one shown on 1300 to 
1400 screens is really something if it takes in 7000 to 
8000 a screen krier said 
with all this free publicity of course they were full but 
the more the christian community sees this thing the angrier they 
will get the rev donald wildmon of the tupelo missbased 
american family association said monday 
the preacher is among several religious leaders who have labeled 
the film blasphemous and have urged urged a boycott of mca inc 
universals parent company 
theres no question that in round 1 the publicity that we 
generated created a lot of curiosity said tim penland who 
served as a religious consultant to universal but later resigned to 
protest the film 
it certainly appears we helped universal he said but he 
predicted the adverse publicity will ultimately burn universal 
there comes a point where the publicity becomes damaging 
wildmon agreed 
wildmon said the demonstrations which climaxed thursday with a 
march on universal studios by 25000 christians are over 
the next tactic will go beyond the boycott of universal films 
universal tours and appeals to mca shareholders he said adding he 
may disclose the next strategy later in the week 
christians are angry wildmon said they universal may 
realize shortterm profits but in the longterm they will hurt 
economically from this the anger is building and this isnt going 
to be forgotten in two weeks 
some conservative christians have denounced the movie for what 
they said was a blasphemous depiction of jesus who is portrayed as 
fantasizing about abandoning death on the cross to live as a man 
and raise a family with mary magdalene 
director martin scorsese a roman catholic has said the movie 
is a work of fiction and was not made with blasphemous intent

the executor of liberaces estate 
testified he did not know what was killing his famous client until 
told by a doctor after the entertainer had signed a new will 13 
days before his death 
the testimony by joel strote came at the close of a long bitter 
trial challenging the beverly hills calif attorneys role as 
executor of liberaces vast estate 
both sides rested their case monday after weeks of testimony 
that exposed the private life of the flamboyant entertainer who 
died feb 4 1987 of complications of aids 
closing arguments were scheduled for this afternoon in state 
district court it will then be up to judge michael wendell to 
determine whether strote should be removed as executor of the 
liberace estate and head of the liberace foundation 
i was told by dr ronald daniels after the will signing the 
condition that mr liberace had strote testified monday 
he did not elaborate on what he was told 
strote said liberace was very concerned about privacy as 
rumors surfaced months before his death that he was suffering from 
aids 
mr liberace didnt want anyone to know how sick he was 
strote said he said secrecy was a key when liberace was admitted 
to eisenhower hospital in palm springs calif in late january 
1987 for blood transfusions 
strote testified he had drawn up wills for liberace prior to the 
one that was drafted in midjanuary and signed by the entertainer 
jan 22 1987 that will left strote in charge of the estate 
under crossexamination the attorney testified the previous 
wills had precluded him from appointing himself as executor 
earlier monday an accountant testified that liberaces sister 
angie one of the five plaintiffs in the case has been paid nearly 
132000 since his death and has 511000 left in her trust account 
the testimony conflicted with that given last week by angie 
liberace 74 who described herself as penniless 
the sister and four former associates are seeking to have strote 
removed saying liberace was too ill to comprehend what he was 
doing when he signed the documents drafted by strote

biblical film epics were once a staple of 
hollywoods success formula but in recent years they havent had a 
prayer at the box office 
so judging from the phenomenal start of the last temptation of 
christ the controversy surrounding the film looks like manna 
from heaven for universal pictures 
straightforward religious films like westerns are failing to 
attract the viewers they did in the days of cecil b demilles 
the ten commandments william wylers ben hur and george 
stevens the greatest story ever told they garnered huge 
audiences in the 1950s and early 60s 
in 1985 king david a bigbudget saga starring richard 
gere bombed two years later the mission featuring robert 
deniro and themes strongly endorsed by christian leaders also 
flopped 
but director martin scorseses last temptation denounced as 
blasphemous by some christian leaders opened to packed houses last 
weekend it played in seven us cities and two in canada taking 
in 44579 per screen for a threeday total of 401211 a jubilant 
universal pictures reported 
i think if the mission came out 1012 years ago it would 
have received a larger general audience said tim penland 
president of penland productions specializing in the marketing of 
christian films had the film not been perceived as a religious 
epic it could have done better business 
part of the problem penland said is that todays moviegoers 
tend to avoid films that have overt religious messages 
another sign of the times evangelist billy graham is quietly 
retrenching from his effort to use film as a tool for spreading a 
spiritual message 
even as last temptation is drawing big crowds to see a story 
about a jesus plagued by human doubt graham is shutting down the 
burbank studios of his religious film production company 
considered the worlds largest 
our movie attendance has not been what hollywood would 
consider to be large said paul kurtz director of distribution 
and operations for grahams worldwide pictures inc 
worldwides burbank production studio was shut in may a move 
brought on by tight finances more than a dozen employees were laid 
off kurtz said only one employee remains in the offices 
kurtz added that some of the studios duties will be assumed at 
graham headquarters in minneapolis the burbank production site 
will soon be put up for sale and no plans for another worldwide 
feature film are in the offing 
worldwide instead will devote its filmmaking energies to 
lowbudget films for showings in churches prisons and nursing 
homes kurtz said 
started in the 1950s worldwide was envisioned by graham as a 
modern proselytizing tool 
the idea sometimes worked 
worldwides the hiding place a 1975 inspirational movie on 
dutch christians sheltering jews in world war ii did respectable 
business and received satisfactory reviews 
but caught a 1987 worldwide release about a boy looking for 
lifes answers in amsterdam was a commericial failure and was 
panned the film starring jill ireland stopped at us theaters 
only briefly and is scheduled for an october release in canada 
worldwides dwindling fortunes are not isolated 
going to see a religious film is not high on anybodys list 
especially when you see how many films are out there for theatrical 
release penland said no matter how much they worldwide 
tried to hide it audiences saw their films as extensions of billy 
graham 
i think weve reached a period in religious filmmaking where 
to attract an audience we have to have mainstream appeal

as ronald reagan urged george bush to win 
one for the gipper in november joe unangst raised his sweating 
beer can with an aging athletes bravado 
punchline unangst yelled toward a television at mothers a 
50yearold eatery at tchoupitoulas and poydras streets that 
proclaims the coldest beer and the worlds best baked ham 
he took a long loud sip then professed gridiron kinship with 
the former eureka college player whose exhortation to bush mimicked 
a line from one his movies 
i played football too unangst said touchdown great 
speech 
mothers is about a dozen blocks from the louisiana superdome 
where reagans emotional farewell was cheered monday night by 
delegates to the republican national convention 
the fuzzy presidential image came from a small television set 
rigged high on a wall between a velvet toy elephant head and a sign 
that warned caution men drinking 
reagans goodbye played to a nearempty house at mothers 
because all the republicans are still up the street said owner 
jerry amato 
amato was braced for a crush of convention visitors after the 
nightly session ended cooks popped pans of biscuits into the oven 
and chopped vegetables for the anticipated late diners 
for now amato could relax at a table near the front door 
puffing a long brown cigar and philosophizing about politics 
me im not political not in the party sense i vote this 
way or that way ill just walk in the booth and pull the lever 
maybe republican maybe for the democrats he said 
but i dont mind watching the speech although weve been 
seeing nothing but republicans amato said with a laugh 
besides theres really nothing else on television 
a beer and reagan what could be more fun than this said

a former marine who saw pacific combat in world war ii he 
confessed to emotional twinges every time reagan talks patriotism 
same thing tonight said landry 64 its very touching 
it goes right through me it makes me proud to be an american 
how will he vote 
it was the democrats that sent me to war not the republicans 
but who knows ill decide election day landry said

aint misbehavin is back on broadway with 
the same bright cast and even more uninhibited gusto than it had 10 
years ago 
the revue of songs that fats waller composed or turned into hit 
records opened at the ambassador theater on monday night its 
infectious highenergy spirited entertainment 
the bright cast of five singers their movements by 
choreographer arthur faria carefully rehearsed give the show a 
real team feeling but like a decade ago its nell carter with 
her ethel mermanlike vocal attack whos the homerun hitter 
when she sings ow to start ive got a feeling im 
falling its with the sharp surprise of someone whos just been 
stuck with a pin the audience breathes out in delighted response 
she also stopped the show with her brash cash for your trash 
and vulnerable mean to me 
the singers look like theyre having fun theres a mischievous 
sexiness to armelia mcqueens giggly singing of wallers squeeze 
me and to ken page and miss carters rendition of honeysuckle 
rose 
charlaine woodard chooses sweet demure vocal delivery for 
keepin out of mischief now as the other two women appear to 
have lost no weight in 10 years miss woodard seems not to have 
gained any 
page who was old deutertonomy in the original broadway cast of 
cats makes the most of the jolliest of the novelty songs 
your feets too big singerdancer andre de shields is snakily 
sinuous in the vipers drag 
luther henderson who did the musical arrangements when aint 
misbehavin started at the offbroadway manhattan theater club 
and was the first pianist on broadway played onstage piano six 
other musicians were across the back of the stage 
thomas fats waller stride pianist composer singer and 
movie performer was born in harlem in 1904 and died on an 
eastbound train from los angeles in 1943 richard maltby jr 
directed the show of his music and the shubert organization 
emanuel azenberg dasha epstein and roger berlind produced 
aint misbehavin won a tony award in 1978 as best musical 
and ran for three years the original singers stayed in it for nine 
months this time they spent two months on the road and came to 
broadway for a limited engagement through november 
delights of aint misbehavin arent confined to solos 
theres the brassy nearly naughty find out what they like by 
miss mcqueen and miss carter the shim sham danced by the three 
women the ensembles lounging at the waldorf and the joint 
is jumpin it sure is 
in other reviews 
howard kissel of the daily news wrote that this revival lacks 
the restraint of the original production this time the show 
seems less an ensemble performance more like a series of star 
turns 
even with its lapses aint misbehavin is for sheer 
entertainment the best value on broadway 
in the new york times frank rich wrote aint misbehavin 
is so torrid that it may be the only place in town where you feel 
happy to be hot 
whats even more impressive about the revival is how little it 
seems like a rehash the original on and off stage artists have 
returned not only in force but in high gear as well 
the new york posts marilyn stasio called it a bonafide 
recreation of the spirit and the artistry that made the show such a 
joy the first time around

rebels exploded in a crowd of officegoers in the eastern port city

their way to work said officials at colombos military command

the explosion occurred at the citys busy clock tower area 
where many government employees disembark from city buses the 
officials said 
most of the government employees reporting for work in the city 
belong to the sinhalese community tamils refused to work for the

community in the city on july 21 
last week authorities ordered all employees to report to work 
and promised them maximum protection but the rebels challenged the 
order and warned government staff against complying 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people but 
are in a majority in the islands north and east tamil radicals

prime minister noboru takeshita has sent a letter 
to black us lawmakers expressing regret for a japanese 
politicians degrading remarks about american blacks a foreign 
ministry official said today 
takeshita said in a letter to rep mervyn dymally chairman of 
the congressional black caucus that he was saddened that a 
recent event has hurt our friends in the united states according 
to the ministry official who read excerpts of the letter 
it is regrettable a misunderstanding arose takeshita wrote 
adding that there is no justification for racial discrimination 
i hope to make the partnership between our two countries even 
stronger takeshita wrote america is a great country made up 
of numerous ethnic groups and i want to work hard to heighten 
japanese peoples awareness of this 
the letter was delivered friday to dymally dcalif through 
the us embassy in tokyo 
takeshitas message was sparked by a letter from dymally 
complaining of remarks by michio watanabe policy chief of the 
governing liberal democratic party and calling on the prime 
minister to clarify japans position toward us minorities 
watanabe said at a liberal democratic party seminar last month 
that american blacks have few qualms about going bankrupt and 
implied they walk away from their debts 
he quickly apologized for his comments but anger built up in 
the us congress and public over what were seen as racist remarks 
two years ago then prime minister yasuhiro nakasone stirred a 
similar controversy when he said the overall us intelligence rate 
was brought down by the large numbers of blacks mexicans and 
puerto ricans living in the country 
nakasone later apologized for his comments

mikhail gorbachevs policy of glasnost is 
just a gimmick in the eyes of an armenian activist who was expelled 
from the soviet union 
paruyr ayrikyan called the policy of openness cosmetics and 
an enterprise to make the soviet union look nicer than it is 
in general there is still a oneparty system 
and he vowed to stay in the united states to rally support for 
his cause until he can return home 
ayrikyan was stripped of his soviet citizenship and expelled 
from the country on july 21 last week a highranking soviet legal 
official said ayrikyans appeal to be readmitted filed at the 
soviet consulate in paris was not being taken seriously 
in an interview here monday ayrikyan said he does not expect to 
be allowed to return home soon he denounced the terms of his 
ejection and vowed to ask governments and private groups for 
financial and political support for armenian rights in the soviet 
union 
the 39yearold former translator said he would ask congress for 
money to maintain an office and cover printing costs and seek to 
bring us pressure on soviet officials 
the soviet government respects only a position of strength 
he said speaking through an interpreter 
as for his own case he said he has written a letter asking us 
officials to raise this question on an international level 
particularly at the international conference on human rights in 
geneva and in your meetings with the ussr so that this illegal 
decision will be overturned and that i will be allowed the 
right to return to the ussr 
ayrikyan said he would be soviet armenians representative in 
the united states and hoped to regularly communicate with the 
government in such a capacity although he said he did not expect 
to be formally recognized as a diplomat de facto i am in such a 
position 
the armenian activist was arrested in march for his part in 
spreading word to western journalists about the armenian campaign 
to have a mostly armenian region of the neighboring soviet republic 
of azerbaijan made part of soviet armenia 
ethnic rioting killed at least 35 people in azerbaijan after 
armenians launched the annexation campaign in february 
although ayrikyan was not a leader of the uprising he has been 
a subject of popular support and after his arrest many 
demonstrators made his release one of their demands 
ayrikyan said that within the week he would move to los angeles 
asked why he thought he was forced into exile he said they 
were planning to try me and they realized it was impossible because 
of broad public support for me they realized they couldnt try me 
they couldnt release me so they decided to exile me

the networks felt used abused and manipulated 
by george bushs vice presidential mystery tour but they found it 
far more interesting than most of what went on at the republican 
national convention on monday night 
when dealing with another piece of manipulated media a 
laudatory film about president reagan the networks found it easy 
to turn away cbs and abc chopped up the film into news reports 
while nbc filled the time with a taped interview of nancy reagan 
and belatedly tuned in for the end of the film 
vice presidential trial balloons filled the airwaves monday 
night as likely candidates traipsed through the network booths or 
were tracked down by floor reporters 
no one seemed more unhappy about this than the abc crew which 
vigorously pursued vicepresidential speculation and selfpromotion 
for almost all of the first hour 
the point of the vicepresidential secret as the bush campaign 
freely admits is to hype tv ratings and to do that by keeping 
us talking about the running mate so far it seems to be working 
reporter brit hume complained earlier in the evening on abcs 
world news tonight 
in other words brit an exercise in manipulating the media 
anchor peter jennings said 
indeed peter and i have to say i think we are being 
manipulated hume said 
and as david letterman says we all know how painful that can 
be 
cbs anchor dan rather made the same point in passing calling 
the vice presidential secret the orchestrated manipulated 
mystery of this convention 
nbc opened its primetime coverage with an interview of sen dan 
quayle of indiana while cbs started with a report from diane 
sawyer that the big announcement might come wednesday instead of 
thursday as promised 
nbc grilled sen pete domenici of new mexico who then turned 
around and chatted with cbs 
if elizabeth dole has hopes for the vicepresidential 
nomination she didnt get much help only cbs tuned in on her 
speech to the convention but all three networks welcomed her 
husband sen bob dole into their booths to boost his candidacy 
nbcs tom brokaw noted later in the evening that dole seemed to 
have shot himself in the foot by complaining to home state 
reporters that bushs selection process was demeaning 
rep jack kemp managed to get his speech on abc and nbc while 
cbs filled that time talking to sen gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire about why he wanted kemp to be the vice presidential 
nominee 
nbcs john chancellor added some puzzling background to this 
media flurry both jimmy carter in 1976 and ronald reagan in 1980 
waited until the last day to pick their running mates chancellor 
said and they won while walter mondale announced his choice in 
advance and lost 
the pursuit of the big tease reached comic proportions when bush

thousands of peasant adults and children 
forced to drink dirty water because of widespread flooding are 
expected to die of waterborne epidemics a un health official 
says 
incidents of malaria typhoid and cholera have been on the rise 
since flooding earlier this month left 15 million people homeless 
dr nicholas ward a world health organization adviser on diarrheal 
diseases and immunization said monday 
if some infected person is passing cholera into the water that 
his community drinks every person in that community can get very 
sick very quickly he told reporters at who offices in khartoum 
ward predicted 400000 people most of them under age 5 will 
develop diarrhea and other gastrointestinal diseases and 4000 of 
them will die 
left untreated as many as 40000 people could perish said 
ward who came to sudan from his base in north yemen to help 
coordinate the governments response to the health crisis 
the government has recruited 300 extra doctors and medical 
students for about 120 emergency clinics and increase staff at 127 
alreadyexisting health units he said 
nongovernmental relief organizations including the sudanese 
red crescent the sudanese council of churches and the islamic arab 
relief agency also have organized dozens of health clinics in 
squatter camps ringing khartoum 
the sprawling settlements of mud huts and papyrus and burlap 
leantos were hardest hit by the deluge that destroyed 167000 
homes and killed at least 58 people according to government 
figures 
the more than 500000 people living in the camps mostly 
peasants who fled drought and civil war in southern sudan also 
are threatened by epidemic 
the government seeking to discourage the settlements forbids 
squatters to dig wells consequently they must either beg for 
water or buy it from people who transport it from the distant nile 
river on donkeydrawn carts 
since the floods the price of water has soared to as much as 5 
per 13gallon jug 10 times its value before the deluge 
those unable to pay the price have been forced to drink water 
from the huge brackish pools left behind by the rainstorm and 
contaminated by excreta floating up from swamped pit latrines 
dr afaf ahmed yahya health coordinator for the red crescent 
said the organizations 23 health clinics each have been reporting 
150 or more cases of diarrhea and gastrointestinal diseases a day 
since the floods 
diarrhea kills the young and the weak through dehydration and 
rehydration salts are the main therapy given patients she said 
but if you want to rehydrate people you have to provide clean 
water yahya said 
nearly 100 cargo planes carrying emergency aid including water 
tanks have arrived since the floods but distribution of relief 
supplies has been slow 
nongovernment agencies this weekend began distributing tents 
blankets food and other supplies but most of the needy have yet 
to be reached 
in geneva the international red cross said relief efforts are 
being expanded to cover 200000 people and appealed for further 
donations of emergency supplies 
more than 100 tons of supplies have been airlifted into 
khartoum and international donors have contributed about 950000 
following an aug 9 appeal by the red cross 
many roads were made impassable by the rains and some 
settlements left isolated and unreachable by huge lakes of 
kneehigh water 
the lack of telecommunications knocked out by the rains further 
hampers coordination of the relief effort 
while the sun steadily evaporates the remaining vast pools more 
rains have been forecast into september posing a further threat to 
the swollen nile already dangerously brimming near street level in 
khartoum

prime minister margaret thatchers government 
plans new laws to stop banks from handling funds of the ira 
protestant paramilitaries and other guerrilla groups in northern 
ireland 
the government also intends to set up a special force to combat 
guerrilla racketeering in the strifetorn british province 
the plans were outlined in a letter mrs thatcher sent to the 
rev martin smyth a legislator from the provinces largest 
protestant party the official unionists her 10 downing st office 
made the contents of the letter available to reporters on monday 
mrs thatcher said in the letter that planned statutes will 
prohibit banks other financial institutions accountants and 
financial advisers from handling the funds of guerrilla groups and 
empower the government to seize the assets of convicted guerrillas 
the letter says the government also plans to set up a special 
force to combat extortion and fundraising rackets by the mainly 
roman catholic irish republican army and rival protestant 
organizations it described the planned new force as a 
purposedesigned administrative antiracketeering body 
british press reports said the new force will involve customs 
and tax officers and the department of social security 
the republic of ireland passed legislation in 1985 enabling the 
dublin government to seize money suspected of being used by the 
ira which is outlawed on both sides of the irish border 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland it 
wants to unite the predominantly protestant province with the 
overwhelmingly catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule 
mrs thatchers letter was in response to complaints by smyth 
that her government wasnt taking tough enough measures to combat 
the ira and other outlawed organizations 
racketeering is widespread in northern ireland 
the british news and current affairs magazine the listener this 
year said protection rackets on construction sites in northern 
ireland plus cash collected from stores bars taxis and clubs 
netted guerrillas on both sides of the sectarian divide an 
estimated 51 million a year 
it said 95 percent of construction sites in the provinces 
capital belfast are involved in protection rackets it said the 
standard charge per site demanded by racketeers is an initial 
5100 plus up to 680 a week

a federal bankruptcy judge ordered 108yearold 
bishop college closed after it failed to come up with the 185 
million needed to cover its 198889 deficit 
judge robert c mcguire on monday ordered bishops 16monthold 
reorganization under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
coverted to chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy 
school officials agreed but reserved the right to move the case 
back to chapter 11 if 2 million could be raised quickly 
despite frantic fundraising efforts during the past year 
including tshirt sales outside the federal courthouse monday 
afternoon officials of the predominantly black school failed to 
get the funds mcguire said was needed by the hearing 
bishops attorney glover roberts said the schools best hope 
was financial and administrative support of local business leaders 
i think there are some discussions going on along those 
lines roberts said but added he didnt know who if anyone 
would come forward with the money 
you have an institution that has a particular kind of heritage 
and that has done a particular kind of job in preparing for 
participation in the culture that has been lost said rev 
william shaw chairman of bishops board of trustees 
bishop with academic specialties in religion and education was 
the only predominantly black school in dallas 
i think there is a real need for bishop college in the dallas 
area mayor annette strauss said i hope it can be reorganized 
at a later time its a good school it serves a good purpose 
security guards monday evening turned away visitors to the 
schools unmowed boardedup campus 
george mcelreath the federal bankruptcy trustee overseeing the 
case said attorneys told him this weekend that donations had 
increased to about 7000 per day during the past few weeks but 
thats not enough 
after the southern association of colleges and schools revoked 
the colleges accreditation because of the financial difficulties 
bishop officials filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
april 1987 bishop had since tried to pay off an estimated 18 
million in debts 
the college was founded in marshall in 1881 and moved to dallas 
in 1961 it has been troubled by financial problems and declining 
enrollment for a decade 
enrollment peaked at 1500 in 1967 and dropped to about 300 
students last spring 
its a sad day bishop senior wayne e croomes said i was 
hoping something positive would come out of it its time for me to 
move on go to another school

throwing exclusive parties at exotic 
locations during the republican national convention means forking 
over a bankroll before the good times can roll 
for example it costs 5000 to rent the new orleans museum of 
art for two hours but dont use that r word around mary liz 
keevers 
we prefer to say donation instead of rent said ms 
keevers spokeswoman for the 1912 museum scene of elaborate bashes 
during the fourday convention 
food drinks and entertainment are extra 
museum donors on monday were the eagle forum a conservative 
group headed by activist phyllis schlafly and the republican 
senatorial inner circle whose membership fee is a 1000 
contribution to elect gop senators 
todays museum agenda included a reception and banquet for the 
conservative victory committee chaired by former delaware gov 
pete du pont 
women in frilly hoop skirts greeted eagle forum guests who 
hailed republican celebrities such as rep jack kemp of new york 
former united nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick and former 
federal judge robert bork an unsuccessful nominee for the supreme 
court 
the vips were presented with fourfaced clocks which mrs 
schlafly said would keep them on time as they travel crosscountry 
in support of the partys ticket 
later in the evening the senatorial shindig provided masks of 
purple green and gold the officials colors of mardi gras for 
about 1000 guests some in colorful costumes 
the ladies get a kick out of these washingtonbased party 
consultant wendy pangburn said as she distributed the masks the 
men seem to try to put them in their pockets 
arriving dignitaries were met by an 18foothigh trailermounted 
king kong that customarily travels in mardi gras parades next to 
it was a 12foot cartoon alligator on wheels wearing a red necktie 
and holding appropriately a money bag 
four elephant float decorations flanked the wide marble entrance 
steps a pair of beefeater mannequins also borrowed from a float 
were silent sentries next to red and white striped guardhouses 
inside workers trimmed a sweeping central staircase dominated 
by a portrait of marie antoinette to fit the mardi gras theme 
caterer brian huber fretted that delegates might burn out on 
plentiful creole and cajun food and theyve only been here a 
couple of days so im changing tonights menu he said 
out with gumbo and jambalaya hubers panache caterers prepared 
stirfried chicken and peanuts pasta topped with spicy ham and 
fried pork rinds 
he swore pork skins were on the menu before vice president 
george bush declared they were a favorite snack but we are 
serving more of them huber said 
hubers company is catering for 14000 people during five days 
tonights a slow evening only 1500 to cook for he said 
but dont ask about price if i said how much id be killed 
huber said but this senatorial thing is a relatively elaborate 
party and i cant say we are doing any lowbudget ones

more than 10000 people came to st john 
neumann catholic church hoping for a miracle and after a dramatic 
evening mass during the feast of the assumption most werent 
disappointed 
shortly after mondays mass began some worshipers gasped and 
pointed skyward others looked and began shouting its jesus 
look 
as the excitement brought the mass to a halt scores of pilgrims 
cried and applauded claiming to see apparitions of jesus and the 
virgin mary 
i knew there would be a miracle i just knew it said mamie 
fertitta of beaumont crying and pointing to the sky 
she said the saw the sun pulsating and then saw jesus 
a dozen priests standing on a rooftop altar and 600 eucharist 
ministers turned their backs to the crowd to look at the sky and 
wave after minutes of silence the pastor monsignor joseph james 
facing the west where people were pointing began to sing amazing 
grace 
people in the audience whipped out cameras to photograph the 
clouds and light 
paula mitchell 13 of dallas said she saw jesus and mary as 
the sun burst through the clouds 
jesus had a grayishwhite beard and hes got some kind of cape 
on marys wearing a crown she said 
i saw baby jesus for an instant in the sky said koreth 
vargahese of houston 
for the estimated 12000 people the pilgrimage was prompted by 
reports that a miracle would occur on mondays feast of the 
assumption the day catholics celebrate marys assumption into 
heaven 
the charismatic parish has been the focus of national attention 
after three parishioners began reporting receiving messages of 
peace and hope from the virgin mary this spring 
while many cried and pointed skyward not everyone saw an 
apparition in the sky 
i didnt see anything but some of the other priests did 
said deacon joe richard 
before the mass thousands streamed onto the church grounds 
despite temperatures in the high 90s as busloads brought pilgrims 
from around the country 
many of the worshipers were handicapped who came seeking 
healing 
rosaries were said throughout the day in spanish english 
french portuguese and vietnamese 
lubbock bishop michael sheehan had originally planned to preside 
over the feast day mass but decided not to following the publicity 
about the messages he has urged people to treat the messages with 
caution and has not endorsed the happenings at the church

potential vice presidential choices and their vendor keeps a 
running tally of his sales displaying a bar chart on a computer

has spent hours preparing for her primetime speech written to be 
delivered in two minutes and 13 seconds 
is that precise or what she said after a morning briefing 
at the louisiana superdome whoever planned all this really did 
their homework they had everything mapped out right down to the 
colors i wear 
her height and the strength of her voice were also matters of 
utmost importance to convention planners and she received

the leader of a breakaway baptist church 
says his new congregation is the first of what will be a growing 
split between moderate and fundamentalist southern baptists 
we have taken the first step the rev bill jenkins said 
we are the first church aligned with the southern baptist 
alliance that is not a part of the southern baptist convention 
alan neely executive director of the southern baptist alliance 
and a professor at southeastern baptist theological seminary in 
wake forest nc also said jenkins may be the first us case of 
a pastor making a public break because of recent denominational 
events 
the southern baptist alliance is a national group made up 
primarily of moderate baptists moderate members have dissented 
publicly against the denominations fundamentalist leaders the 
southern baptist convention is the denominational unit that manages 
the educational and missions programs of about 36000 churches it 
is the nations largest protestant denomination and has an 
estimated 15 million members 
jenkins resigned as pastor of biloxis bay vista baptist church 
last month because of policy disagreements with southern baptist 
convention leadership 
he said about a dozen southern baptist families met for services 
in a rented gulfport hall last week 
each southern baptist church operates autonomously but the 
churches finance national programs through the conventions boards 
and agencies 
since 1979 fundamentalistbacked candidates have been elected 
president of the convention they have the power to influence the 
appointment of trustees to convention boards and agencies 
the new congregation called alliance baptist church will issue 
papers on theology and other church matters 
the basic question is this will the real baptist please stand 
up i believe that i am a real traditional baptist said jenkins 
jenkins said his key points of disagreement with the southern 
baptist convention include inerrancy or the literal interpretation 
of the bible

the khmer rouge the largest guerrilla 
group fighting the vietnamese in cambodia has declared support for 
international guarantees to prevent it from abusing other groups in 
postwar cambodia 
in a peace proposal the movement that ruled cambodia in a 
threeyear reign of terror until vietnam invaded a decade ago even 
suggested it would reduce its army to the level of other factions 
as part of a political settlement 
the proposal dated monday and signed by nominal leader khieu 
samphan was broadcast over khmer rouge radio that day a text was 
obtained today from a western embassy in bangkok 
the proposal was the groups most direct unequivocal response 
to widespread concerns that it may try to return to power once a 
settlement to the nearly decadeold war is reached it appeared to 
put the khmer rouges public position in line with views of its 
guerrilla partners and the asian and western nations that back the 
guerrillas 
during its rule the khmer rouge massacred hundreds of thousands 
of people and devastated society and culture as leader pol pot 
tried to impose radical communal agrarianism 
fears of its return have recently been fueled by vietnams 
announced plans to withdraw some 50000 troops or half its force 
in cambodia by the end of the year and its pledge of a total 
pullout by early 1990 
some diplomats say the khmer rouge which fields some 35000 
guerrillas is storing arms for an allout offensive in 1990 
the khmer rouge proposal said that after a political settlement 
is agreed to an international conference should be convened to 
find measures to guarantee the agreement and cambodias 
independence neutrality and territorial integrity 
it said the conference should be attended by countries involved 
in the conflict the united nations secretarygeneral and the 
permanent members of the un security council china france 
great britain the soviet union and the united states 
the security council members should guarantee the agreement it 
said 
the proposal said the conference should set up an international 
body under either the united nations or other international 
committees and adopt measures agreed upon by all four cambodian 
parties and countries attending the international conference to 
ensure that the khmer rouge does not abuse other parties and that 
other cambodian parties do not abuse one another and at the same 
time to ensure that vietnam cannot return to commit aggression 
against cambodia 
the four cambodian parties are the vietnameseinstalled 
government in cambodia and the khmer rouge and its noncommunist 
partners in a guerrilla coalition government the forces of prince 
norodom sihanouk and of son sann 
the proposal said that in the last phase of a vietnamese 
withdrawal both the resistance government and cambodias 
provietnamese government should be dissolved simultaneously 
a provisional fourparty government headed by sihanouk then 
would be formed to organize elections for a new government it said 
the armies of the four factions would be put in garrisons under 
the control and supervision of a fourparty cambodian committee and 
international auspices 
the khmer rouge army is by far the most powerful of the four 
factions 
in the preliminary stage a fourparty cambodian army should 
be set up with each party having equal strength under a fourparty 
high command the proposal said 
in accordance with cambodias constitution promulgated by the 
constitutional assembly a single national army should be 
restored 
the khmer rouge has been increasingly diplomatically isolated in 
recent months and parties attending unprecedented multilateral 
peace talks last month in indonesia agreed the withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops must be linked with measures to prevent the 
return of khmer rouge practices 
cambodias provietnamese government called at the talks for 
elimination of the khmer rouges top leadership and dissolution 
of its army at the talks the khmer rouge clashed bitterly with 
the government and with vietnam 
also attending the talks were the other guerrilla groups and 
the association of southeast asian nations which has only recently 
unequivocally stated that while it backed the guerrillas it 
favored measures to ensure the khmer rouge does not return to 
power asean groups thailand malaysia indonesia the philippines 
singapore and brunei 
china the khmer rouges strongest supporter and main source of 
arms stated for the first time recently that it did not favor the 
groups dominance in cambodia

the director of the countrys largest zoo denies 
a chinese newspaper report that inflation has stopped his tigers 
from eating live chicken and his elephants from munching bananas 
beijing zoo director feng youlian was quoted in tuesdays 
edition of the guangming daily as saying his animals have never 
known hunger 
he criticized an aug 8 report in the official englishlanguage 
china daily that said the 3000 animals birds and fish at the zoo 
have fallen on lean days because of inadequate funding and sharp 
rises in food prices 
the china daily report said elephants were forced to eat carrots 
instead of their favorite bananas and it said tigers lions and 
other carnivores were once treated twice weekly to a live chicken 
now feast on such delicacies only when they are sick 
even during the three difficult years our animals have 
never known hunger feng said referring to a famine that hit 
china from 1960 to 1963 
many animals at the zoo are presents from heads of foreign 
countries and some are rare animals on the brink of extinction 
he was quoted as saying as a result we can cut down on other 
things but one thing that wont drop is the amount we spend on the 
animals food 
inflation could affect some capital construction projects 
feng said but never the stomachs of our beasts 
feng said the zoo received 176000 from the government for 
nonstaple foods in 1985 that figure jumped to 189000 in 1987 
he said that since 1965 the goverments subsidy to the zoo has 
grown 12 times although the number of animals has only doubled 
in addition he added the zoos entrance fee of 10 fen less 
than a nickel has not been raised in 38 years 
china is currently facing its highest inflation since 1949 when 
the communist government was established prices in june of this 
year were 19 percent higher than they were in the same period last 
year 
nonstaple food items such as vegetables fish and meat have 
increased the most some by as much as 60 percent over the past 
year 
feng acknowledged that the china daily report was correct in 
saying that tigers lions and other big cats were forced to fast 
one day a week but he said that policy has been in effect since 
1954 
their stomach capacity is very large zoo worker zhang gaopu 
told the guangming daily they can go without eating for several 
days 
feng also acknowledged that lately the zoo has been substituting 
cheaper items for more expensive ones to save money 
but he said if the more expensive food is the favorite food 
of the animal then we will guarantee that food no matter what the 
cost

like her son george dorothy walker bush 
shies from the intense media scrutiny that would throw her private 
life open to public examination and dissection 
the 87yearold mrs bush has a longstanding policy against 
interviews and even the vice presidents plan to show off his 
large clan at the republican national convention hasnt changed her 
mind 
she will be here this week she wont be giving interviews 
said catherine holt a member of the bush campaign staff 
nevertheless insights into the personality of the likely gop 
nominees mother can be found in recent comments and past articles 
written by none other than george bush 
every mother has her own style my mothers was a little like 
an army drill sergeants the vice president wrote in a may 1985 
mothers day article for the greenwich conn time 
she had five of us to raise pres prescott myself nancy 
john and bucky william and she just felt strongly that there 
was too much for us to learn and to do to waste any time on chaos 
so we had very little chaos around our house bush said 
a widow since the 1972 death of her husband prescott bush sr 
mrs bush lives in greenwich the wealthy new york city suburb 
where son george attended schools as a youngster 
in the article bush recalled the childhood tennis lessons given 
by his mother 
i can hear her now you can do it youll get it youll get 
it and she would be patient and tireless and always absolutely 
sure we would eventually get it 
she also tamed our arrogance ill never forget years ago 
saying rather innocently i thought i was off my game mother 
jumped all over me you are just learning you dont have a 
game bush wrote 
recently in a cbs news interview the vice president was asked 
which of his mothers qualities he tries to emulate 
gentleness caring sharing bush responded she tried to 
instill in us through example not through lecturing a certain 
kindness concern for the other guy fairness is a word i think 
competitive tough i mean she could whip anybody in 
anything he said 
if bush succeeds in defeating democratic nominee michael 
dukakis mrs bush would be the 12th mother to see her son sworn in 
as president the first since january 1977 when lillian carter 
witnessed her son jimmys inauguration 
miss lillian became a celebrity in her own right in the carter 
years that is not expected to happen with dorothy bush

one of the surest ways to end up in a 
deadend job in the fbi is to be a spanishspeaking hispanic 
according to agents testifying in a discrimination suit against the 
agency 
i think the ability to speak spanish in the fbi is a 
tremendous liability special agent julian perez testified monday 
before us district judge lucius bunton 
the 311 agents who have joined the classaction lawsuit contend 
the fbi discriminates against hispanics in hiring promotion and 
discipline the agents want damages and a change in fbi promotion 
practices 
the nonjury trial is expected to last two weeks with up to 100 
witnesses expected to testify 
three hispanic agents who testified monday described the fbi as 
an organization that shunts spanish speakers into relatively menial 
tasks as it promotes people who complete investigations and make 
important arrests 
what happens as a spanishspeaking agent is you might 
initiate an investigation and have it going pretty well but youre 
pulled off perez testified that usually happens because the 
hispanic agents are put on a temporary assignment requiring 
spanish he said 
other agents who complete such investigations begun by hispanic 
agents end up getting the credit perez said 
nonhispanic agents who speak spanish dont have to deal with 
the same problems the agents testified 
the lawsuit was filed in january 1987 by bernardo matt 
perez assistant special agent in charge at the el paso office 
from 1979 to 1982 matt perez worked at the san juan puerto rico 
office a bureau considered an undesirable assignment because of 
the islands high crime rate and isolation 
the agents charged that hispanics are routinely transferred to 
puerto rico sometimes punitively 
fbi personnel director david rarity jr testified that the 
agency does not discriminate against hispanics and said more 
hispanic agents are transferred to puerto rico because they are 
more likely to speak spanish 
felipe frocht a special agent in san jose calif said his 
association with the lawsuit has prompted superiors to threaten to 
transfer him to puerto rico 
puerto rico supervisory special agent armando lara testified 
that he had been passed over for promotion nine times and that the 
fbi kept a dossier on his wife because the agency disapproved of 
her opening the first rape crisis center in el paso when lara was 
stationed there in 1974 
lara said he was pressured into applying for a transfer to 
puerto rico after two months in san juan he was transferred to 
the isolated city of aguadilla on the islands northwest coast 
after five years at aguadilla lara was transferred to gallup 
nm officially listed by the fbi as a hardship office because of 
gallups isolation and low quality of life

radical student leaders said today 
they will not give up their antigovernment struggle but admitted 
they failed to gain public support to share the olympics games with 
communist north korea 
leaders told 1500 cheering supporters at yonsei university in 
seoul they will continue pressing for reunification of the divided 
korean peninsula they also said they will have to make a greater 
effort to gain public support 
we have to admit the road to unification is still too far and 
there lie many difficulties ahead further struggle is called 
for said one student leader oh yungshik 
riot police blocked students who tried to march out of yonsei 
monday to go the border truce site of panmunjom for reunifiction 
talks with north korean student delegates 
police arrested about 2000 students monday who took part in 
demonstrations in seoul after breaking up the march with tear gas 
and beating protesters most of the students were released after 
receiving warnings 
the government banned the march and the meeting with the north 
korean students as a threat to national security a similar march 
june 10 was blocked by police 
the students many of them from colleges around the nation left 
the college to return home after riot police surrounding the campus 
withdrew 
today new violence broke out at sogang university when students 
hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police after plainclothes police 
staged a raid and arrested 10 students 
the radical students back north koreas demand to cohost the 
olympics that begin sept 17 in seoul the international olympic 
committee has rejected the norths demand because the games are 
awarded to a single city 
north korea has said it will boycott the games if it is not 
allowed to cohost 
the radicals a small but powerful minority on campuses have 
failed to gain public support because of their violent tactics and 
open advances to the communist north just a few thousand students 
took part in demonstrations in various cities over the past week 
most south koraens fear the north and believe it wants to 
conquer the peninsula north korea invaded the south in 1950 to 
start the korean war which ended three years later without a 
political solution

beachgoers undeterred by the medical waste 
washing up here this summer found something much more interesting 
in the water money 
great gobs of cash appeared at weekapaug beach over the weekend 
prompting at least 40 people to run giggling and screeching into 
the water to pick it up 
you had your own little spot and you just stood there and 
watched the seaweed said leonard francois of springfield mass 
who found 23 sunday it was in the seaweed sometimes it was 
rolled up and when you went to grab it it got washed away if you 
saw green you just had to jump for it 
lifeguard dean perri 20 said the scene was wild 
people were digging in the sand with sticks and turning over 
the seaweed he said one girl was yelling mommy mommy look 
what i found she had two 100 bills my boss found 80 bucks 
most of the money displayed monday by the finders appeared in 
good shape and was dated 1985 
the cash began washing ashore wednesday unlike the needles 
syringes and other medical debris discovered here the money was 
not immediately reported to lifeguards police or state 
environmental authorities 
secret service agent joseph g sullivan said that as far as the 
us treasury department which runs the agency is concerned its 
finders keepers 
many finders speculated it was drug money but perri had another 
idea maybe the hospitals that have been dumping the medical 
waste are putting money in the water now to bribe us he said

the local branch of the american civil liberties 
union says it will get into the movie theater business if necessary 
to ensure the controversial film the last temptation of christ 
plays here 
howard simon executive director of the michigan aclu said 
monday that he approached the producer universal pictures about 
sponsoring a showing to make certain detroitarea theatergoers had 
an opportunity to judge it on its merits 
this is what america is all about simon said the film 
needs to be seen so that were not victimized by selfcensorship 
on the other hand our job is also to defend the right of anybody 
to protest the film they have a first amendment right to do that 
too 
some theater chains across the country refused to carry the 
movie after being threatened with boycotts and protests from 
fundamentalists who consider the film blasphemous for depicting 
christ as fantasizing about living as a man 
the film which opened friday in nine cities in the united 
states and canada is scheduled to open in midseptember in detroit 
simon said universal pictures told him his offer to organize a 
screening might be premature

the plos executive panel has approved the 
establishment of a provisional government in israelioccupied 
territories a senior palestinian official said 
bassam abu sharif a spokesman for plo chief yasser arafat also 
called on the united states to support the formation of an 
independent palestinian state 
the executive committee has approved the idea of the 
provisional government and it will be endorsed by the pnc 
palestine national council abu sharif told a news conference 
monday in baghdad 
the palestine national council parliamentinexile of the 
palestine liberation organization is scheduled to meet next month 
in algeria 
a highlevel plo delegation met today in the egyptian port city 
of alexandria with president hosni mubarak the staterun middle 
east news agency said 
the delegation discussed the idea of a provisional government in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip monday with foreign minister 
esmat abdelmeguid delegation member abdullah horani said 
at the baghdad news conference abu sharif said the pnc would 
explore the idea of demanding independence for the west bank and 
gaza captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war and the 
creation of a palestinian state 
the territories have been plagued for the last eight months by a 
palestinian rebellion or intefadah in arabic that has claimed 
the lives of more than 240 palestinians and four israelis since 
dec 8 
this independent state has been the target of the intefadah 
and the council will thoroughly examine the possibility of its 
declaration soon abu sharif said 
he said the us administration should support un 
resolutions which call for the setting up of a palestinian state 
israel has denounced all attempts to declare palestinian 
independence or set up a state in occupied territory it refuses to 
talk to the plo which it views as a terrorist group 
abu sharif also said the plo would compensate palestinians left 
jobless after jordans king hussein late last month announced he 
was cutting legal and administrative ties with the west bank and 
gaza 
recent plo appeals for a dialogue with israel have provoked 
debate in the jewish state over the sincerity of the statements 
last month abu sharif indicated the plo may adopt the idea of 
peace talks based on recognition of israels right to exist on 
sunday salah khalaf deputy chairman of arafats fatah wing made 
a similar statement in the parisbased journal du dimanche 
foreign minister shimon peres head of the centerleft labor 
party demanded monday that the plo present a clearcut position

bloc dismissed khalafs statements as a tactical move aimed at 
israels destruction 
a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity

soviet troops will not complete their withdrawal 
from afghanistan earlier than the feb 15 deadline set by a 
unsponsored agreement because of the military situation there a 
government spokesman said today 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov repeated kremlin 
accusations that guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked afghan 
government have been supplied with weapons and other aid by 
pakistan in violation of the april 14 agreement signed in geneva 
gerasimov speaking at a regular news briefing also denied a 
us allegation that the retreating soviet forces have left behind 
as many as 30 million mines 
half of the soviet unions more than 100000 soldiers who had 
been deployed in afghanistan have returned since the withdrawal 
began may 15 
the geneva agreement requires the other soviet soldiers to be 
out of afghanistan no later than feb 15 but foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze has indicated the kremlin would like all of 
its troops home before the end of this year soviet forces 
intervened in december 1979 
on monday the tass news agency reported the second phase of the 
withdrawal would begin in november and gerasimov confirmed that 
the pullout would likely extend beyond 1988 
the situation in afghanistan does not give grounds to 
accelerate the withdrawal of soviet troops he told reporters 
gerasimov said rebel groups based in pakistan have been 
increasing their attacks on sovietbacked afghan government troops 
and that until the guerrillas laid down their arms and joined a 
proposed governing coalition there would be no opportunity to 
complete the soviet withdrawal early 
for the time being there is no possibility to reduce the plan 
for withdrawing soviet troops gerasimov said 
the soviet government has complained repeatedly that pakistan is 
violating the geneva accords and on monday threatened to take 
unspecified action in response 
if military supplies to the insurgents continue the statement 
said the soviet union reserves for itself in that case the 
right to take such measures that are necessitated by the 
situation 
gerasimov declined to specify what action the soviet union would 
take but said the statement was meant as a warning to pakistan 
us state department spokesman charles redman told reporters in 
washington on monday that it appeared the soviets were adhering to 
their withdrawal commitments but said the soldiers had left behind 
as many as 30 million mines including boobytrapped toys 
we would like to state again that we are not involved in any 
mining gerasimov said adding that soviet soldiers have been 
helping afghans remove and defuse mines planted by opposition 
forces along major roads 
tass reported tuesday that the capital of kabul was again under 
rocket fire and said fierce fighting continued around kunduz 
a northern provincial capital 
afghan president najib and soviet officials have said kunduz was 
lost to guerrillas forces earlier this month but taken back again 
by government troops 
two moslem guerrilla groups claimed today in pakistan that their 
fighters were holding on to kunduz despite heavy bombardment by 
afghan government troops 
the guerrillas also claimed today that they captured talogan 
capital of takhar province east of kunduz on friday 
with about 50000 soviet troops remaining in afghanistan 
guerrillas have concentrated recent attacks around kabul northern 
provinces and the southeastern provincial capital of kandahar 
abandoned by the soviets the same time as kunduz 
many western analysts predict afghan government troops will not 
last long against the moslem insurgents who are armed via pakistan 
by the united states china and saudi arabia the soviet union 
intervened in afghanistan in december 1979

our friends on the other side had actually passed the single 
highest tax bill in the 200year history of the united states auto 
loans because of their policies went up to 17 percent so our 
great factories began shutting down fuel costs jumped through the 
atmosphere more than doubling then people waited in gas lines as 
well as unemployment lines 
facts are stupid things stubborn things i should say 
and then there was the misery index that was an election year 
gimmick they designed for the 1976 campaign they added the 
unemployment and inflation rates and it came to 134 percent in 
1976 and they declared that our candidate jerry ford had no 
right to seek reelection with that kind of misery index 
but four years later in the 1980 campaign they didnt mention 
the misery index do you suppose it was because it was no longer 
134 percent in those four years it had become almost 21 percent 
and last month in atlanta at their convention there was again 
no mention of the misery index why because right now its less 
than 92 percent 
facts are stubborn things 
when we met in detroit in that summer of 1980 it was a summer 
of discontent for america around the world our national defense 
had been so weakened the soviet union had begun to engage in 
reckless aggression including the invasion and occupation of 
afghanistan 
the us response to that was to forbid our athletes to 
participate in the 1980 olympics and to try to pull the rug out 
from under our farmers with a grain and soybean embargo 
and in those years on any given day we had military aircraft 
that couldnt fly for lack of spare parts and ships that couldnt 
leave port for the same reason or for lack of a crew our embassy 
in pakistan was burned to the ground and the one in iran was 
stormed and occupied with all americans taken as hostages the 
world began to question the constancy and resolve of the united 
states our leaders answered not that there was something wrong 
with our government but that our people were at fault because of 
some malaise 
well facts are stubborn things 
when our friends last month talked of unemployment despair 
hopelessness economic weakness i wondered why on earth they were 
talking about 1978 instead of 1988 
now now we hear talk that its time for a change well ladies 
and gentlemen another friendly reminder we are the change 
we rolled up our sleeves and went to work in january of 1981 we 
focused on hope not despair we challenged the failed policies of 
the past because we believed that a society is great not because 
of promises made by its government but only because of progress 
made by its people and that was our change 
we said something shocking taxes ought to be reduced not 
raised we cut the tax rates for the working folks of america we 
indexed taxes and that stopped bracket creep which kicked average 
wageearners into higher tax brackets when theyd only received a 
costofliving pay raise and we initiated reform of the unfairness 
in our tax system and what do you know the top 5 percent of 
earners are paying a higher percentage of the total tax revenue at 
the lower rates than they ever had before and millions of earners 
at the bottom of the scale have been freed from paying any income 
tax at all

federal authorities have scrapped the first stage 
of a major aids survey because of protests from community leaders 
in washington dc 
dr james o mason director of the centers for disease control 
in atlanta said monday the project was opposed because of fear 
that participants aids test results would not be kept confidential 
since the cdc project the first part of a major study to 
assess the nations aids infection rate was bungled in its early 
stages the agency must drop washington as its survey site and 
start over elsewhere mason said 
the damage has been done if i had the same information as the 
black people in washington i would have been concerned about 
participating in the survey he said 
black health leaders described the setback which comes more 
than a year after president reagan called for the study as an 
example of the administrations awkward approach to issues in the 
black community 
it is emblematic of a lack of sensitivity said dr rudolph 
jackson chairman of pediatrics at atlantas morehouse school of 
medicine 
at issue were the questions doctors planned to ask as they took 
blood samples at 800 randomly selected households in washington 
the questions included the subjects name and sexual preference 
mason said the study would be redesigned with queries concerning 
only age gender and general geographic location 
more local people should have been involved in planning the 
survey said dr reed v tuckson commissioner of health for the 
district of columbia he said that would have allowed concerns 
about confidentiality to be addressed 
mason said the cdc planned to use the washington project as a 
trial run in a nationwide aids survey of about 50000 people 
new york is the only other site beside washington that had been 
publicized for the survey mason said monday a new site had not 
been selected 
at a conference on aids last year in atlanta black and hispanic 
leaders read resolutions lamenting cdcs disregard and 
insensitivity toward their groups

for beating injuries hospital officials said 
the army said at least 12 palestinians were injured in scuffles 
with troops in the gaza strip where a curfew was in effect for a 
second day

aymen yameen 16 suffered a critical gunshot wound to the head 
they said a second youth abdul razak hudhud 20 was critically 
wounded in the stomach during a clash between stonethrowers and 
soldiers inside nablus 
the army confirmed troops wounded a palestinian in the west bank 
town of tel during a clash with arabs throwing stones and bottles 
it said it was checking the reports of two wounded in nearby nablus 
and of beating injuries in the gaza strip 
israeli news reports said soldiers beefed up patrols in gaza 
where the 650000 residents have been confined to their homes since 
a curfew was imposed sunday night following a firebomb attack on 
israeli civilians in which an 8monthold was seriously burned 
the curfew has denied reporters entry to gaza except under 
military escort although jewish settlers were allowed into the 
israelioccupied seaside strip and armed supporters of rabbi meir 
kahane launched patrols on a highway leading to jewish settlements 
in gaza 
united nations food trucks also were barred from entering gaza 
to distribute daily rations of flour rice milk sugar and oil to 
refugee camps said rulf van uye a spokesman for the un relief 
and works agency 
but there were no reported food shortages uye said 
dozens of palestinian youths defied the curfew monday by hurling 
stones and burning tires on roads and darting out from behind 
street corners to shout we want a state witnesses said 
demonstrators also burned tires in khan yunis while in gaza 
city children broke curfew today by playing basketball and soccer 
in the streets and fleeing when soldiers were spotted an arab 
witness said 
clashes erupted in several areas including jabaliya refugee 
camp in northern gaza where soldiers fired tear gas to disperse 
stonethrowing demonstrators arab news reports said 
a 15yearold palestinian was also moderately wounded in the 
stomach in the nablus clash said an official at the citys st 
johns hospital

plastic bullet which is designed to cause fewer casualties israel

under 70 yards 
the radio also reported that unidentified assailants sabotaged a 
water pipeline to the beit hagai settlement near the west bank city

violence said jerusalem police spokesman rafi levy who declined 
to elaborate 
the gaza strip has been under an aroundtheclock and indefinite 
curfew since sunday after a violent weekend in which three arabs 
died during protests in the lands israel seized in the 1967 middle 
east war 
it was only the third time the army sealed off the entire gaza 
strip since the palestinian uprising began last dec 8 
palestinians and israeli officials traced the weekends outbreak 
of violence to the arson deaths of three gaza workers who were 
trapped in a shed set on fire near tel aviv last week police said 
jewish extremists may have been involved 
the third worker a 34yearold man died early today of his 
wounds israel army radio reported 
defense minister yitzhak rabin called the gaza curfew a clear 
message that israel was cracking down on protesters and said it 
would be in effect as long as needed 
some israeli sources speculated the move which kept some 50000 
gazans away from jobs in israel was an effort to put economic 
pressure on the residents 
in the west bank hospital officials said 21yearold jamal odeh 
of tulkarm refugee camp was dead on arrival monday after being shot 
in the heart during clashes his death raised to 245 the arab death 
toll in the uprising four israelis also have died

its kept suspense in our convention its certainly going to 
focus a lot of attention not only on his pick but on his own 
speech and to that extent its been a good idea kemp said on

finish what we began in 1980 to help all americans share in 
the success of freedom and democracy and peace 
kemp whose own presidential campaign fizzled in the early 
primaries spoke to the convention before president reagans 
farewell to his party it was the high point in a schedule that 
seemed aimed at keeping kemp in the public eye and in the 
speculation as bush pondered a running mate 
could i be a good vice president you bet kemp told 
reporters before his speech 
i was a good second string quarterback and i could be a good 
second string quarterback for george bush said kemp who played 
for the san diego chargers and buffalo bills before entering 
politics 
kemp was attending delegation meetings minority receptions and 
other public events as well as conducting network television 
interviews during the convention week 
a small staff from his congressional office and volunteers from 
his defunct campaign kept a presence for him at a convention hotel 
as he addressed the convention delegates waved red signs 
bearing his name but his speech hardly seemed to grip his 
convention hall audience and he did not provoke a prolonged floor 
demonstration 
kemp contends he is not campaigning for the vice presidential 
job but his loyal supporters among the partys right wing clearly 
have been campaigning for him 
they chanted bushkemp at a huge reception he threw sunday 
night and they presented him with a football jersey bearing not 
his playing number which was 15 but 2 the number representing 
the second spot on the gop ticket 
and alabama gov guy hunt says he has arranged for one member of 
each of the 50 state delegations at the convention to gather 
signatures on petitions asking that kemp be chosen as running mate 
were not trying to take george bushs decision away from 
him hunt said only he can make that decision were just 
trying to show him what we think of jack kemp 
kemp addressing the convention that he had hoped would be 
nominating him spoke of economic opportunity his usual theme 
but largely avoided the arcane economic terminology and the laments 
for the abandoned gold standard that so frequently filled his 
campaign speeches 
he praised the reagan record and urged the republican party to 
reach out to blacks hispanics and other minorities reflecting 
his frequent call for blending social progress and economic 
opportunity with bedrock conservatism 
as the party of lincoln and reagan we believe that freedom 
and hope and opportunity cant be for just some of us kemp said 
theyve got to be for all of us america has got to keep 
moving ahead and we cant leave anyone behind 
he said reagans support for the strategic defense initiative 
the star wars nuclear defense system has shown us how we can 
make even the threat of nuclear war obsolete and he credited 
reagan with leading an entrepreneurial renaissance that has 
electrified the world and raised our standard of living while 
creating 17 million new jobs in five years

black republicans in the year of democrat 
jesse jackson are a minority within a minority but they dont seem 
to mind swimming against the tide were strong swimmers said 
one 
at the same time black delegates to the republican national 
convention who account for only 3 percent of the total generally 
had no quarrel with former gop presidential contender pete du 
ponts suggestion that jackson jump ship and join the republicans 
i feel pride as a black american in what jackson has 
accomplished said gertie thomas 65 an administrator from albany 
calif i just wish he was a republican 
nevertheless the thirdgeneration republican added its 
fantastic to be a republican in any year this year included if 
you look at the statistics you will see that were swimming 
against the tide but were strong swimmers with strong legs and 
strong backs and strong arms 
in a speech to the delegates du pont praised jackson as a 
prominent voice but as long as you speak as a democrat he 
added you will never be a successful leader his suggestion 
that jackson join the party of lincoln and reagan and kemp and 
bork was greeted by silence from the republicans 
minton francis 66 who heads an accreditation task force for 
howard university in washington dc said du pont hit it right 
on the head where jackson belongs is in the republican party 
most of us look at the democratic party as taking the black 
vote for granted they promise blacks everything but what they 
deliver falls far short most current black millionaires were made 
during richard nixons administration francis said under 
jimmy carter nothing was passed out but welfare 
he too is proud of jackson but calls himself resolutely 
republican in a party that appears predominantly white there is 
opportunity for those who can ride the tide and take with them some 
who cannot help themselves 
maxine dawson 65 a teacher from topeka kan said she was 
confident jacksons example will lead to an emergence of black 
leadership within the gop i respect jesse jackson i think 
hes a national leader but im a republican and i believe in the 
republican philosophy 
harold thomas a court administrator from philadelphia said 
jackson put things on the map he had a movement he did stir the 
contents id love to see someone stir up this convention its 
stuffy 
thomas wasnt sure the gop needed jackson jesse who wheres 
his experience but he did think the party could learn from the 
democrats 
theres lots of lip service being paid to us but not much 
else he said during du ponts speech republicans could 
stand to look over at the democratic party and see what theyre 
doing to lure blacks hispanics and jews we need them all 
the dearth of blacks at the convention was evident in the 
instructions given to delegate roberta maloy of brooklyn ny a 
black delegate who was told to leave the funny hats at home and 
look dignified 
as one of the few blacks on the floor she said i could 
be on camera at any time

gary dotson the convicted rapist whose accuser 
later recanted was freed from prison today after a sixmonth term 
for violating terms of his parole and entered an alcohol 
rehabilitation program 
dotson 30 served his term at logan correctional center in 
lincoln said nic howell a spokesman for the corrections 
department he was sent to prison after being arrested in a bar 
dec 24 for allegedly starting a fight over a sandwich 
dotson who blamed a drinking problem for his repeated scrapes 
with the law since his 1985 release from prison on the rape 
conviction was taken to a rehabilitation program at an undisclosed 
location in the chicago area howell said 
hell be in the residential portion for several weeks and then 
hell be involved with that organization on an outpatient basis for 
a while longer howell said today 
dotson three years ago was paroled early from a 25 to 50year 
sentence after cathleen crowell webb recanted testimony that he had 
raped her gov james thompson commuted dotsons sentence to the 
six years he had served 
mrs webb said in her recantation that she made up the rape 
story to cover up for a sexual liaison with her boyfriend 
in commuting dotsons sentence however thompson bypassed 
dotsons request for a grant of clemency saying he did not believe 
mrs webbs recantation 
on monday dotsons attorney tom breen said he had asked 
thompson for clemency because of new evidence 
breen said tests by a forensic serologist on genetic material 
from blood and semen samples from dotson webb and her former 
boyfriend prove conclusively absolutely and definitively that 
dotson did not have sex with webb 
thompson who received results of the test last week is in new 
orleans for the republican national convention 
he wants to talk to some scientific types to feel comfortable 
in his own mind whether this test is scientifically reliable beyond 
a reasonable doubt said terry barnich thompsons legal counsel 
the clemency request is submitted to a prison review board 
which makes a recommendation to the governor 
since his 1985 release dotson has been convicted of drunken 
driving and arrested another time on charges he punched his wife 
and threatened the couples infant daughter

demonstrations in the capital of rangoon staterun radio rangoon 
said 
student groups meanwhile distributed leaflets in rangoon calling 
for street demonstrations wednesday to demand an end to 26 years of 
authoritarian rule diplomats and journalists said 
radio rangoon said of those detained on aug 89 51 were freed 
from insein prison and handed over to parents and guardians the 
broadcast monitored in bangkok said 47 of those released were 
students 
it did not identify those freed because of the dates given it

dissident aung gyi and the burmese correspondent of the 
associated press sein win the two were among 10 people detained 
july 2930 
the radio also said 30 people arrested in aug 410 disturbances 
in pegu 45 miles northeast of rangoon were freed sunday 
the releases were the first reported since the demonstrations 
ended last friday with the resignation of president sein lwin 
radio rangoon had said early on aug 9 that authorities had 
arrested more than 700 demonstrators overnight later that day it 
reported 1451 arrests in rangoon but didnt make clear if that 
included the 700 figure 
a large number of other dissidents were arrested before and 
after aug 89 
students distributed leaflets calling for protests and attached 
identical posters on trees mailboxes and walls of major buildings 
today the buildings include rangoon general hospital which became 
a rallying point for protesters after security forces allegedly 
shot doctors and nurses there during the riots 
soldiers made no attempt to take down the posters said liu zhen 
ting a journalist for singapores united morning news daily upon 
returning to bangkok today 
chinas xinhua news agency meanwhile reported 177 burmese 
lawyers signed a document charging last weeks shooting of 
demonstrators violated burmas constitution and the un 
declaration of human rights the agency said the nations bar 
association submitted the document monday to the council of state 
or the presidents office 
the xinhua report from rangoon said the council sent copies of 
the document to foreign embassies and to the un secretary general 
a western diplomat reached in rangoon said army trucks and tanks 
with up to 200 soldiers parked today about 200 yards from the us 
embassy just south of the sule pagoda witnesses said last weeks 
violence began when security forces opened fire to disperse tens of 
thousands of protesters who had converged peacefully in front of 
the ancient pagoda 
the diplomat said the vehicles were gone by the afternoon and 
the presence of security forces elsewhere in rangoon was light 
burmas sole political party the burma socialist program party 
and the legislature are holding emergency sessions friday 
presumably to choose a successor to sein lwin a retired general 
who was widely hated for crushing dissent during a quartercentury 
of militarydominated rule 
most analysts said they doubted the new burmese leadership would 
make dramatic changes in the oneparty system ne win instituted 26 
years ago sein lwin ruled as president and party chairman for 17 
days after ne wins resignation last month 
diplomats and tourists arriving today in bangkok said the 
placards and leaflets had seven demands including multiparty 
democracy legalization of student unions a court trial for sein 
lwin and the release of political dissidents including their 
leading figure aung gyi 
the students also have called for major changes in leadership 
reductions in the cost of living and compensation for families of 
people killed or wounded in the demonstrations it was not clear if 
these were included in the list of seven demands 
staterun radio rangoon has said at least 95 people were killed 
and 240 wounded in protests in two dozen towns last week but

george bush arrived today in a convention 
city ready to hand him the republican presidential nomination 
saying he has finally settled on a stillsecret running mate and 
declaring this is a big time in our lives 
bush said he practiced his acceptance speech on the plane while 
en route to new orleans i checked it out with barbara she 
stayed awake for the whole thing he joked 
bush said he called president reagan last night after his 
farewell address the presidents speech was superb he gave me a 
marvelous sendoff bush said 
bush called his appearance with reagan at the airport a symbolic 
passing of the torch 
asked when he made up his mind on a veep bush said just 
before i climbed onto this plane today with finality 
bush would not be specific on when he would announce his running 
mate saying only it would be before thursday night 
i want an opportunity to properly notify the person i will 
nominate bush told reporters on air force ii as he flew from 
washington to new orleans 
the republican presidential nomineetobe said he also wanted to 
notify those whom he did not choose before making his choice public 
bush said his decision came late 
i had hoped to do it by the time i got on this airplane and i 
have bush said the decision will be announced before thursday 
night 
bush warned reporters that he would not let out the name he 
said he would not to play the game of 20 questions with 
reporters or others about the choice 
he knows that if he tells one person it will leak said 
bush press secretary sheila tate 
he said he had told no one of his decision even his wife or 
campaign chairmantobe james a baker iii both of whom joined him 
for the plane ride 
bush said he thought he had made his selection with a certain 
dignity there is going to be public speculation but i have not 
contributed to public speculation 
bush said he was not offended by remarks on monday by sen bob 
dole who complained about the selection process i took no 
offense at that bush said 
early today bush and family members boarded air force two at 
andrews air force base near washington for the flight to new 
orleans where he will accept the unchallenged nomination of his 
party on wednesday 
on thursday he will give an acceptance that will be measured 
against the wellreceived speech michael dukakis delivered a month 
ago in atlanta 
after watching the presidents monday night address to the 
convention bush said he would do my level best to fill those big 
shoes of president ronald reagan 
the bush forces arranged for an elaborate arrival in this 
convention city and a carefully orchestrated encounter with reagan 
at the belle chasse naval air station near new orleans 
reagan eager not to steal the show from bush departs 
immediately for a california vacation 
upon arrival at the airfield bush was to travel by motorcade to 
the mississippi river where he will cross on a riverboat the ss 
natchez arriving with great fanfare on the downtown side of the 
river for a rally in spanish plaza 
the water crossing was designed to make good use of assets 
that are part of the local scene said bushs chief of staff 
craig fuller it will be a colorful arrival possibly to be seen 
on the evening news 
the vice president has said he hoped to make up his mind on a 
choice of a running mate before leaving for new orleans but as of 
late monday had not made a decision although he had considerably 
narrowed his field of choices said spokeswoman tate 
asked whether the delay would cause logistical problems for the 
campaign staff ms tate said i hope that all those under 
consideration have been smart enough to get their background 
together and smart enough to have a copier machine around or 
well be putting out pretty sparse information 
she said that she anticipated bush would choose from among the 
candidates who previously had been asked to provide background and 
financial information and doubted that bushs choice would come 
out of the blue 
those believed to be on bushs short list include sen bob dole 
of kansas and his wife former transportation secretary elizabeth 
dole rep jack kemp of new york sen dan quayle of indiana 
attorney general richard thornburgh and former white house chief of 
staff howard baker who insists hes not in the running 
bush held both morning and afternoon sessions on monday with 
speechwriter peggy noonan going over a final draft of the 
acceptance speech 
on monday bush suggested that reagan would be a hard act to 
follow and said that he would not try to be a ronald reagan 
there is only one i want to be george bush 
asked whether he expected to be compared with reagan bush said 
he felt such comparisons were inevitable because hes been a 
great president 
bush also told nbc that the pressure is mounting as he nears 
the time for him to accept his partys presidential nomination 
but he suggested that as an athlete he had been in 
pressure situations before maybe none this intense but look all 
ill do is just stand up there and say what i believe about peace 
and what i believe in about prosperity

george bush said he decided today on a 
running mate for the fall campaign but warned he would not play 
the game of 20 questions to fuel speculation about whom he had 
chosen in advance of an announcement later this week 
as bush flew from washington here on air force two the 
incumbent vice president said the long process of selection was 
over 
i had hoped to do it by the time i got on this airplane and i 
have bush told reporters aboard the plane the decision will 
be announced before thursday night 
he said the final phase in the process came just before i 
climbed onto this plane today with finality 
i want an opportunity to properly notify the person i will 
nominate bush said 
bush brushed aside complaints about his selection process 
sen bob dole of kansas who has been at the top of many lists 
complained about the drawnout process 
i dont care for it frankly said dole 
i took no offense at that bush responded today 
another prospect rep jack kemp said today he didnt think the 
procedures were demeaning 
its kept suspense in our convention kemp said on abcs 
good morning america i imagine george bush is either close 
to or has made up his mind and that is going to keep the suspense 
alive 
the rumormongers were having a field day guessing but no one in 
new orleans could say they knew whom bush would tap this week 
we didnt need rumor control said bush aide rich bond it 
is more like curiosity control 
the names on the rumor mill kemp dole his wife elizabeth 
sens dan quayle pete domenici and alan simpson atty gen 
richard thornburgh and former white house chief of staff howard 
baker 
new names introduced by no one in particular were sens john 
danforth and christopher bond of missouri 
i am not running around trying to get it said domenici 
but frankly if it will help keep the momentum of the past few 
years goingi guess it is fair to say id do about anything 
quayle began to have second thoughts 
from a personal standpoint if i had a time in my life to be 
vice president i wouldnt choose this time he said if george 
bush thinks i can offer the most to the ticket dan quayle will 
sign up immediately 
baker a former tennessee senator continued to deny he is under 
consideration my names not on that list ive made it 
perfectly clear ive no desire to be vice president 
bush in a wellorchestrated telephone call to campaign manager 
lee atwater on the convention floor did raise the possibility he 
will unveil his choice a day ahead of schedule on wednesday 
atwater said bush wanted to just leave it on thursday but 
flexible 
for one hopeful the selection procedure has already dragged on 
too long dole said he thought it might have been more valuable for 
bush to choose a running mate last month and not give democratic 
nominees michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen a head start for the 
fall campaign 
aides to the kansas senator rushed to say he was not criticizing 
bush but the vice president had already heard of the comments from 
the politician known for a sharp tongue 
dole said he suspects bush has already made up his mind 
if you asked the question i think thats not an unlikely 
thing for him to say said bush deputy campaign manager rich bond 
on the convention floor 
in the superdome the hopefuls began their parade to the podium 
with the opening of the convention monday 
first up were kemp of new york the choice of hardline 
conservatives and former transportation secretary elizabeth dole 
later in the week sens dole and domenici will address the 
delegates 
others named on various versions of bushs list quayle of 
indiana thornburgh baker were here monday but not to speak to 
the convention 
sen simpson of wyoming who has asked off bushs list also 
appeared at the podium and became the first speaker to answer the 
democratic question of where was george 
the question is whos mike simpson said summing up the 
gop attacks on dukakis into a campaign button slogan 
kemp boosted by the most organized effort promoting a vice 
presidential candidacy resolutely declared he wants to be on the 
gop national ticket as he heaped praise on president reagan and 
bush 
earlier in the day kemp had told supporters i was a good 
secondstring quarterback and i can be a good secondstring 
quarterback for george bush 
mrs dole the remaining female on the list used her convention 
speech to talk directly to american women who currently hold 
negative views of bush 
our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for millions 
of women the former cabinet member said and let me say to the 
women of america i respect the fact that some of you have 
questions i also ask you to have an open mind 
the other hopefuls varied in their attitudes toward a possible 
national campaign 
thornburgh in town to hear president reagans monday speech 
remained coy when he asked about how he would respond to an offer 
from bush 
i have no reason to think thats going to happen he said

north korea on tuesday criticized the latest 
proposal by the international olympic committee for its 
participation in the olympics and said it will discuss being a 
cohost of the games in talks with south korea 
in a telegram to committee president juan antonio samaranch kim 
yu sun president of the north korean olympic committee said his 
country could never accept the proposal because separate teams 
for north and south korea in the olympics would give the world 
a more strong impression of two koreas against the desire of 
our nation for reunification 
the english text of the telegram was carried by the communist 
countrys official korean central news agency and monitored in 
tokyo 
samaranch proposed last week that north and south korea teams 
march side by side in the opening and closing ceremonies next month 
in seoul each carrying its own flag preceded by a single olympic 
flag 
samaranch said in messages to the olympic committees of both 
countries that this would be a highly symbolic event 
demonstrating a strong desire for dialogue and reconciliation 
south korea welcomed the proposal but north korea has said it 
will boycott the games unless it is made a cohost on the grounds 
that separate teams in a south korean olympics would perpetuate the 
division of the korean peninsula 
the ioc has rejected formal cohost status for north korea 
saying the olympiad is awarded only to one city but it has offered 
to let the country hold five events in the olympics 
north korea recently proposed the two nations parliaments meet 
to discuss the sept 17oct 2 olympics and a mutual nonaggression 
pact between the two sides divided since 1945 
if good results are produced at the northsouth joint 
parliamentary meeting we will inform you immediately for your 
cooperation kim told samaranch 
no date has been set for the proposed joint parliamentary talks 
and south korean lawmakers have said preparatory talks should be 
held first to decide on an agenda and other matters 
in addition to north korea five other countries have not yet 
responded to invitations from the ioc to participate in this years 
olympics cuba ethiopia nicaragua albania and the seychelles

the federal aviation administration is doing a 
poor job of managing restricted airspace used by military planes 
and helicopters and has no way of judging if the pentagon has too 
much specialuse airspace according to the general accounting 
office 
the faa is not effectively managing specialuse airspace to 
ensure its efficient and appropriate use the congressional 
watchdog agency says in a 43page report we acknowledge that 
some improvement in the administration of specialuse airspace has 
recently occurred but believe that serious and longstanding 
problems continue to affect the program 
the study conducted over an 18month period and released on 
monday was requested by sen jesse a helms rnc the agency 
cited helms state of north carolina as well as california as two 
areas where the conflict between military and civilian use of the 
skies is becoming particularly sharp 
according to the gao special use airspace consisted of 
556152 square miles or about onefifth of the airspace within 
the continental united states as of september 1987 
the agency said that total excludes specialuse areas off the 
coastlines but still represents a 22 percent increase in square 
mileage compared to 1978 when 455000 square miles were designated 
special use 
there are various categories of special use airspace the agency 
continued ranging from a few prohibited areas that are 
offlimits to all aircraft to restricted areas from which 
civilian aircraft are barred to alert areas in which civilian 
pilots are simply informed there is a high level of flight activity 
occurring 
the biggest problem with the current system is the faa does not 
require the army navy air force and marine corps to disclose in 
some standardized way how frequently they use the airspace set 
aside for them the gao said 
the faa does not have adequate utilization data for areas in 
which hazardous flight training activities occur and requires no 
data to be provided for other special use airspace areas the 
report says 
that failure is particularly important given the results of a 
navy study conducted last year the gao continued that study 
focused on 191 specialuse areas and found that during a twomonth 
period they were utilized by military aircraft only about a 
quarter of the available hours 
seven restricted and three military operations areas were not 
utilized at all during the period the gao said 
that navy study also revealed that restricted airspace was 
sometimes used for other than its intended purpose for example 
for nonhazardous activities such as basic flight training 
if the faa is to effectively manage specialuse airspace it 
needs to know where when and how airspace is being utilized the 
gao concluded 
making matters worse even if the faa had the data necessary 
it has not established guidance for its regional offices to 
reduce or eliminate specialuse airspace that is inefficiently or 
inappropriately used the gao asserted 
the faa in a written response to the gao dated june 13 
generally concurred with the findings and said it would begin 
trying to collect actual usage reporting data 
the agency said it also would take appropriate action to 
periodically review the usage reports and ensure that the airspace 
is being used for the designated purpose 
the pentagon in a separate response said it is pursuing 
development of a computerized airspace management system that 
automatically would provide the faa with the information it needed 
assistant defense secretary gordon a smith cautioned however 
that low levels of usage dont always mean that airspace 
restrictions can be dropped 
the military has requirements for specialuse airspace that 
may be used as little as three or four times a year smith wrote 
only the defense department he added can accurately and 
properly assess its needs in support of national security

killed in a reprisal attack

the explosion occurred at the busy clock tower area of the city 
where many government employees disembark from buses the officials 
said 
most of the government employees reporting for work in the city 
belong to the sinhalese community 
tamils refused to work for the government after a sinhalese mob 
killed three members of their community in the town on july 21 
last week authorities ordered all employees to report to work 
and promised them maximum protection but the rebels challenged the 
order and warned government staff against complying 
the police in trincomalee about 150 miles northeast of colombo 
imposed an unofficial curfew in the town area after the incidents 
the bodies of two tamils with gunshot wounds were found near the 
clock tower 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people but are 
in a majority in the islands north and east tamil radicals have 
been agitating for an independent homeland since 1983 claiming 
discrimination by the sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the 
population

a small defense contractor will not 
fight a court order allowing unisys corp to seize more than 117 
million worth of military components an attorney said today 
armtec inc had closed earlier this month laying off about 80 
employees after unisys withheld a payment claiming it had been 
overbilled 
unisys then sued armtec charging that the smaller firm might 
move or damage components manufactured under contract with unisys 
and us district judge howell w melton issued an order monday 
allowing unisys to seize the items 
armtec had said it would not comply until unisys paid more than 
400000 in unpaid bills 
but armtec attorney mitchell rogovin said in a telephone 
interview from washington today that a 234 million bond melton 
required unisys to post will ensure armtec will be paid any money 
it is owed 
we were holding it back because we hadnt been paid and they 
wanted it back rogovin said it was property they sent us and 
labor we put into it 
both companies are under scrutiny in the pentagon bribery probe 
unisys said it sued to protect navy radar equipment from being 
damaged by humidity in the closed plant 
unisys is under contract to deliver the completed systems to the 
navy over roughly a twoyear period beginning in february and the 
navy has made fleet deployment decisions accordingly the lawsuit 
said

ronald reagan and george bush staging a 
political role reversal on the eve of bushs nomination for 
president shook hands and wished each other well today in an 
airport reunion rife with the symbolism of changing influence in 
the republican party 
nancy and i want you to know you have all our support all the 
way and all our love reagan told bush and his wife barbara 
who had just arrived from washington 
with their military jets lined up on the tarmac at belle chasse 
naval air station on the outskirts of this convention city reagan 
and bush kept the ceremony short but affectionate 
its time to accept the great challenge that you have left for 
us and made possible to build a better america bush told the 
president whom he has served for nearly eight years 
and i accept that challenge the vice president added we 
look forward to writing the next chapter in americas freedom story 
because americas mission is greatness and i do not intend to 
fail 
reagan made lighthearted humor out of the unusual airport 
gettogether saying the fire chief of new orleans had declared the 
city overcrowded and that hes not letting in a new republican 
until one leaves 
he also poked fun at the theatrics surrounding bushs 
decisionmaking on a vice presidential running mate saying hed 
offered to show bush where to find blackened redfish if hed tell 
me whos going to be the vice president 
im not sure he knows reagan told reporters who yelled 
questions to the pair about the no 2 spot on the ticket as the 
engines on air force one began roaring in preparation for the 
reagans departure 
reagan was heading for california after delivering a 
thanksforthememories speech to the convention monday night 
while bush awaited a greeting rally in a spanish plaza along the 
banks of the mississippi river 
reagan had told the convention monday night he wanted bush to 
win one more for the gipper and had said he would work hard for 
bushs election although the president conceded that this office 
is not mine to give 
reagans speech brought tears to longtime loyalists on the 
convention floor it capped a day in which both he and his wife 
nancy talked of relinquishing the political spotlight to bush and 
his wife barbara 
there are times to enter times to stay and times to leave 
mrs reagan told friends at a luncheon given in her behalf 
today the curtain begins to close on the reagan era of the 
republican party she said weve had a wonderful run but the 
time has come for the bushes to step into the political leading 
roles and for the reagans to step into the wings 
that same theme dominated reagans convention address preceded 
by a documentary about the reagan years and heralded by trumpets 
blaring hail to the chief 
standing before the 2277 convention delegates and thousands of 
others in visitors and alternates seats reagan declared he still 
would be heard even in retirement 
when i pack up my bags in washington dont expect me to be 
happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life said 
reagan 77 
twilight not in america 
but reagan also made clear that he doesnt desire to command the 
party saying ill leave my phone number and address behind just 
in case you need a foot soldier 
convention delegates frequently interrupted his speech with 
applaue waving banners and cheering reagan even got applause a 
few times for things he said in the filmed narration of the reagan 
years 
the delegates stood for several minutes and clapped their hands 
as he arrived at the podium and reagan basked in the glory 
eight years ago we gathered in detroit in a troubled time for 
our beloved country he said and we gathered solemnly to share 
our dreams 
when our children turn the pages of our lives i hope theyll 
see that we had a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect 
as we could he said 
reagans speech contained little of the acerbic indirect 
criticism of democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis that 
was his theme upon his arrival sunday 
but reagan did not let the democrats off the hook even poking 
fun at one point at a democratic convention speech in atlanta by 
sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts which was built around the 
rhetorical question of where was george 
george played a major role in everything weve accomplished 
he said and in noting that bush headed a presidential task force 
on reducing the burden of government paperwork he said and 
george was there 
with george bush ill know as we approach the new 
millennium our children will have a future secure with a nation at 
peace and protected against aggression he said

a syrianbacked christian who was 
president when lebanons civil war began in 1975 said tuesday he is 
a candidate for president creating a crisis two days before 
parliament is to make the choice 
suleiman franjieh 78 pledged to stop 13 years of bloodshed 
some lebanese see the election as a first step toward ending the 
war 
the lebanese forces the main christian militia and an opponent 
of syria urged legislators not to elect a man who bears grudges 
and whose accession to power would touch off the war anew 
under an unwritten covenant in effect since lebanon gained 
independence from france in 1943 the president is a christian the 
prime minister a sunni moslem and the speaker of parliament a 
shiite moslem 
franjiehs lastminute candidacy could delay parliaments 
election of a successor to president amin gemayel whose 
6yearterm expires sept 23 rightwing christian leaders 
including gemayel have said they would use all means to block 
franjiehs election if he announced for the office 
many christians dislike franjieh because of what they see as an 
attempt by moslem syria to take over its small neighbor syria has 
25000 soldiers stationed in the bekaa valley of eastern and 
northern lebanon and more than 7000 in west beirut to keep the 
peace among warring moslem factions 
i shall spare no effort to rescue the nation and safeguard 
lebanons unity and independence as an arab democratic and free 
country franjieh told a news conference at his home at ehden in 
the christian stronghold of north lebanon 
he said his program was aimed at saving the nation and 
building a new lebanon and that can only be achieved through 
national entente 
the lebanese forces issued its statement after a special meeting 
of the high command 
suleiman franjieh is a confrontational candidate the 
statement said his election would rekindle the war and would 
lead to the partitioning of the country as well as obliterating all 
chances of national entente to end the civil war 
it did not say whether the militia would use force to prevent 
franjiehs election but urged parliament to choose a 
reconciliatory president who could lead the nation out of its 
current impasse and bring about national entente 
franjieh like gemayel a maronite catholic was president in 
19701976 when the moslemchristian civil war began april 13 
1975 he requested syrian military intervention to stop it and 
syrian troops have been in lebanon since 
word that franjieh would seek a new term with syrias blessing 
was leaked last week 
he holds samir geagea leader of the lebanese forces personally 
responsible for killing his eldest son tony the younger franjiehs 
wife and 3yearold daughter and 30 bodyguards in a raid on ehden 
in june 1978

china said tuesday it is raising its interest 
rates which have remained at about the same level since the 1950s 
to fight inflation end panic buying and encourage investment 
a spokesman for the peoples bank of china said on nationwide 
television news that on sept 1 general loan rates would go up 
from 792 percent to 9 percent in a break with the past he said 
that when risks appear higher the interest rates would increase 
saving account interest rates will vary he said rates on 
oneyear accounts for example will go from 72 percent to 864 
percent while those on 10year accounts will go up from 1044 
percent to 1242 percent 
the influential economic daily on monday published a frontpage 
editorial calling for a rise in interest rates to keep in step with 
inflation the highest since communist china was established in 
1949 and to encourage investment which is dropping off 
since 1985 the paper said retail prices have soared 237 
percent but interest rates are about the same as they were in the 
1950s it said the low rates combined with high inflation had 
caused panic buying throughout china 
the paper cited the case of a worker in the central city of 
wuhan who bought enough salt to last his family for 10 years 
another family from changzhou in the yangtze river valley in one 
shot bought 1100 pounds of rice it said 
the report said low interest rates and easy credit were also 
responsible for a run on bank loans by chinese businesses 
by raising interest rates china hopes to get people and firms 
not to spend money on food and consumer items but to channel it 
into production and investment 
two chinese sources said monday that china would raise interest 
rates and to stave off growing discontent in the cities give 
workers a large raise and link further pay increases to the 
inflation rate 
the sources both of whom recently attended top government 
meetings said the proposals were made by liberalminded reformers 
allied with communist party chief zhao ziyang 
they said premier li peng vice premier yao yilin and other 
conservatives have called for a complete freeze on reforms which 
are slowly opening the economy to market forces 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity estimated the 
average workers annual salary of 246 would rise between 8 percent 
and 28 percent 
in the last 10 years china has pushed farreaching economic 
reforms aimed at ending state controls over prices and allowing the 
value of goods to be controlled by the market 
the elimination of low governmentfixed prices has caused high 
inflation as the inefficient economy fails to keep up with rising 
consumer demand an active black market and the hoarding of goods 
still sold at governmentset prices has exacerbated the problem

the small number of demonstrators at the 
republican national convention is an indication that george bushs 
critics dont think hell be elected one protester says 
theres no turnout because everybody thinks george bush is a 
goner said dana beal who describes himself as a 41yearold 
career protester from new york city 
absent so far are large groups of protesters who traditionally 
turn out at national political conventions instead those here 
appear to be part of a loose network of people who go from one 
conventionrelated event to another staging small demonstrations 
today about 20 protesters held up signs and shouted in front of 
imreg inc a pharmaceutical company which manufactures one of the 
few promising drugs effective in the treatment of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome or aids 
demonstrators said they objected to the federal governments 
bureaucratic red tape that has delayed the release of drugs to 
treat aids 
six demonstrators were arrested monday at a rally for evangelist 
pat robertson others got into a shoving match with police outside 
the superdome 
about 20 demonstrators marched with a police escort down poydras 
street near the superdome to protest the us presence in the 
persian gulf 
but things were quiet about six blocks away at lafayette park 
the designated freespeech and demonstration gathering place for 
the convention 
the stage built for protesters was empty all morning and much of 
monday afternoon police assigned there milled around and sought 
relief from the sweltering louisiana summer 
late in the day a handful of protesters held an openmike forum 
to criticize the republican party and banged on pots with sticks 
police stopped a young republican from stepping onto the stage to 
debate the demonstrators 
we didnt expect this but we didnt expect a big crowd 
either police lt ra paisant said of the sparse crowds i 
dont think theres any real issue right now to unite people 
moreover he said people in new orleans are known to be 
followers not leaders and there is no one here to unite them 
beal said the small number of demonstrators reflected a 
marketing decision 
a decision was made by the communication networks not to 
mobilize and do this he said the singleissue groups are here 
but not the left as a group so you lack a coalition 
for his part beal said he will return to new york city on 
wednesday 
there are other more important things going on he said 
citing the tompkins square park riot aug 7 in which residents near 
the new york city park went on a rampage when police tried to 
enforce a 1 am park curfew 
beal said many of his friends canceled plans to demonstrate at 
the new orleans convention to work for neighborhood changes 
following the riot

a program that administered the drug azt for free 
to 130 indigent aids patients will lose its federal funding next 
month and officials say that will completely cut off the treatment 
for 66 of those patients 
the federal health resources and services administration 
provided 587000 to the state on a onetime basis to assist those 
patients who do not receive medicaid and are not covered by health 
insurance 
the money part of a 30 million appropriation under the 1987 
supplemental appropriations act runs out sept 30 
azt has been shown to relieve certain symptoms in those 
suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aidsrelated 
complex but it is not a cure for the fatal disease 
without this treatment many people who are poor and sick now 
run the risk of a considerably shortened life span dr joseph 
wilber medical consultant for the state department of human 
resources said monday 
treatment for 220 medically indigent aids victims in georgia was 
provided under the program beginning october 1987 ninety of them 
have died moved away become eligible for medicaid or were unable 
to take the drug dhr officials said 
wilber said 64 of the remaining patients would be eligible to 
continue azt treatment at grady memorial hospital in atlanta which 
provides care for poor people who live in fulton and dekalb 
counties 
but 66 others will no longer be able to get treatment because 
they are not residents of the area grady covers wilber said 
those who live in smaller towns where there is no charity 
hospital are just going to be cut off he said 
wilber said some aids victims could seek assistance through 
medicaid but he cautioned that medicaid pays for treatment only 
when patients are extremely poor and even then few qualify 
he speculated that some patients would relocate to fulton or 
dekalb in order to receive treatment at grady 
wilber said the state bought azt in bulk at an annual cost of 
6566 per patient grady hospital would have to buy the drug at a 
yearly cost of 8000 to 10000 per patient and would ultimately 
pay an estimated 1 million per year to continue the azt program 
he said 
dhr officials said there were 1493 aids cases reported in 
georgia as of june 1988 with 841 deaths

the lake bluff precision lawn mower 
drill team is looking to draft a few hot prospects for its 16th 
season 
however organizers warn that standards are high and the field 
crowded also presumably closely cropped 
the popularity of lawn mowing and the drill team has led to an 
unprecedented demand for admittance to this elite unit says the 
teams tongueincheek press release 
there have been attempts to bribe the selection committee to 
gain entry 
candidates should be equipped with a strong sense of the absurd 
and a lawn mower anything goes says attorney robert oneill a 
team member 
some are push some are power some are old some are new 
he said 
the teams big day is the fourth of july and the annual parade 
in this north chicago suburb when mowers are pushed through a 
choreographed drill in concentric circles and figure eights lines 
weaving in and out as members offer a commentary on current events 
the recruiting drive was prompted by a dwindling in the ranks 
from 14 to 11 with two members moving away and a third giving up 
the little touch of show business because of a bum knee 
applicants are asked if they could take the physical pace if 
their jobs would permit appearances on national news programs and 
if their passports are in order 
theyre also asked 
would you be willing to donate time as a hall monitor at the 
lake buff sic childrens home during the off season the home 
was closed 10 years ago and torn down oneill notes 
would you be able to attend the grand national mowoff 
against the toro toro toros in casa grande arizona on august 
19 1989 
the city and the california mower team exist but oneill says 
no competition has been set 
briefly critique james thurbers short story entitled the 
unicorn in the garden 
applications are also being distributed worldwide a team 
statement notes 
actually oneill says one member took a couple of the forms 
along on a vacation to australia 
prospective members also are advised that the unit has won 
numerous local national and international awards for its 
intricate marching routines and its elegant costumes and 
impersonations 
thats malarkey too but we have a great time oneill says 
the team was started as a joke a spoof of the costumed 
shriners precision motorcycle units 
then as it got rolling and people got more interested we 
started spending more time to do what we had to do to put on a good 
show oneill said 
one year members dressed as arab sheiks for a commentary on an 
oil shortage at another parade they dressed up as brides after a 
movie called the wedding was shot in their village of 5000 
last year they traded their mowers for chain saws 
the occasion the uproar generated when mr t star of the 
ateam television series had some trees cleared from his lake 
forest estate 
dignity is not the teams strong suit however 
one year they had a boy running ahead screaming the mowers 
are coming the mowers are coming said waitress margaret abel 
58 named this years mower mother by team members who frequent 
the restaurant where she works 
she keeps the application forms on hand 
it makes good reading when youve had a few cocktails mrs

a homeless unemployed former factory 
worker has kept a vigil for three months on the bandstand in the 
shadow of the mcdonald county courthouse saying hes determined to 
get justice 
but many residents of pineville a town of 500 some 30 miles 
south of joplin in extreme southwest missouri see 60yearold tom 
daywalt as more ragged exhibitionist than righteous protester 
during jesse james days in july the chamber of commerce wrapped 
the front and sides of the bandstand in sheets of bright blue 
plastic to hide daywalt and then parked a flatbed trailer in front 
of it as a replacement stage 
that annual celebration isnt what you might think it 
commemorates the 1938 filming of a movie about the outlaw in 
pineville 
the plastic remains on the bandstand providing daywalt some 
protection from the sun and rain and allowing passersby to avoid 
his almost courtly good afternoon 
chamber of commerce members who had donated the bandstand to the 
city had a judge order daywalt removed temporarily on june 29 but 
on july 5 doctors at nevada state hospital said he was competent 
mcdonald county circuit judge george henry ruled the bandstand was 
public property and daywalt could not be barred 
daywalt moved to the bandstand may 11 complaining he was treated 
unfairly after arrests on trespassing charges last winter and 
spring 
he vowed to stay until he is granted a trial on a charge that 
was dismissed in april he said dismissal is not enough he wants 
to prove his innocence 
he leaves only to use the courthouse restroom some townspeople 
bring him food and water but what the divorced father of three 
grown children seems to crave most is conversation 
when youve been here three months you really appreciate it 
there are some that wont even walk on this side of the 
courthouse daywalt said he has had no contact with his children 
and fought an attempt to place him in custody of a daughter 
he seems comfortable despite the fleecelined denim jacket two 
sweaters and work boots he wears in the 90degree heat he has a 
roof and lights at night he sleeps on a wooden bench using a 
cardboard box containing his bible and a copy of the constitution 
as a pillow 
he said he is a jehovahs witness and trusts jehovah to sustain 
him until he is granted a trial he told me sit upon this 
bench and thats where ive been ever since daywalt said 
daywalt had one day in court jan 15 and represented himself he 
was convicted of trespassing sentenced to three days in jail and 
credited with time served 
daywalt had been arrested on the porch of a home from which he 
had been evicted in nearby lanagan court records said deputies 
arrested him dec 21 as much for his health in the freezing weather 
as to uphold the law 
daywalt who said he has worked in factories and construction 
but now describes himself as a bible student and teacher returned 
to the porch after his conviction 
according to court records he was charged once more with 
trespassing after being jailed for nearly four months awaiting 
trial the charge was dismissed by county prosecutor ben hormel 
hormel has said the charge will not be refiled but refused to be 
interviewed about daywalt 
others in pineville seemed weary of talking about daywalt and 
resentment is evident as in tshirts for sale that depict daywalt 
with the legend the great pineville holdup 
teenagers have thrown eggs and yelled insults but the worst 
daywalt faces now are glares from a few passersby 
i doubt very seriously that anybody would do him any harm 
said one man who asked not to be identified but he could die 
out there of a heart attack or stroke or whatever what i would do 
is take him up to the court and give him about 15 minutes to tell 
his story i think its a problem that should be resolved

the state department firing a new blast at 
the soviet union today accused moscow of spurning us requests 
for help in the removal of mines from afghanistan 
we have contacted the soviet union on several occasions at a 
high level to request soviet cooperation with the un effort to 
clear the millions of mines that have been strewn throughout 
afghanistan spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the soviet union has been specifically asked to provide maps 
of minefields the un has also been in touch with the soviet 
government on this problem she said to date were not aware 
of any significant soviet effort to remove mines 
a soviet spokesman in moscow said earlier the soviets had not 
deployed the mines and were indeed helping to remove them 
but mrs oakley did not back away from a statement monday by 
spokesman charles e redman that mines left in place by the soviets 
and the afghan army were a big problem for the refugees as they 
contemplate returning to the wartorn country 
many of the mines redman said are disguised as toys many 
others are socalled butterfly explosives that cause limited 
damage but the overall total which he placed at 10 million to 30 
million amounts to 1 to 3 mines for every afghan 
these mines are strewn throughout the countryside and so its 
difficult to come up with a precise figure he said 
redman said the mines were deployed by the soviet army and by 
the afghan forces engaged in an 8year war with usbacked 
guerrillas 
the united nations is exerting strong leadership in 
encouraging a program of mineawareness and minedetection the 
us official said 
he suggested however there was not much the united states 
could do right now to help and that the soviets were not 
identifying the locations of the dangerous devices 
i am not aware of any assistance of that kind redman said 
but again i guess id have to refer to the united nations for a 
definitive readout on that 
in moscow today foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
denied the us allegation 
we would like to state again that we are not involved in any 
mining gerasimov said adding that soviet soldiers have been 
helping afghans remove and defuse mines planted by opposition 
forces along major roads 
there were up to 115000 soviet troops in afghanistan until the 
red army began to withdraw under the geneva agreement between the 
promoscow government in kabul and neighboring pakistan which 
funneled us missiles and other arms to guerrilla factions 
half of the soviet troops were supposed to be gone by monday 
while the state department reserved judgment until the results of 
inspections were tallied redman was authorized to provide an 
encouraging account 
i would offer just two observations he said we have seen 
evidence of an accelerated soviet departure from afghanistan over 
the past few weeks and second all of eastern and southern 
afghanistan now appear to be free of soviet forces 
based on us information in hand redman said we dont 
really have anything that would suggest that theyre not adhering 
to their commitment 
the soviets moved into afghanistan in december 1979 to support a 
promoscow government at war with the usaided guerrillas 
the fighting presumably will continue however but possibly 
without american weapons for the rebels if moscow suspends its 
arming of the afghan government redman declined to predict the 
outcome 
in the meantime redman said our support to the mujahedeen 
continues as they fight the government of president najibullah 
which doesnt enjoy popular support 
beyond that the us spokesman said i dont think were at a 
position where we could pinpoint what the future of the afghan 
government is going to be what its going to look like 
many of the guerrillas called freedom fighters by the 
reagan administration are fundamentalist moslems with an outlook 
similar to that of the governing powers in nearby iran 
last month some us officials were concerned about the pace of 
the soviet pullout they said soviet military leaders had found 
withdrawing under rebel fire difficult and that the soviet military 
commander in kabul had indicated that thousands of new troops would 
be sent to the embattled country 
the commanders remarks were conveyed to president mohammad zia 
alhaq of pakistan by the united nations team that is monitoring 
the red armys withdrawal 
zia then touched off alarm bells with a statement that the 
soviets decided not only to stop their withdrawal but they have 
brought in something like 10000 troops back from the soviet union 
into kabul because kabul was under threat 
several us officials who were watching the situation closely 
said however there was no hard evidence that troops were 
returning to afghanistan although meeting the aug 15 deadline 
could be difficult 
the soviet military commander in kabul may have spoken without 
the authorization of his superiors in moscow or he may have been 
trying to unsettle the pakistanis who channeled us weapons to 
the rebels and took in hundreds of thousands of afghan refugees 
officials said 
we may never understand what happened one us official 
said maybe the soviet general was speaking prematurely or they 
were trying to get the pakistanis off balance when he made the 
statement to zia 
in any event the basic fact of the matter is there is no 
evidence of a reintroduction of soviet troops said the 
official who like others spoke on condition of anonymity

the irony of playing host to the republican 
national convention in a city that missed the prosperity of the 
reagan years isnt lost on new orleans mayor sidney barthelemy 
that was another reason to have the convention here maybe 
they owed it to us said barthelemy a democrat 
louisianas unemployment rate has been no 1 or 2 in the country 
for the last three years 
it was such an issue in the 1983 governors race that edwin 
edwards pledged to reject his 73000 annual salary until the 
states joblessness dropped below the national average 
edwards served his last four years gratis 
it will be an issue in the november election said former rep 
henson moore rla who lost a bid for the senate in 1986 the 
year the president reagans coattails didnt hold too many 
candidates 
moore said his defeat in 1986 was a message to the reagan 
administration oilmen wanted an oil import fee but the 
administration refused to approve the tariff 
i dont believe voters are going to blame bush like they did 
me and reagan in 1986 moore said but louisiana is going to be 
a difficult state and bush is going to have to work hard to carry 
it 
overall louisianas fortunes began to tumble with the price of 
oil on the world market in 1982 an estimated 152000 jobs have 
been lost since then 
a decreased demand for south louisiana petrochemical products 
and the competition from canada with north louisiana timber 
exacerbated the problem 
in june 1979 louisianas unemployment rate was 76 percent in 
new orleans it was 70 percent the national rate was 56 percent 
according to allen johnson spokesman for the state department of 
labor 
louisiana was on a knifes edge between inflation and 
recession said a june 1979 lsu business review the state was 
cut by recession 
new orleans outofwork peaked at 117 percent in february 
1985 he said the state was at its worst since the great 
depression with a 145 percent jobless rate on january 1987 
johnson said 
in june 1988 the state logged in with 105 percent unemployed 
nearly twice the national rate of 55 percent new orleans was only 
slightly better at 93 percent out of work 
we have not been treated particularly poorly by the federal 
government said dr michael conte associate director of the 
division of business and economic research at the university of new 
orleans 
for example he said federal government employment increased by 
8 percent over the last five years in new orleans the rate of 
growth for federal jobs was 74 percent

soviet historians and officials on tuesday 
defended the 1940 takeover of the baltic states as necessary for 
the survival of the soviet union at a time when it was isolated and 
insecure at the brink of world war ii 
it had to be decided to be or not to be we had an 
opportunity to choose the least of the evils and understandably we 
opted for the to be part said valentin m falin chairman of 
the novosti press agency 
at a news briefing falin never acknowledged that estonia 
lithuania and latvia were forcibly incorporated into the soviet 
union instead he referred to the transfer of the baltic states 
to the north 
falin was one of six panelists at the briefing who seemed to 
defend the molotovribbentrop pact without acknowledging its 
existence 
the pact between the soviet union and germany was signed aug 
23 1939 by soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov and german 
foreign minister joachim ribbentrop it promised nonaggression 
between the two countries and in a secret provision paved the 
way for the soviet takeover of the three independent baltic states 
and the german invasion of poland 
the estonian newspaper voice of the nation and estonian radio 
last week disclosed details of the agreement for the first time in 
the soviet media although residents of the baltic states generally 
know of the agreement some had been pressing for its publication 
on the basis that the soviet union should own up to its existence 
activists view the pact as proof that the baltics were 
incorporated forcibly into the soviet union 
the panelists at the briefing organized by novosti said the 
documents published by the estonian newspaper have not been 
authenticated and they knew of no plans to publish them in latvia 
or lithuania as well 
the attempts to find original versions have failed falin 
said the copies published in the press do they reflect what is 
real this is unknown 
nationalist sentiment in the baltic republics has risen 
especially since soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev introduced his 
policy of greater openness in the country three years ago 
last year lithuanian estonian and latvian activists 
demonstrated on the 48th anniversary of the pact rallies are 
expected for the 49th anniversary next week 
falin said josef stalin believed the germans intended to expand 
north by way of the baltics rather than westward he said 
anticommunist sentiment was at a peak in the 1930s making europe 
and the united states distrustful of the soviet union 
since 1933 and 1934 the soviet union had been trying to set 
up a system of collective security in europe regrettably the idea 
was countered at the official level by negative reaction against 
soviets falin said 
it was considered better by western powers to lose 
czechoslovakia than to save it at the hands of the soviet union 
the world thought was not to let the soviet union participate in 
major international decisions he said 
falin characterized polish rule at the time as bourgeois and 
semifascist and claimed the poles and germans were negotiating a 
possible joint action against the soviet union 
the three panelists who were from the baltics said some the 
republics citizens but not the majority opposed the soviet 
unions move into their region 
baltic nationalists say the soviets moved masses of troops into 
the republics when soviet soldiers outnumbered native baltic 
citizens elections incorporating the countries into the soviet 
union were held 
estonians and latvians fought for socialism said olaf 
kuuli a history professor from the estonian capital of tallinn 
but they wanted a true socialism unfortunately not all of those 
hopes came true we know that the socialist system was deformed and 
that the purges of stalin and the mass deportations at the time 
were true 
stalin had thousands of native baltic citizens deported because 
he said they were nazi collaborators or otherwise antisoviet 
kuuli called for the rehabilitation of those accused by stalin of 
being disloyal 
falin said stalin had to make decisions about handling the 
baltic states under extraordinary conditions and should not be 
secondguessed 
to paint him black and criticize everything that had to do 
with him or his decisions i do not think will do any service to the 
truth the novosti chief said 
stalin pursued a course for the protection of the state 
interest as he understood the state interest do we have the right 
to say today that there was this and this alternative that was 
never taken 
also at the briefing were erik zagar a latvian historian romas 
sarmaitis department head of the party history institute under the 
lithuanian communist party central committee historian mi 
semiryaga and la bezymensky a historian and political analyst 
for new times magazine

michael dukakis today borrowed president 
reagans facts are stubborn things line in listing what he said 
were reagan administration problems that would become the central 
issues in the presidential campaign 
the democratic presidential nominee pointed to todays 
announcement that the june trade deficit had widened dramatically 
to recent prime rate increases and to a report earlier in the year 
that serious crime had risen around the nation 
facts are stubborn things and these are the facts that we are 
going to be debating dukakis told reporters it will be mr 
bush who has to respond to these facts 
reagan in his address to the republican national convention 
monday night had repeated his 1984 list of democratic 
shortcomings prefacing each with facts are stubborn things 
dukakis dismissed reagans criticism of democrats as the party 
of inflation saying its the administration that has to defend 
itself against new inflationary pressures 
we are back in an inflationary spiral dukakis told a 
meeting of newspaper editors from central massachusetts its the 
direct result of eight years of fiscal irresponsibility 
the vice president is going to have to defend the reagan 
fiscal record dukakis said i dont know how he is going to do 
it 
dukakis also attacked bush on the environment saying 
republicans came to washington bound and determined to destroy 
the epa environmental protection agency and that the vice 
president was part of that 
this administrations record on the environment is zero he 
said 
he also denounced reagan for vetoing the defense authorization 
bill saying the president made a strictly political veto of a 
measure that had broad bipartisan support 
now weve got mass confusion in addition to all the scandal 
dukakis said thats not the way you build a strong america 
on monday dukakis said leadership and not republican 
namecalling will determine the winner in november 
i dont think its going to do any political damage the 
democratic presidential nominee said of the dukakisbashing taking 
place at the gop gathering in new orleans 
the massachusetts governor dismissed the criticism and 
predicted reagans personal popularity will not give much of a 
boost to bush 
dukakis cited an l word of his own leadership to counter 
the liberal tag placed on him by republicans 
the l word in this campaign is leadership dukakis said in 
shrewsbury during the first day of a twoday visit to central 
massachusetts in the last analysis people are going to be 
looking at me and mr bush and they are going to be looking at 
which one of us has the leadership abilities 
he noted that reagan campaigned actively for gop senate 
candidates in 1986 but could not keep democrats from regaining 
control of the senate

the legislature today overwhelmingly 
approved a bill aimed at doing away with a centuryold county 
purchasing system the fbi found was rife with corruption 
the house passed the bill 1117 and the senate 500 it now goes 
to gov ray mabus who had hailed the measure as a tremendous 
victory against corruption and for effective government 
for the first time the government of the state of mississippi 
is on record for honest and efficient government mabus said 
after the legislation won final approval 
passage came on the seventh day of a special session called by 
mabus in response to an fbi probe of purchasing practices that 
resulted in the arrest of 56 supervisors in 25 counties on charges 
ranging from mail fraud to extortion 
the legislature had failed in this years regular session to 
agree on anticorruption legislation 
the bill would require counties to adopt central purchasing 
systems some form of which already exists in 22 of the states 82 
counties but leaves in voters hands exactly how far the 
reorganization should go 
currently county supervisors oversee all purchasing in their 
districts the new system would give an appointed administrator 
power over daytoday purchasing for the entire county while 
keeping policy in the hands of supervisors 
however the bill gives voters in each county the right to veto

democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen said today that president reagans coattails will be very 
short in helping george bush try to win the presidency 
asked about the presidents speech monday night to the 
republican national convention bentsen said reagan had an 
adoring crowd and they enjoyed each other 
i also believe that in the convention and after the 
convention as we go into the election that its george bush 
people are looking to not ronald reagan he said and ronald 
reagans coattails will be very short 
the texas senators comments came during a visit to the big hill 
strategic petroleum reserve here a stop designed to show off the 
democratic tickets support for the program the six underground 
petroleum reserves are vaults of crude oil that can be tapped in a 
national emergency 
bentsen told about 50 workers at the plant that their program is 
crucial to the national security of the country 
it was the latest stop in bentsens home state campaign to grab 
all the attention he can in texas while the republicans dominate 
the national news from new orleans 
bentsen on monday was in houston talking about another industry 
in texas that has suffered lately the space program 
he visited the johnson space flight center and announced that 
dukakis would favor building a permanent manned space station 
we will support an allout effort to restore american 
leadership in exploring the universe he said in a speech to the 
greater houston chamber of commerce 
president reagan is a longtime supporter of the space station 
but bentsen said the administration has failed to bring the space 
agency back to top form since the challenger disaster 
bentsen also announced that if dukakis were elected the new 
president would quickly reinstitute a cabinetlevel council on 
space with the texas senator at its head 
lyndon johnson another texan was put in charge of the space 
council when he was vice president the board was later abolished 
by president nixon and reagan has killed efforts in congress to 
put it back in operation 
texas has 29 electoral votes and bentsen is trying to make good 
on his boast that the democrats will carry the state this fall the 
nineday campaign trip almost entirely in texas was designed to 
keep his name in the papers and on local television while vice 
president george bush another texan is receiving all that 
attention in new orleans 
were doing everything we can in these local markets to blow 
the republicans off the front page said campaign spokesman mike 
mccurry

in works toward securing the mines property to leave the 
premises the staterun pap news agency said 
as of tuesday night 700 workers still were in the mine the

that wage demands were not high on the miners agenda 
legalizaton of the solidarity union is among the chief demands 
made by the miners said solidarity spokeswoman katarzyna 
ketrzynska 
the workers also want mine management to reinstate workers fired

workers also are demanding better working conditions and pay 
increases 
the action began when the overnight shift refused to take up 
their tools they were joined by workers arriving for the morning 
shift kuron said 
kuron said mine management then locked out members of the 
afternoon shift to prevent them from joining the strike 
solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby borynia mine 
staged a brief sympathy rally but went back to work at noon 
jastrzebie is located about 280 miles southwest of warsaw in the 
heart of silesia polands most vital industrial and mining region 
security officials meanwhile briefly detained 10 solidarity 
leaders at the rudna copper mine near the city of wroclaw in lower

crews were taken to the mines management building for safety 
training there was no production at the mine tuesday he said

jesus christs teachings are being ignored by 
those who would prevent others from seeing the last temptation of 
christ says actress barbara hershey the movies mary magdalene 
its so obvious when you see the film that its intentions 
are religious said ms hershey who introduced the movies 
director martin scorsese to the nikos kazantzakis novel upon 
which the movie is based 
these people have a perfect right not to see the film but 
they dont have a right to tell everyone else that they cant 
she said fundamentalist christians have protested the movie since 
it opened in seven cities in the united states and two in canada 
last week 
christs teachings are about love and generosity and im 
certainly not seeing that in these demonstrations the actress 
said in a telephone interview from her connecticut home what 
happened to judge not lest ye be judged and let he who is 
without sin cast the first stone 
ms hershey whose credits include hannah and her sisters 
and tin men told scorsese about the book in 1972 when they 
were working together on the movie boxcar bertha 
as i got to know him i could see his wit and humor and the 
incredibly complex investment he had in religion she said i 
immediately thought of the book in terms of marty i told him he 
should make it into a film 
he says i also told him that i should play mary magdalene i 
dont remember actually saying that but it sure sounds like me 
years later when the film finally was being cast she recalled 
i auditioned for months i did three screen tests 
marty told me later that he had me work so hard because i 
really had to prove to him that i was the best for the role he 
didnt want to give it to me for any obligatory reasons

the vice president watched reagans speech on television monday 
night and then said he would do my level best to fill those big 
shoes of president ronald reagan 
george im in your corner reagan declared in an 
emotionally charged valedictory speech to a superdome audience 
packed to the rafters but george just one more personal 
request go out there and win one for the gipper

convention hall today chorused approval of a conservative platform 
for bush to use in his battle against michael dukakis

constitutional amendment to ban abortion and promises rapid and 
certain deployment of the star wars missile defense plan also 
known as the strategic defense initiative

childcare tax credits for lowincome families increased spending 
on head start and a new merit schools program and taxfree 
savings bonds to pay for college there was not a single dissenting 
report for the full convention to debate

from new orleans i dont think its going to do any political 
damage the massachusetts governor said in the last analysis

someplace over alabama or maybe mississippi 
winging his way to the republican national convention george bush 
unsheathed his thursday night acceptance speech and rehearsed it 
for his wife 
she stayed awake for the whole thing bush said in 
describing tuesdays midair drama 
for the whole thing she stayed awake for the whole thing 
there he goes again george bush is raising expectations for his 
conventionclimax address it is a pressure situation he is no 
william jennings bryan but hell do ok 
this was not quite the dukakis approach 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis like george 
bush does not enjoy a reputation as a marvelous and commanding 
public speaker people laugh at his dense delivery and his 
seemingly endless repetition of sophomoric rhetoric 
a real war not a phoney war on drugs 
good jobs at good wages and i dont mean flipping hamburgers 
and doing other peoples laundry 
zorba the clerk the critics called dukakis 
so the expectations were pretty low for the democratic nominees 
convention speech and that was before kitty took her catnap when 
it comes to lowering expectations the kittycatnap will go down in 
history 
to hear dukakis tell it hed spent the better part of a week 
mulling and writing and honing his acceptance speech when kitty 
asked if she could take a look 
i said ok and she went into the bedroom he said when i 
went into the room myself to get my jacket my wife was fast asleep 
on the bed and the speech was beside her half read 
and so when dukakis gave his address and it was good and it 
was delivered with passion and force he seemed transformed as the 
saying goes thats the way to do it 
for better or worse that isnt the way bush is going about his 
business 
he knows expectations are low and he figures if he doesnt stand 
up for himself who will and so full tilt he has been raising 
expectations even to the extent of borrowing the dukakis catnap 
anecdote and turning it upside down for barbara bush 
to hear bush tell it he is the comeback kid weighing in and 
bragging in advance that its in the bag he told bryant gumbel of 
nbcs today youre an athlete im an athlete theres a lot 
of pressure out there you can feel it building but ive been in 
pressure situations before 
republican delegates are well aware of the importance of the 
thursday night address if bush is to overtake dukakis 
i think his image should be sharpened and his acceptance 
speech should do that said nancy chinlee of delaware he can 
low key it for a while but not much longer 
he needs to improve his image but i dont know what he should 
do said delegate kitty stark of chattanooga one thing he 
ought to get hornrimmed glasses instead of those awful clear ones 
he wears now 
tom adam of pierre sd said it will help that bush is now out 
from under president reagans shadow 
his lightbulb was under somebody elses shade and when he 
turns it on hell be all right adam said i think when people 
get an idea of his background how deep he is the polls will take 
care of themselves

commerical airlines are jeopardizing safety by 
putting more hightechnology planes into service without properly 
training pilots to use them the leader of the airline pilots 
largest union said tuesday 
henry a duffy president of the air line pilots association 
representing 41000 us pilots said an overloaded air traffic 
control system and a shortage of experienced pilots made the need 
for better pilot training even more crucial 
even though this need has long been recognized very little 
has been done to improve pilot training he told an air safety 
forum sponsored by the pilots union 
duffy said a combination of new problems in the us airline 
industry including inadequate training for pilots flying 
hightechnology aircraft with fully automated cockpits had led to 
an erosion of the critical margin of safety thats absolutely 
necessary in the operation of commercial air carriers 
we cant continue to chip away at this safety margin and not 
expect to suffer the consequences he said 
an independent expert told the pilots forum that the 
introduction of fully automated cockpits while reducing the 
frequency of human errors had made some pilots feel alienated from 
the aircraft 
the pilot feels himself moved from the center of the cockpit 
to the periphery said earl wiener an air safety expert at the 
university of miami 
as a joke meant to illustrate this feeling of alienation wiener 
listed what he called the questions most frequently asked by pilots 
in advanced cockpits 
what is it doing now 
why did it do that 
what is it going to do next

both us and soviet nuclear scientists 
prepared elaborate detection equipment tuesday for a historic 
nuclear weapons test in which both superpowers will be represented 
at the nevada test site 
technically everything looks aok said department of 
energy spokeswoman chris sankey 
wednesdays test codenamed kearsarge will be the ninth 
conducted at the desert site this year and the 684th announced shot 
there since january 1951 
some of the soviet scientists have been at the town of mercury 
for six of this years previous tests but kearsarge is the first 
time nuclear scientists from either country have been allowed on 
the others highly sensitive sites 
wednesdays test is designed to test the ability of the two 
countries to measure the size of each others nuclear tests such 
verification is needed to determine whether the two superpowers are 
living within the 150kiloton limit set in treaties that were 
signed in 1974 and 1976 but never ratified 
scientists and diplomats said the experiment is a critical first 
step toward a possible test ban 
diplomats who helped forge the historic event were at mercury a 
tiny town 65 miles northwest of las vegas that serves as a base 
camp for the nations nuclear tests 
some 45 soviet nuclear scientists were scheduled to be on site 
for wednesdays detonation with most of them watching from a 
control point 30 miles from ground zero 
a like number of american nuclear scientists are scheduled to 
witness a soviet nuclear test at the soviet site at semipalatinsk 
in midseptember 
the us and soviet scientists checked out sophisticated 
equipment tuesday that is housed in trailers a few hundred yards 
from ground zero 
the trailer areas were fenced off and armed guards checked 
everyone entering and leaving signs on the fence read security 
area deadly force authorized 
the crew of a doe helicopter patrolling the site picked up two 
antinuclear protesters in a remote desert canyon on a bombing and 
gunnery range adjoining the secret site they were taken to us 95 
west of the test site and released 
the 25 million test known as the joint verification 
experiment comes nearly four years after president reagan proposed 
such a project in a speech to the united nations 
the verification tests were agreed to by reagan and general 
secretary mikhail gorbachev at the washington summit last december 
scientists from the us and the soviet union will be measuring 
the explosive punch of a thermonuclear device 
the device scheduled for detonation was encased in a steel 
canister buried 2020 feet beneath the scenic 7500foot mesa the 
canister painted red white and blue was 8 feet tall 88 inches 
in diameter and weighed 7 tons soviet scientists were allowed to 
look at the canister only after it was sealed 
the device with an explosive force nearly 12 times the bomb 
that destroyed hiroshima was large enough to send shock waves 
through upper levels of las vegas hotelcasinos and rattle 
chandeliers at historic scottys castle in nearby death valley 
calif 
managers of highrise buildings in las vegas received their 
standard warning not to have workers in precarious positions at the 
time of detonation 
doe spokeswoman barbara yoerg said the two antinuclear 
demonstrators were spotted on the nellis bombing and gunnery range 
which borders the 1350squaremile test site on three sides 
chris brown of the antinuclear american peace test announced 
monday that the two had infiltrated the test site saturday night 
with the intent of hiking to ground zero and delaying the test 
but ms yoerg said the two never made it to the test site 
boundary

republican delegates chorused their approval 
tuesday of a booklength 1988 platform that courts conservatives 
cudgels democrats and commits the gop to a child care tax credit as 
well as rapid deployment of the strategic defense initiative 
nebraska gov kay orr the platform chairman called it a 
rallying cry for all those who share our values 
there was neither dissent nor debate on a single plank the hall 
was halfempty as orr and other platform leaders spent 45 minutes 
singing the praises of their 40000word declaration of philosophy 
titled an american vision for our children and our future 
i didnt hear any nos orr said after finishing her work 
and producing a document that speaks to scores of issues from the 
spacebased defense shield that it extols to a heifer tax that it 
opposes 
orr who has said it would cost 43 billion to carry out 
programs implicit in the democrats platform was unable to say how 
much it would cost to make good on the gops promises pressed for 
an estimate she said its a busy week 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
later in a speech to the conventions evening session orr 
boasted that the gop document is far far superior to the 
platform the democrats cobbled together in atlanta 
you wont find some very basic words in the democratic 
platform words like tax or revenue or unemployment you 
wont find any mention of nato you wont find the words church 
or synagogue orr said they dont want the people to 
know that they are still the party that will raise taxes and weaken

marilyn thayer of new orleans called it our loveletter to the 
american family she said the platform stands on our 
judeochristian tradition it spells the doom of corruption in 
government and of pornography 
were not just against abortion were for adoption reform 
for more tax relief for families and an allout crusade against 
infant morality and birth defects she said 
even mothers at home with kids would benefit from the child care 
tax credit because republicans know every mom is a firstclass 
mom and were going to help them all said thayer 
its hard to take a stand on controversial issues but we 
republicans would rather take a stand than take a walk said 
patricia goodrich of madison wis 
the platform toes the conservative line on taxes abortion and 
defense it accuses the democrats of tolerating corruption and 
calls for subjecting congress itself to civil rights health and 
safety laws 
the 104page text is 25 percent longer than the 1984 gop 
platform and eight times the length of the barebones platform the 
democrats approved in atlanta four weeks ago 
the gop platform echoes the 1984 document in pledging no tax 
increases calling for a constitutional human life amendment to 
ban abortion and promising peace through strength 
it promotes george bushs positions in favor of childcare tax 
credits for lowincome families increased funds for head start a 
new merit schools program and taxfree savings bonds for 
college 
it calls for compassion and help for those who suffer from 
aids but also stresses the need to protect those who do not have 
the disease 
it became certain monday there would be no minority planks when 
the 106member republican platform committee approved the document 
with only two dissenting votes sen lowell p weicker jr and mary 
boatwright both of connecticut 
no one attempted to gather the 27 signatures needed to file a 
minority report 
boatwright was returning home after injuring her leg monday in

more than 200 people are imprisoned without charge 
in benin and many have been tortured amnesty international said 
wednesday in a report on human rights in the west african country 
the report alleges that some of the prisoners have been detained 
for up to three years while 100 were arrested in march and april 
on suspicion of being involved in a conspiracy against the 
government 
the human rights organization identified most of the prisoners 
as armed forces personnel including a police chief lt col 
francois kouyami and a member of the presidential guard identified 
only as capt hountondji 
the arrests over the alleged conspiracy took place in the area 
of abomey capital of the former kingdom of dahomey amnesty 
international said the countrys name was changed from dahomey to 
benin in 1975 
it said abomey was an area of considerable economic unrest 
caused by government measures introduced in recent months 
including a reported plan to store european nuclear waste in saklo 
just south of abomey 
official beninois sources have since reported that benin has 
shelved the plan which provoked sharp protest from neighboring 
countries 
the report said at least half the prisoners held without trial 
are prisoners of conscience imprisoned solely for the 
nonviolent exercise of their basic human rights to freedom of 
expression and association 
it said at least one prisoner remy glele akpokpo died in 
custody 
it said prisoners were subjected to prolonged beatings and 
whippings sometimes in front of spectators one form of torture 
described by former prisoners is the rodeo in which victims 
are made to crawl on sharp stony ground while being beaten 
benin a former french colony became independent in 1960 and 
underwent six military coups until 1972 when the present 
president frenchtrained paratrooper mathieu kerekou seized power 
and installed a marxist government

new orleans ap with fetes and eats and welcoming arms in 
hotels and meeting halls and restaurants across this 
conventionconsumed city business is buddying up to the republican 
party 
try suite 2886 of the hilton hotel where the food marketing 
institute beckons with free liquor hors doeuvres and a river 
view the catch so far a hundred bites with rep bob michel of 
illinois as the biggest fish 
uninterested in tales of the travails of the nations 
supermarkets try the delta airlines hospitality suite hit 
bellsouths free food at windsor court drop by the reception 
sponsored by middle south utilities 
the enticements are many the official convention calendar lists 
more than 50 corporatesponsored parties for delegates party and 
elected leaders and aides this week many more events did not make 
the list 
such affairs are nothing new to the political scene many of the 
same companies held similar parties for the democrats in atlanta 
last month their credo ideology aside in politics goodwill is 
good business 
theres no arm twisting no hard sell its primarily meet and 
greet and make friends said raymond friedlob a delegate from 
denver they have a chance to tell their story to an audience 
thats willing to listen 
as straightforward as it may seem however the corporate 
presence is troubling to some delegates who fear having the gop 
tagged as the party of big business 
the whole issue is how organizations corporations 
associations of interest groups finance candidates and do favors 
for candidates i find it a disturbing one said sherry nemmers 
an alternate delegate from portland maine my concern is 
appearances 
you have a lot of money flowing around she said the 
source of that money is always going to be open to question about 
its intended purpose 
nemmers nonetheless attended a bellsouth reception for elizabeth 
and sen bob dole of kansas at a posh hotel this week because 
she said it was her only chance to see them in an intimate setting 
the free spread included champagne and bloody marys eggs 
benedict and sliced kiwis were she running for public office back 
in maine nemmers was quick to say id have avoided it like the 
plague 
another elected official dole himself did not share those 
reservations about corporate sponsorships though both he and his 
wife were defensive in commenting on the businessbacked events 
we know all the people anyway its nice dole said they 
live here and they have business here and they want to be welcomed 
and i think its great nothing sinister about it 
i dont know anything about that really i was not in on 
any of the planning of the events said mrs dole the former 
us transportation secretary they asked to be hosts people 
are enjoying it and the idea is to have a good time so i dont see 
that theres any problem with that 
one or both of the doles were listed on the official schedule 
for eight businesssponsored receptions and lunches this week 
courtesy of groups from the american trucking association and 
general motors to avon 
one of the biggest corporate players is bellsouth the regional 
phone company is sponsoring a dozen events this week including a 
brunch for 150 congress members state gop chairmen and executives 
bellsouth also runs a free lunchroom for the news media 
were a major player in the telecommunications industry 
said dan mattoon a bellsouth lobbyist we want to be involved 
with members of congress and others who are involved in our 
issues 
there are other ways for corporations to spread good will at 
political conventions many donated to the fund new orleans 
established to defray its costs others are paying up to 100000 
for tables at a gala fundraiser for the republican party this 
week while corporations cant give directly to political 
candidates they can give to the party and sponsor parties 
take delta airlines its running two hospitality suites one 
equipped with firstclass airplane seats for visitors who want a 
snooze its buying lunch for the utah delegation salt lake city 
is the hub of western airlines which delta took over last year 
and its laying out a sixcourse luncheon at arnauds a french 
quarter restaurant for 200 guests led by lawmakers with a hand in 
transportation policy 
if somebody knows you they can believe what youre saying 
said delta spokesman william d berry they can come to you and 
say delta this bill is surfacing what do you think of it is it 
good for the industry or bad 
we like that input we need that input this is a chance for 
us to be known by these people and for us to know them

burma said tuesday it has released 51 
people who were detained during bloody antigovernment protests 
last week that led to the resignation of president sein lwin 
the release came as student groups in the capital of rangoon 
distributed leaflets calling for more protests wednesday against 
burmas oneparty government diplomats and journalists said 
the official radio monitored in bangkok said the 51 prisoners 
released from insein prison on the outskirts of rangoon included 37 
male students 10 female students and four civilians 
it also said 30 people arrested earlier this month in 
disturbances in pegu 45 miles northeast of the capital were freed 
on sunday 
the releases were the first since violent nationwide 
demonstrations ended friday with the resignation of sein lwin a 
hardline former general 
radio rangoon said a week ago that authorities had arrested more 
than 700 demonstrators later it reported 1451 arrests in rangoon 
but did not make clear if that included the 700 mentioned earlier 
the protests were the most massive since burma achieved 
independence from britain in 1948 
in a sweep last month following sein lwins elevation to the top 
post authorities arrested the countrys most prominent dissident 
aung gyi as well as associated press correspondent sein win there 
was no indication that they were among those who were freed 
life in rangoon continued its slow return to normal tuesday 
soldiers maintained their guard on police stations for fear of 
attacks similar to those in which three policemen were beheaded by 
protesters last week 
a western diplomat in rangoon said trucks and tanks with up to 
200 soldiers were parked on merchant street in the center of the 
city about 200 yards from the us embassy 
the show of force appeared to be a precaution because posters 
called for continued protests said the diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity he said the vehicles were gone by tuesday 
and there was only a light troop presence in the rest of the 
capital 
the ruling burma socialist program party and the countrys 
legislature have scheduled emergency sessions for friday 
presumably to choose a successor to sein lwin who served only 17 
days and was hated for brutally crushing dissent 
sein lwin took over when ne win resigned abruptly as leader 
after 26 years of authoritarian rule 
most analysts believe the countrys next ruler will be an active 
or retired military officer from the enduring hierarchy of ne win 
whose coming to power in a 1962 military coup ended burmas 
experiment with democracy 
diplomats and tourists arriving in bangkok from burma on tuesday 
said among the seven demands listed by protesters in leaflets and 
posters were a multiparty democracy the release of political 
dissidents including aung gyi a court trial of sein lwin and the 
legalization of student unions 
students also have called for major changes in leadership 
reductions in the cost of living and compensation for families of 
people killed or wounded in last weeks demonstrations 
in a sign of discontent within the system 177 burmese lawyers 
signed a document charging that by firing against peaceful 
demonstrators including children security forces violated the 
burmese constitution and the un declaration of human rights 
japans kyodo and chinas xinhua news agencies reported from 
rangoon that the lawyers council an organization under the 
governments council of peoples attorneys submitted its protest 
to the council of state or presidents office 
radio rangoon has said at least 95 people were killed and 240 
wounded in protests in two dozen towns last week but western 
diplomats believe the toll was much higher 
no major rallies have been reported since sein lwin resigned 
but a senior western diplomat said the recent leaflet and poster 
campaign indicated massive street protests would resume unless 
authorities meet demands for leadership changes and multiparty 
democracy 
another rangoonbased diplomat said that while some students 
would be satisfied with nothing less than dismantling oneparty 
rule rankandfile protesters might stay off the streets if 
authorities make gradual concessions

vice president salvador laurel said 
tuesday that government policy is drifting aimlessly under 
president corazon aquino and he gave her one week to resign 
a roman catholic cardinal urged the leaders to settle their 
differences 
presidential spokesman teodoro benigno said mrs aquino has not 
replied to a letter from laurel that accused her government of 
incompetence and urged her to resign and call new elections 
i dont want to appear to be threatening her so i give her 
one week laurel told reporters he did not elaborate 
in the letter released saturday laurel offered to resign along 
with mrs aquino if she refused laurel said he would 
dissociate himself from her government 
if she does not resign i will not resign as vice 
president laurel said i will simply disengage myself from 
her administration and speak out freely to expose all the acts that 
are prejudicial to the national interest 
he said mrs aquino was running the government without direction 
and basing her decisions on maintaining her popularity 
her policy is drifting aimlessly swaying wherever the wind 
blows said laurel what happens is that the ship of state is 
moving nowhere its not anchored she tries to please 
everybody but in the end she will please nobody 
cardinal ricardo vidal said it would not be wise for mrs aquino 
to resign as it will create a stoppage of ongoing government 
programs 
mrs aquinos resignation will have a big negative effect on 
the administration vidal told reporters so i propose that she 
and laurel sit down and talk their problems over to prevent a 
discontinuity in government 
the countrys other cardinal jaime l sin said he would not 
offer advice in the dispute unless there is an occasion 
in 1985 sin convinced laurel to abandon his presidential 
ambitions and run as mrs aquinos vice presidential candidate 
against president ferdinand marcos who was ousted in a 
civilianmilitary uprising that brought the current government to 
power 
laurels growing isolation from the aquino administration began 
in september when he resigned as foreign secretary because of 
fundamental differences 
on monday laurel met with leaders of political opposition 
groups including sen juan ponce enrile and marcos new society 
movement to try to assemble a new opposition alliance 
enrile said he supported laurels position on mrs aquino but 
stopped short of endorsing early elections the next presidential 
election is scheduled for may 1992

the red army wont speed up its withdrawal from 
afghanistan because moslem guerrillas there have rejected political 
overtures and continue fighting the sovietbacked government the 
government said tuesday 
the statement by foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
reversed previous official indications that all of the more than 
100000 soviet troops would be home by years end 
the situation in afghanistan does not give grounds to 
accelerate the withdrawal of soviet troops he told a regular 
news briefing 
gerasimov indicated the kremlin will stick to the timetable of 
the unmediated agreement signed april 14 in geneva it directed 
that the withdrawal begin may 15 with half the soviet forces gone 
by aug 15 and all removed from afghanistan by feb 15 1989 
a un statement confirmed tuesday that the aug 15 deadline had 
been met 
the guerrillas have increased their attacks on afghan government 
troops and there will be no early soviet withdrawal unless the 
insurgents stop fighting and join a proposed governing coalition 
gerasimov said 
for the time being there is no possibility to reduce the plan 
for withdrawing soviet troops he declared 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze had indicated the 
kremlin would like all its soldiers home by the end of the year 
the official news agency tass said monday the second phase of the 
withdrawal would begin in november 
afghan guerrillas began fighting after a communiist coup in 
april 1978 and soviet military forces entered the country in 
december 1978 
more than 5 million people have fled afghanistan at least 3 
million live in border cities and camps in pakistan that serve as 
bases and supply points for the insurgents 
the guerrillas were not a party to the geneva agreement and 
when it was signed said they would continue the civil war 
tass reported fierce fighting tuesday in kunduz a 
provincial capital captured by insurgents when soviet troops 
abandoned it two weeks ago 
president najib of afghanistan said monday his forces had 
recaptured the city but guerrilla groups claimed tuesday their 
fighters were holding it 
according to tass afghan soldiers killed 100 insurgents monday 
and tuesday around kunduz the city is north of kabul the capital 
and near the route used by red army troops moving north to the 
soviet border 
guerrillas also claim to have captured talogan capital of 
takhar province east of kunduz 
rocket attacks on kabul in the previous two days killed five 
people and wounded 11 tass said 
gerasimov denied american charges that departing soviet forces 
have left up to 30 million mines behind 
we would like to state again that we are not involved in any 
mining he declared the spokesman said soviet soldiers have 
helped afghans remove and defuse mines planted by guerrillas along 
major roads 
he accused the us state department of following a double 
standard by expressing concern for civilians exposed to mines but

an israeli peace crusader said tuesday he is 
trying to promote direct negotiations between israel and the 
palestine liberation organization and has pitched his plan to us 
and palestinian officials 
abie nathan who owns a shipboard radio station in the 
mediterranean called the voice of peace is meeting this week with 
american jewish leaders in new york to present his blueprint 
nathan said he had conceived his plan in the wake of the 
decision earlier this month by jordans king hussein to relinquish 
control of the israelioccupied west bank without the jordanian 
option we have a climate in which israel and the plo must talk to 
each other he said 
nathan declined to discuss specifics of his plan but said it 
would require an initial step by the plo and subsequent 
gestures by israel both israel and the united states have said 
they would not talk to the plo until it recognizes israels right 
to exist and renounces terrorism 
nathan said his plan was also based on the plo making certain 
gestures proving they can control the west bank 
earlier in the day a palestinian spokesman in iraq said the 
plos executive panel had approved the establishment of a 
provisional government in israelioccupied territories bassam abu 
sharif a spokesman for plo chief yasser arafat also called on the 
united states to support the formation of an independent 
palestinian state 
nathan who flew a light plane from israel to egypt in 1966 when 
the two countries were still at war said he had asked for a 
meeting with arafat and was awaiting a response he met last week 
in tunis with senior plo officials but arafat was away at the time 
nathan added 
he said he had met before with arafat 
israeli law forbids meetings with the plo but nathan said no 
law would stop him from crossing borders or talking to people who 
can bring about peace 
he said he had sent a message with someone to the israeli 
authorities informing them of his plans to meet with the plo 
officials they were aware of my plans he said 
nathan said he had met last week in washington with officials at 
the state department and would remain in new york at least another 
week to seek the support of jewish leaders 
the state department confirmed that nathan had met with deputy 
assistant secretary of state edward s walker but declined to 
discuss specifics of the conversation saying it was simply an 
exchange of views 
nathan an indianborn jew said he had asked the plo officials 
for information regarding five israeli soldiers missing in action

peasants started a fire that raged out of 
control tuesday in the grass and forests near the ancient ruins of 
the incas officials said tuesday 
the blaze which started a week ago has not endangered machu 
picchu the famed ruins of a mountaintop inca fortress according 
to nicanor moscoso president of the state commission for the 
preservation of machu picchu 
about 200 troops and firefighters are fighting the blaze which 
is burning out of control four miles south of machu picchu 
according to civil defense chief gen jorge ferreyros 
the lima daily el comercio said southerly winds have kept the 
blaze away from the ancient fortress but many smaller ruins that 
dot the region known as the sacred valley of the incas are 
threatened according to moscoso 
el comercio said the fire which has spread across 3750 acres 
of land about 300 miles southeast of lima was started by peasants 
who every year ignite tough old grass on the pastures to allow new 
growth 
el comercio said a river separates the blaze from villages near 
the resort of cuzco 40 miles south of machu picchu 
officials said a train carrying tourists to machu picchu from 
cuzco still was operating on tuesday

the nile has risen to its highest level 
for midaugust and threatens khartoum where torrential rains have 
left up to 15 million people homeless experts said tuesday 
the swollen river runs through the city still sodden from the 
deluge aug 45 more rain fell tuesday and large areas of the 
capital are isolated by vast p water and roads that 
have become impassable tracks of mud 
more than 150000 homes were destroyed and most people in the 
affected areas have yet to receive aid from a relief operation 
hampered by bad roads and lack of food and otheools of stagnantr supplies 
inundation by the nile would worsen the relief problems but 
officials are uncertain whether it will flood the city 
an important factor is whether rains at the ethiopian headwaters 
of the blue nile which joins the white nile at khartoum to form 
the nile river will further engorge the river 
another source of uncertainty about what awaits khartoum stems 
from ignorance about which parts of the nearly flat city are lowest 
and thus most vulnerable 
british cartographers lent to the united nations relief 
operation are working on a contour map of the city that will help 
determine at what height the nile waters would start pouring into 
the streets 
the cartographers told reporters and relers on monday lonsdale said 
the plateau straddles us soviet and international waters and 
until now moscow did not allow american scientists to conduct 
research in the soviet zone 
the plateau measures 250 miles by 60 miles and is part of a 
longer chain of volcanic islands and submerged seamounts that 
include hawaii 
it is a continuous trail of volcanic activity that leads 3500 
miles to hawaii a continuous line of volcanoes lonsdale said 
the theories we are testing have to do with what might cause this 
volcanic activity to start we know the result islands like 
hawaii 
some recent studies suggest that islands and seamounts were 
formed when weak spots in the earths crust passed over hot 
volcanic spots 
among the sophisticated hardware aboard the thomas washington is 
a high resolution bathymetric survey system known as sea beam made 
by the general instrument corp sea beam sends 16 simultaneous 
sonar signals toward the ocean floor measures the return time and 
uses a computer to make an acccurate topographic chart 
the expedition is also collecting rock samples and cores from 
the sea floor for later analysis lonsdale said 
while the scientific results of the expedition will take weeks 
or months to analyze it has already broken diplomatic ground 
the soviet union like the united states asseerts an economic 
zone 200 miles off its coasts but unlike washington moscow 
requires foreign scientists to obtain its permission to conduct 
research in those waters said william erb director of maritime 
sciences at the state department 
lonsdales expedition marks the first time in 10 years that 
the soviets have authorized a us research vessel to operate in 
their economic zone erb said 
the project was made possible by the exchange of diplomatic 
notes in late 1987 reviving for one year the usussr 
agreement on cooperation in studies of the world ocean which was 
signed in 1973 but allowed to lapse 
us and soviet officials will meet in washington starting oct 
3 to negotiate three more american expeditions in soviet waters 
under the agreement erb said 
previously he said the soviets had denied us permission and 
were acting in a way that we felt was not in conformance with the 
law of the sea and normal practice we raised the issue in 
bilateral diplomatic conversations but not in an international 
forum

the no 2 spot on the ticket said earlier he wanted to block 
adoption of the rule change so he and others could vote for someone 
else if they didnt like bushs selection 
aside from the change in the vice presidential nominating 
process and a few technical changes the new rules are the same as 
those passed by the 1984 convention

republican senate hopeful beau boulter 
unveiled his first major television ad campaign tuesday previewing 
a spot that will lampoon sen lloyd bentsen for running two races 
at once 
using humorous clips from several old movies the commercial 
shows actors trying to ride two horses at the same time holding up 
a saddle with no horse under it and falling off a horse into a hole 
we all wish we had two chances to win but any real texan will 
tell you can get hurt riding more than one horse at a time says 
the narrator 
bentsen was chosen last month as vice presidential running mate 
by massachusetts gov michael dukakis under texas 1959 lyndon 
law passed for then sen lyndon johnson bentsens name is 
allowed to appear on the texas ballot in both that race and his bid 
for a fourth senate term 
bentsen began airing his first round of senate election 
commercials last week boulter and his campaign manager greg 
graves complain that the senate and vice presidential campaigns 
overlap 
the message that i get from his television commercials is 
the people of texas should elect him to the us senate and then he 
will resign said boulter who is attending the gop national 
convention this week 
our commercial says that lloyd bentsen simply does not want to 
be the us senator for texas and that beau boulter does the 
amarillo congressman said 
the commercial narrators voice in a western twang also seeks 
to calls attention to the differences between texas and democrat 
dukakis home state 
lloyd bentsen says hes running in two races riding a cow 
pony to impress us back in texas and riding sidesaddle for his new 
massachusetts friends ol lloyd is really hedging his bets it

bishop college founded by freed slaves and once 
the largest black university west of the mississippi river has 
been forced by bankruptcy to shut its doors after 108 years 
we feel that its a tragedy that a college that had such great 
expertise in educating disadvantaged and minority students was not 
able to survive because there was no money available said 
harriet schimel vice president of communications for the united 
negro college fund 
the schools debts increased over the last few years and by 
april 1987 when it filed for protection from its creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code it owed 126 million to 
400 creditors 
by monday when it filed for chapter 7 proceedings the figure 
had grown to 20 million the school said it was unable to raise 
the 185 million needed to keep it opened 
liquidation of the colleges assets 21 buildings on 400 acres 
will begin as soon as a trustee is appointed 
im personally and professionally hurt said john q taylor 
king a longtime educator and former president of hustontillotson 
another black college in texas 
bishop founded in 1881 in the small northeast texas town of 
marshall built its reputation on its graduates among them 
lawyers teachers doctors and ministers 
the school moved to dallas in 1961 at the height of its 
success about 1500 students were enrolled in 1967 last year 
that figure had dipped to 300 
scandal rocked the school in the late 1970s when three top 
administrators were indicted on charges of embezzling student aid 
funds two were acquitted and one was convicted on a misdemeanor 
charge 
bishops image never recovered and neither did its fundraising 
efforts 
in december 1986 bishop lost accreditation from the southern 
association of colleges and schools which in turn forced the 
united negro college fund to stop contributing money 
though the school is bankrupt educators say the need for the 
college still exists 
the dropout rate for blacks is lower at historically black 
colleges than at other schools ms schimel said

ronald reagan didnt choose his vice 
presidential running mate until almost the last minute jimmy 
carter conducted a long boring search and adlai stevenson 
declined to choose at all they all did it their way and so did 
george bush 
bushs decision to keep everybody guessing until tuesday 
afternoon was the no 2 topic at the republican national 
convention which had little else to talk about no 1 of course 
was the choice itself 
bush brought all that speculation to an abrupt end tuesday 
afternoon with his announcement that he had selected sen dan 
quayle of indiana as his running mate 
in holding his cards close to his vest bush was only doing unto 
others what reagan did to him all evening on wednesday of 1980 
republican convention week in detroit it looked as if former 
president gerald ford would be reagans choice for vice president 
the way ford saw it if they won they would have sort of a shared 
presidency 
but at 1115 pm reagan and ford agreed not to be a team and 
bush received a telephone call as bush recalls in his 
autobiography the conversation went like this 
hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the 
convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if 
thats all right with you 
id be honored governor 
george is there anything at all about the platform or 
anything else anything that might make you uncomfortable down the 
road 
bush could think of nothing a few minutes after midnight 
reagan made an unusual trip to convention hall to announced his 
choice a dramatic end to a dramatic night of speculation and rumor 
despite the long list of vice presidential hopefuls that came to 
be interviewed in plains ga in 1976 carter didnt announce his 
choice of walter mondale until thursday the day the vice 
presidential nomination went before the delegates 
the fact that both tickets with last minute running mate choices 
won probably hadnt escaped bush the fact that walter mondale 
picked geraldine ferraro in advance in 1984 and they lost the 
election might also have made an impression 
the choice of a running mate is probably the most important 
early decision a presidential candidate makes thirteen vice 
presidents have become president eight on the death of a president 
in 1956 democratic nominee adlai stevenson startled the 
convention in chicago by leaving the choice of his running mate to 
the delegates as a result votes were distributed among 13 
candidates after the first ballot 
sen estes kefauver of tennessee had 483 votes followed by 
sen john f kennedy of massachusetts with 304 and sen albert gore 
of tennessee with 178 
on the second ballot kennedy had the lead after the roll call 
but before the chair recognized vote changes gore pulled out 
began a bandwagon for kefauver and kennedy moved that kefauvers 
nomination be made unanimous the ticket lost 
with that exception every vice presidential nominee in modern 
times has been the presidential nominees choice albeit an uneasy 
choice sometimes in 1944 franklin d roosevelt didnt want to 
run with vice president henry wallace but had no other favorite he 
was persuaded to accept harry s truman who then succeeded him 82 
days after the inauguration when roosevelt died 
in 1960 kennedy offered the no 2 spot to lyndon b johnson 
thinking that his chief opponent for the presidential nomination 
would not accept johnson did helped kennedy win by bringing in 
southern states and became president when jfk was assassinated in 
1963 
when johnson ran for president in 1964 republican nominee barry 
goldwater picked rep william e miller as a teammate saying one 
of the reasons i chose miller is that he drives johnson nuts

bob and elizabeth dole ramrod and rainbow in 
the secret service code book saw their fortunes as the vice 
presidential twins of the republican national convention rise 
together and fall together 
the senate republican leader and his wife the former secretary 
of transportation have earned a unique footnote in american 
political history 
the doles got word tuesday that they were out of the running for 
the no 2 spot although dole was told he had been one of two 
finalists a short time later vice president george bush announced 
he had selected sen dan quayle of indiana to be his running mate 
they were almost certainly the first married couple to be 
considered individually for a vice presidential nomination 
they joke about their situation they joke about it a lot 
im not running for vice president dole said this week 
im not campaigning for anyone but she would make a great vice 
president 
or were not running but when the phone rings she says 
let me get it 
or if bush calls the man or woman who picks up the phone 
will say i take it and hang up fast 
it is a bit of a novelty to have a husband and wife under 
consideration as running mates elizabeth dole said as convention 
week opened but i truly mean it when i say im not running for 
it and neither is bob 
she said she was more worried about her job as the gop 
conventions temporary chairman that gavel is so big i 
understand it may take two hands to handle it 
the doles are one of the capitals power couples a fact the 
senator likes to capitalize on 
at the 1983 gridiron dinner given by the nations press dole 
told the audience im happy to be here with the countrys second 
most powerful couple ron and nancy reagan 
a favorite line she has her career and i have my career and 
we have our career whatever that is 
mrs dole often cannot control an urge to take a playful swipe 
at her politician husband 
at a publishers convention a few years ago she explained her 
commitment to air bags in automobiles saying i ought to know i 
married one 
the doles are a hell of a onetwo punch says robert 
strauss former chairman of the democratic national committee 
its like adding two and two and getting five 
sen dole is notorious in the world of politics for his dark 
humor and his biting tongue 
with an occasional lapse he has tried to curb that tongue in 
recent years especially since his marriage 
according to popular theory elizabeth was responsible for my 
sudden mellowing he says 
the doles penned a book issued earlier this year their subject 
was themselves the title the doles unlimited partners 
they used it to sketch the outlines of their lives and to define 
themselves as public figures in the late 20th century 
dole credited his wife for helping to broaden his outlook but 
said she wasnt the only influence 
with all due respects to elizabeth it would be unusual if age 
and experience hadnt broadened my perspective he wrote in 
truth most of those who talked about a new bob dole hadnt known 
the old one very well what had changed was not my character or 
personality but my role in the senate where success is impossible 
to achieve unless you have the votes on your side 
the doles have figured in vice presidential speculation for 
years sen dole of course actually ran for vice president as 
president gerald r fords running mate in 1976 
elizabeth dole was once asked if her husband could adjust to 
actually being no 2 to a sitting president 
she said he could 
but dole wasnt so sure about becoming no 2 
one and a half maybe he said

the city has offered a 17312 settlement 
to pay a blind woman for her humiliation after she was forced by a 
policeman to clean up after her guide dog 
raygena harper a 25yearold stockbroker sued the city over 
the september 1985 incident she said she would accept the 
settlement offer from the city attorneys office which also must 
be approved by the board of supervisors 
the reason i will settle for this amount is that it has been 
going on since 1985 she said id prefer to go to trial 
because i would win hands down it isnt the money they could 
pay me 500000 and it wouldnt be enough for what they did 
the officer aaron barnes a 22year police veteran said i 
was just doing my job 
i didnt know she was blind and that it was a guide dog he 
said 
barnes stopped harper as she was walking to lunch with some 
coworkers and friends accompanied by her guide dog flora 
she said in her lawsuit that the dog indicated it needed to 
defecate so she led it to the gutter next to the curb 
moments later she said barnes walked up and ordered her to 
clean up after the dog in accordance with the citys 
pooperscooper law that requires petowners to dispose of an 
animals waste 
harper said she protested that she was blind and that owners of 
guide dogs are exempt from that ordinance this was confirmed by 
city attorney louise renne 
harper said she became increasingly distressed and humiliated 
as a large crowd gathered and that despite her repeated 
protestations barnes forced her to clean up after her dog with 
a paper tissue insert the waste into a paper bag and travel across 
the street to deposit the bag in a garbage receptacle 
although barnes claimed he didnt know harper was blind she 
said i told him more than five times im a very aware 
individual considering that im blind i know the laws and my 
rights but he would not relent 
barnes who said he suffers high blood pressure and went on 
unpaid sick leave in 1986 said he hadnt realized then that blind 
people using guide dogs are exempt from the pooperscooper law 
no i didnt have that knowledge at the time i learned it 
later this is blown all out of proportion i had no knowledge at 
the time that she even was blind and no one came forward to say 
she was blind

american factories mines and utilities 
operated at 835 percent of capacity in july the highest operating 
level in eight years the government reported tuesday 
the federal reserve said the operating rate climbed a sharp 04 
percentage point last month and now stands 24 percentage points 
higher than it was a year ago as american manufacturers continued 
to benefit from a boom in export sales 
the government said in a separate report tuesday that the us 
trade deficit rose sharply to 125 billion in june even though 
exports remained close to their record highs set earlier this year 
it was the fourth consecutive monthly increase in the industrial 
operating rate and put it at its highest level since march 1980 
when american industry was operating at 837 percent of capacity 
the increase was further evidence that inflationary pressures 
are building in the economy analysts said 
the federal reserves top policymakers met behind closed doors 
tuesday to review monetary strategy a week ago the central bank 
boosted a key lending rate as a way of trying to dampen 
inflationary pressures it hiked its discount rate the fee it 
charges on loans to member banks from 6 percent to 65 percent 
analysts predicted further less dramatic credit tightening in 
the weeks ahead as the fed makes further efforts to dampen demand 
and ease pressures on tight labor markets and us industries 
already operating at high levels 
the fed has put out the message that it is time to put on the 
brakes said david wyss an economist with data resources inc of 
lexington mass 
wyss said the overall operating rate is still below traditional 
peaks at the end of expansionary periods of around 87 percent but 
he said at the rate manufacturing has expanded in the past year 
the country will be closing in on that top level in the next year 
some industries in fact are already above those levels with 
paper plants operating at 928 percent of capacity and textile 
mills at 896 percent of capacity 
the operating rate at all manufacturing plants climbed to 837 
percent of capacity up from 832 percent in june this compared 
with an average over the past 20 years of 806 percent and a low in 
the 198182 recession of 68 percent 
factories making durable goods items expected to last at least 
three years saw their operating rate rise to 823 percent of 
capacity from 817 percent in june 
the increase came even though the operating rate at auto plants 
dipped to 714 percent of capacity from 753 percent in may 
plants producing nondurable goods saw the operating rate rise 
to 858 percent from 854 percent 
the mining sector which includes oil and gas well drilling had 
an increase to 823 percent from 817 percent in june 
the nations utilities which have been working to meet 
increased air conditioning demands prompted by the summer heat 
wave operated at 842 percent of capacity in july up from 834 
percent in june

in this city where revelry is routine and 
sensuality is as palpable as the pungent aroma of cajun spices 
utahs conservative mostly mormon gop delegation has found little 
to remind it of home 
if the state settled by brigham youngs pioneers has an 
opposite this is the place 
when other delegates to the republican national convention head 
for bourbon streets bars after the nightly floor sessions the 
utah delegation offers a nightcap of ice cream flown in by 
delegate richard snelgrove partowner of snelgrove ice cream co 
inc of salt lake city 
and by tuesday only a few cans were missing from two cases of 
dixie brand beer delivered as a courtesy to the utah hospitality 
room 
at least 20 of utahs 26 delegates identify themselves as 
members of the mormon church which discourages the use of alcohol 
tobacco coffee and tea but utah leads the nation in per capita 
consumption of ice cream 
ice cream is sold in the french quarter too but it is not a 
goal of most of the people strolling the narrow streets the 
principal attraction is the irreverent celebration that begins at 
sundown and doesnt stop until almost dawn 
in utah the sale of mixed drinks is banned except in private 
clubs but they can be purchased to go in openfront bars along 
bourbon street utah law forbids nude dancing but in the quarters 
burlesque clubs dancers ply their trade up to a point before 
open doors 
among the temptations are the blackened redfish jambalaya 
gumbo and other cajun dishes offered by the citys scores of 
restaurants 
alex hurtado a delegate from ogden who has been to new orleans 
before warned dieting delegates at their first meeting 
youve got to treat this like a scarlett ohara convention 
he said youve got to think frankly you dont give a damn and 
eat this is a 20pound convention

several hundred people remained at st 
john neumann roman catholic church on tuesday to pray and share 
accounts of the miracles they claimed to have witnessed the night 
before 
while about 50 people lined up inside the darkened sanctuary to 
pray and leave flowers before a small statue of the virgin mary 
others gathered in small groups in the courtyard outside to talk 
about what they had seen during mondays evening mass 
one woman stopped by the fountain to dip her rosary beads in the 
water 
thousands of worshipers interrupted the outdoor service early 
monday evening with cries and applause as hundreds claimed to see 
jesus and mary when a ray of light burst through the clouds some 
worshipers said the sun appeared to dance in the sky while dozens 
reported that the silver beads on their rosaries turned to a gold 
color 
others in the crowd including several priests said they saw 
nothing in the sky but the sun and clouds but the pastor of the 
church said it looked to him like a host spinning inside the 
sun 
lou shaffner showed three photographs of the sky she had taken 
monday in one photo amid the clouds and rays of sunlight a faint 
line was visible and mrs shaffner said she perceived a window 
frame in that picture 
i took these in sequence she said the sun looked blue 
it kind of danced it did it three times like the father the son 
and the holy ghost 
mrs shaffners mother marie blood said the silvercolored 
crucifix on her chain of rosary beads turned gold 
this belonged to my father and ive had it for all these 
years she said i never thought this would happen 
about 12000 people came to st john neumann a charismatic 
church after three parishioners reported receiving messages from 
the virgin mary i will look upon you and you will see my eyes 
one reported message said other messages told the parish to 
prepare for miracles on mondays feast of the assumption which 
celebrates the entry of the virgin mary into heaven after her death

received from pilgrims to medjugorje yugoslavia in that small 
mountain village six youths have claimed to have received messages 
and seen apparitions of mary 
neither the reported occurrences in yugloslavia nor at st john 
neumann have been officially endorsed or recognized by the catholic 
church 
after the first messages were reported bishop micheal sheehan 
of the lubbock diocese had urged worshipers to treat the messages 
with caution he was out of town tuesday and not available for

ariel sharon a cabinet minister and militant 
member of the rightwing likud bloc said tuesday that israel 
should annex parts of the occupied palestinian territories 
immediately 
the rival labor party announced changes in its election platform 
to emphasize peace talks with palestinians rather than negotiations 
led by jordan that would include palestinians 
king hussein of jordan announced a decision two weeks ago to cut 
most of his legal administrative and economic ties with the 
israelioccupied west bank of the jordan river and the gaza strip 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
jordans monarch said indirectly it was up to the palestinians 
to determine the future of any peace negotiations with israel 
which had sought talks with a joint jordanianpalestinian 
delegation that would not include representatives of the palestine 
liberation organization 
sharon the trade and industry minister told a news conference 
in jerusalem the time was right for annexation because husseins 
actions dissolved proposed peace negotiations 
this may be the last moment to take security steps he said 
and israel should move quickly before the psychological 
political vacuum created by husseins decision is filled 
presumably by the plo 
he said the plo appeared ready to declare an independent state 
in the occupied territories which would create strong 
international opposition to israeli annexation today its still 
possible 
during a weekend meeting in amman jordan of plo and jordanian 
delegations the possibility of creating a provisional 
palestinian government in the territories was discussed 
according to plo sources 
sharon said there already is a palestinian state jordan is 
the palestinian state 
a group of people from the leftwing citizens rights movement 
demonstrated outside the building where sharon held the news 
conference one banner said from the architect of the lebanon 
war to the architect of annexation 
sharon was defense minister when israel invaded lebanon in june 
1962 israel withdrew the bulk of its forces three years later 
labor party leaders debated the partys platform for novembers 
national elections and approved changes on possible peace talks 
the changes must be ratified by two higher party organizations 
the newspaper haaretz said that under the proposed platform 
labor would strive for peace talks with hussein in accordance with 
its policy of talking to a joint palestinianjordanian delegation 
but labor also will be ready to talk to palestinian elements 
and personalities who recognize israel renounce terror and 
accept un security council resolutions recognizing israels right 
to exist the new platform plank said according to haaretz 
it said israel would talk with agreed representatives of the 
people of the territories even if jordan would not take part in 
the negotiations 
both likud and labor have refused to negotiate with the plo 
describing it is a terrorist organization dedicated to the 
destruction of israel 
they have been in a fractious coalition since 1984 elections in 
which neither won a parliamentary majority

george bush tapped youthful conservative 
sen dan quayle of indiana on tuesday to be his republican running 
mate i do not intend to fail in the quest for the white house 
the vice president vowed as he arrived to claim his partys 
presidential nomination 
dan quayles a man of the future bush said as he introduced 
his fairhaired running mate at an outdoor campaign rally on the 
banks of the mississippi river 
in his first utterance as a national candidate quayle thanked 
bush for his confidence and immediately showed off the exuberance 
he will bring to the ticket in the uphill race against the 
democrats this fall lets go get em he shouted 
we will win because america cannot afford to lose said the 
41yearold senator there is nothing more important in this 
country than freedom and george bush will keep the freedom and 
peace 
said an obviously delighted bush well done danny 
republican national convention delegates were settling in for an 
evening of speechmaking from the likes of former president gerald 
ford television evangelist pat robertson and keynoter gov tom 
kean of new jersey but barring a late night visit by bush and 
quayle to the superdome podium it was a safe bet that the days 
drama was elsewhere 
bushs selection of a running mate was part of an attempt by his 
high command to depict the vice president as the new undisputed 
leader of the republican party in a carefully scripted changing of 
the gop guard he flew to the convention city and strolled across a 
windy tarmac to bid hail and farewell to a departing president 
reagan 
quayles selection drew raves from party leaders although new 
hampshire gov john sununu admitted to being a little 
disappointed at being passed over arizona sen john mccain said 
his congressional colleague is extremely telegenic in this day of 
television and images 
quayle a secondterm senator from a reliably republican state 
won his senate seat in the 1980 reagan landslide 
mark gearan a spokesman for michael dukakis said quayles 
selection would make no difference in the democratic strategy we 
have always promised and will continue to run a 50state national 
campaign and this will not sizeably affect our campaign effort at 
all he said 
but republican strategists said otherwise campaign adviser 
charlie black said quayle should give us a chance to appeal to 
baby boom voters and strengthen gop appeal in the midwest 
the choice of the indiana senator was something of a surprise 
although he had long been rumored to be under consideration and had 
made clear his interest in joining the ticket 
in turning to the telegenic midwesterner bush bypassed better 
known conservatives such as rep jack kemp and durable party 
stalwarts such as sen bob dole of kansas and former white house 
chief of staff howard baker 
bush told dole hed been the other finalist according to an 
aide to the kansas senator 
standing in shirtsleeves at the outdoor celebration bush 
declared dan quayles a man of the future a young man a young 
man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of 
america hes a dynamic young leader for the future of our party 
the audience roared its approval

spending six months in a sweltering prison cell 
still hasnt soured sam gilley on kuwait although the native texan 
said tuesday his only crime was having homemade hooch in his home 
id go back tomorrow i have no animosity towards those 
people said gilley a 52yearold oil engineer theyve got 
their set of rules and they play by a different set of rules than 
us 
gilley and 45yearold dean gillette also an oil engineer flew 
from kuwait to london on tuesday after their release 
gilley who lost 32 pounds during his six months in a hot tin 
and concrete prison and gillette were pardoned by the emir of 
kuwait reportedly after intervention by vice president george bush 
when they came to my cell i thought they were joking 
gilley said in his london hotel room after a reunion with his wife 
dee and a former employer frank simmons who worked to free them 
gillette who has high blood pressure and a heart condition 
rested in another room after a reunion with his wife marie 
simmons said bush helped free the men by persuading kuwaits 
crown prince sheik saad abdullah sabah to ask emir sheik jaber 
ahmed sabeh to pardon them 
if they want to know where george was we know where he was 
said gilley referring to massachusetts sen edward kennedys 
mocking refrain of where was george at julys democratic 
presidential convention 
the us consulate in kuwait declined to provide information on 
the case 
gillette and gilley shared an apartment in kuwait where they 
work for the international oil well servicing company anadrill 
schlumberger 
they were sentenced in march to five years in prison each on 
charges of selling homemade whiskey kuwait a moslem country 
forbids the sale or production of liquor 
gilley said he and gillette like many foreigners kept homemade 
wine and beer in their home he said he believes an employee may 
have sold some of his liquor while gilley was away on a leave of 
absence last fall 
in may an appeals court reduced their sentences to three years 
and four months 
youve got to develop a mental attitude or youll go crazy 
and i chose the other way said gilley a native of kilgore 
texas 
my wife and i sat down and decided that if i had to spend 
three years and four months in jail so be it 
gilley shared a cell with five other prisoners slept on the 
floor rather than on the concrete slab that was his bed because 
it was cooler painted prison signs read a lot and looked 
forward to at least twiceweekly visits from his wife 
gillette spent his time in a prison hospital 
mrs gilley said she was occasionally allowed to bring her 
husband mustard and other treats 
simmons managing director of universal oilfield services ltd 
of daventry england said he informed bush of the case through 
bushs longtime associate jim mcdonough of dallas 
the gillettes of daniel wyo plan to return to the united 
states on thursday said simmons 
the gilleys said they will visit texas in a couple of weeks 
after that gilley will decide what to do 
i know one thing im just going to take some time off and get 
my head screwed back on right he said

an artist who says she was bothered a lot 
hopes to tame the animal instincts of the urban jungles aggressive 
men by posting a few more signs along the citys streets 
ilona granets 2footsquare metal and enamel designs one in 
pink the other magenta urge men who must leer to do so in 
silence 
one shows a shapely woman admonishing a tom cat truck driver 
no cat calls whistling or kissing sounds the other 
illustrated with a man restraining a struggling wolf advises in 
english and spanish curb your animal instinct 
the eyecatching signs came to be because i was bothered a 
lot every girl i know was bothered a lot ms granet a believer 
in art with a social message said tuesday 
later this week in lower manhattan near city hall and in the 
financial district the east village artist says she will begin 
putting up 12 little signs which are going to change mankind so 
everyone will be gentlemen and ladies again 
department of transportation spokesman victor ross said the dot 
had granted permission for ms granet to hang the signs for six 
months as works of art at the request of a community board and an 
arts group but he said that if the works create confusion with 
existing street signs i see a clash between the artist and the 
bureaucracy 
ross whose department maintains and regulates the citys 
million or so street signs views mr granets efforts as an 
ineffective publicity stunt 
a sign telling a wolf not to whistle is like putting a red 
flag in front of a bull and telling him to cease and desist from 
charging it doesnt work ross said 
although the artist agrees that her signs will do little to 
change attitudes she hopes they will become part of a dialogue 
between men and women 
it can be a real problem that men dont get a lot of men 
think its complimentary said ms granet 39 
for young girls it can be traumatic she said of obscene 
propositions some men make to passing women its way too 
personal and its kind of frightening 
as an older woman im not frightened by these people but i am 
offended when youre unprepared for it its a horrible 
intrusion 
ms granet has so far asked five manhattan community boards for 
permission to post signs one has agreed one is still considering 
it and the other three refused 
she said she has invested about 3500 some from an arts grant 
and some of her own money to print 100 of her signs she said she 
plans to post 50 around the city and hopes to sell the others 
there was going to be a line of signs for the beach this 
summer but they became poisonous and i canceled it she added 
floating medical waste and sewage have closed many of the areas 
beaches this summer

was captured by police is city property now and will be sold to the 
highest and perhaps the bravest bidder 
no one has been able to determine the owner of the snake which 
was found aug 3 in someones yard it took three police officers 
to pry the nonpoisonous snake from a tree it had wrapped itself 
around 
lloyd ross director of the baltimore animal shelter said that 
because the burmese python is city property now he must follow 
bidding procedures for the sale of the snake 
the process will begin after a curator at the baltimore zoo 
examines the snake to determine its sex and assess its health 
bids could go as high as 50 to 100 ross said 
the snake is resting peacefully at the shelter

the us trade deficit widened to 125 
billion in june as imports hit an alltime high the government 
said tuesday analysts said the report showed how far the country 
still has to go in solving its trade problems 
the gap between what america exports and what the country 
imports surged by 285 percent in june a major setback after three 
consecutive monthly improvements 
the reagan administration sought to play down the significance 
of the onemonth surge but democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis said the figures were evidence of the 
administrations failed economic policies 
financial markets which went into a tailspin the last time such 
a disappointing trade report was released took tuesdays report 
more or less in stride 
while the dollar was hit by a wave of panic selling immediately 
after the report was released it soon steadied and regained much 
of its lost ground 
the dow jones industrial average which had plunged 100 points 
after the last disappointing trade figure was released in april 
posted gains after the june figure was released the average of 30 
industrial stocks advanced by more than 17 points to close at 
202151 after falling on monday to its lowest close in nearly 
three months 
the reagan administration contended the june deficit was a 
onemonth aberration that did nothing to change the fact that the 
country will enjoy a substantial narrowing of its merchandise trade 
deficit in 1988 the first such improvement in eight years 
even with the june bulge the deficit for the first six months 
of the year was running at an annual rate of 140 billion down 
significantly from the record 1703 billion deficit set in 1987 
the rise in the trade deficit is a disappointment but it does 
not change the fact that our underlying fundamentals are 
improving said us trade representative clayton yeutter 
the june surge in the trade deficit followed a revised may 
imbalance of 98 billion the lowest monthly deficit since 
december 1984 the 28 billion deterioration came from a 24 
percent drop in exports and a 57 percent rise in imports which 
climbed to a record high of 394 billion 
even with the small dip in exports they still totaled 268 
billion the third highest monthly sales figure on record analysts 
said this reflected continued strong demand for american 
manufactured goods which have benefitted from the weaker dollar 
in a separate report tuesday the federal reserve said that 
american industry operated at 835 percent of capacity in july the 
highest operating rate in more than eight years 
the 04 percentage point rise from the june level reflected 
widespread gains in many industrial sectors helped in large part 
by the export boom analysts said 
however the trade report showed that imports were flooding into 
the country in record amounts even though the dollar has lost more 
than 50 percent of its value against the japanese yen and german 
mark over the past three years a development which the 
administration hoped would make many foreign goods too expensive 
for american pocketbooks 
paradoxically analysts said one reason for the surge in imports 
was the fact that the overall economy was robust in the second 
quarter with both consumer spending and business investment up 
sharply the problem however was that much of that spending still 
went for imports 
the june trade deficit tells a very disappointing story 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co the trade 
deficit cant really be cracked until american businesses and 
consumers stop buying so many imports 
dukakis campaigning in massachusetts blamed the 
administrations economic policies in particular the huge budget 
deficits which have increased the countrys need for foreign 
capital 
this is a nation that eight years ago was the largest creditor 
nation in the world today we are the largest debtor nation in the 
world he said thats the consequence of eight years of 
borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending 
the jump in imports in june came from big increases in purchases 
of clothing and cars by consumers and a 900 million rise in 
purchases of capital equipment by us businesses 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc said that 
while american manufacturers have been spending heavily to expand 
production facilities much of the money has gone to buy foreign 
equipment 
in industries like paper and textiles american companies are 
putting in foreign machinery because that is where the state of the 
art is he said 
americas foreign oil bill declined slightly in june to 36 
billion compared to 39 billion in may as the average price per 
barrel fell to 1619 down 21 cents from may 
as usual the largest overall deficit was with japan an 
imbalance of 44 billion up from 41 billion in may the deficit 
with canada climbed to 140 billion with western europe it rose 
to 19 billion with the newly industrialized countries of taiwan 
south korea hong kong and singapore the deficit rose to 27 
billion in june

south africa cuba and angola 
have established a joint military commission to monitor the 
weekold truce in the angolan war the government announced tuesday 
the south african defense force said the three countries which 
agreed to a ceasefire aug 8 met monday and tuesday in army tents 
at ruacana on the border of southwest africa known as namibia 
and angola to work out details of the monitoring group 
it said the joint military monitoring commission will include 
officers from the three countries and also from the namibian 
military 
in windhoek the namibian capital the territorial army that is 
controlled by south africa said its forces killed 14 guerrillas 
last week 
the aug 8 ceasefire does not apply to hostilities in namibia 
south africa has administered namibia since the end of world war 
i under a mandate from the nowdefunct league of nation that 
mandate was repudiated in 1966 by the united nations which called 
for elections and independence for the territory between south 
africa and angola 
black nationalist guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples 
organization or swapo have been battling south africa for years 
for control of namibia 
south africa has said it would not agree to independence for 
namibia as long as an estimated 50000 cuban soldiers remain in 
angola helping the marxist government battle guerrillas backed by 
south africa and the united states 
the brief statement from the south african defense force said 
the ruacana talks were held in a climate of respect and 
responsibility but gave no details of how the monitoring 
commission would operate 
south africa has said it is complying with the first phase of 
the ceasefire plan that calls for it to withdraw an estimated 
2500 south african troops from angola by sept 1 
south africa also has said it is willing to begin withdrawing 
from namibia by nov 1 if it can reach a mutual date for namibian 
independence and the withdrawal of the cuban troops from angola 
south africa cuba and angola along with us mediators plan a 
new round of peace talks next week in an effort to establish that 
timetable 
angola gained independence from portugal in 1974 and marxist 
forces defeated prowestern factions in the civil war that 
followed cuba sent troops to angola to help the government battle 
guerrillas of unita the national union for the total independence 
of angola 
unita which was left out of the peace talks has said its 
guerrillas will continue fighting until it is included in 
negotiations 
the windhoek report on last weeks fighting in namibia gave no 
details 
it was issued by the southwest africa territorial force 
commanded by south africans and also said 275 swapo guerrillas 
have been killed this year it did not mention government 
casualties 
swapo which has bases in southern angola also was not included 
in the peace talks but has said it would observe a ceasefire 
beginning sept 1 if south africa does so south africa has not 
responded

parties are swinging to dixieland and cajun 
waltzes during the republican national convention a fourday 
nonstop dance of unity thats keeping musicians busy around the 
clock 
theres jazz at brunch and twosteps by night 
and theres allday hometown hubris these four days dont 
come close to mardi gras said john sherman secretary of the 
1300member musicians local protective union local 174496 
but there does seem to be a little more publicity and the 
parties are more numerous sherman concedes 
dixieland music welcomed vice president george bush to a street 
party on the river front tuesday afternoon 
as the paddlewheeler natchez eased to the dock along the 
mississippi river the rebirth jazz band let loose with when the 
saints go marching in their rowdy music was punctuated by a 
shrill blast from the calliope aboard the riverboat which carried 
bush and hundreds of supporters to the rally 
the rallys dixieland theme was typical of live music that is 
entertaining republicans this week an extravagant party just isnt 
complete it seems without live tunes and everybody it seems 
wants to be extravagant 
leland b bennett said his 10piece band featuring four 
vocalists has turned down some invitations to entertain during the 
convention he accepted one from the republican senatorial inner 
circle bigmoney boosters of gop senate candidates 
well play all kinds of selections he said 
can delegates get burned out on dixieland 
it depends on the individual some will listen to only that 
bennett said 
ronnie cole a popular local pianist has also been able to pick 
his party stops said spokeswoman barbara menteris cole 
entertained at a delegate welcoming party in audubon zoo and for a 
function honoring president reagan but he turned down twice as 
many chances to play as he accepted she said 
the workload has picked up ms menteris said i would be 
surprised if there are any musicians who havent worked 
but at least one performance missed most of its expected 
audience legendary trumpeter al hirt started a threenight 
engagement at a club monday but drew only 50 fans 
scott roach manager of the club located in the new riverwalk 
development blamed a laterunning opening convention session and 
heavy traffic in the big easy im absolutely disappointed 
roach said 
hirt was the consummate showman natty in red bow tie and 
matching handkerchief he growled youre a small crowd but 
youre enthusiastic and thats where its at 
california delegate don roth was delighted the santa ana 
resident first heard hirt in new orleans while traveling up the 
mississippi river as a serviceman during the korean war i think 
they could have done a better job of advertising this i didnt 
know al hirt was here until i just happened to have it mentioned to 
me i love his music roth said 
delegate kathryn thompson of south laguna calif praised 
hirts showmanship hes a classic she said

shouted halt or ill fire and made to lie on the ground for an 
hour at gunpoint until his identity was confirmed 
ms bridge said incidents have occurred at bases in upper 
heyford lakenheath and alconbury

hypnosis once was a business of 
quacks and charlatans but now finds growing acceptance as a useful 
treatment and attracted hundreds of doctors to a conference this 
week 
about 600 physicians psychotherapists and dentists discussed 
and demonstrated modern applications of hypnosis during the 
international congress of hypnosis and psychosomatic medicine 
which ended tuesday it is the 11th conference since the first in 
paris in 1889 
the process of acceptance is still going on dr richard 
van dyck told the associated press he is a professor of psychiatry 
at amsterdams free university and was chairman of the conferences 
scientific committee 
van dyck said few nations restrict the practice of hypnosis to 
formally qualified therapists with the result that unscrupulous 
practitioners can induce subjects to weird and fantastic 
behavior 
hypnosis first became popular in the late 18th century because 
of the work of franz mesmer an austrian physician who theorized 
about what he called animal magnetism 
only in the 1950s did it become a topic for serious 
psychological study when the american researcher ernest hilgard 
designed a scale to measure a persons susceptibility to hypnosis 
people who are easily hypnotizable have generally been 
more interested in the world of fantasy ever since their youth 
theyre often very creative van dyck said 
in the 1970s us and israeli psychiatrists found hypnosis was 
valuable in helping war veterans overcome their traumatic 
experiences he said and today treatment of posttraumatic 
distress is one of its most important psychiatric applications 
general practitioners use it to combat disorders ranging from 
tension headache to psoriasis and dentists increasingly rely on 
hypnosis to help patients overcome fear of dental work some even 
use it instead of anesthesia 
reseachers are exploring whether hypnosis can help the 
diseasefighting immune system and help combat acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
during hypnosis a patient becomes susceptible to suggestions 
that would otherwise seem strange although the patient generally 
retains some control over the process and can end the hypnosis if 
it is threatening 
a hypnotic state can be induced by any of a dozen methods van 
dyke said and most patients eventually can enter hypnosis alone 
in a commonly used approach a patient is asked to choose a 
point on the wall and stare at it locking out other mental 
activity in another a subject is told to imagine his hand is 
getting lighter and eventually levitating 
its not without some danger van dyke said there are 
people who really have a hard time resisting suggestions under 
hypnosis

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen said tuesday the reagan administration has allowed 
america to drift aimlessly back into dangerous dependence on 
imported oil 
the texas senator also said that despite republicans adoration 
of president reagan the the presidents coattails will be very 
short when it comes to helping george bush get elected 
commenting later about george bushs selection of indiana sen 
dan quayle as his running mate on the gop ticket bentsen said 
of course well debate im looking forward to it 
ive looked across the aisle in the senate at dan quayle and 
ill be looking forward to comparing our accomplishments in the 
senate and in turn what each of us could do for our running mate 
assuming we were elected in pushing through and influencing the 
passage of a legislative program for the new president he said 
asked if he was surprised by quayles selection bentsen said 
no not particularly i really wasnt concerned as to who it 
might be 
bentsen speaking in this oil town after a visit to the nearby 
big hill strategic petroleum reserve said the nations dependence 
on foreign oil is now greater than it was in 1973 when the arab oil 
embargo caused gas lines across the country 
the american people understand that for eight years this 
administration has steadfastly refused to produce an energy policy 
that will protect americas national interests he told the 
gathering of about 500 
the republicans tell you they have loosened opecs hold on the 
worlds petroleum markets but the numbers tell you that today 
america is importing 42 percent of the oil we consume he said 
our dependence has increased by 15 percent while this 
administration has been lulled to sleep by low oil prices he 
said 
the petroleum reserve program was launched in the wake of the 
oil shocks of the last decade the six reserves are underground 
vaults of crude oil which can be retrieved in a national emergency 
bentsen used the visit to the big hill site the last of the six 
reserves to underscore his and michael dukakiss support for the 
program which eventually will put 750 million barrels of oil in 
storage 
bentsen in shirtsleeves and a goldcolored hard hat with sen 
bentsen on the front told a group of about 50 workers at the 
plant that the reserve is crucial to the national security and said 
he would like to expand it to a billion barrels 
the reagan administration has proposed cut in the program in the 
past and bentsen said only the democratic congress was able to 
keep it going 
bentsen has been campaiging in his home state while the 
republicans hold their convention in new orleans and dominate the 
national news 
asked about the presidents speech monday night to the 
convention bentsen said reagan had an adoring crowd and they 
enjoyed each other 
i also believe that in the convention and after the 
convention as we go into the election that its george bush 
people are looking to not ronald reagan he said and ronald 
reagans coattails will be very short 
bentsen said there is a yawning gap between the republican 
rhetoric and reality including reagans charge that the democrats 
speciality is inflation 
inflation is in the trade deficit bentsen said citing 
tuesdays news that the trade gap had jumped back to 125 billion 
in june

egypt has received a model of a show case 
designed by the us getty conservation institute that will help 
prevent the decay of egypts royal mummies the institutes 
director said tuesday 
luis monreal told a news conference that american canadian 
spanish german and egyptian scientists had designed the 
nitrogenfilled case on the basis that inert gases preserve organic 
material and reduce biological growth 
he said the case also could be used to conserve priceless 
antiquities such as manuscripts and objects made of organic 
materials including wood leather and bone 
monreal desplayed a small prototype of the case that is 
hermetically sealed 
the new thing is that it is simple will not cost much and 
includes a cocktail of nitrogen and oxygen he said 
getty scientists developed the proper mixture of 97 percent 
nitrogen and 3 percent oxygen and the prototype was first shown in 
california last may according to monreal he said tests involved a 
3000yearold female mummy on loan from egypt and other egyptian 
mummies from american museums 
the first fullsize case will be delivered to egypt in december 
and egypt then is to build similar cases locally for its 27 royal 
mummies and put them on display monreal said 
the royal mummies dating from 3000 to 3800 years ago were 
discovered in a common tomb in 1881 near the southern city of luxor 
where ancient priests had hidden them from grave robbers 
they have been held in a closed hall at the egyptian museum 
after being displayed from 1958 to 1980 although thousands of 
mummies have been found and displayed the 27 are considered to be 
the only royal mummies 
plans to put them on display last summer were postponed until 
the new show cases could be developed 
monreal said research in developing the case had cost the 
institute about 150000 
that is a very low cost if what you are trying to save are the 
most precious specimens of egyptian history he said

president reagan praised the 
selection tuesday of dan quayle for the republican vice 
presidential nomination saying the indiana senators talent 
intellect family and energy will be valuable assets in the fall 
campaign 
vice president george bush has made an outstanding selection 
of senator quayle of his running mate reagan said in a statement 
shortly after his arrival in california for a threeweek vacation 
earlier tuesday before leaving new orleans reagan blessed 
bushs presidential quest anew and told his vice president that a 
great deal rides on this campaign 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush informed the 
president of his choice of quayle during a conversation at the foot 
of the airplane ladder before the president boarded 
dan was first elected to the senate as part of the reaganbush 
team in 1980 reagan said hes a proven votegetter 
ive worked closely with dan on a number of issues he has 
been a leader in the senate for a strong national defense 
particularly the strategic defense initiative and proponent of 
innovative job creation programs 
reagan added his talent intellect family and energy will 
be valuable assets during the campaign and i know he will be a 
great vice president i salute vice president bushs selection 
george has made an excellent choice 
at the airport ceremony in new orleans reagan assured bush that 
nancy and i want you to know that you have all our support all 
the way and all our love 
bush will receive his partys presidential nomination wednesday 
in a formal roll call of delegates at the republican national 
convention 
the brief greeting between reagan and his vice president which 
took less than five minutes occurred under gray skies on an 
airport tarmac with air force one and air force two in the 
background 
bush had just arrived in new orleans reagan who addressed the 
convention monday night was on his way to california 
the meeting was arranged only recently by the white house and 
the bush campaign in part because of the questions that had been 
by raised the absence of any joint meetings between reagan and bush 
in the convention city 
well ladies and gentlemen the reason the vice president and 
i are meeting this way is a recent decision by the fire marshal in 
new orleans reagan joked he said that new orleans is now so 
crowded hes not letting in a new republican unless one leaves 
it was a veiled reference to the overcrowding and closing of the 
omni during the democratic national convention last month 
but seriously george reagan said a great deal rides 
on this campaign and on you are americas hopes for continued 
peace and prosperity 
bush told reagan that by the time you leave office you 
will have done for america the greatest thing that a president 
could do you will have left this country better than you found 
it 
today america can see further because of your vision he 
said and now its time to extend that vision into the next 
century and i do not intend to fail 
fitzwater said reagan will make at least a couple of trips a 
week in bushs behalf after the president returns from his 
california vacation on sept 6 
fitzwater said reagan wont get personal in his campaign 
rhetoric he wont talk about mike dukakis but hell talk about 
republicans and democrats and liberals in a way that you wont 
mistake the difference 
reagan in fact has been talking increasingly of dukakis 
without mentioning the massachusetts governors name during his 
rally speech here sunday reagan alluded to the stealth 
candidacy and said that he was sure dukakis wouldnt be holding a 
federal office in january 
in california reagan planned to mix pleasure with business 
during his vacation at his 688acre ranch in the santa ynez 
mountains north of santa barbara 
as has been the habit during the reagans summer forays on the 
west coast the pair will travel to los angeles for a few days to 
socialize with longtime friends 
before leaving new orleans fitzwater said the president signed 
four bills including one requiring imported telephones to be 
compatible with hearing aids the president wears a hearing aid 
the other bills involved an alaska land transfer and set aside 
august 9 as a neighborhood watch day and labor day weekend as a 
safe driving observance 
reagan also was expected to act on several other pieces of 
legislation awaiting his signature including a bill to overhaul 
the trade laws and to reinforce us laws barring discrimination in 
housing 
as for monday nights address to the convention fitzwater said 
i think he felt very good about last night at the reception 
which the reagans held later in a meeting room at their hotel he 
stayed until around 1230 they were almost the last to leave you 
could tell he was feeling up about the whole thing savoring the 
evening

a wellknown mexican entertainer who made 
body building part of her act sobbed a declaration of innocence 
tuesday when she and 17 men appeared at a news conference as 
defendants involved with a drug ring 
the federal attorney generals office said rossy escudero and 
the others 10 of them colombians were arrested in a raid that 
netted 1500 pounds of cocain and involved a major ring that was 
smuggling the drug into the united states 
they were presented to journalists in mexico city including the 
purported ring leader a colombian identified as william mayor 
arias 
a statement from the attorney generals office which 
coordinates antinarcotics activity in mexico called the operation 
the biggest victory of the year over drug dealers it said the raid 
followed a sixmonth investigation 
it said the cocaine with an estimated street value of 500 
million was confiscated last weekend in bahia de kino in 
northwestern sonora state 210 miles south of the us border 
those arrested were provisionally booked on charges of attempts 
against the health of the mexican population a catchall felony 
punishable by up to 15 years in prison 
most refused to talk to reporters but ms escudero weeping 
insisted she knew nothing of the drug trafficking 
she is a singer dancer and physical culturist who has her own 
gymnasium and promotes female body building on national television

authorities got on the rings trail in march after a private 
plane crashed at barra de navidad in western jalisco state with a 
large amount of cocaine aboard the statement from the attorney 
generals office said 
it said four people were later arrested in the jalisco state 
capital of gudalajara 280 miles northwest of mexico city in

headquarters at a hotel in the mexican capital

comment in french newspapers tuesday on the 
republican convention included this report by marc kravetz of the 
leftist liberation on the french quarter scene in new orleans 
even if speaking frankly and by the criteria of old europe 
new orleans libertine reputation seems very excessive its 
fairly pleasing to see so many declared militants in the fight 
against lax morals the right to abortion homosexuality 
pornography and stimulating substances between two bottles of 
dixie the local beer shouting encouragements at the appearance of 
a breast the suggestion of a caress or the simulated copulation of 
a guy with a mustache 
lhumanite the communist party daily said of george bush 
bushs bad media image making him seem colorless and 
maladroit is obviously not enough to explain his lack of success 
in the eyes of americans he is accountable for the antisocial 
policies waged for eight years by reagan which are not denied by 
the platform to be adopted by the republican convention 
the conservative le figaro explained the choice of a running 
mate in a frontpage editorial by jacques jacquetfrancillon 
things being what they are logic would have a candidate 
choose as running mate the man best suited to continue his work 
the one who most resembles himself his best friend if possible 
but that alas would deprive him of a precious trump card 
necessary for victory 
a good running mate is not an alter ego all that is demanded 
of him is to be able to deliver additional votes if the partys 
champion campaigns on liberal ideas he needs help from a 
conservative and vice versa of course if the no 1 is strong in 
the west its best to chose a man from the south or from new 
england 
is this shocking perhaps but its one of the secrets of 
american political equilibrium one of the reasons why whatever 
might come up since its unity was forged after the civil war the 
united states has never again found itself cut in half

sen dan quayle has made his reputation in the 
senate as one of the chambers most ardent supporters of president 
reagans pentagon buildup and a master of the minutiae of arms 
control and defense policy 
in fact the man picked tuesday by george bush as the republican 
vicepresidential candidate broke with moderate republicans last 
month and advised reagan to veto a pentagon budget bill reagan did 
just that citing as did quayle the deep reductions in star 
wars spending 
the junior senator from indiana also was one of the leaders in a 
bitter 1986 senate fight over daniel manion a conservative indiana 
lawyer whose judicial nomination became a battleground over 
reagans judicial philosophies 
in addition quayle is on the senate labor committee where he 
has spearheaded the reagan administrations fight against raising 
the minimum wage providing advance notice of plant closings and 
other labor legislation backed by unions 
even after senate conservatives the white house and major 
business groups dropped their opposition to some laborbacked 
measures such as a ban on the use of lie detectors to screen job 
applicants quayle remained a vehement foe 
quayle elected to the senate in 1980 has specialized in 
military issues as a member of the armed services committee he 
admitted he had little knowledge about the issue before coming to 
the senate but said he had made up for that by spending long hours 
poring over the arcane details of military policy such as troop 
strength weapons performance and soviet military doctrine 
quayle is now ranking republican on the conventional force and 
allied defense subcommittee a panel which deals chiefly with the 
16member north atlantic treaty organization 
last winter quayle was one of the leading skeptics during the 
long senate debate over the historic intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty the ussoviet pact which eliminates medium and 
shortrange atomictipped missiles 
quayle was one of the few senators on the armed services panel 
who attended virtually the entire series of hearings including a 
number of long detailed sessions devoted to taking testimony from 
military officers and thinktank experts about the possible effect 
of the inf pact on western europe 
before the hearings began quayle said he was skeptical about 
the pact even though it had been negotiated by a conservative 
president he admired but he eventually ended up voting for it on 
march 27 when the senate ratified the pact by a 935 margin 
many of his questions centered on the issue of whether the pact 
would ban socalled futuristic weapons of the type envisioned 
by reagans 5yearold strategic defense initiative the formal 
name of star wars 
quayle has been one of the senates leading champions of star 
wars and it was that advocacy which last month led him to suggest 
that reagan veto a defense bill providing for the pentagon budget 
for the fiscal year starting oct 1 
reagan wanted 48 billion next year for star wars but the 
compromise measure proposed by the democraticcontrolled congress 
provided 40 billion a figure only slightly above the current 
39 billion star wars budget 
on july 14 the senate was preparing for final passage of the 
bill in a vote that would send it to reagans desk but quayle 
moved to return it to a housesenate conference committee so the 
star wars budget could be increased and democraticwritten arms 
control restrictions could be dropped 
this is a political struggle between the administration and 
the congress over who is going to run arms control policy no 
question about it explained quayle 
quayle told his senate colleagues that reagan might veto the 
bill but other republicans such as sen john warner of virginia 
ranking republican on the armed services panel said they had been 
told the president would reluctantly sign the measure 
quayles move lost 5835 but he said afterwards that reagan 
should veto the measure and he was one of the first senators to 
praise the president when reagan did reject the bill on aug 3 
quayle described reagans veto as a good sound decision 
quayle was also involved in the fight over manion who had been 
appointed by reagan to a federal appeals court in chicago 
opponents said manion was unqualified but republicans said he was 
being criticized only because of his conservative ideology 
manion a son of the founder of the john birch society had 
received a qualified rating from the american bar association 
the lowest passing grade given by the abas judicial screening 
panel 
manion was eventually confirmed 5049 on a tiebreaking vote 
cast by bush in his vicepresidential role as presiding officer of 
the senate

president reagan was a stronger television 
draw than the treasurer of the state of texas but not as popular as 
jesse jackson according to overnight ratings compiled by the ac 
nielsen co 
the three broadcast networks combined for an average rating of 
199 for more than 2 hours of live coverage monday night as reagan 
made a farewell address to the republican national convention that 
compared to a 177 rating for the first night of the democratic 
national convention which featured a keynote address by texas 
treasurer ann richards 
the biggest audience for the democratic convention was on the 
second night when jacksons speech pulled cumulative ratings of 
233 
on monday nbc led the pack with a 71 rating and 13 percent 
share of the audience followed by abc with a 68 rating and 13 
share and cbs with a 60 rating and 12 share 
each rating point represents 866000 homes with television the 
share is the proportion of sets in use during the time period 
cbs ratings may have been hurt because it stayed on the 
longest until 1155 pm edt when many viewers presumably had 
switched off nbc stopped at 1140 minutes after reagans speech 
ended and abc at 1146 
the combined share of 38 percent for the three networks was 
about half their normal primetime audience 
on the first night of the democratic convention the 
threenetwork share fell to 32 percent

gov michael dukakis said tuesday he was mildly 
surprised by the selection of indiana sen dan quayle as the 
republican vice presidential candidate 
hes not very well known but i assume and expect the vice 
president will make the reasons known for his picking him the 
democratic presidential nominee told reporters at a briefing in a 
room next to his statehouse office 
i didnt have any sense of who the vice president would pick 
and i didnt spend much time on it he added 
dukakis who had spent the day touring central massachusetts 
returned to the statehouse by helicopter late tuesday afternoon and 
learned of quayles selection by vice president george bush shortly 
after the news broke in new orleans 
dukakis who chose texas sen lloyd bentsen last month shortly 
before the democratic national convention declined to discuss 
quayle in detail instead he emphasized bentsens virtues 
implicitly outlining the themes the dukakis campaign may use 
against quayle 
im very happy with my running mate the more time we spend 
together and campaign together the happier i am dukakis said 
senator bensten is a mature thoughtful man with real stature 
somebody whos a real leader in the united states senate the 
democratic candidate said hes already been a great asset to our 
ticket 
dukakis was asked if the choice of quayle signaled an emphasis 
by bush on defense matters 
senator bentsen has been seasoned experienced on issues of 
foreign policy defense space dukakis said also citing 
bentsens accomplishments in the senate this year on trade 
catastrophic health care welfare reform and plant closings 
thats the kind of stature thats the kind of strength the 
kind of maturity i think you want in a vice president especially 
when that vice president may be president dukakis said

a day after police evicted 12 homeless women and 
their children from a vacant federally owned house housing and 
urban development officials agreed tuesday to lease 55 vacant homes 
for 1 annually to shelters 
the agreement was worked out with shelter sponsors after hud a 
federal department had police oust the squatters who broke into a 
73400 hudowned home over the weekend and refused to leave the 
squatters were protesting the number of repossessed homes that are 
left vacant while homeless people move from shelter to shelter 
dorothy king organizer of the protest was arrested for 
investigation of trespassing after she refused to leave quietly 
police said 
king who operates a shelter called the golden brick road for 
battered and homeless women and children denied the allegation 
and said i was placing homeless women and children in affordable 
housing 
im so mad at him she said of grady maples regional 
director of hud who requested the evictions im crying because 
i am so mad at the system 
she said she had tried to obtain vacant houses for use by 
homeless women and their children through the official channels 
on tuesday she was released from jail without bond with a 
court appearance set for aug 26 on a trespassing charge 
maples defended the evictions as unfortunate but necessary the 
precedent of allowing occupancy at will of vacant hud buildings 
had the potential for being a very serious problem he said 
monday 
let me say as kindly as i can the department of housing

a federal appeals court declined tuessday to 
revive leftwing writer margaret randalls legal challenge of the 
immigration and naturalization services refusal to give her 
permanent resident status 
a divided threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals 
here ruled that randall who has fought deportation under the 
political beliefs section of the 1952 mccarranwalter act must 
follow administrative procedures to challenge ins actions in her 
case 
the opinion by judge ruth b ginsburg upheld last years 
decision by us district judge john garrett penn that dismissed 
randalls lawsuit against the ins 
but the court noted that congress decision to suspend 
enforcement of the provision during the current fiscal year removes 
the danger that randall will be deported 
it therefore appears that the large question initially raised 
whether margaret randall could regain united states citizenship 
is now reduced to the question when she can regain it ginsburg 
wrote in an opinion joined by judge laurence silberman 
randall 51 an americanborn writer who lives in albuquerque 
nm renounced her citizenship in the 1960s after she had moved to 
mexico 
the writer poet and photographer who has also lived in cuba 
and nicaragua returned to this country in 1984 to marry an 
american and teach at the university of new mexico she has four 
children including two who are american citizens 
randalls lawyers contended that the court had the power to 
overturn a 1985 ins decision refusing her permanent resident status 
on the ground that her writings espoused world communism 
randall said this decision was unconstitutional and therefore 
her eligiblity to reapply for citizenship should be calculated from 
that date 
the panel ruled it would not reach a decision on the case until 
that procedure is exhausted 
once the board of immigration apeals has rendered its 
decision randall may proceed to the appropriate circuit court in 
her situation the fifth or the tenth circuit the court said 
circuit judge abner mikva filed a dissent saying randall i 
am convinced would have obtained the status adjustment she seeks 
but for a governmental officials unconstitutional action

now i ask you should this country tolerate such cynicism 
should this country tolerate a campaign of deliberate deception 
should we tolerate a campaign that pits one american against 
another 
our party will not divide people we will bring america together 
we are not afraid to show our true republican colors our 
purpose was spoken more than 100 years ago by a man who said 
america means a government whose leading object is to elevate the 
condition of men to lift artificial weights from all shoulders 
to afford every person an unfettered start and a fair chance in 
the race of life 
those words were abraham lincolns and my fellow republicans 
his creed is our creed 
when we have followed it we have succeeded 
when we have deviated from it we have failed 
the very first act lincoln signed as president was the homestead 
act 
it offered land in the west to every american 
it didnt matter if you were a man or woman if you were black 
or white if you were young or old as long as you worked the land 
no new bureaucracy 
no spending required 
this republican program limited government while offering to all 
unlimited dreams 
today americans have the same dreams but the answer to those 
dreams will not come through bigger government in washington 
you see thats what the democrats offer 
its no wonder the most popular movie in atlanta during their 
convention was big they thought it was a documentary on their 
philosophy 
liberal democrats believe washington should manage dreams for 
all americans 
republicans believe americans should have the freedom to achieve 
our dreams ourselves 
republicans believe that if liberty is threatened anywhere it 
is threatened everywhere

we will never turn our backs on the refusenik in the soviet 
union the black student in south africa or the brave freedom 
fighter in nicaragua 
jeane kirkpatrick is right when she says that when it comes to 
defending america george bush knows best 
all i can add is a warning the dukakis democrats will try to 
talk tough 
but dont be fooled 
they may try to talk like dirty harry but they will still act 
like pee wee herman 
we live in a dangerous and uncertain world we need the ship of 
state in seasoned strong and steady hands 
i am a student of history i want to tell you something 
americans need to understand 
in 200 years there has never been a candidate for president 
whose experience in world affairs and knowledge of foreign nations 
has exceeded that of george bush 
we must stay the course at home as well if the reaganbush 
years have proved anything it is that the heroes of the american 
economy are not paper pushers along the potomac but dream makers 
in dayton denver and dallas 
the dukakis democrats dont believe that according to the new 
york times two thirds of the delegates in atlanta said they wanted 
higher federal taxes the democrats know the american people 
disagree 
so they hid those colors too they make promises without a price 
tag well we added up the cost 
they call for an end to economic violence what it really means 
is taking from those who work and simple giving to those who dont 
what does it add up to more taxes 
and wheres ted kennedy well hes promoting mandated health 
insurance yet the idea seems eerily similar to a colossal 
program for socialized medicine right out of the platform of george 
mcgovern what does it add up to more taxes 
and then there is their nominee 
every day he endorses another congressional spending bill in 
concept 
well to paraphrase sen everett dirksen a little concept here 
and a little concept there and pretty soon you are talking real 
money 
what does it add up to more taxes

look beneath the rhetoric 
add up all the wayout programs of the democratic party what 
does the name of dukakis sound like to you more taxes 
at a time when costs are rising when we are paying more for 
insurance housing medical care and college tuitions the liberal 
democrats want to take money out of the pockets of working men and 
women because they think washington can spend it better 
now i know those democrats like to insist they understand the 
average person but the average people i know dont want to pay 
higher taxes low taxes create jobs better than any government 
program 
in my state the reaganbush tax cuts have created almost 
threequarter of a million new jobs good jobs with bright 
futures and heres one governor from a northeastern state who is 
not afraid to give credit for our economic miracle to george bush 
and ronald reagan 
but the reaganbush recipe of low taxes and economic freedom is 
not just working in new jersey in florida or california the 
recipe is working far beyond our borders 
around the world people are voting with their feet for 
capitalism over communism just think for a moment how many west 
germans climb the berlin wall to east germany not one 
how many malaysians pack up to move to vietnam not one 
and i ask you how many costa ricans tomorrow morning will 
stand in line for visas to nicaragua not one they would have to 
be out of their mind 
and even communist nations are finally realizing that karl marx 
knew about as much about economics as groucho marx 
the peoples republic of china is experimenting with free 
enterprise even the soviet union is changing the year i graduated 
college nikita khrushchev promised that our children would live 
under communism today history is on our side we dare hope that 
khrushchevs grandchildren will live under freedom

britain france japan italy all cutting taxes all limiting 
government 
only in america is the party of the left proposing solutions 
that time has left behind only in atlanta could the democrats 
draft a platform that has gone with the wind 
at a time when almost every nation in the world is beginning to 
turn our way let us not make the mistake in this election of 
turning their way 
but let us also understand that the ship of state is venturing 
into unchartered and turbulent waters 
the watch bell has rung we need all hands on deck 
eight years ago we gained power because americans yearned for 
freedom freedom from the shackles of high taxes freedom from the 
tyranny of inflation freedom from the burdens of big government 
and we wanted freedom from the embarrassment of an america that 
wore a kick me sign on its back 
well we republicans delivered after eight years of ronald 
reagan and george bush our country is stronger safer and better 
today and americans are proud to admit it 
but new challenges lie ahead and we wont win by simply 
punching the vcr and replaying the last election and you know 
what america wont win either 
the democratic party failed because they kept offering the new 
deal long after it became the old deal 
we should learn from their mistakes we dont want to repeal the 
reagan revolution far from it we want to take the reaganbush 
principles into new areas where liberal policies have failed 
today america demands a new vision we want new freedoms 
freedom from racism freedom from poor schools freedom from 
polluted oceans freedom from crack dealers

britains senior law officer is studying requests 
by a member of parliament and a private group that he file 
blasphemy charges to stop the showing of the last temptation of 
christ a spokesman said tuesday 
the matter is under consideration said a spokesman for 
attorney general sir patrick mayhew commenting on the condition he 
not be identified 
many christian leaders have denounced martin scorseses film 
one scene shows jesus fantasizing about abandoning death on the 
cross marrying prostitute mary magdalene and making love to her 
mary whitehouse britains most prominent campaigner against 
media permissiveness said she wrote last week to mayhew asking him 
to consider whether the film is blasphemous and could lead to a 
breach of the peace 
legislator nicholas bennett of the governing conservative party 
also urged mayhew to investigate to determine if the movie is 
blasphemous and could lead to violence if screened in britain 
in 1976 mrs whitehouse president of the national viewers and 
listeners association brought the only blasphemy case in britain 
in more than a halfcentury to court her successful civil action 
prevented the gay news newspaper from publishing a poem that said 
jesus was a homosexual 
britains centuriesold law defines blasphemy as any 
contemptuous reviling scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to 
god jesus christ the bible or the formularies of the church of 
england 
the last temptation which opened to packed houses last 
weekend in seven us cities and two in canada will be seen by 
british censors aug 25 
until that time we cant confirm the release of the film or 
say anything about the film said patrick scott a spokesman for 
the films distributors united international pictures 
mrs whitehouse also wrote to james ferman director of the 
british board of film classification saying that if the film is 
classified for viewing circumstances may be such as to justify 
the law against blasphemy being invoked 
mrs whitehouse who said she had read the movies script 
maintained that without any question whatever it would give very 
considerable offense to christians 
she said the fact that jesus was tempted and resisted is what 
gives everyone the strength to resist temptation themselves if he 
didnt resist as is the message of the film then how can i 
the us catholic conference is urging american catholics not to 
see the film which some leaders have denounced as blasphemous 
scorsese says the film is a work of fiction and was not made 
with blasphemous intent 
in venice italy the citys roman catholic diocese denounced 
the movie tuesday and urged that it not be shown as scheduled at 
the venice film festival next month the director of the film 
festival guglielmo biraghi said it would still be shown he said 
he respected the churchs opinion but did not agree with it

and most of all we want freedom to know that our future will be 
made right here in the united states of america 
many of us have been blessed with good jobs good homes and good 
families but we also care about those who are not so fortunate 
we have to care because their future is now our future their 
tomorrow is our tomorrow the simple truth is there are no spare 
americans any longer 
to those who are illschooled illtrained or illhoused we 
must reach out and lift the artificial weights as lincoln promised 
as republicans we will do it not only because economically it is 
the only thing to do but because morally it is the right thing to 
do 
one hundred years ago this summer an exslave and proud 
republican stood before another convention of our party frederick 
douglass said a government that can give liberty in its 
constitution ought to have the power to protect liberty in its 
administration 
one hundred years later bigotry and intolerance still threaten 
we have seen it in howard beach ny forsyth county ga and too 
many other places republicans will make it clear we will search 
out bigotry and racism we will drag it into the sunshine of 
understanding and make it whither and die 
we republicans offer liberty not just from prejudice but from 
poverty 
the democrats gave us the war on poverty and poverty won 
hosea williams said it best the war on poverty failed because 
by the time it trickled down to the poor all we got was scraps from 
the table 
we offer poor americans not the junk food of more big 
government but the full meal of good private sector jobs 
our idea is simple cut taxes in inner cities and new businesses 
and new jobs will flock to places like oakland calif and gary 
ind 
the idea works 
in my state these tax cuts called urban enterprise zones 
have created over 20000 jobs in neighborhoods that were torn by 
riots 20 years ago

we would create thousands more good inner city jobs tomorrow if 
the democratic congress would stop blocking jack kemps enterprise 
zones program 
we discovered something in new jersey every time we take an 
unemployed person and give them a job we take a democrat and turn 
him into a republican 
but good jobs will not matter if our children do not have the 
skills to fill them 
as a child i had a terrible stutter i also had dyslexia i 
overcame those problems but i couldnt have done it alone i went 
to a good school i had good teachers 
today a lot of children across america struggle with problems 
with a little help from a good school or a great teacher todays 
stuttering child could be tomorrows keynote speaker todays 
potential dropout could become tomorrows thomas edison 
thats why republican governors are leading a revolution in 
american education orr in indiana branstad in iowa hunt in 
alabama martinez in florida 
the democrats response is always the same spend more money 
but republican governors understand that money wont make a 
difference unless we change other things as well 
no more automatic passing of students from grade to grade if 
you cant write or read or count you dont deserve a high school 
diploma mediocrity can never be tolerated in teaching 
from now on hard work and creativity must be rewarded every 
single day 
when schools fail year after year lets admit it is the fault 
of adults not children stop blaming the children fix the schools 
and children cannot be educated if their minds are clouded by 
drugs kingpins who make millions by selling drugs to children are 
merchants of death

i agree with george bush those who dispense illegal drugs 
should be prepared to have death dispensed to them 
my father told me about roots and wings roots so that a child 
knows where hes coming from and wings so that he can soar on his 
own the roots are our values 
bill bennett is right our families and our schools should teach 
children the difference between right and wrong that honesty is 
the best policy and at the risk of offending some people there 
is nothing wrong with young americans reciting the pledge of 
allegiance 
the bush administration will offer the wings of great schools 
and good jobs the head of that administration will also reaffirm 
our roots 
george bush is a decent man and he shouldnt have to defend 
his being one if defending values such as loyalty family or 
belief in god is no longer fashionable then i fear for our country 
there is another value and it comes from the bible one 
generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the 
earth abideth forever so wrote solomon never has the need for 
environmental protection been written more beautifully 
today our air is plagued by acid rain our oceans and beaches 
are sullied by sewage and syringes our very future threatened by 
sunburn from above and poisoned water from below 
the party of teddy roosevelt must regain our environmental 
heritage in the 1990s we are going to clean america from one coast 
to the other you know what we are going to start way up north 
in boston harbor 
can jobs and trees go hand in hand yes they can and president 
bush is going to prove it 
what do americans want not litmus tests not special interest 
politics 
they want something very simple good jobs with high wages 
clean water and air streets free from drugs great schools an 
america strong abroad so our children will live at peace these 
desires like a parents love know no color or culture or creed

with these issues and with george bush at the helm we will go 
to the farms and the cities to the various and the union halls to 
the suburban developments as well as the country roads 
let us send one message to the democrats this evening we will 
not concede one single vote anywhere let the dukakis democrats 
offer the politics of delusion and exclusion we republicans will 
practice the politics of inclusion 
when i was young i often listened to a song about america 
called the house i live in the song asks the question what 
is america to me 
it speaks of old abe lincoln of jefferson and payne of 
washington and douglass and the task that still remains it says 
america is the right to speak my mind out and the air of feeling 
free 
the song concludes very simply the town i live in the 
street the house the room the pavement of the city or a garden 
all in bloom the church the school the clubhouse the million 
lights i see but especially the people thats america to me 
america is this and so much more but america has to be this and 
so much more for everyone 
you see we are pilgrims on this ship called liberty we carry 
with us the dreams of our forefathers whether they came on the 
mayflower or the slave ship or whether their ship docked at ellis 
island or the port of san francisco 
if the free nations of the world represent the fleet of 
democracy we are the flagship if we flounder the future of the 
free way of life will sink with us but if we succeed other 
nations will follow in our wake 
we have a historic mission we must prove to the world that in 
this voyage of america no one for reasons of race or background is 
ever left behind but that everyone is on board 
for all of us are crew on this ship of freedom all of us 
serve publicly or privately at our own stations it is our 
generations watch on deck 
each of us as a parent can make our house a home each of us as 
a worker can make our job a vocation each of us as a citizen can 
make our community a neighborhood 
with gods help we will reclaim the faith of our fathers we 
will practice the politics of inclusion 
with george bush as our leader we will redeem our american 
dream 
thank you very much

aids demonstrators and a dixieland band 
greeted vice president george bush as he cruised into the big easy 
by riverboat on tuesday 
bush laughed as the rebirth jazz ensemble ambled across a stage 
in spanish plaza along the mississippi river he didnt acknowledge 
the knot of protesters who started shouting a few seconds into his 
gladtobehere speech 
bush partisans tried to shout down the demonstrators who 
carried signs criticizing bush and president reagan for failing to 
do enough to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome bushs 
backers held their bush 88 signs high to block the protest 
messages from the vice president who was about 30 yards away 
within five minutes new orleans police and plainclothes 
security officers encircled the demonstrators whose arms were 
locked and pushed them farther from the podium bush never stopped 
his speech 
bush his wife barbara and several hundred supporters arrived 
at the plaza aboard the riverboat natchez a banner on an ornate 
upperdeck railing proclaimed steaming to victory 
the natchez was preceded by a fireboat that spewed three plumes 
of water colored red white and blue restored vintage military 
aircraft including an avenger like the one flown by bush in world 
war ii soared within 500 feet of the cheering crowd 
youngsters like sean mccree a boys club member wholl be 
eligible to vote in 1996 carried probush posters that were 
distributed by grownup supporters i think ill vote someday 
mccree said but he was stumped by a query about his party 
preference huh he said 
brocton wilson 13 another boys club member clutched a 
crumpled paper bag from a drug store inside were a couple of boys 
club tshirts sizes large and medium that he hoped to hand to the 
vice president but he had trouble penetrating the throng that 
lined a police barricade from the stage to bushs waiting motorcade 
lorean labranch wore a styrofoam boater with a red white and 
blue band they threw it to me just before the rally like mardi 
gras she said while keeping track of a halfdozen kids 
the riverboats calliope wailed dixie as dark clouds 
swirled overhead but rain didnt come during the rally

they will report a second american emancipation working 
men and women freed from the oppression of jimmy carters inflation 
they will report the incredible fact that the leader of the 
soviet union went on television and admitted that communism has 
failed 
they will report that for the very first time in the nuclear 
age instead of designing new weapons of destruction we are 
destroying old ones 
but my friends this election is not about the past but the 
future 
a great deal about the dukakis campaign can be summed up by one 
incident 
you see this flag of red white and blue 
it symbolizes the land of the free and the home of the brave 
well their media consultants in atlanta said they didnt think 
the colors looked good on television 
so they changed red to pink blue to azure and the white to egg 
shell 
well i dont know about you but i believe americans democrat 
and republican alike have no use for pastel patriotism 
but the liberal democrats are trying to hide more than the 
colors in our flag they are trying to hide their true colors 
they want higher taxes 
but they wont say so 
they want to weaken america 
but they wont admit it 
and they want to play the politics of special interests 
last week in a rare moment of candor a prominent dukakis 
democrat explained their strategy to a reporter from congressional 
quarterly magazine 
what he said shocked me and i have to share it with you he 
said democrats advice to special interests was and i quote 
just shut up gays women environmentalists just shut up and 
you will get everything you want after the election in the 
meantime just shut up so we can win

michael dukakis on tuesday returned 
president reagans facts are stubborn things line in a 
counterattack which blamed the administration for rising interest 
rates budget and trade deficits and several foreign policy 
debacles 
irancontra noriega beirut facts are stubborn things 
dukakis told reporters a day after reagan used the same refrain to 
list his accomplishments in an address at the republican national 
convention in new orleans 
this is a nation that eight years ago was the largest creditor 
nation in the world dukakis said shortly after the 
administration released figures showing a sharp increase in the 
us trade deficit 
today we are the largest debtor nation in the world dukakis 
said thats the consequence of eight years of borrowing and 
spending and borrowing and spending facts are stubborn things and 
these are the facts we are going to be debating it will be mr 
george bush who will have to respond to those facts 
later dukakis responded to the selection of indiana sen dan 
quayle as bushs running mate saying the conservative senator was 
not well known and that his own choice texas sen lloyd bentsen 
was far more experienced than quayle 
senator bensten is a mature thoughtful man with real stature 
somebody whos a real leader in the united states senate 
dukakis said senator bentsen has been seasoned experienced on 
issues of foreign policy defense space thats the kind of 
stature thats the kind of strength the kind of maturity i think 
you want in a vice president especially when that vice president 
may be president 
dukakis campaign aides immediately attacked quayles record 
criticizing him for supporting a freeze on social security benefits 
and his opposition to plant closing drought assistance and civil 
rights legislation 
he does not understand the economic problems facing the 
american family dukakis spokesman mark gearan said of quayle 
we learned today that the vice president cant keep a secret and 
that instead of showing himself as a man in his own right he 
placated the extreme right wing of his party 
the massachusetts governor wrapping up an annual visit to 
central massachusetts said he expected the vice president to cut 
into his lead in the polls because of the usual convention bounce 
but he said he did not expect the boost to last or that reagans 
personal popularity would help the vice president 
things will settle down dukakis said this is an election 
between michael dukakis and george bush the question voters 
are going to be asking themselves is which one of us has the 
ability to lead 
reagan in his speech to the gop convention monday night said 
bush should be elected because the nation could not afford to have 
a president who would need onthejobtraining 
dukakis laughed when asked about that remark and then said 
the same might have been said of the republican nominee in 
1980 said dukakis referring to reagan the former california 
governor 
none of us comes to the presidency with onthejob training 
least of all vice presidents dukakis said 
senior dukakis adviser kirk odonnell told reporters that the 
dukakis campaign did not believe reagans speech hurt dukakis or 
was any great help to bush 
he also said the campaign did not believe criticizing the carter 
administratrion as reagan did monday night would be effective for 
the republicans a position dukakis echoed at his news conference 
just after odonnells briefing 
this election isnt about the past dukakis said its 
about the future its about our economic future 
dukakis also said he was not bothered by the harsh criticism of 
him at the republican convention 
if you went through what i went through in the mid70s its a 
day at the beach said dukakis who was voted out of office in 
1978 after raising taxes and slashing welfare benefits in his first 
term he returned to office in 1983 
dukakis was heading out wednesday on a fourday campaign trip 
that includes stops in minnesota florida alabama illinois 
missouri arkansas and texas 
he said he spoke to former rival jesse jackson on wednesday 
morning and had spoken to him several times in recent weeks no 
joint campaign appearances have been scheduled as yet but will be 
soon dukakis said 
its going to be a close relationship dukakis said 
the governors schedule for the day included a meeting with 
regional editors and publishers the swearing in of a judge a 
meeting with an anticrime council and the distribution of more 
than 300000 in grants for drug education programs he also toured 
an apple orchard in the central massachusetts town of northboro 
where he had a luncheon with area farmers and environmentalists 
during the meeting with the local news organizations dukakis 
called reagans veto of the defense authorization bill a strictly 
political veto that would undermine national security 
what kind of a contribution to national defense and national 
security is that dukakis asked now weve got mass confusion 
in addition to all the scandal thats not the way you build a 
strong america

sen alan simpson of wyoming is rarely at a 
loss for words and neither are his allies and opponents when it 
comes to describing the republican minority whip 
outspoken straightshooting gutsy selfdeprecating fiery 
downtoearth witty 
this biting style has won simpson both praise and criticism but 
it also raised nagging questions at the republican national 
convention where he was frequently mentioned as a possible running 
mate for george bush 
bush may have looked long and hard at simpson but on tuesday 
afternoon he settled on fellow sen dan quayle of indiana 
was the man who once scolded reporters for trying to catch 
president reagan off balance and stick it in his gazoo too 
outspoken to be vice president would he have been a liability on 
the campaign trail 
it is if i get smartalecky simpson said monday noting the 
thin line between good humor and sharpness 
but as he reflected on the record and public statements of 
democratic nominee michael dukakis simpson smiled and said i 
can just see how you can have a lot of fun with this chap 
simpson played down his prospects of landing on the republican 
ticket and this past weekend said he had asked bush to remove him 
from his list of possible running mates i would be a 
liability he said because of his support of politically 
unpopular positions 
simpson while generally regarded as a conservative supports a 
womans right to abortion limiting social security benefits and is 
open to a tax increase to deal with the federal budget deficit 
ive had a very checkered career ive punched the lights out 
of a lot of sacred cows simpson said in an interview with nbc 
news 
sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire who had urged bush to 
select a staunch conservative agreed with simpsons assessment 
hes a man of great selfcontrol strong feelings a hell of a 
sense of humor humphrey said his one problem is 
righttolife that would create an opening for the democrats 
for some though simpson would have been the ideal vice 
presidential candidate 
hes outspoken in a very acceptable way said sen orrin 
hatch of utah who along with simpson serves on the judiciary 
committee hes humorous gutsy 
hatch said the 6foot7 simpson has an ichabod crane appeal 
referring to the tall gangly character in washington irvings 
legend of sleepy hollow 
his sense of humor is always close to the surface 
consider simpsons speech to the convention monday night 
there was the good news and bad news from atlanta simpson 
said the good news was that dukakis laid all those cards on the 
table the bad news is they were all face down 
next simpson introduced to a national audience the slogan he 
had unveiled earlier in the day in the form of blackandwhite 
campaign buttons found on the lapels of the wyoming delegation 
the democrats asked the wrong question the question was not 
wheres george the question is whos mike

fifteen workers at the turkey point nuclear plant 
had to be decontaminated tuesday after about 3200 gallons of 
mildly radioactive water leaked from a spentfuel pool utility 
officials said 
no injuries were reported and radiation levels were safe 
officials said 
the employees who helped clean up the spill in the open canal 
were decontaminated by washing off their shoes and clothes said 
stacey shaw spokeswoman for the plants owner florida power amp 
light co 
a radiation inspector from the nuclear regulatory commission was 
en route to the plant which the federal agency has listed as one 
of the nations 10 worst 
theres no health threat at all to anyone inside or outside 
the plant nrc spokesman ken clark said this water could have 
been released to the cooling canal under controlled conditions 
anyway without violating regulations 
plant workers and nrc inspectors were monitoring radiation 
levels in the canal and initial readings were only 5 percent of 
allowable maximum levels clark said 
joette lorion founder of the private center for nuclear 
responsibility and a longtime foe of the plant called the event 
alarming 
any incident that happens in a spent fuel pool should be taken 
seriously she said 
the long canal system inside the plant boundaries allows heat to 
dissipate from nonradioactive cooling water warmed by the reactor 
core a function performed by cooling towers at many other nuclear 
plants the canal is just off biscayne bay but is not directly 
connected to it 
the leak began in a 30foot deep pool where spent fuel rods are 
kept in a building adjacent to unit 4 a 1inch valve broke on a 
pump that keeps the pool water circulating slowly allowing water 
to pour out at 100 gallons a minute ms shaw said 
most of the fuel has been there at least a couple of years so 
the water is not highly radioactive clark noted 
by just after midnight the pool level had dropped about 2 
inches setting off an alarm at the plants control center when 
plant workers rushed to the site they found the buildings floor 
flooded and water pouring out the door 
the water flowed across a paved area into a storm drain that 
leads directly to the canal system resident nrc inspectors were at 
the site by 3 am clark said 
unit 4 has been shut down for unrelated reasons and was to start 
up again tuesday 
the plant 30 miles south of miami was again this year identified 
by the nrc as one of the nations worst fpl has been fined 
repeatedly for violations ranging from corroded bolts holding the 
reactor together to guards found asleep at their posts and 
unauthorized people allowed into the control room 
last year the nrc ordered wholesale changes at turkey point and 
the utility submitted an independent management consultants 
report the nrc sent the report back for changes and 
coincidentally fpl announced tuesday it has resubmitted a 134page 
plan to the agency 
the document calls for hiring more experienced personnel 
reducing overtime shortening maintenance backlogs and better 
organizing maintenance schedules

portauprince haiti ap a provincial mayor confirmed 
tuesday that four youths were killed by army gunfire last weekend 
and said he was one of those named by the central government to a 
committee to investigate 
radio haitiinter said tuesday that four youths were killed and 
two wounded when soldiers fired without warning on a meeting in the 
remote town of labadie 
mayor andre paul chrysostome of petite riviere de lartibonite 
the capital of the province involved denied the report of the two 
wounded 
he was the first government official to comment on the 
shootings the national government has issued no official 
statement repeated inquiries by the associated press in person and 
by telephone proved fruitless 
first word of the incident was broadcast monday by radio soleil 
the roman catholic station which reported 10 dead and an 
undetermined number of wounded 
the rev hugo trieste director of radio soleil later told the 
ap the lower casualty figures given by haitiinter probably were 
correct 
trieste said his station got its information from five youths 
who were at the meeting when the soldiers fired but that the five 
were still in a state of shock which would account for the 
inflated number of victims they reported 
the investigating commission began work monday headed by 
lafortune sintilus commander of the army barracks in the zone 
haitiinter reported it said other members include chrysostome 
three policemen a justice of the peace a magistrate and local 
police chief esperance charles 
haitiinter said three masked men one dressed in an olive green 
uniform and the other two in civilian clothes fired without 
warning at a meeting attended by about 350 people 
radio metropole said the meeting was celebrating the second 
anniversary of the founding of the youth club of labadie it said 
this was a grassroots group affiliated with a provincial 
organization which in turn was linked to the confederation of 
democratic unity an organization opposed to the military 
government of lt gen henri namphy 
labadie lies 80 miles north of the capital city of 
portauprince and near petite riviere de lartibonite scene of 
violent political conflicts before the aborted presidential

tens of thousands of puerto ricans who seek independence for the 
caribbean island that is now a us commonwealth puerto ricans are

republicans who have been patting themselves 
on the back for picking the superdome for their national convention 
have gotten a few kicks in the rump from people who have been 
cupping their ears to hear 
technicians were adjusting the sound system tuesday after former 
sen barry goldwater the gops 1964 presidential nominee 
complained that he thought the sound was terrible 
at one point tuesday morning the sound system went on the blink 
while rep helen bentley rmd was giving a speech the acoustics 
on the podium itself must not be very good because mrs bentley 
kept talking even after the sound went out 
she stopped when someone tapped her on the shoulder and told her 
the microphone was dead after a few minutes and a couple of 
piercing squeals of electronic feedback the sound was restored 
superdome general manager bob johnson was quick to point out 
that the sound system is the one the republicans had installed for 
the occasion 
it is not the superdome system he said 
on monday night goldwater was seated in the box reserved for 
vice president george bush to listen to president reagans farewell 
speech 
where i sat i didnt hear a word goldwater said tuesday on 
nbctvs today show 
the vice presidents box as well as the one where reagan sat 
monday night are half a football field away from the podium and 
the problems with the sound system were compounded by the presence 
of 36000 people many of whom were talking to each other 
conditions are no better on the convention floor where the 
pretty red carpets are laid atop a temporary plywood floor even 
delegates seated close to the podium have to strain to hear above 
the constant rumble made by thousands of shuffling feet 
i said i was serving my time this morning said phyllis 
gault an alternate from norman okla who was seated in the 
delegate section 
oklahoma delegates who have relatively good seats are all but 
forcing the alternates who sit in the back of the hall to trade 
places with them the seats at the back of the hall are not near 
the plywood flooring and the sound is better 
barbara pardue a convention spokeswoman said adjustments were 
being made to the sound system and more speakers were being put on 
the floor tuesday 
she said the adjustments were necessary because the buildings 
acoustical characteristics vary with the number of people in the 
hall and where they sit

rep bill chappell dfla said tuesday he 
approved of his former accountant testifying before a federal grand 
jury in alexandria va which is investigating defense department 
procurement practices 
the accountant ray crippen testified tuesday before the 
federal panel concerning the wind meadows racquet club in ocala 
fla that chappell once owned 
according to published reports two men tied to the defense 
industry intervened in a foreclosure lawsuit against chappell 
involving the racquet club they were leonard kilgore a defense 
consultant and former chappell aide and george l dalferes vice 
president of governmental affairs for martin marietta heading up 
the companys lobbying arm 
martin marietta disclosed in july that it has acquired the ocala 
racquet club from the investors who had earlier purchased it to 
help chappell 
in a statement released by chappells office the veteran 
congressman who is chairman of a house subcommittee that oversees 
billions of dollars in defense spending said 
recently there have been reports concerning financial records 
and transactions surrounding the wind meadows racquet club as i 
have indicated in the past i want to answer all questions 
concerning the wind meadows club and any other issue that has been 
raised 
that is why i wanted my accountant ray crippen to provide 
information to federal investigators chappell said 
the congressman who is seeking reelection to an 11th term in 
congress said because of floridas accountantclient privilege 
laws the only way crippen could answer questions about the club 
was before a federal grand jury 
in a july release martin marietta officials said they knew of 
chappells involvment when the company purchased the club martin 
marietta has a plant in silver springs shores and corporate offices 
in ocala 
martin marietta has said the club was a good investment because 
the property has a market value in excess of the purchase price 
the company said it paid 200000 for the club and it is listed on 
marion county tax rolls for 214967 
chappell has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with 
the racquet club or in his relationship with armtec 
the congressmans status in this investigation has not 
changed in fact we are confident that as we provide more 
information it will become even more apparent that all of the 
congressmans transactions have been and are proper his office

abortion opponents sang god bless america and 
nearly overwhelmed police at a clinic tuesday in a demonstration 
that ended when 157 activists were jailed in the largest mass 
arrest since weeks of protests began 
a total of 593 protesters have been arrested since the 
demonstrations began four weeks ago during the democratic national 
convention as of monday 178 remained in jail because they refused 
to identify themselves 
demonstrators sang and prayed as they blocked entrances to the 
atlanta surgicenter a frequent target of protests staged by the 
new yorkbased operation rescue the clinic performs abortions and 
other surgery 
atlanta police spokesman cal jackson said the arrested people 
would be charged with criminal trespass and with giving false 
names traffic was snarled in the area around the clinic after 
protesters blocked spring street a major artery 
the abortion opponents led by operation rescue leader randall 
terry found 20 officers waiting for them when they arrived at the 
center police also observed the protesters activities from 
helicopters 
about 70 police and corrections officers formed a barrier and 
quickly arrested three or four protesters involved in a shoving 
incident that strained the makeshift police line the shoving began 
as officers shifted positions to keep demonstrators away from the 
clinic 
there is no possibility that we will stop the rescues unless 
mayor andrew young would like to make an executive decree closing 
down the abortion mills in atlanta terry said 
fiftyeight of those arrested during earlier protests identified 
themselves during hearings at the city jail monday and posted 500 
bond each twenty other protesters continued to identify themselves

republican presidential nomineetobe george 
bush broke the suspense that had gripped this convention city and 
picked on tuesday youthful sen dan quayle of indiana as his 
running mate 
lets go get em shouted an exuberant quayle as bush 
designated him as his choice at a rally on the shore of the 
mississippi river 
left in the lurch were a dozen or so leading republicans 
several of them better known that quayle who got the bad news in a 
series of brief telephone calls from bush 
one by one in the hours after bush landed at belle chasse naval 
air station outside new orleans word leaked out that one or 
another vice presidential prospect had been eliminated 
thus the convention pastime name that running mate became a 
process of elimination it was only a short time earlier that bush 
made it known he had made his decision but intended to keep it a 
secret 
the secret became harder and harder to keep as prospects were 
eliminated 
ron kaufman bushs new england coordinator said the decision 
to make the announcement tuesday rather than wait until thursday as 
originally planned was because there seemed to us to be a little 
bit of flatness in the convention and this puts a lot of pizazz 
into todays program 
others who had been on the list were quick to praise the choice 
that ended their dreams of sharing the national ticket 
i told the vice president im going to look forward to 
campaigning for a bushquayle ticket in 1988 said rep jack kemp 
of new york who had openly coveted the nod i told him mr 
vice president i want you to know my support is unconditional 
sen alan simpson rwyo also considered for the post called 
quayle a young good choice 
i knew danny was on the list and i think its an excellent 
choice he said my first choice was bob dole danny quayle 
will be a very attractive choice 
among the first to receive the phone calls from bush were kemp 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas and his wife former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole sen pete domenici of new 
mexico and gov carroll campbell of south carolina 
campbell quoted bush as telling him we dont need to go south 
for a running mate 
campbells information ruled out two tennesseans former gov 
lamar alexander and howard h baker a former senator and white 
house chief of staff 
as names dropped by the wayside sen gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire added a new one sen john mccain of arizona a former 
vietnam prisoner of war 
campbell apparently knew but he wasnt saying anything other 
than to tell his south carolina delegation i think youll be 
very pleased 
the south is considered bushs strongest region in the fall 
campaign against michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen although the 
selection of the texas senator for the democratic vice presidential 
nomination was a direct challenge to bush in the state he calls 
home 
as he flew to new orleans on air force two bush told reporters 
he had made his decision but intended to keep it a secret a while 
longer 
he said the final phase in the process came just before i 
climbed onto this plane today with finality 
i want an opportunity to properly notify the person i will 
nominate bush said explaining why he was delaying further his 
announcement 
word of the selection of quayle got out as the vice president 
arrived by riverboat in the convention city 
it is george bushs america that we will work for said 
quayle as he and bush stood together at the podium 
the choice of the 41yearold quayle a robert redford 
lookalike was likely to bolster the gop ticket in the midwest a 
region where bush fared poorly in the primaries 
quayle who defeated democratic sen birch bayh in the 1980 
reagan landslide has a strongly conservative voting record 
certain to please the delegates at this gop convention 
in the senate quayle is a member of the armed services budget 
and labor and human services committees 
two of bushes top advisers pollster robert teeter and media 
expert roger ailes also have worked on quayles congressional 
campaigns 
in quayles 1980 senate race much was made of the resemblance 
between the young congressman and robert redford at one point the 
actor sent quayle a telegram complaining about the lookalike 
references in his promotional literature after he won he sent 
redford an autographed picture of himself 
asked about the comparison this week quayle sighed his blue 
eyes flashed as he brushed his brownishblond hair aside 
impatiently 
ive had that stigma since i first ran for the senate its 
stuck ever since he says obviously id rather talk about the 
issues i think i have a feeling of what jack kennedy went through 
id rather talk about what i stand for than what i look like 
bush and president reagan had a brief meeting at belle chasse 
naval air station with president on his way to a california 
vacation the vice president on his way to assume his role as his 
partys choice as reagans successor 
when reporters asked reagan if he knew the identity of bushs 
running mate the president replied 
im not sure that he knows 
bush turned to reagan and said i know

spearheading a republican attack on michael 
dukakis limited foreign policy experience former un ambassador 
jeane kirkpatrick said tuesday night that the democratic 
presidential candidates approach to world affairs is dangerous and 
naive 
in an address to the republican national convention mrs 
kirkpatrick said dukakis policies would leave the nation 
vulnerable to nuclear attack and remove any incentive for the 
soviet union to make a nuclear arms control bargain 
with repeated assertions that george bush knows better mrs 
kirkpatrick characterized the dukakis approach as collectivism in 
domestic affairs weakness in defense and confusion about americas 
role in the world 
she called dukakis policy pronouncements to date deeply 
disturbing criticizing him for advocating cuts in the us 
nuclear arsenal ending the star wars strategic defense 
initiative and emphasizing a buildup in conventional arms 
we know dukakis favors negotiations she said but his 
proposed unilateral cuts would leave the soviets no incentive to 
negotiate michael dukakis doesnt say he will make america more 
vulnerable but that is the inevitable consequence of cancelling 
major weapons systems 
mrs kirkpatrick said the nuclear threat to the united states 
comes not only from the soviet union but from the half dozen other 
countries whom she said either have or soon will have nuclear 
weapons and the capacity to deliver them on target 
to speak as though we could defend ourselves against these 
weapons with more and better tanks is simply ludicrous she said 
and added michael dukakis simply does not take the need for a 
defense seriously 
this attitude that weak is strong and vulnerable is safe is 
extremely dangerous she said michael dukakis is more worried 
about an american presidents misuse of power than about an 
adversarys use of it 
reckless antiamerican leaders in trouble spots around the globe 
and the proliferation of nuclear weapons make the world too 
dangerous for america to rely on naive unrealistic uninformed 
strategies to defend our freedom she said 
the american people know there is no cram course for learning 
about global politics world needs nuclear strategy national 
security she said it takes years of study practice and of 
being there 
she accused dukakis of hiding his true intentions behind 
deliberately vague rhetoric 
in the dukakis campaign there is a large carefully cultivated 
discrepancy between conservative style and liberal substance she 
said and asked will it fool enough of the people for long enough 
to elect michael dukakis 
we need a president who understands the world she said 
we cannot settle for less

george bush in his quest for the presidency 
is promising to uphold the reagan legacy on taxes the economy and 
defense while trying to soften the republicans image on 
education the environment child care and other domestic concerns 
the republican presidential nomineetobe has been campaigning 
in day care centers as well as defense plants has called for a 
moratorium on drilling for oil off the california coast and a ban 
on ocean dumping he has proposed bigger and more specific 
education increases than democrat michael dukakis 
bush tells voters everywhere i wont raise your taxes 
period he even backs lowering the tax rate on capital gains from 
28 to 15 percent 
bush contends that particular tax cut would produce more revenue 
for the treasury not less apart from his concept of letting the 
overall budget grow no faster than inflation bush has not 
specified what programs would be trimmed back to pay for his new 
spending initiatives or rapid deployment of the strategic defense 
initiative 
while his party has accused the democrats of making promises in 
their platform that could cost taxpayers 43 billion gop officials 
said tuesday they do not yet know how much it would cost to 
implement everything in their platform 
nebraska gov kay orr the platform chairman apologized its 
been a busy week she said and she said the bush campaign would 
provide answers in a few days 
bush is running on his experience in foreign affairs from his 
days as united nations ambassador envoy to china and director of 
central intelligence to his globetrotting duties of the past seven 
years as a standin for president reagan 
after some hesitation he has promised to deploy a spacebased 
defense shield reagans strategic defense initiative as soon 
as feasible and has accused his democratic foe of favoring 
unilateral disarmament 
but while pledging to keep america strong and to maintain the 
policies that ushered in 69 straight months of economic growth 
bush is also emphasizing domestic issues that were not at the top 
of the reagan agenda or budget 
bush who says he would be the education president has 
proposed a 500 million program to reward schools that succeed with 
children from poor homes he also wants to increase the head start 
budget and create taxfree college savings bonds 
while congress wrestles with a 25 billion democratic 
childcare bill bush is proposing his own 22 billion childcare 
tax credit targeted at lowincome families 
gingerly this vice president who prides himself on loyalty has 
broken with the official reagan posture on ethics in government 
the environment and the civil rights of aids patients 
he has suggested he would take a harder line on human rights 
issues during arms control talks with the soviets and promised to 
avoid swings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated 
pessimism in dealings with them 
on defense spending which doubled in the reagan years bush 
says i believe that the administrations approach in rebuilding 
americas defenses is fundamentally correct but he promises to 
overhaul pentagon procurement and have no tolerance for waste 
bush supports a mobile mx missile which dukakis opposes bush 
says that the midgetman missile a single warhead weapon that 
would be hard for the soviets to locate could enhance 
stability 
bush backs a 10 percent tax credit for oil and gas exploration 
he opposes an oil import fee 
on reducing the federal deficit bush says the most important 
action we need to take is to hold the line on taxing and 
spending like reagan he favors lineitem veto authority and a 
balanced budget amendment to the constitution 
he has proposed a flexible freeze that would allow most 
programs merely to keep pace with the rate of inflation but to 
make room for new spending initiatives some programs would have to 
be trimmed 
bush has promised to exempt social security from budget cuts 
deborah steelman bushs domestic policy director cited child 
care ethics the environment and safe streets as key issues of 
concern for bush 
bush opposes abortion except in the case of incest rape or to 
save the life of the mother he favors medicaid funding of 
abortion only to save a mothers life 
on aids bush has said the government may have to spend more on 
research and education he endorsed a presidential commissions 
call for legislation to protect the civil rights of aids victims 
and those with the virus a step reagan refused to take 
on illicit drugs bush says he would make the war on drugs a 
top priority but he says the war will never be won unless young 
people can be convinced to steer clear of drugs 
he promises to see that all american families are able to 
obtain decent affordable housing primarily by keeping interest 
rates down but also by continuing housing aid to lowincome 
families 
bush has said we must do more to meet the needs of the 
homeless including development of communitybased mental health 
clinics 
on crime bush says he will appoint judges who will crack down 
on criminals and he will seek to stop hamstringing our 
police in particular he favors admission of illegally seized 
evidence in criminal trials if the police had a good faith belief 
their search was lawful 
bush supports the death penalty for those who commit heinous 
crimes including copkillers and drug kingpins 
on health care he promises a comprehensive effort to reduce 
the cost and improve the quality of and access to health care in 
america he would seek to squeeze waste and inefficiency from 
medicare and medicaid and promote health maintenance organizations 
he favors tax incentives for group insurance plans to pay for 
longterm care and wants to allow individual retirement accounts 
to be converted to pay for longterm care he also would ease 
medicaid requirements that force the needy elderly to spend 
down their life savings before qualifying for help 
bush who once ran an oildrilling operation in the gulf of 
mexico says there is no way to meet our energy requirements 
without offshore drilling but he would delay lease sales in 
extraordinarily sensitive areas like the california coast until 
it is certain the coast will not be harmed 
bush favors full decontrol of natural gas greater reliance on 
coal and retention of nuclear power as part of our energy mix 
on ethics bush has promised to establish a white house ethics 
office to hold government jobholders to an exacting code of 
conduct he also wants the federal ethics law applied to members 
of congress as well as those in the executive branch 
bush opposes an equal rights amendment to the constitution and 
any move to require federal registration of gun owners 
he supports laws to allow voluntary prayer in public school

a cubanborn fbi agent with a doctorate in 
law testified tuesday that he was told he couldnt be a legal 
adviser for the agency in washington because of his dark skin and 
accent 
appearing as a witness for hispanic agents suing the fbi for 
discrimination fernando mata also said he was ostracized by his 
colleagues in the miami fbi office for participating in a 
fundraiser for the lawsuit 
the agents 311 of whom have joined the suit being tried in 
us district court contend that the fbi discriminates against 
hispanics in hiring promoting and disciplining they are seeking 
damages and a change in fbi promotion practices 
the lawsuit say hispanic activists could have ramifications 
far beyond the agency 
the 60s were the decade of blacks the 70s were the decade 
of women hugo rodriguez cocounsel for the plaintiffs said 
the 80s and 90s are the decades of the hispanics hispanics are 
here to be reckoned with we think the laws should be applied to 
them equally 
jose de lara national director of the league of united latin 
american citizens said he expected more lawsuits contesting 
discrimination by government agencies against hispanics 
once we get a ruling on this issue were going to take this 
issue all over the country he said this is sort of a 
detonator that will get this issue going 
he said the case is important not only for law enforcement 
but for other departments as well such as government offices in 
other entities such as social workers 
the justice department which is defending the fbi has 
dispatched a total of 23 people to mount the defense including two 
teams of lawyers paralegals and nonhispanic fbi agents the 
plaintiffs legal team comprises three lawyers 
government lawyers in el paso and department officials in 
washington refused comment tuesday on the case 
also tuesday a statistical analyst hired by the plaintiffs 
testified that the numbers show hispanic fbi agents are less likely 
to hold higher level jobs 
of 9000 fbi agents 400 are hispanic or 44 percent hispanics 
make up 8 percent of the population 
gary lafree associate professor of sociology at the university 
of new mexico testified that 15 percent of hispanic fbi agents 
with at least five years of agency experience are managers 
compared with 21 percent of nonhispanic fbi agents with the same 
level of experience 
hispanics and nonhispanics do equally as well on management 
test scores said lafree 
bernardo matt perez who originally brought the suit is the 
highest ranking hispanic in the fbi he is secondincommand in el 
paso 
mata with the fbi in miami testified that a few years ago he 
applied for a job as legal adviser in washington he was an 
assistant legal adviser in newark at the time 
he was turned down for the washington job 
i was told that as a person who spoke with an accent and who 
had dark skin that looked hispanic it would look bad for me to 
represent the fbi he said 
mata did not attribute what he was told to any individual in 
his testimony he referred to his supervisors vaguely as they or 
them

here are excerpts from the prepared text of 
the keynote address by gov thomas h kean of new jersey to the 
republican national convention on tuesday night 
a great deal about the dukakis campaign can be summed up by 
one incident 
you see this flag of red white and blue 
it symbolizes the land of the free and the home of the brave 
well their media consultants in atlanta said they didnt think 
the colors looked good on television 
so they changed red to pink blue to azure and the white to egg 
shell 
well i dont know about you but i believe americans democrat 
and republican alike have no use for pastel patriotism 
but the liberal democrats are trying to hide more than the 
colors in our flag they are trying to hide their true colors 
they want higher taxes 
but they wont say so 
they want to weaken america 
but they wont admit it 
we are not afraid to show our true republican colors our 
purpose was spoken more than 100 years ago by a man who said 
america means a government whose leading object is to elevate the 
condition of men to lift artificial weights from all shoulders 
to afford every person an unfettered start and a fair chance in 
the race of life 
those words were abraham lincolns and my fellow republicans 
his creed is our creed 
when we have followed it we have succeeded 
when we have deviated from it we have failed 
today americans have the same dreams but the answer to 
those dreams will not come through bigger government in washington 
you see thats what the democrats offer 
its no wonder the most popular movie in atlanta during their 
convention was big they thought it was a documentary on their 
philosophy 
the dukakis democrats will try to talk tough 
but dont be fooled 
they may try to talk like dirty harry but they will still act 
like pee wee herman 
in 200 years there has never been a candidate for president 
whose experience in world affairs and knowledge of foreign nations 
has exceeded that of george bush 
we must stay the course at home as well if the reaganbush 
years have proved anything it is that the heroes of the american 
economy are not paper pushers along the potomac but dream makers 
in dayton denver and dallas 
the dukakis democrats dont believe that they make promises 
without a price tag 
add up all the wayout programs of the democratic party what 
does the name of dukakis sound like to you more taxes 
eight years ago we gained power because americans yearned for 
freedom freedom from the shackles of high taxes freedom from the 
tyranny of inflation freedom from the burdens of big government 
and we wanted freedom from the embarrassment of an america that 
wore a kick me sign on its back

well we republicans delivered after eight years of ronald 
reagan and george bush our country is stronger safer and better 
today and americans are proud to admit it 
but new challenges lie ahead we want new freedoms 
freedom from racism freedom from poor schools freedom from 
polluted oceans freedom from crack dealers 
and most of all we want freedom to know that our future will be 
made right here in the united states of america 
many of us have been blessed with good jobs good homes and good 
families but we also care about those who are not so fortunate 
we have to care because their future is now our future their 
tomorrow is our tomorrow the simple truth is there are no spare 
americans any longer 
to those who are illschooled illtrained or illhoused we 
must reach out and lift the artificial weights as lincoln promised 
as republicans we will do it not only because economically it is 
the only thing to do but because morally it is the right thing to 
do 
as a child i had a terrible stutter i also had dyslexia i 
overcame those problems but i couldnt have done it alone i went 
to a good school i had good teachers 
today a lot of children across america struggle with problems 
with a little help from a good school or a great teacher todays 
stuttering child could be tomorrows keynote speaker todays 
potential dropout could become tomorrows thomas edison 
when schools fail year after year lets admit it is the fault 
of adults not children stop blaming the children fix the schools 
and children cannot be educated if their minds are clouded by 
drugs kingpins who make millions by selling drugs to children are 
merchants of death 
i agree with george bush those who dispense illegal drugs 
should be prepared to have death dispensed to them 
george bush is a decent man and he shouldnt have to defend 
his being one if defending values such as loyalty family or 
belief in god is no longer fashionable then i fear for our 
country 
today our air is plagued by acid rain our oceans and beaches 
are sullied by sewage and syringes our very future threatened by 
sunburn from above and poisoned water from below 
the party of teddy roosevelt must regain our environmental 
heritage in the 1990s we are going to clean america from one coast 
to the other you know what we are going to start way up north 
in boston harbor 
let us send one message to the democrats this evening we will 
not concede one single vote anywhere let the dukakis democrats 
offer the politics of delusion and exclusion we republicans will 
practice the politics of inclusion 
with gods help we will reclaim the faith of our fathers we 
will practice the politics of inclusion 
with george bush as our leader we will redeem our american 
dream

sen dan quayles name was raised in a 
sexandinfluence scandal when he was a member of house in 1981 
although he denied having an affair with the woman involved 
lobbyist paula parkinson 
thats been looked into and theres absolutely nothing to 
it said james a baker iii soon to become george bushs 
campaign chairman 
quayle now the junior senator from indiana was one of three 
house members who shared a cottage with mrs parkinson during a 
golfing vacation in florida in january 1980 
mrs parkinson who appeared nude in playboy magazine that same 
year said she was going to tell justice department investigators 
that she had love affairs with fewer than a dozen republican 
house members 
and she told the washington post in march 1981 that she had 
videotaped one of her sexual encounters with a congressman neither 
the tape or the name of the congressman if there was such a 
congressman have been made public 
she also told the post that she had accepted 500 in cash a 
member of congress to pay for the abortion of their unborn child 
the name of that congressman also has not surfaced 
at the time of the incident mrs parkinson was 30 years old and 
separated from her husband hank parkinson 
she was a registered lobbyist for an insurance industry group 
opposed to proposed legislation to set up a national crop insurance 
program the bill passed by a 235150 margin in september 1980 and 
quayle voted against it 
the justice department investigated mrs parkinsons activities 
but in august 1981 officials dropped the case and did not file 
criminal charges 
she gave us some salacious accounts of purported activities 
with congressmen but there was no evidence of federal violation 
sources said at the time 
the two congressmen besides quayle who shared the florida 
cottage with parkinson were rep tom railsback rill and rep 
thomas b evans rdel 
parkinson said she had an affair lasting seven months with 
evans who later left the house evans declined to characterize the 
nature of his relationship with mrs parkinson but did say i 
deeply regret any association i ever had with her

sen dan quayle says comparisons to robert 
redford are a stigma he must bear but beyond the golden good 
looks the man tapped for the no 2 spot on the republican ticket 
aims to be taken seriously 
george bush announced tuesday before a cheering crowd on the 
mississippi riverfront that he had chosen indianas junior senator 
as his running mate quayle stepped up and told bush lets go 
get em 
an ardent conservative in his second senate term quayle has 
seen little of the national spotlight and has yet to attain the 
level of peer respect enjoyed by his senior colleague sen richard 
lugar 
quayle 41 acknowledges that he was not exactly a household 
word when news came that he was a hot vice presidential prospect 
with his youth and movie star looks he was quickly mobbed by 
the media at the republican national convention he basked in the 
attention a few more days of this we can take it he joked 
at one point 
quayle admits that life has been very good to me i never had 
to worry about where i was going to go 
tuesday sharing the stage with bush quayle told the crowd he 
was honored and a bit humbled and went on to invoke what my 
grandfather told me that there is nothing more important in this 
country than freedom 
he added george bush will keep the freedom and peace of this 
world 
bush for his part introduced quayle as freedoms friend 
a man of the future a young man born in the middle of this century 
and from the middle of america 
later treasury secretary james a baker iii told reporters that 
quayle was a man of the future a leader for the future and 
an excellent campaigner he said quayles youth and the fact 
that his wife had practiced law and had been a professional 
woman enhanced his value to the ticket 
born in indianapolis j danforth quayle is a member of a 
prominent publishing family the pulliams his grandfather was 
eugene c pulliam publisher of the indianapolis star and news the 
arizona republic and the phoenix gazette quayles father james c 
quayle is publisher of the huntington heraldpress 
he attended depauw university which many of his relatives 
attended joined the familys fraternity of choice and waited 
tables at a sorority house for 40 a month 
quayle met his wife marilyn at law school and they were 
married 10 weeks after their first date everything clicked 
perfectly said mrs quayle also a lawyer 
quayle was associate publisher of the huntington heraldpress 
from 1974 to 1976 when he was elected to the house five months 
into his second term quayle announced he would challenge veteran 
incumbent democrat sen birch bayh 
it was in the 1980 senate race that much was made of the 
resemblance between the young congressman and robert redford at 
one point the actor sent quayle a telegram telling him to stop the 
lookalike references in his promotional literature quayle replied 
that it was the fault of the media not his literature after he 
won he sent redford an autographed picture of himself 
asked about the comparison this week quayle sighed his blue 
eyes flashed as he brushed his brownishblond hair aside 
impatiently 
ive had that stigma since i first ran for the senate its 
stuck ever since he says obviously id rather talk about the 
issues i think i have a feeling of what jack kennedy went through 
id rather talk about what i stand for than what i look like 
quayle defeated bayh with 54 percent of the vote and easily won 
reelection in 1986 when he first arrived in the senate he was 
dismissed by many as a blowdried golden boy but quayle set to 
work to erase that image and carved out a niche for himself on the 
armed services committee where he specializes in matters involving 
the nato alliance 
he supported the reagan administration view that research for 
president reagans spacebased missile defense system popularly 
called star wars is permitted under the antiballistic missile 
treaty he was a proponent of the presidents recent veto of the 
defense authorization bill which reagan opposed because of various 
arms control restrictions 
in the budget committee quayle has been a hardline 
conservative speaking out to recommend more money for defense and 
he was a chief opponent in the senate of plant closing legislation 
to require companies to give workers advance notice if a plant was 
going to be shut down 
he is proud of his accomplishments during his first years in the 
senate when the republicans still had the majority and he helped 
devise and enact a new jobs training program 
an avid golfer and vigorous campaigner quayle is also a family 
man who likes to keep separate his personal and public life 
quayle has talked to his wife and three children about the 
impact of a vice presidential race on their family and said that 
all things being equal he would not choose to make a run for 
national office this year 
and he already has experienced one negative side effect of the 
heightened public attention 
during the speculation about his vice presidential prospects 
some newspapers recalled a 1980 scandal involving lobbyist paula 
parkinson who shared a florida house with several lawmakers 
including quayle then a congressman on a golfing vacation 
parkinson who later posed nude for playboy said she had an affair 
with one of the lawmakers not quayle who denied any relationship 
with parkinson 
quayle said bush hasnt asked him about that episode and he 
reiterated that he had done nothing wrong 
thats all public record i think people who know me and know 
my family know theres no factual basis to what has been written 
he said if you try to say that somehow i was implicated thats 
just not true 
quayle acknowledges that in this day of scrutiny such 
publicity seems to come with the territory 
for the vice presidential nominee there are 15000 
journalists who want to grab him by the ankles turn him upside 
down and shake him until something bad comes out quayle said

firefighters kept a close watch tuesday on fires threatening 
homes in a montana town while high winds fanned flames in 
wyomings yellowstone national park and elsewhere in the west 
two winddriven fires burned out of control tuesday in the 
southeastern montana town of lame deer threatening housing 
developments and forcing the temporary evacuation of 40 houses 
monday night fire crews which had carved lines around the flames 
stood by in case the fires jumped the lines 
the 12000acre slick blaze crept to within 300 yards of houses 
southwest of town monday and a 1500acre fire 1 miles to the 
northwest burned up to and around a trailer home before crews 
blocked its path with a fire line said fire information officer 
jerry chapman 
winds of 12 mph to 15 mph hampered firefighting efforts early 
tuesday but the wind shifted later and began blowing the fires 
back into themselves to the south chapman said 
in idaho dry windy weather delayed control of the 2175acre 
ruby rapids fire in the nez perce national forest in the 
westcentral part of the state but firefighters were having more 
success in other parts of the state 
at yellowstone home of the famed old faithful geyser park 
officials reopened the west entrance tuesday but fallen trees and 
poor visibility from a 60000acre fire forced them to keep 14 
miles of road closed 
theres quite a lot of fire activity there again today and 
theyre still cleaning up from yesterday said park spokeswoman 
joan anzelmo 
the 292space madison junction campground also remained 
offlimits to tourists tuesday 
heavy winds were hampering efforts to combat the flames which 
have charred about 241000 acres of the countrys oldest national 
park 
the only help were getting is from the cooler temperatures 
said anzelmo adding that thermometers tuesday afternoon had hit 
only the mid70s 
in idaho a few days of rain have given a major boost to the 
crews that have been trying to get the upper hand on forest fires 
for weeks 
both the nez perce and payette forests in westcentral idaho 
were hit by more lightning monday setting off new fires but most 
were small and quickly controlled forest officials said 
every night we can count on getting hammered said mary 
zabinski nez perce information officer 
winds up to 30 mph and dry weather pushed back the control time 
on the ruby rapids fire along the main salmon river from monday to 
wednesday an incendiary device was found at the scene and the 
salmon ranger district is offering a 5000 reward for information 
about the apparent arson ms zabinski said 
to the south fairly steady rain fell for a third day on the 
payette national forest spokesman dave olson said lightning 
activity diminished and rain was expected to continue sweeping 
through the forest 
things are looking real good olson said 
elsewhere in montana officials closed public access to 58000 
acres in the fireravaged elkhorn mountains about 10 miles 
southeast of helena the area was closed as a safety precaution and 
will remain closed until further notice said fire information 
officer bob krepps 
a fire in the mountains increased from 3000 acres monday to 
4175 acres after winds fanned flames 200300 feet high and sent 
the blaze racing along a mountain ridge into heavy timber the fire 
continued to burn uncontrolled late tuesday krepps said

new jersey gov thomas kean using his 
keynote address to launch an unrelenting attack on the democratic 
opposition told the republican national convention on tuesday that 
michael dukakis and his party talk tough like dirty harry but act 
like pee wee herman 
they want higher taxes but they wont say so kean said 
they want to weaken america but they wont admit it and they 
want to play the politics of special interests 
the new jersey governor selected to give the primetime speech 
because of his success in attracting traditional democrats to the 
republican party coupled his attacks on dukakis democrats with 
a vision for a george bush victory in november 
touting his trademark politics of inclusion kean declared 
we will not concede one single vote anywhere 
with george bush at the helm we will go to the farms and the 
cities to the barrios and the union halls to the suburban 
developments as well as the country roads kean said 
let the dukakis democrats offer the politics of delusion and 
exclusion he said we republicans will practice the politics 
of inclusion 
kean took note that the democrats chose a color scheme of 
pastels at their national convention in atlanta last month rather 
than red white and blue 
i dont know about you but i believe americans democrats and 
republicans alike have no use for pastel patriotism kean said 
in remarks prepared for delivery to the convention 
the liberal democrats are trying to hide more than the colors 
of our flag they are trying to hide their true colors kean said 
democrats chose the pastel colors after deciding they would look 
better on television 
while repeating the dukakis democrats refrain kean never 
specifically intoned the name michael dukakis in his remarks 
laying out a course for the republican party after president 
reagan kean said the gop must convince voters that it is the party 
willing to tell the truth to the american people 
kean said dukakis would return america to the oppression of 
jimmy carters inflation and weaken the international might 
restored by reagan 
the dukakis democrats will try to talk tough but dont be 
fooled they may talk like dirty harry but they will still act 
like pee wee herman kean said 
dirty harry is the hardtalking quickshooting cop portrayed by 
hollywood tough guy clint eastwood pee wee herman is the 
squeakyvoiced wimpish television and movie personality 
in a speech that kean said saw a dozen drafts he quoted abraham 
lincoln and the bible and invoked american symbols like the 
pilgrim ship mayflower and columbus santa maria 
and in another dukakis barb the governor even cited a 
hollywood classic 
only in america could the democrats draft a platform that has 
gone with the wind he said the famous civil war film is set 
in the georgia capital 
kean a moderate is completing his second term as new jersey 
governor elected in 1981 by the narrowest margin in state history

a state appeals court tuesday ordered a county 
medical medical center to stop feeding a 77yearold woman who is 
the focus of a righttodie battle but stayed the decision for 
five days to give the county a chance to appeal 
in a 3to2 decision the state appellate division in brooklyn 
upheld a lower court ruling that the woman mary oconnor can be 
removed from all artificial life support systems 
mrs oconnor of the bronx has been physically and mentally 
incapacitated by a series of strokes officials at westchester 
county medical center say she is conscious but unable to speak or 
swallow 
she has been fed intravenously and the hospital also wanted to 
use a nasal feeding tube to provide nutrition 
the judgment was stayed for five days however 
its a precedentsetting situation said barry bowman a 
spokesman for the medical center what we have here is a 
conscious patient and a decision being made by surrogates as 
opposed to a patient who is brain dead or in a persistent vegetated 
state 
he said a decision had not been made whether to appeal to the 
state court of appeals in albany new yorks highest court 
the womans daughters both licensed practical nurses initiated 
the righttodie battle last month to stop the medical center from 
inserting the nasal feeding tube and to halt the intravenous 
feeding 
they said their mother had told them on numerous occasions that 
she would not want to be kept alive by artificial means 
we agree with the supreme court that mrs oconnors desires 
expressed when she was competent to decline any life sustaining 
treatment including a nasogastric tube and intravenous feeding 
in her current condition was established by clear and convincing 
evidence said the decision written by justice guy magano and 
signed by justices moses weinstein and isaac rubin justices 
vincent balletta and richard brown dissented 
balletta wrote in the absence of a medical consensus that a 
patient in mrs oconnors condition would not suffer severe pain 
and thirst in the process of dying without hydration and nutrition 
it is in my view that it is cruel and inhuman to sentence her to 
death which will be accompanied by such extreme discomfort 
julius cohn who represents mrs oconnors daughters said he 
obviously agreed with the appeals court decision but said he 
expected the legal battle to continue 
on july 26 state supreme court justice nicholas colabella 
ordered that the medical center stop efforts to feed mrs oconnor 
and allow her to die colabella directed that the hospital provide 
painkillers and help get mrs oconnor home 
his triallevel ruling was stayed while the medical center 
appealed to the appellate division

george bush didnt need dan quayle as his 
running mate to win indianas 12 electoral votes after all if 
bush cant on his own win a state that has voted republican 11 
times out of 12 hes in deep trouble 
no the strategy behind the choice of the indiana senator is 
generational the 64yearold bush choose quayle because he is 41 
years old and looks younger 
dan quayle is a man of the future a young man born in the 
middle of this century and from the middle of america bush said 
in announcing his choice tuesday a dynamic young leader for the 
future of this party 
bushs choice presents a stark contrast to dukakis strictly 
political decision to tap 67yearold lloyd bentsen of texas for 
his running mate 
dukakis selected bentsen to help him win texas 29 electoral 
votes a classic case of electoral college strategy any other 
benefits from the choice are just icing on the political cake 
indeed quayle is the first member of the postworld war ii baby 
boom to be named to a national ticket leading campaign 
chairmantobe james a baker iii to call the decision a bold 
stroke across the generations it should give us a chance to 
appeal to baby boom voters said charlie black a bush adviser 
hes within my generation said 31yearold steve wark a 
nevada delegate hes not my grandfather 
he looks like one of george bushs sons west virginias 
state party chairman edgar heiskell said 
the argument that a babyboom candidate would win more 
babyboomer votes is fiercely debated in the political and academic 
communities but little data is really available to test it after 
the 1988 election maybe we will know more 
republican strategists do argue that younger voters are the 
gops hope of becoming the majority party in this country those 
whose political life covers only the carter and reagan presidencies 
tend to be heavily republican if that group can be kept within the 
party the gop will get stronger and stronger as the more 
democratic older voters pass from the scene 
in some polls bush has been doing better among younger voters 
a gallup poll aug 57 found bush leading 5440 among those 
under 30 years of age while those over 50 went to democrat michael 
dukakis buy a 5337 margin 
such a generational appeal is not a new idea after all 
democratic sens al gore jr and joseph biden two baby boomers 
made generational appeals in attempting to win their partys 
presidential nomination they lost out to the 54yearold dukakis 
there are four other potential benefits from the choice of 
quayle 
he is good on television 
he may help in the midwest a republican stronghold now under 
democratic siege 
he is a strong conservative 
and if you believe some republicans he might add a missing 
dimension to the ticket for women 
quayle is one of the new generation of politicians who is 
comfortable with and looks good on television bush to be 
charitable fails to communicate well through the video medium 
sen john mccain of arizona said quayle is extremely telegenic 
in this day of television and images 
republicans have been able to count on strong support from the 
midwest for years but the farm crisis has sapped that strength 
it is a region that is up for grabs for the democratic ticket 
has no special appeal there either the only drawback for the 
republicans is that there is no evidence that the vice presidential 
nominee has a regional impact as opposed to one in only his home 
state 
quayle is also a conservative with a capital c there are 
simply no obvious defects in his record from a conservatives point 
of view 
quayles good looks he has been called the republican robert 
redford could be a plus as well some argue 
mccain said that i cant believe a guy that handsome wouldnt 
be attractive in some respect to women 
but quayles selection was immediately attacked by at least one 
group concerned with womens issues 
with the nomination of daniel quayle for vice president 
george bush has essentially written off the womens vote 
asserted kate michaelman executive director of the national 
abortion rights action league 
daniel quayle has an extraordinary antiwomen record in his 
tenure in the senate he is opposed to a womans right to choose 
he is opposed to the era he opposes almost every program that has 
been advanced since 1980 that would enhance womens rights and 
womens wellbeing 
women are a big problem for bush according to several surveys 
they hold negative views of him and support dukakis in far greater 
numbers than men 
whether quayle helps shrink the socalled gender gap or becomes 
of liability with women remains of course to be seen 
a vice presidential candidate like quayle can help his party in 
a number of ways but it is still the presidential candidates whom 
the voters are focusing on as they make their choice

about six tons of ussupplied food clothing 
and tents have been sent to southern honduras over the past 10 days 
to assist a large group of contra rebels and nicaraguan civilians 
who have fled to that area the state department said tuesday 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the exodus reflects increased 
represssion by the leftist sandinista government and the dire 
condition of contra units that have been left without any means of 
resupply inside nicaragua 
the blocking of delivery of humanitarian aid by the sandinista 
regime has resulted in severe hunger disease and injury to some 
resistance fighters she said 
according to reports from the border area more than 1000 
soldiers and civilians arrived there last week from a central 
nicaraguan combat zone another group estimated at about 2500 is 
said to be en route to the area 
the contra leadership said the new arrivals joined about 8000 
combatants and 5000 civilians 
the assistance part of 17 million in humanitarian aid approved 
for the rebels by congress last march is intended to help sustain 
the contras through september 
last week the senate approved by a 4947 vote a democratic plan 
to provide 27 million in humanitarian assistance to the contras in 
the new fiscal year starting oct 1 senate republicans who had 
sought military as well as humanitarian assistance voted against 
the proposal

a mother who won a federal court battle to 
enroll her adopted aidsinfected mentally handicapped daughter in 
public school will appeal the judges order that the youngster 
remain isolated in a classroom booth 
steve hanlon attorney for rosa martinez 36 said he filed 
notice of appeal tuesday 
he said he plans to ask the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
in atlanta for a speedy hearing but is doubtful the case could be 
resolved before school starts aug 29 if it isnt eliana 
martinez 6 wont be starting school as planned he said 
us district judge elizabeth kovachevich ruled last week that 
the hillsborough county school board must admit the child to 
manhattan exceptional center to be schooled with her peers 
the judge said the child would remain inside a plexiglass 
enclosure until she became toilettrained and learned to stop 
sucking her thumb and forefingers 
school officials objected wanting her to remain on homebound 
instruction instead out of fear she could transmit the deadly virus 
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
we were hopeful the judges solution might work hanlon 
said but after talking with pediatric and psychological experts 
people whose judgments we respect a great deal we are convinced 
it would be very harmful even to the extent of affecting her 
immune system 
eliana is in the advanced stages of aids which doctors believe 
she contracted from multiple blood transfusions following her 
premature birth in puerto rico 
in a separate matter mrs martinez a licensed practical nurse 
was arrested monday and charged with improperly obtaining 200 or 
more in government assistance in 1986 she was released on her own 
recognizance a few hours later 
mrs martinez said she was unemployed when she and her husband 
separated she applied for food stamps and then took a parttime 
nursing job without reporting the income about 100 a week or 
less to state officials she said 
no one wanted to take care of eliana she said joey her 
husband wasnt here and it was the only kind of work i could do i 
figured thats not all that much money its not going to make that 
much difference 
the welfarefraud charge is a thirddegree felony hanlon said 
prosecutors might let her participate in a firstoffender program 
that would leave her with a clean record

here is a transcript of the address delivered 
by gov kay orr the cochairman of the republican platform 
committee to the republican national convention tuesday night 
thank you very very much nebraska you are so special to me 
tonight i want to tell you exactly who our republican platform 
is for 
our platform is far far superior to the one the democrats 
cobbled together in atlanta the difference is simple republicans 
share their vision with the american people democrats hide from 
the people 
last week 106 women and men arrived here here in new orleans 
to construct the platform that reflects our partys deepest beliefs 
and aims george bush spoke to us last week and shared with us his 
vision on a whole range of issues that confront our country 
keeping taxes low for economic growth preserving peace through 
strength fighting drugs and improving education 
the vice president said that governor dukakis was the stealth 
candidate like the stealth bomber dukakis tried to hide himself 
and his positions from the people george bush is right and the 
democrats platform proves it 
you know fellow delegates you wont find some very basic words 
in the democratic platform words like tax or revenue or 
unemployment you wont find any mention of nato and you wont 
find words like church or synagogue 
the democrats want to hide their views from the american people 
because they knew that if the people ever found out what they 
really believed they would lose they dont want people to know 
that they are still the party that will raise taxes and weaken our 
defense 
let me give you one example of the contrast between our platform 
and democrats stealth platform we say loud and clear what vice 
president bush has said so many times we wont raise taxes 
period higher taxes cost jobs 
but the democrats platform doesnt say a word about taxes why 
last month there was a poll taken of the democratic delegates 
and that poll showed the democrats hypocrisy sixtyseven percent 
of the delegates favored a tax increase but 65 percent said they 
wanted to keep it out of the platform 
on issue after issue the contrast is clear democrats say 
nothing or else they quote their views in empty rhetoric but 
republicans tell the american people exactly what we stand for and 
exactly where we will lead this country after we win november 
were for childrens tax credits to let the parents decide how 
their children will be cared for were for college savings bonds 
to help families save for college were for aggressive action in 
the war on drugs including mandatory sentencing for drug dealers 
if any of you is still skeptical well prove it to you just 
write the republican national committee in washington and ask for a 
copy of the sidebyside platforms that im holding or you can 
write your local newspaper and ask them to print it so that all 
the voters will understand that we are the party of opportunity and 
understand where the two parties stand 
fellow republicans and americans i am very proud to represent 
the people of the state of nebraska people in nebraska are special 
people who provide us not only with the products of their hard 
work but they are also a people who have a way of life that is 
based on sound values and common sense rural america is the 
heartland in more ways than one 
the contribution of farming families to our country is not only 
economic but moral for the values that are needed to be a good 
farmer are the same values that built america farmers have been 
through some tough and painful times recently but at the same 
time republicans are optimistic about the future of american 
agriculture 
we reject the democrats idea of mandatory production controls 
instead we know that farmers can return to prosperity if we 
will take a few basic steps we want to open markets abroad we 
will not use food as a foreign policy weapon 
we want to find new uses for farm products and vice president 
bush has taken the lead here with his strong advocacy of 
alternative fuels like ethanol 
and we want to keep our rural communities strong through the 
increased efforts at economic development as a governor of a farm 
state i know that the future of american farming will be secure 
with george bush as president 
michael dukakis michael dukakis knows so little about 
agriculture that he told the farmers of iowa that they ought to try 
growing belgian endive 
fellow republicans our platform presents a vision of america a 
vision that is optimistic and bold and daring it reflects our 
pride in what we have done and our competence in what we will do 
the democrats missed their chance to level with the american 
people we didnt and george bush and dan quayle will lead our 
party to victory in november

sen dan quayle lists more than 250000 in 
stock in a familycontrolled newspaper group as his only 
substantial asset but the figure could be higher because of the 
vagueness of congressional financial disclosure forms 
the indiana senator picked by george bush on tuesday to be his 
vice presidential running mate listed the stock and other 
holdings on the forms filled out by all senators and house members 
earlier this year 
the filing requirements are such that more than 250000 
could mean several millions dollars worth of stock in central 
newspapers inc in indianapolis in fact quayles holdings are 
rumored to be worth far more than that but the 250000plus 
category is the largest used for listing assets on the disclosure 
forms 
too the more than 250000 figure is book value which 
often vastly understates the actual worth of stock 
central newspapers is the group with which the indianapolis star 
and indianapolis news are affiliated quayles grandfather eugene 
pulliam was publisher of those dailies as well as the arizona 
republic and the phoenix gazette 
quayles wife owns another block of central stock with a book 
value of 100000 to 250000 
except for the stock in central newspapers quayles only 
holdings last year were two retirement accounts totaling a maximum 
of 65000 a bank account worth up to 15000 and an account in 
the house of representatives credit union of 1000 to 5000 
quayle still holds the title of vice president and associate 
publisher of his hometown paper the familyrun huntington ind 
heraldpress that papers owner huntington newspapers inc paid 
him 2625 in directors fees last year he reported 
he listed three growthfund accounts in the names of his 
children totaling up to 45000 and a bank account in the 
childrens name worth between 1000 and 5000 
quayle was paid almost 50000 last year for giving speeches to 
a variety of contributors ranging from the anheuserbusch 
breweries to the international ice cream association 
the indiana senator wrote several articles for pay including 
two for 40 apiece that he sold to the indianapolis papers he 
wrote a 1000 article for the army amp navy journal in washington 
quayle reported receiving honoraria totaling 49255 for 
speeches and writings to meet senate limitations he donated 
14302 of that sum to charity 
quayle is a member of the senate budget armed services and 
labor and human resources committees several of his paid speeches 
were to groups with a direct interest in the work of those 
committees a common practice among members of congress 
for example on march 18 1987 he was paid 2000 apiece for 
speeches to the national committee for quality health care 
headquartered in washington and voluntary hospitals of america 
inc in irving texas general electric co a prime defense 
contractor paid him 2000 for a speech on april 9 
quayle an avid golfer listed among his income last year a 250 
trophy for participating in the monterey peninsula golf tournament 
his gifts included less than 200 worth of golf apparel for himself 
and mrs quayle for participating in the pebble beach national 
proam tournament and 288 worth of golf merchandise from the 
kemper open in potomac md 
the most expensive gift received by quayle was more golf 
merchandise from indiana pro fuzzy zoeller 
quayle and his wife were reimbursed by atampt a sponsor of the 
monterey tournament for a roundtrip flight to the california 
tournament he also listed reimbursements for travel to charity 
skiing competitions in utah and idaho and from the us telephone 
association abbott laboratories electronic industries association 
and the pharmaceutical manufacturers association for trips to 
phoenix ariz waukegan ill ft myers fla and white sulphur 
springs wva 
the quayles only liability listed on the financial disclosure 
form was a 30year 5percent note that mrs quayle signed in 1975 
to borrow up to 50000 from huntington newspapers inc 
a majority of the estate of eugene c pulliam was put into a 
trust that will remain in effect beyond the death of pulliams 10 
grandchildren including quayle a source close to the pulliam 
family told the associated press 
the minority interest in central newspapers the privately held 
pulliam family company is divided among the late publishers three 
children and other stock owners central newspapers announced 
earlier this year that it planned a public stock offering but that 
was later delayed 
quayle and his wife marilyn own stock in the company 
financial disclosure forms required of all members of congress put 
the value of his holdings at more than 250000 and mrs quayles 
holdings at between 100000 and 250000 
asked monday if he was wealthy quayle claimed his principal 
source of income is his senate salary 
because the pulliam company is privately owned the value of its 
assets arent disclosed 
last year forbes magazine reported eugene s pulliam publisher 
of the indianapolis star and news was worth 650 million 
he disputed that report saying that forbes mistakenly 
considered him the owner of central newspapers when in fact he is 
a minority stockholder 
their estimate of my wealth is ridiculous said pulliam

a judge tuesday refused to remove a 
beverly hills attorney as executor of liberaces estate rejecting 
the charges of the entertainers sister and four associates that 
the lawyer had looted the estate 
state district judge michael wendell issued the ruling in the 
bitter costly lawsuit after hearing four hours of closing 
arguments from lawyers representing the executor joel strote and 
the plaintiffs 
strote was named as executor of the estate and head of the 
liberace foundation in a will signed 13 days before the 
entertainers death on feb 4 1987 of complications from aids 
the plaintiffs liberaces 74yearold sister angie his 
housekeepers dorothy mcmahon and gladys luckie longtime manager 
seymour heller and cary james his companion in the last six years 
of his life argued that liberace was not competent to understand 
the will because of his illness 
strote countered that the five were just trying to squeeze more 
money out of the state 
wendell is to rule later on who will pay the legal fees 
expected to run into the six figures defense attorneys have asked 
that the costs be paid by the plaintiffs including angie liberace 
who was left 594000 
in his closing argument defense attorney john oreilly said 
that strote had taken the liberace foundation with 100000 in 
assets at the time of the entertainers death and turned it into 
an 18 million entity through shrewd management 
oreilly said the liberace foundation for the performing arts 
had been a longtime dream of the flamboyant pianist the foundation 
was formed in 1979 to provide art and music scholarships at 30 
colleges and universities 
mr liberace as a dreamer will have that dream live on 
forever oreilly said 
however harold gewerter the plaintiffs attorney argued that 
strote had created a web of conflicts and deceit in getting 
liberace to put him in charge of the estate he noted american bar 
association standards say a lawyer should not consciously urge a 
client to name him as executor of an estate 
joel strote has become the largest single beneficiary of the 
liberace estate gewerter contended he said the attorney had 
been paid 500000 in legal fees and was making 250 an hour 
sitting through the lengthy court proceedings 
he charged that stotes actions were tantamount to robbing 
from a dead man and said that his clients were not interested in 
getting more money out of the estate but in removing strote and 
recovering the money he has received in legal fees 
oreilly countered that the five plaintiffs in the case had 
become accustomed to the good life while liberace was alive and 
wanted more out of the estate after his death although each had 
been given more in the will drafted by strote than in previous 
wills 
liberace dreamed a dream then made it become a reality 
oreilly said the plaintiffs lived a dream but cant face 
reality its been said man must pay the fiddler liberace chose to 
subsidize a whole symphony orchestra now theyre saying just give 
us control 
liberace signed that will knowing full well what he was 
signing oreilly said he gave the plaintiffs more benefits

sen dan quayle could hardly contain himself 
tuesday as he listened to george bush describe him as a dynamic 
young leader for the future the youthful senator bounced up and 
down on his toes as he exulted in the spotlight many had hoped 
would settle on them 
only hours before quayle and his wife marilyn had been trying 
to arrange a tennis game 
he also was scheduled to appear at a reception in his honor 
given by the indiana delegation he didnt show up but no one 
minded he suddenly found himself with more important business 
the call came from bush a few minutes after 2 oclock 
the republican presidential nomineetobe told the 41yearold 
indiana senator he had made his decision on a running mate others 
received similar calls from bush but he told them they were not 
his choice 
according to bush aide sheila tate the vice president told 
quayle that he was his first choice his only choice 
less than two hours later they were standing together on the 
shore of the mississippi river bush in short sleeves amd no tie 
quayle in a dark suit and red tie 
taking his cue from bush on the steamy day quayle doffed his 
coat momentarily struggling to pull his arms out of the sleeves 
but then he hit his stride his right hand chopping the air in a 
gesture reminiscent of john f kennedy 
george bushs america believes and has the commitment to the 
american family that is so important to all of us he said his 
voice rising to a shout george bushs america understands the 
problems that confront us and can lead us to the future and the 
21st century 
with quayle as he stood on the platform were his wife and their 
three children the oldest 14 
bush reached quayle at his new orleans hotel the senator is not 
a delegate he said last week he was attending the convention only 
as a vice presidential prospect 
but as the time dragged on and the speculation continued he and 
wife began to express some doubts 
the total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus 
said mrs quayle an attorney you know you cant just jump in 
the car and go to the store to buy a kids swimsuit to replace the 
one with the hole in it 
from a personal standpoint if i had a time in my life to be 
vice president i wouldnt choose this time quayle told indiana 
reporters 
but at the same time the senator said if he bush makes the 
decision ill be there with bells on 
a robert redford lookalike quayle was described by fellow sen 
john mccain of arizona as extremely telegenic in this day of 
television and images 
charles black a bush adviser said quayle was viewed as someone 
with appeal to babyboom voters and an asset in the midwest 
where bush did poorly in several primaries

two young americans emerged from more 
than 10 months of captivity in the amazon jungle and told a news 
conference on tuesday that they were well treated by their leftist 
guerrilla kidnappers 
stephen koneman 22 and jason mclachan 21 both of chicago 
appeared before reporters at the us embassy following their 
release on sunday 
in taped remarks broadcast earlier tuesday koneman said he and 
mclachan were in a canoe in the amazon last october when they were 
captured by the colombian revolutionary armed forces a leftist 
rebel group 
koneman said he and mclachan friends since high school are 
geographers but that apparently the guerrillas thought they were 
cia agents 
they always treated us well although they had their 
suspicions about what kind of work we were doing but talking with 
them we wiped out their doubts and they saw that we were innocent 
the two men were released on sunday to bishop jose luis serna 
alzate in southern caqueta state the us embassy said tuesday in 
a news release 
they the guerrillas told us that we should stay calm and 
that nothing was going to happen to us koneman said in spanish 
when interviewed by the colombian radio chain rcn 
the two young men left last june on what was intended to be a 
sixmonth trip through latin america 
both were senior students in geography koneman at the 
university of wisconsinmadison and mclachan at columbia university 
in new york 
in a statement koneman read on behalf of himself and mclachan at 
the news conference koneman said they were captured oct 4 and 
not oct 8 as reported on the radio earlier in the day 
professor thomas yuill a university of wisconsinmadison 
researcher who frequently travels to colombia said following their 
abduction that the area where the men disappeared was a pretty 
inhospitable place with yellow fever political guerrilla camps 
drug camps and a river that has a strong current waterfalls and 
piranhas 
koneman said at the news conference 
for the last 10 months we lived with a group of guerrillas 
at various camps in the jungle throughout the ordeal we were 
treated well eating the same food as our captors and living in the 
same kinds of shelters 
we were provided with books writing material and a chess set 
to pass the time 
we suffered no serious health problems and are currently in 
fine health as the doctor here at the embassy confirmed today 
we wrote several letters but had no way of knowing whether or 
not they were being delivered 
in the final weeks we marched toward the northwest through 
the jungles 
during this time an farc spanish acronym for colombian 
revolutionary armed forces commander assured us the farc was 
working toward our release but would not specify what was being 
done 
we took this news with some skepticism and remained hopeful 
the ordeal would end well 
koneman said he and mclachan were delivered to bishop serne 
alzate who underwent considerable risk on our behalf 
he said the guerrilla organizations decision to release them 
was on humanitarian grounds and no ransom was paid 
koneman apparently refering to embassy warnings against making 
the jungle journey in the first place said we of course owe our 
most profound thanks and our humble apologies to everyone 
he ended by saying we will be traveling home in the next few 
days to be united with our families and friends in the united 
states 
according to newspaper files in madison the two men said in a 
letter dated sept 22 that they were planning to canoe down the 
putumayo river which divides colombia and peru 
chicago television station wls said tuesday that a letter sent 
by the two in may reached their parents in july raising hopes then 
that they were still alive

annual summary including separate figures for the disease 
while aids has not yet been added to the rankings of major 
causes of death published by the agency the 1987 toll would have 
placed it 15th on the list ahead of birth defects the agency

the us trade deficit widened to 125 
billion in june as imports hit an alltime high the government 
said tuesday analysts said the report showed how far the country 
still has to go in solving its trade problems 
the gap between what america exports and what the country 
imports surged by 285 percent in june a major setback after three 
consecutive monthly improvements 
the reagan administration sought to play down the significance 
of the onemonth surge but democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis said the figures were evidence of the 
administrations failed economic policies 
financial markets which went into a tailspin the last time such 
a disappointing trade report was released took tuesdays report 
more or less in stride 
while the dollar was hit by a wave of panic selling immediately 
after the report was released it soon steadied and regained much

radical students staging 
antigovernment protests have been criticized heckled and even 
attacked in recent days by furious citizens demanding an end to 
violent clashes in their communities 
such public anger toward the radicals who represent about 10 
percent of south koreas students is rarely seen in a nation that 
has been generally tolerant of student activism it has shocked the 
students who see themselves as fighting on behalf of the very 
people criticizing them 
the rising resentment appears to reflect both anger over the 
radicals violent tactics and concern for the olympics which start 
in seoul on sept 17 
south koreans are worried that violent protests at the moment 
when world attention is focused on seoul could ruin the nations 
image most people see the games as a coming of age and they want

martin landau couldnt resist accepting the role 
of the businessman abe karatz in francis ford coppolas new film 
tucker it was a part that caught his dreams 
i saw the possibilities he said too often im cast in 
things that are fairly onedimensional 
landaus career has been anything but onedimensional he 
studied drama with lee strasberg appeared in paddy chayevskys 
play middle of the night and starred in the longrunning tv 
series mission impossible now hes emerged as a mature 
character actor 
he considers his work in tucker something special 
tucker is based on the life of preston tucker who designed 
an innovative automobile the car of tomorrow today after 
world war ii the major car makers realized that the car was far 
ahead of its time and conspired to make sure it never went into 
mass production because it would force them to start manufacturing 
autos with the same safety and productions values 
abe karatz was an elderly new york businessman who helped raise 
financial backing for tuckers project however when the two first 
met karatz scoffed at the idea of the new car 
i really wanted you to feel that there was no possible place 
to go after that first encounter landau said if you tell me 
your biggest dream and i laugh at you thats the biggest insult in 
the world 
karatzs cynicism eventually breaks down 
feelings he hasnt touched in years he starts to touch 
landau said attachment love and the ability to dream again is 
given him everyone dreams when theyre kids abe lost that tucker 
gives it back to him 
the real karatz was a private man rarely photographed or 
written about landau had to create much of the character by using 
his own instincts 
i drew abe the first couple of days said the actor once an 
illustrator for the new york daily news i saw this lonely new 
york businessman who really has no family no friends and no life 
outside of work 
fans of landau will have to look hard to recognize him in 
tucker he wears a mustache in the film and walks hunched over 
his head sticking out in front of his body in reality landau is 
tall cleanshaven and animated 
i wanted abe to be older than i am and shorter than i am 
every day i got a little older in rehearsal and a little shorter 
im almost 63 and i figure abe is about 510 
portraying karatz reminded landau of the men he knew while 
growing up in brooklyn in the 1940s 
when i stood in front of the mirror the first time when i 
saw abe coagulate i saw my father his friends the uncles when i 
was young looking up at these guys he said 
landau credits coppola the godfather apocalypse now 
with giving him the freedom to develop his character 
like all the good ones he lets you go he hires you thats a 
vote of confidence landau said francis really creates a 
playground for you the more you bring the happier he is 
tucker represents americas postwar optimism sharply dressed 
endlessly promoting believing in a better world karatz is a 
product of the depression he gives off the impression of someone 
who has lived a hard life doubting it will ever change 
hes a guy that just misses being elegant landau observed 
the suit is an expensive suit it just doesnt work exactly he 
just misses being everything he wants 
the theme of tucker one man against the system recalls 
the films of frank capra and preston sturges landau agrees that 
tucker shows the influence of those directors especially 
sturges 
in the middle of a serious scene in a sturges film youd 
see a pratfall and its ok francis would allude to preston 
sturges i think its a capra type of story with a sturges style i 
liked that some choices were based on that feeling 
landau has taught acting for over 30 years his students have 
included james dean jack nicholson harry dean stanton and warren 
oates however he downplays his own role in others careers 
you dont teach acting what youre doing is saying youre an 
instrument i helped them find stuff that was in their very being 
that they were not utilizing he said 
acting comes down to a simple formula its laughing at the 
same joke everytime as if youd heard it for the first time if you 
can do that you dont have to work with me the audience wants to 
believe that whats going on has never happened before 
but to be a really good actor something special is required 
anyone can walk and talk thats easy landau said 
theres not an actor in the world that wants to be bad if you 
could create magic thats what its all about the beauty of the 
theater or film is having a thousand people in the single room 
having the exact same experience it means were all the same

the 20th season of pbs sesame street 
beginning this november will lead up to the birth of a baby for 
maria and luis two of the characters who married last season 
this season will also mark the 20th anniversary of two of the 
shows charter cast members singeractor bob mcgrath and caroll 
spinney the man inside big bird 
they recalled their beginnings on the now historic pbs 
childrens series at a recent news conference 
when i first heard about it i didnt think i wanted to be 
involved with a new childrens show because there was nothing that 
exciting in terms of childrens shows at that point said 
mcgrath who had been featured on the mitch miller show and joined 
sesame street in 1969 but when i saw some of the film and 
animation that jim henson and some of the other people had done i 
knew this was really something quite out of the ordinary from what 
had been on television before 
the producers of the show expect to add new graphics and use 
more films including ones by director jonathan demme and 
photographerartist william wegman this season a likely response 
to the trend toward multimedia kids shows like peewees 
playhouse 
guest stars will include lily tomlin tracey ullman susan st 
james rhea perlman and james galway among others 
one of the major episodes last season was the wedding of 
characters luis and maria this seasons finale will be the birth 
of their baby the producers hope to see the baby grow up on the 
show producerdirector lisa simon said a search is on for 
expectant parents who would be willing to let the show follow their 
childs growth 
big bird has become the shows biggest star but he didnt start 
out that way said spinney 
a peripheral character in the early episodes he was sort of 
the village idiot spinney said 
one day i realized he was really a child said spinney 
one of the scripts said he had to go to day care or something so 
i said we really should play him as a child 
big bird came to embody all the fears of children and things 
they have to learn a wideeyed view of the world said spinney 
he gradually learned to read and write and so he grew from 4 
which i felt he was the beginning to 6 which is where he stays 
spinney carefully protects big birds real identity from little 
children but admits when he sees a child toting one of the big 
yellow dolls i keep wanting to say you know he goes into big 
birds high voice hey i do that 
spinney had been into puppeting since he was a child mcgrath 
had intended to have a career entertaining adults as a singer but 
when rock music began to take over the business he decided he 
would have to take another path 
both men said the rewards of working for children are great 
though the task is sometimes exasperating 
mcgrath does a lot of concerts and benefits as his sesame 
street character children he said are a wonderful audience 
first of all theyre very very honest i had a little girl in 
vancouver some years ago i was shaking hands after a concert she 
had me lean over to her and said he drops to a stage whisper 
you know something bob and i said no what up close you 
dont look too good 
mcgrath at least can appear as himself to children though he is 
careful when theyre around i dont walk on red for instance 
he said 
spinney has to be incognito though he does have some fun when 
he heard a mother call her child by name as the girl was examining 
a bunch of talking big bird dolls in a toy department i bent 
down near one and said hello jessica how are you isnt it a 
nice day the mother says those toys are remarkable it even 
calls my child by name 
i dont do that very often usually im a nice guy spinney 
said 
when children visit the set they inevitably will see the man get 
out of the bird suit at some point but most of them will 
continue to talk to the puppet even though youre standing there 
holding it spinney said 
spinney also does oscar the grouch on the way to a meeting with 
henson to discuss the character including what kind of voice it 
would have a gruff new york cabbie barked where to mac and 
a star was born 
i dont know who that cabbie was but id like to thank him 
spinney said 
not all the characters have worked out said simon sam the 
robot was canned professor hastings was a puppet that fell 
asleep as he talked so did the kids she said dinas 
highpitched voice drove parents from the room a blind puppet 
didnt work professor d rabbit was a fullsize juggling puppet 
that looked hideous she added

ordinary folks always have had difficulty 
following the logic of applied economics but activities of late 
have a good many of them standing on their heads 
it is a time in which growth is said to endanger the general 
economic welfare when job creation is declared inimical to the 
best interests of the nation and when busy factories are viewed 
with suspicion 
higher interest rates are praised because they make it harder to 
borrow helping to supress the allamerican urge to buy houses 
inflation though mousesized is said to have the destructive 
potential of an enraged elephant 
the explanation for this peculiar economic attitude is likely to 
be even more puzzling but the one common denominator fitting all 
the above is the widespread view that inflation is now the biggest 
threat to world stability 
that view seems to be shared by heads of most central banks in 
the industrialized world since they have been raising shortterm 
rates in recent weeks and in a global economy one nations move 
provokes anothers 
inherent in fears of inflation no matter in what nation it 
occurs is the assumption that any economy can run amok if not 
reined in in this view economies are machines that if run too 
fast can burn themselves out 
therefore good news such as rising employment and greater 
industrial activity is indeed good news but only to a limit 
that limit is reached when the good news strains the machinery 
producing the smoke of inflation 
as always economists now disagree on whether they see smoke in 
fact the growth is good school has not given up contending 
that the way to overcome inflation and other economic threats is to 
oil the machine and go even faster 
more jobs for example can mean more income less debt greater 
savings more jobs can mean more government revenues thus helping 
reduce the federal deficit and myriad social problems more 
spending by business could mean bigger more productive factories 
reducing the chances of economic burnout 
there appears to be no universal fixed attitude toward any of 
these economic elements job creation is sometimes viewed as 
healthy at other times a threat capital spending often is viewed 
as antiinflationary at other times it is seen as a threat to 
economic stability 
the various elements that make up the big economic machine move 
in relation to each other sometimes an element is seen as overly 
loose and in need of tightening at other times it is viewed as 
tight and out of synchronization 
many people will recall for instance that it was universally 
agreed a year ago that the united states would have to export more 
manufactured goods if it were to lower its imbalance of payments 
it was considered imperative 
now that us factories are turning out manufactured goods for 
export the warning is heard the united states does not have enough 
workers and capacity to serve both the domestic and overseas 
markets without courting inflation 
perhaps overly simplified it comes down to a question of 
choice is it better to slow output to accommodate the limited 
capacity of the machinery or would it be a better resolution to 
build a bigger better machine 
right now the growth is bad school has the upper hand 
mainly because it counts as members several of the worlds central 
bank heads including alan greenspan chairman of the federal 
reserve board

after 19 years of painstaking effort workers 
are only now making headway in repairing the damage caused when an 
australian sheep shearer set fire to al aqsa mosque one of islams 
holiest monuments 
precarious wooden scaffolding towers into the dome laborers are 
still cleaning fireblackened stone behind the pulpit while skilled 
craftsmen are carefully reconstructing mosaic panels with 
inscriptions from the koran islams holy book 
isam awad the palestinian engineer in charge of the project 
blames lost skills and modern politics for the slowness of the work 
the fire damaged some of the oldest parts of the mosque 
suddenly we had to work with gypsum mosaics stucco and lead all 
these were lost skills and we had to find people who knew and 
relearn them said awad who supervises a team of 40 workers 
al aqsa which marks the place where the prophet mohammed 
ascended to heaven to receive the word of god was built in the 7th 
century after the caliph omar conquered jerusalem it is considered 
islams third holiest site after mecca and medina 
the 36acre site known in arabic as the haram al sharif noble 
enclosure was originally the site of the jewish temple built by 
king herod and destroyed by the roman tenth legion in 70 ad 
awad said the renovations for the mosque and the nearby dome of 
the rock have been slowed by the arabisraeli conflict we have 
to be careful because of politics 
awad added that the recent decision of jordans king hussein to 
sever ties with the west bank put question marks on whether money 
would still be available for the restoration he said more than 
15 million had been spent so far on fixing damage from the fire 
awad said repeated strikes and boycotts by palestinians 
protesting israeli occupation on the west bank made it impossible 
to complete the change from the mosques goldtinted aluminum dome 
to a new a reddishhued copper top before rains start in september 
perhaps the greatest loss in the fire which took hours to put 
out was a carved wooden mindab or pulpit presented to the 
mosque by saladin the moslem warrior who defeated the christian 
crusaders in the 11th century ad 
replacing the pulpit requires special woodworking skills 
unavailable locally a number of countries are vying for the honor 
of carrying out the work but choosing one country over the other 
is proving to be a delicate political exercise 
officials of the waqf the jordanianfunded moslem trust that 
oversees the al aqsa complex said turkey or egypt would probably 
be awarded the job of reconstructing the pulpit 
on april 21 1969 moslem guards spotted flames coming from al 
aqsa the fire burned out of control for hours with flames reaching 
the windows just below the dome 
israeli authorities arrested michael denis william rohen a tall 
blond sheepshearer from sydney australia who belonged to the 
protestant church of god sect he was judged insane and deported to 
australia 
hassan tahboub a member of the moslem supreme council in 
jerusalem questions whether the act was the work of a deranged 
individual 
he said moslem investigators believed a group may have been 
involved because rohen called london the night before the attack 
and may have received instructions but tahboub added we refused 
to give evidence to the israelis because we considered the court to 
be illegal 
much of the fire damage has now been repaired including about 
75 feet of fatamidstyle mosaics 750 square feet of gypsum 
moldings 30 new stain glass windows and new marble columns 
the most painstaking work is being done by adel jabari 38 who 
said it took two months to place the 20000 pieces of glass and 
stone in each square meter 1076 square feet of mosaic 
some of his work represents new designs inspired by jabaris 
stay in italy where he was sent to study restoration methods and 
became enthused with the sistine chapel in rome 
i was inspired by the spirit of michelangelo said jabari 
cleaning fireblackened stone and mosaic panels behind the 
pulpit restoring some decorations in the al aqsa domes interior 
and building a new pulpit remain to be done 
awad declines to predict when work will be complete noting the 
mission has expanded to include other repairs needed because of age 
and neglect 
it is a lifetime job he said

editors note for 16 days they held out against the japanese 
invasion force some 1200 civilians fighting alongside 449 
marines 68 sailors and six army air corps men all were either 
killed or captured when wake island fell on dec 23 1941 a 
momument to the military men was erected shortly after the war but 
it was not until this summer that the civilian defenders got their 
monument many returned to wake island for the dedication some for 
the first time since the war 
</TEXT>

palm trees and 
evergreens grow where once there was only ironwood brush the 
oncecountless rats and gooney birds are gone the coral runway has 
been replaced 
its strange everything looks so different that walking 
around here looking at the monuments and the old rustedout guns 
its almost like looking at someone elses life like it never 
happened to me says darwin dodds of denver a retired radio and 
television broadcaster 
dodds was a 22yearold civilian construction worker captured 
when the japanese invaded this remote tropical atoll in late 1941 
he was one of the defenders of wake island who recently returned 
for a dedication of a monument in honor of the civilians who fought 
alongside the soldiers sailors and marines all of whom were 
either killed or captured 
a memorial to the marines was erected shortly after the war but 
the civilians including construction workers building military 
installations and others who worked for pan american airways got 
little credit it was 1981 before they were deemed eligible for 
veterans benefits and for 47 years there was no official monument 
to them 
the dedication ceremony drew 42 civilian defenders 14 military 
men and about about 100 family members for many of them the 
reunion june 1316 was their first visit to the island since the 
war 
ival dale milbourn 64 a retired construction contractor who 
lives in santa rosa calif still has occasional nightmares about 
his war experiences by bringing his wife two sons and his 
85yearold father to the reunion he hoped to put some of the old 
ghosts to rest 
this has been a 47yeardream milbourn said as he looked 
over the post he manned on the day of the first attack on dec 8 
1941 i just cant explain how i feel but by having my family 
here i feel like they understand why im the way i am why i did 
the things i did 
milbourn was 18 years old and a private in the us marine corps 
when he landed on wake in late 1941 he still recalls the details 
of that first attack only hours after the japanese struck pearl 
harbor wake is west of the international dateline so it was the 
next day there 
we werent prepared at all says milbourn who manned a 
3inch antiaircraft gun we hadnt even filled the first 
sandbag we ran to our positions and trained right on those planes 
but we were expecting reinforcements and we thought they might be 
our own guys 
the next 16 days were a blur of daily bombing raids thwarted 
invasions and closefought battles 
the outnumbered us troops shot down 21 japanese planes and 
sank at least two destroyers with outmoded weapons salvaged from 
warships from world war i but with no reinforcements and little 
ammunition they surrendered to the japanese on dec 23 1941 
the marines were commanded by maj james ps devereux who was 
acclaimed the hero of wake island during the fighting he was 
reported to have sent out the message send us more japs he 
later denied the story 
devereux who served as a congressman from maryland after the 
war died aug 5 of pneumonia at age 85 
we were among the last marines to get the order to 
surrender milbourn recalls and when we were told to give up 
our guns well that was the first time we ever told an nco 
noncommissioned officer up your bucket because wed been told 
the japanese take no prisoners 
the americans were ordered to strip and march down to the old 
airstrip where a ring of machine guns awaited there they were 
tied up and ordered to crouch in the middle of the circle 
we were scared and praying and crying and everything else 
milbourn says then at the last minute they took the guns down 
because they learned there were civilians among us 
the americans 449 marines 68 sailors six army air corps men 
and 1200 civilians were left on the airstrip overnight still 
naked and tightly bound 
the next day they were each given a small piece of bread and a 
drink of gasolinetainted water it was dec 25 1941 
that was our christmas dinner and we had no idea how much 
worse it would get milbourn recalls 
most of the prisoners were eventually transferred by boat to 
prison camps in shanghai and japan several prisoners were beheaded 
and all were poorly fed along the way the japanese kept 98 
civilians on the island as slave labor 
roger chick bamford of texarkana ark lied about his age 
to join the marines when he was 15 years old so he had not even 
turned 20 when he was released from prison camp in september 1945 
after the japanese surrender 
i got the name chick in boot camp because i was such a 
kid says bamford in prison camp the older guys looked out for 
me tried to get me food because i was in my growing years 
across the atoll the survivors many of whom hadnt seen each 
other since they were liberated from prison camps gathered in 
little groups to compare experiences 
they set off under the blazing tropical sun to find memorable 
spots the bunkers the old landing strip the mass grave where the 
dead were laid to rest 
thats what this trip is really about said walter kennedy 
71 of orange cove calif who as a 23yearold marine sergeant 
was injured during the first attack 
its been nearly 50 years and were pretty old now but it 
was a heck of a fight and we still remember adds kennedy who 
made the marine corps his career seeing the guys who helped get 
you through all those years in the prison camps well it just 
makes you happy to be alive 
of the americans 120 were killed in the fighting and 231 died 
in captivity the 98 civilians kept on wake were executed on oct 
7 1943 
they left behind a reminder of their plight a large coral 
boulder painstakingly handcarved with their initials and the 
stilllegible message that reads98 us pw for prisoners of war 
51043 five months later they were machinegunned on the beach 
in retaliation for a devastating american air strike the day before 
the memory of those civilians and how they died has haunted many 
of the survivors 
when i heard about this trip i thought i wasnt sure i wanted 
to go i didnt know what kind of memories it would bring said 
oscar ray 67 now credit manager of a hospital in boise idaho 
the execution of the civilians affected me so profoundly that i 
couldnt sleep for weeks after hearing about it i thought it was a 
religious duty that i should come back

the board of interco inc target of a 269 
billion hostile tender offer likely will be hardpressed to devise 
a restructuring plan attractive enough to keep shareholders from 
defecting many analysts say 
a washington dcbased investor group launched a 70ashare 
tender offer for the huge furniture and apparel company on monday 
a week after interco directors rejected the proposal as inadequate 
the bid is the first bigtime takeover attempt orchestrated by 
the rales brothers who already have diverse manufacturing holdings 
but seek a major foothold in the consumer products industry 
seventy dollars is a fair offer and its important that the 
board give full consideration to fair offers said robert 
buchanan an analyst at ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis 
its going to be difficult to come up with a plan that would 
be significantly more he said 
robert hedrick a vice president at the investment firm eppler 
guerin amp turner inc in dallas said the restructuring plan has 
merit but im afraid it cant compete with a tender offer 
interco stock jumped 212 a share to close at 7212 in heavy 
trading monday on the new york stock exchange indicating investors 
are waiting for a higher bid or measures by the company to support 
the price 
hedrick said he has valued interco conservatively at about 70 a 
share although some analysts have estimated interco might be worth 
up to 78 a share 
the tender offer pressures the interco board to speed up its 
ongoing restructuring plan 
in an effort to remain independent interco recently 
strengthened its defenses against unwanted takeover bids and began 
working on a plan that includes selling the companys flagging 
apparel operations and paying shareholders a special dividend 
analysts said the st louisbased companys apparel operation 
which includes the wellknown london fog line could fetch as much 
as 800 million 
the rales brothers have indicated in security and exchange 
commission documents that they also would sell the unit as well as 
other operations to raise capital for the buyout 
the rales brothers and their associates already own 87 percent 
of intercos 384 million common shares outstanding the pricetag 
on the shares they do not already own is about 247 billion 
susan schepman a spokeswoman for interco said the company had 
no comment on the hostile tender offer 
while intercos apparel operations saw operating profits plunge 
33 percent in the 1988 fiscal year as the retail industry slumped 
other operations have shown impressive growth operating profits 
from intercos footwear operations which include the converse and 
florsheim brands jumped 77 percent over the previous fiscal year 
and operating profits from furniture jumped 21 percent the company 
said in its annual report 
interco reported revenue of about 334 billion last year in 
addition to its manufacturing operations the company operates 201 
home improvement centers general merchandise discount stores 
mens specialty apparel shops and specialty department stores in 15 
states 
interco already had been a strong force in the furniture 
industry with its ethan allen and broyhill lines but the 
acquisition of furniture maker lane co more than a year ago 
solidified its no 1 position 
operating through cardinal acquisition corp and city capital 
associates steven rales 37 and his brother mitchell 31 
initially approached the interco board with a 64ashare takeover 
bid the group sweetened the offer to 70 a share but the interco 
board derided the bid as inadequate 
an acquisition of interco would give the rales brothers their 
longsought goal of an established place in consumer products 
cindy carpenter a spokeswoman for their acquisition group said 
the brothers expressed an interest in consumer products as long as 
three years ago 
but to date the rales have confined their business interests 
to machinery and other nonconsumer goods among the prizes of 
their acquisition efforts in recent years are western pacific 
industries inc chicago pneumatic tool co mohawk rubber co and 
master shield inc

domestic car and light truck sales continue to 
outperform analysts predictions though aug 110 sales were 66 
percent behind an incentivefueled early august 1987 sales period 
sales in august and september last year were artificially 
high david healy analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc in new 
york said monday 
combined sales of usmade cars and light trucks totaled 
277952 for the nine selling days from aug 110 up from 264588 
in the comparable period last year the automakers reported there 
were only eight selling days in the 1987 period and on a daily 
basis sales were down 66 percent 
sales reached a 76 million seasonally adjusted annual rate the 
same as in the preceding 10day period from july 2131 
in early august 1987 buyer incentives aimed at clearing excess 
cars from crowded dealer lots pushed the annualized sales rate 
during the period to 84 million compared with the yearlong 1987 
rate of 71 million 
this year the big three automakers inventories are hovering 
around a 60day supply of vehicles which the companies consider 
ideal and the firesale atmosphere is gone said analyst joseph 
phillippi at shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
sales are relatively strong phillippi said although compared 
to last august they are going to be rather lackluster because we 
are comparing against an incentive period

situation said drexel burnhams healy

the dealer predicted that if the june deficit is similar or 
larger than mays 1093 billion gap the dollar will slide but if 
the deficit is below 10 billion the dollar will rise though any

a federal judge has issued an order 
allowing unisys corp to seize computer components for navy radar 
and weapons systems from a small florida company that shut down 
earlier this month 
us district judge howell w melton issued the seizure order 
monday after unisys filed suit against armtec inc and charged that 
the smaller firm might move or damage more than 117 million worth 
of components it manufactured under contract to unisys 
armtec closed on aug 3 laying off about 80 employees after 
unisys withheld a payment to the small contractor in its lawsuit 
unisys claimed it found evidence it had been overbilled by armtec 
both companies are being scrutinized in a federal probe of 
potential fraud and bribery in the defense departments procedures 
for buying weapons systems 
unisys also charged that armtec made out smaller final paychecks 
to its employees than provided for in an aug 4 agreement under 
which unisys would give the smaller company 66000 to help cover 
the payroll in exchange for taking the components and raw materials 
it owns at the armtec plant 
armtec president william w roberts and his wife company 
treasurer evelyn roberts said they would not give unisys about 
200000 worth of assembled components because unisys had not paid 
its bills 
theyre not going to get the goods until they pay us our 
money mrs roberts said i will stand in the door at this 
building well bar it up 
william roberts denied the allegations in the lawsuit and said 
unisys owed armtec more than 400000 
lawrence j hamilton ii a jacksonville lawyer who represents 
unisys said the company sought the seizure order to protect 151 
million worth of unisys contracts to build 14 terrier mod 10 three 
mk92 and six cort radar defense systems for navy ships 
if the closed armtec plant does not remain dehumidified severe 
but almost undetectable damage could occur to the wiring harnesses 
produced there decreasing the reliability of the final products 
unisys said in court documents 
unisys is under contract to deliver the completed systems to the 
navy over roughly a twoyear period beginning in february and the 
navy has made fleet deployment decisions based on bringing some 
ships to port for installation of the new systems the suit said 
unisys met a requirement melton imposed to post a 234 million 
bond in case it eventually loses its lawsuit against armtec 
mrs roberts said 10 of the close to 90 employees that lost 
their jobs aug 3 had been placed back on the payroll to complete 
work for sikorsky air a defense contractor that did business with 
armtec

japans economy continues to grow steadily in 
august as consumer spending and capital expenditures post solid 
gains according to the bank of japans monthly economic report 
the report released tuesday summarized recent economic figures 
for june and july and concluded that strong domestic demand both 
for consumer and capital goods is helping to keep the economy 
steaming along even though investment in housing and public 
spending appear to have reached a peak 
the report noted that demand for labor is showing a tendency to 
tighten but didnt indicate any concern over wages rising or over 
inflationary pressure if they did start to rise 
central bank officials have indicated in recent statements they 
are watching the impact of wages on inflation closely 
the report said domestic wholesale prices have risen slightly 
recently but attributed the gains mainly to seasonally higher 
electricity rates 
commodities prices meanwhile are trending lower in japan as 
imports are rising while world commodities prices have been lower

lawsuit by a south american company against texas oilman nelson 
bunker hunt and his two younger brothers accusing them of trying 
to corner the world silver market 
the sixmember civil jury was to resume weighing the evidence 
today 
us district judge morris lasker took about three hours monday 
to instruct the jury on the law the panel broke off deliberations

claims that the hunts manipulated world silver prices between 1979 
and 1980 in a failed attempt to corner the market 
the trial began at federal court in manhattan in february 
minpeco a mineral marketing company owned by the peruvian 
government sued the three brothers nelson bunker hunt 62 
william herbert hunt 59 who also has extensive real estate 
holdings and lamar hunt 56 owner of the national football 
leagues kansas city chiefs and several middle east businessmen 
lawyers for minpeco charge that the hunts and their middle 
eastern codefendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver 
prices from about 9 an ounce to more than 50 an ounce between 
september 1979 and january 1980 
but the hunts assert they bought silver because of unstable 
world political conditions and those conditions such as the soviet 
invasion of afghanistan and the seizure of us hostages in iran 
drove up the price of silver

case

countries 4 billion of it to latin america he did not explain

the nations merchandise trade deficit jumped to 125 billion 
in june the commerce department said today in a report that 
weakened the dollar and pushed up interest rates 
the larger trade gap raised concerns that the dollar would have 
to fall to make americanmade products more competitive in world 
markets 
in another report that raised fears of inflation the federal 
reserve said today that american industry operated at 835 percent 
of capacity in july the highest level since march 1980 
the strength of the economy was reflected in the trade deficit 
which rose partly because the economy consumed a record amount of 
imported products 
the financial markets reacted with modest pessimism stock 
prices were broadly lower although the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks was up 604 points to 201031 as of 11 am edt 
the dollar lost more than 1 percent of its value against the 
japanese yen british pound and west german mark immediately after 
the morning report but then trimmed nearly half its losses 
bond prices fell pushing interest rates higher prospects for a 
falling dollar hurt bond prices by frightening away foreign 
investors 
the benchmark 30year treasury bond fell 1732 point or about 
530 per 1000 in face value as its yield rose to 949 percent 
from 944 percent late monday 
the deficit was the worst since februarys 144 billion which 
triggered a 100point plunge in the dow jones average of 30 
industrials when it was announced in april 
while exports fell by 24 percent in june to a seasonally 
adjusted 268 billion while imports surged to an alltime high of 
394 billion 
on monday investors concerns about inflation were fueled by a 
government report that industrial production rose in july at its 
fastest rate in nine months 
the report issued monday by the federal reserve helped knock 
down stock prices as the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
fell 3325 points to 200427 combined with its 8161point 
decline last week the average is at its lowest point since may 27 
when it finished at 195644 
the 08 percent increase in industrial output intensified 
economists speculation that the economy was expanding too rapidly 
leading to possible inflationary bottlenecks and higher wage 
demands 
you still have this global interest rate pressure said 
william king head trader at nikko securities co international in 
new york thats why the market got whacked 
the bond market showed less response than the stock market did 
monday to the industrial production report analysts speculated 
that bond traders may have been focusing their attention on todays 
release of june merchandise trade figures 
the price of the benchmark 30year treasury bond which is 
highly sensitive to inflation speculation edged down monday as its 
yield rose to 943 percent from 942 percent late friday 
some analysts speculated the federal reserve would take more 
steps to cool off the economy with higher interest rates even 
though the central bank moved just last week to raise its discount 
rate to 65 percent from 6 percent that is the rate the fed 
charges on loans to commercial banks and is a key indicator of the 
feds interest rate policy 
fed policymakers had a regular closeddoor meeting scheduled 
today to review the economys prospects and chart monetary policy 
for the next 1 months 
the federal reserve said monday the large july advance in 
industrial production was widespread throughout us manufacturing 
industries and also reflected heavy demand for electricity during 
the summer heat wave 
the 08 percent july advance was double the 04 percent june 
increase and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrial 
production has risen it was the largest increase since a 11 
percent rise last october 
we are seeing an industrial sector that is surging under the 
impact of increased exports and higher capital spending said 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers 
but jasinowski said some of the strength in july was overstated 
reflecting the increased electrical demand and some unwanted 
buildup in inventories 
people ought not be frightened by these hefty industrial 
production numbers because the inventory buildup we have been 
seeing shows that there is still slack in the economy jasinowski 
said

the midwest drought may have only a minor 
impact on the price of good farmland even though it has caused 
significant crop losses a university of illinois economist says 
john scott an agricultural land economist said he polled more 
than 400 professional farmland appraisers in illinois iowa 
indiana and ohio asking them what effect the drought would have on 
farmland prices 
the consensus that emerged from the responses was that if the 
drought has any impact at all it will only last one year and might 
represent a short decline in land values scott said in a 
statement released monday 
the value of prime farmland fell sharply during the first half 
of this decade but scott said appraisers indicated a rally in the 
past 18 months 
asked if the prospect of low corn and soybean production because 
of the drought could stop that rally the appraisers answered that 
any halt would be a brief one 
these appraisers expect any loss to be made up by a rebound 
with a good crop in 1989 and then land prices will move to higher 
levels in coming years scott said 
in addition stronger commodity prices resulting from the short 
crops and the reduction of the grain surplus will help the land 
market rally again he said 
scott also pointed out that some economists expect interest 
rates to decline in the next few years and that too would tend 
to support stronger land prices 
a temporary slump in land prices might tempt farmers to invest 
in more land and expand their operations but scott urged caution 
only when a farmer is financially capable and can pencil out 
through revenue projections the ability to pay for the land 
should the farmer consider buying it scott said 
he also said the next rally in land prices will be unlike the 
one in the 1970s which was fueled by inflation 
during that rally some farmers thought inflation would pay for 
the land and they spent more on it that they ever could recover in 
earnings

american companies are slow and lazy 
in their export policy compared with the more competitive japanese 
a south korean trade commissioner told a trade development club 
youngil sunwoo director of the korea trade center in chicago 
praised the japanese as being aggressive exporters who follow 
through with excellent customer services 
many us companies are less motivated than the japanese in 
penetrating the korean market he told the columbus world trade 
development club on monday japan is very competitive in korea 
american exports to south korea increased about 25 percent last 
year to 87 billion he said the increase was partly because of a 
reduction of trade restrictions and depreciation of the south 
korean won in relation to the us dollar 
however growing south korean exports to the united states have 
created a 108 billion trade surplus between the two nations which 
favors south korea the asian nation conducts 39 percent of its 
export trade with the united states 
sunwoo said that when south korea dropped trade barriers and 
added 560 new items to its import market the japanese took 40 
percent of the new business while the united states got 9 percent 
besides having geographic and cultural advantages the japanese 
take time to learn the korean markets and follow through with 
service he added 
most americans dont know about the korean market he said 
american businesses are slow and lazy especially in the 
afterservices 
the japanese service a piece of equipment in a day or two but 
with the us it is impossible he said 
sunwoo said american business needs to motivate its export 
marketing efforts and get to know south korean businesses he said 
large korean trading companies are looking for american suppliers 
for machinery chemicals agricultural products and electrical 
testing equipment 
if possible please try to make a joint venture with a korean 
company he said adding that such ventures would help american 
companies gain a foothold in the south korean market that also may 
be a link to markets in japan and china

swedish price control officials tuesday 
attacked the government for suggesting restrictions on japanese car 
imports 
the national price and cartel office said in a sharply worded 
letter that limiting japanese imports would raise car prices boost 
inflation and reduce freedom of choice for swedish customers 
the attack was in response to proposed restrictions by the 
foreign ministrys trade department which claims japanese car 
makers are redirecting exports to sweden because of restrictions in 
other countries the ministry dismissed the conclusions by the 
cartel office 
sweden home of volvo and saab car makers was one of the last 
countries in europe with a free automobile market the government 
department said 
perarne sundbom head of the cartel office which is politically 
independent told two newspapers that the government was shouting 
before the wolf has come by claiming the japanese were swamping 
the swedish market 
foreign ministry official lars stalberg said that following 
talks in tokyo in april japanese manufacturers were ready to 
voluntarily limit exports to sweden for the rest of the year 
we feel it was an admission by the japanese companies that 
they have subjected the swedish market to too strong pressure and 
have used the fact that sweden has the only open market stalberg 
said 
he said japanese manufacturers increased their market share in 
sweden from 15 percent in 1986 to 25 percent during the first part 
of this year toyota nissan and mazda are now among the top 10 
importers 
stalberg denied allegations by opposition leader bengt 
westerberg that the social democratic government was violating 
swedens traditional support for free trade 
he said the government had taken no action only discussed 
a developement which we find disquieting 
japanese cars sold well here because they had a reputation for 
durability and were cheaper a new japanese small car cost about 
the same as a secondhand swedish model 
sundbom said decreased competition would raise inflation which 
is more than 6 percent and is nearly twice as high as most of 
swedens trading partners 
the cartel office said restrictions would not affect the 
swedishmade cars as much as imports from west germany which go to 
the same smallcar market 
a volvo spokesman also said the swedish giant had not suffered 
from the japanese expansion and sales last year were up 14 percent 
volvo sold a record 73255 last year twice as many as its 
nearest competitor ford said official statistics saab was the 
fourth largest seller in sweden

washington state authorities today said 
they have seized up to 900 crab pots illegally placed in us water 
by canadian fishermen and a local politician calls it a case of 
lowseas piracy 
the pots contained more than 10000 pounds of prime dungeness 
crab valued at about 25000 said tom burton a fisherman and 
whatcom county councilman 
the crabs were returned to boundary bay because the us harvest 
for dungeness crab closed last spring 
about 850 to 900 of the traps were pulled in saturday sunday 
and monday 600 of them on monday said lt lyle nelson of the 
state department of fisheries 
the pots were found about a halfmile to a mile south of the 
canadian border which cuts across the more than 10milewide mouth 
of boundary bay authorities said 
this is lowseas piracy said burton who was among the 
fishermen who helped remove the pots weve been hearing rumors 
about this for quite some time over the winter our drag fishermen 
have been snagging canadian pots in their nets 
weve been telling state fisheries people all summer that 
there was a problem burton said its nothing to see a dragger 
return with 20 canadian crab pots on the stern 
last week coast guard and state officials arrested three 
residents of vancouver british columbia suspected ofn a normal summer 
avery said 
what were living through now is the same thing we were living 
through in 1980 in terms of a natural disaster he said 
normal death rates nearly doubled from oklahoma east during a 
1966 heat wave with deaths jumping to five times normal in st 
louis according to the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
the senate special committee on aging later reported that heat 
waves in 1963 and 1966 claimed a total of 11000 lives 
and a university of california at berkeley study found that hot 
spells in los angeles in 1939 1955 and 1963 each produced more 
excess deaths than any recorded natural disaster in that state 
including the san francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 
those most vulnerable to heat stress are the elderly who may 
already suffer various ailments avery explained indeed in 1980 
the elderly made up 70 percent of the excess deaths in the hot 
weather he said 
several factors contribute to this increased vulnerability to 
heat stress including less cardiovascular stamina heart damage 
less responsive blood vessels underlying diseases and a decreased 
ability to sweat the senate aging committee reported 
in addition it noted the elderly use more prescription 
medications and many of those drugs can increase sensitivity to 
heat 
heatcaused deaths do not arouse the concern they should because 
a uniform reporting system has not been established avery said 
as a result only classic cases of heat stroke get officially 
reported as heat deaths and those amount to perhaps 200 in a 
normal summer and 1500 to 1600 in a hot summer like 1980 he 
explained 
still not attributed to the heat are the thousands of 
temperatureinduced heart attacks strokes and other fatal 
ailments they are only measured later when deaths in the hot 
years can be compared to more normal ones and the excess calculated 
we have very accurate assessment of what crop losses are going 
to be and it seems we are more concerned about corn than about our 
people i think thats a tragedy avery said 
death and illness arent the only heatwave related problems 
heat affects work attendance and productivity depending on the 
region 
a fiveyear study by researchers at the university of delaware 
found that hot weather increases work attendance in the sun belt 
but reduces it in other areas of the country 
attendance rates remain high in hotweather cities where air 
conditioning is common at home work and car the study found but 
rates drop off when the the weather cools slightly and workers want 
to engage in outdoor tasks and recreation 
in northern cities however work attendance dips as people 
unaccustomed to hot muggy weather lose sleep and suffer other 
discomfort

the us trade deficit suffered a major 
setback in june swelling to 125 billion the government said 
today in a report that sent the dollar down sharply although 
briefly on foreign currency markets 
the surge in the trade deficit a sharp 285 percent worse than 
the revised may imbalance of 98 billion came after three 
consecutive months of improving trade figures the commerce 
department reported 
junes trading shortfall was the worst since februarys 144 
billion deficit which triggered a 100point plunge in the dow 
jones industrial average when it was announced in april 
the impact of the june deficit figure however was far less 
adverse 
the dollar initially fell dramatically against all major 
currencies in hectic trading but within an hour recovered at least 
half of its lost ground 
likewise stock prices were broadly lower at the opening of 
trading after three hours of activity however the dow jones 
industrial average had risen by more than 25 points 
the initial reaction to the june trade figures was 
indigestion but the more we chew on them the better they taste 
said jay goldinger chief economist at capital insight a los 
angeles investment house 
goldinger said that the markets realized that the onemonth rise 
did not interrupt what should be a substantial improvement in trade 
for 1988 
in a second report today the government said that american 
industry operated at 835 percent of capacity in july the highest 
level in more than eight years the 04 percentagepoint jump from 
the june operating rate was also viewed negatively by financial 
markets because it heigthened concerns about growing inflationary 
pressures 
the reagan administration sought to play down the significance 
of onemonths increase in the trade deficit saying that it did 
not change the fact that the us trade deficit for all of 1988 
will be sharply lower than the record imbalance suffered in 1987 
this onemonth jump in the trade deficit is not cause for 
alarm us trade representative clayton yeutter said in a 
statement monthly numbers will always be erratic and it is more 
instructive to focus on the longterm outlook 
analysts said the trade deficit has been a major blow to the 
dollars stability this year and shows financial markets are still 
vulnerable to unexpected jolts from the monthly merchandise trade 
statistics 
the june trade figure is a big disappointment and the 
implications are very scary for financial markets said allen 
sinai chief economist for the boston co 
sinai said that the trade figure would likely push the dollar 
lower driving up the costs of imported goods and further 
intensifying inflationary pressures in the united states 
the june deficit in merchandise trade was substantially worse 
than had been expected most economists had anticipated a deficit 
of around 109 billion which would have matched the deficit as 
originally reported for may 
the may imbalance was revised downward to 98 billion making 
it the best performance since an 8 billion deficit in december 
1984 
analysts said the markets were ignoring the better may figure to 
focus on the widening of the june deficit which was seen as a 
disappointment because of a big jump in imports and a drop in us 
exports 
exports fell by 24 percent in june to a seasonally adjusted 
268 billion while imports surged to an alltime high of 394 
billion 
the deterioration pointed up the problem facing us 
policymakers who have struggled for most of this decade to find 
ways to reduce soaring trade deficits 
while us exports have shown improvements because of a 
substantial decline in the value of the dollar imports have stayed 
at stubbornly high levels despite the fact that a weaker dollar is 
now making foreign goods more expensive for american consumers 
the 57 percent jump in imports in june was laid to a sharp rise 
in imports of clothing office equipment and heavy machinery 
the report said that shipments of foreign capital goods shot up 
by 900 million in june while shipments of consumer goods rose up 
700 million 
the weakness in exports reflected declines in shipments of 
american capital goods agricultural products and autos 
even with the deterioration the us trade deficit for the 
first six months of the year was running at an annual rate of 140 
billion down sharply from the record deficit of 1703 billion set 
in 1987 
americas foreign oil bill declined slightly in june to 36 
billion compared to 39 billion in may as the average price per 
barrel fell to 1619 down 21 cents from may an average of 736 
million barrels of oil were imported daily down from 776 million 
barrels daily in may 
as usual the largest overall deficit was with japan an 
imbalance of 44 billion up from 41 billion in may 
the deficit with canada americas largest trading partner 
climbed to 140 billion the deficit with the countries of western 
europe rose to 19 billion while the deficit with the newly 
industrialized countries of taiwan south korea hong kong and 
singapore rose to 27 billion in june

the federal trade commission announced tuesday 
that is will not drop its challenge to the proposed merger of the 
cocacola and dr pepper soft drink companies even though the plan 
has been scrapped 
the two firms announced merger plans in june of 1986 and were 
promptly challenged by the commission which contended the 
combination would reduce competition in the production and sale of 
soft drinks 
the companies subsequently abandoned the merger plan and asked 
the commission to dismiss its administrative complaint against them 
however the agency announced that it had voted 21 to continue 
the action in which it is asking a court to require cocacola to 
apply for permission from the agency before acquiring stock in any 
soft drink company for 10 years 
the case was sent to an administrative law judge for 
consideration

three of the nations largest retailers reported tuesday they 
had varying degrees of success in maintaining secondquarter 
earnings as consumers continued to spend at a sluggish pace 
dayton hudson corp said its earnings rose 24 percent during the 
quarter ended july 30 as the company kept tight controls on 
expenses meanwhile jc penney co inc reported its income 
dropped 21 percent and zayre corp posted a substantial loss 
dayton hudson said it earned 286 million or 34 cents per 
share compared with 23 million or 24 cents per share in the 
same period a year earlier 
secondquarter revenue increased to 269 billion from 231 
billion a year ago 
we planned conservatively for the quarter and despite a weak 
retail environment our operating companies executed their plans 
very well said kenneth a macke chairman and chief executive 
officer 
we are particularly pleased with the profit performance of 
mervyns and are confident that its turnaround is progressing 
macke said 
problems with mervyns apparel stores drained dayton hudson 
profits in past quarters and made the company a takeover target for 
dart group corp a year ago the dart bid failed in the wake of the 
stock market crash 
penney reported secondquarter income of 81 million or 61 
cents per share down from 103 million or 68 cents per share in 
the second three months of 1987 
the company reported revenue of 321 billion down from 341 
billion a year earlier 
the retailer attributed the earnings drop to the increased level 
of markdowns that apparel retailers have been forced to take during 
a yearold sales slump 
penney said it also had higher development costs for ventures 
including video home shopping but said its results benefited from 
a lower tax rate 
the nearly 22 million loss reported by zayre came as no 
surprise after the company warned earlier this month it had 
suffered a substantial loss during the second quarter 
the loss compared with earnings of 773 million or 129 a 
share in the second quarter of 1987 the yearearlier results 
included an 896 million gain from the sale of part of zayres 
interest in its tjx cos apparel division 
zayre attributed the loss in the latest quarter to its flagging 
discount stores division which lost sales after it cut back on 
promotions the discount stores also were forced to take 
largerthanexpected markdowns zayre said in a statement 
the retailers secondquarter revenue totaled 155 billion up 
from 14 billion 
for the first six months dayton hudsons earnings were 593 
million or 70 cents per share compared with 611 million or 63 
cents per share for the first half of 1987 revenue for the first 
half increased to 524 billion from 446 billion a year ago 
dayton hudson corp operates 599 department specialty and 
discount stores in 37 states 
penney said it earned 212 million or 157 per share during 
the first half down from 239 million or 159 per share in the 
same period a year earlier the 1987 figure includes a 140 million 
charge for the relocation of penneys headquarters to dallas from 
new york 
firsthalf revenue totaled 639 billion down from 663 
billion in the first six months of 1987 
zayre reported a sixmonth loss of 174 million compared with 
earnings of 1189 million or 199 per share a year earlier the 
1987 figure includes the gain from the tjx sale as well as a 205 
million gain from an accounting change 
the company had firsthalf revenue of nearly 3 billion 
compared with 27 billion for the first six months of last year

lawyers met privately tuesday to plan strategy 
on behalf of farmers in 10 states who accuse chubb group of 
insurance cos of reneging on its duties to pay drought insurance 
claims 
its just an organizational meeting in an effort to have a 
united front which is the only way to go said cincinnati lawyer 
stanley m chesley who organized the meeting he declined to 
elaborate on the discussions 
us district judge carl b rubin of cincinnati issued an order 
monday granting classaction status to lawsuits against chubb 
allowing eligible farmers nationwide to join a group legal action 
against the warren njbased company farmers still can pursue 
independent litigation 
rubins action expanded his decision last week to grant the 
classaction status to three ohio claims against chubb 
the ohio department of insurance also is conducting hearings to 
investigate how chubb policies were marketed within the state 
some of the farmers lawsuits also name as a defendant good 
weather agriculture a californiabased agent for chubb chesley 
said 
the farmers say chubb sold them drought insurance on their 
crops but has reneged on its duties to pay their claims as a 
result of the ongoing drought damage chubb has offered to repay 
farmers twice the amounts they paid in premiums but state 
insurance regulators have termed the offer insufficient 
chubb has maintained its innocence in recent weeks the company 
has taken out fullpage newspaper advertisements nationwide to say 
that it has a longstanding reputation for business integrity 
the company says it initially intended to underwrite 30 million 
in drought insurance but a lastminute flurry of applications 
resulted in potential liabilities of more than 400 million 
chubb spokeswoman mary lu korkuch did not return a telephone 
message tuesday seeking further comment 
chesley who helped obtain the judges classaction declaration 
said an estimated 8800 farmers in 10 states could have claims 
against the company he said the farmers involved are in ohio 
indiana kentucky tennessee michigan illinois missouri 
minnesota iowa and wisconsin 
chesley said he hopes the case can go to trial in three to four 
months if a settlement is not worked out our only interest is 
full and fair compensation for the plaintiffs he said 
last week some minnesota farmers suggested that they might 
pursue their own suits against chubb but janet abaray a lawyer on 
chesleys staff said last week that she persuaded lawyers for the 
minnesota farmers to support the classaction lawsuit

unisys corp employees armed with a 
federal court order began removing 17 million in military 
components from armtec inc in palatka tuesday under the watchful 
eyes of three federal marshals 
while the packing and loading operation took place about 25 
former armtec employees who lost their jobs when unisys cancelled 
its contracts with armtec picketed outside carrying signs 
reading armtec is quality unisys pay up and jobs not 
welfare 
both armtec and unisys have come under scrutiny in a federal 
probe of potential fraud and bribery in pentagon weapons contacts 
and armtec shut down earlier this month 
us district judge howell w melton in jacksonville ordered the 
seizure monday after unisys citing national defense and 151 
million in federal contracts asked the judge to order armtec to 
surrender materials owned by unisys 
lawrence j hamilton ii a jacksonville lawyer who represents 
unisys said he action was taken to protect unisys contracts to 
build 14 terrier mod 10 three mk92 and six cort radardefense 
systems for navy ships 
unisys is under contract to deliver the completed systems to the 
navy over roughly a twoyear period beginning in february and the 
navy has made fleet deployment decisions based on bringing some 
ships to port for installation of the new systems the suit said 
the unisys lawsuit claims that armtec told unisys lawyers last 
week that it would not turn over the materials because unisys owed 
it money for work already performed 
unisys said it feared that if the closed armtec plant did not 
remain dehumidified severe but almost undetectable damage could 
occur to the wiring harnesses produced there decreasing the 
reliability of the final products unisys said in court documents 
the issue came to a boil when unisys notified armtec on aug 3 
that it would no longer buy the wiring harnesses and other 
materials from armtec 
actions by unisys forced the fledgling defense contractor to 
close its doors and lay off 88 workers

bushel have recently provided direction to the grain markets but 
soybeans lost traders tuesday to the lowerrisk corn pit said 
steve freed a grain analyst in chicago with dean witter reynolds 
inc 
despite a recordmelting heat wave that threatens further damage 
to the droughtstressed soybean crop freed said speculators shied 
away from the soybean market when prices for nearmonth delivery 
approached 9 a bushel tuesday morning 
meteorologists predicted cooler temperatures would begin moving 
into the midwest on thursday the forecasts plus a lack of 
substantial export business left the markets with little bullish

organizers of a new venture involving the weekly 
television supplements of 33 newspapers announced plans tuesday to 
challenge popular tv guide in a battle for advertising revenue 
the venture called tv week network groups the newspapers in an 
effort to attract national entertainment advertising with rates 
competitive with tv guides it is a joint venture of tribune media 
services a subsidiary of chicagobased tribune co and western 
states associates an independent agency that represents newspaper 
publishers 
representatives of tv guide didnt have an immediate comment on 
the move but some analysts said the newspaper organizers have 
carved themselves a daunting task 
tv guide is going to be a tough competitor its not easy 
said rodd macklin a financial analyst for legg mason wood walker 
inc in baltimore 
the sunday television supplements now carry little national tv 
advertising because it is too complicated and timeconsuming for 
the networks to deal with ad representatives of each individual 
newspaper the organizers said 
its been inefficient to buy said robert reed president of 
tribune media services 
under the new scheme networks will be able to buy space in a 
number of tv supplements by doing business with a centralized 
operation 
the move comes on the heels of publishing tycoon rupert 
murdochs purchase of tv guide announced last monday as part of 
his 3 billion acquisition of triangle publications the venerable 
weekly tv publication is the most widely read magazine in the 
country with a circulation of around 17 million and advertising 
revenue of more than 162 million in the first half of the year 
we felt the timing for tv week network was right because of 
the growing fragmentation of the television viewing audience 
reed said when you realize that tv guide only reaches 20 
percent of the potential audience it is not difficult to 
understand why there is room in the marketplace for additional 
national advertising alternatives 
tv guide also has been challenged in recent years by guides 
aimed directly at cable television subscribers the cable guide 
the largest of the pack has a circulation of about 72 million and 
is expected to fetch some 35 million in ad revenue this year 
tv guides had a lot bigger threats over the last five years 
than the one mounted by the newspaper group said robert ladd an 
analyst for deutsche bank capital corp in new york 
network and studio advertisers will likely start advertising in 
the newspaper sections as a supplement to not a replacement for 
their promotions in tv guide he suggested 
the 33 newspapers comprising tv week network have a total 
circulation of 188 million compared with tv guides 94 million 
in the same markets the organizers said only televisionrelated 
advertising will appear in the newspaper supplements while tv 
guide carries ads for other kinds of products in addition to 
promotions of tv programs 
a fullpage blackandwhite ad in the tv week network 
supplements will average around 70000 about the same or 
slightly less than tv guide charges reed said tv guide currently 
charges 88900 for the same type of ad according to julianne 
hastings a spokeswoman for the magazine 
advertisers will have up until 18 days prior to publication to 
place the ads close to tv guides 17 
the newspapers in the group include the new york daily news the 
chicago tribune the los angeles times the philadelphia inquirer 
the boston globe the detroit free press the houston chronicle and 
the washington post

hechinger co said tuesday it agreed to 
purchase 47 bradlees discount department store leases from stop amp 
shop cos inc for about 118 million 
about half the bradlees stores located in the densely populated 
corrider linking philadelphia baltimore and washington dc will 
be remodeled and opened as hechinger stores according to company 
spokeswoman pam mcmillan the rest because they are located close 
to existing hechinger stores will be rented out to other retailers 
stop and shop was only willing to sell the leases as a 
package mcmillan explained but the locations are very 
lucrative and a number of retailers have already shown an interest 
in renting in these locations 
the agreement did not include the purchase of any inventory 
fixtures or other bradlees assets by hechinger said john w 
hechinger and richard england cochairmen of the chain of 
doityourself retail home improvement centers 
hechinger which is based just outside the nations capital has 
73 stores operating on the eastern seaboard and will expand by 
about 32 percent with the transaction 
the growth of the area in terms of number of homes and 
household income makes it one of the prime markets for 
doityourself retailing in the united states england and 
hechinger said in a statement 
they said the acquisition would be financed out of existing 
working capital 
hechinger reported sales of 7251 million up 23 percent and

hewlettpackard co is impressing 
customers if not wall street with new computers and appears on 
the way to its goal of 10 billion in annual sales entering its 
50th year of business in 1989 
at a meeting of more than 2000 customers in florida last week 
hewlettpackard enjoyed a wealth of plaudits for its spectrum line 
of minicomputers 
that wealth though hasnt yet affected hewlettpackards stock 
price which plunged 150 a share tuesday to a new low for the 
year 4587 hewlettpackards 52week high was 7362 
this is clearly a huge panic on the technology stocks in fear 
of inflation and recession in 1989 said adam cuhney of kidder 
peabody amp co there isnt a lot of substantive reason to see a 
derailment of good hightech companies like hewlettpackard 
john a young hewlettpackards president and chief executive 
officer scared investors with gloomy comments in june about us 
orders in the third quarter the effects of higher prices for 
scarce dynamic random access memory chips and a defense department 
freeze on certain orders 
the higher cost of dram chips led to a price increase of up to 
25 percent for some of hewlettpackards computer memories in july 
hewlettpackard is scheduled to report its thirdquarter 
earnings on wednesday 
cuhney is forecasting a 24 percent rise in revenue for the third 
quarter and profits of 87 cents per share versus 57 cents per share 
last year 
thats a little higher than most other forecasts jeff canin of 
hambrecht amp quist inc said the market is worried hewlettpackards 
domestic bookings wont match last years record 119 billion 
cuhney said he expected a 3 percent rise in us orders and a 34 
percent rise in foreign orders just to be up 3 percent on the 
us side is a major accomplishment considering the strength of 
last years us sales in the third quarter 
as it approaches the halfcentury mark hewlettpackard is 
stepping up its assault on computer giants digital equipment corp 
and international business machines corp while using a 15 
billion hoard to invest in small companies and buy back stock 
hewlettpackard agreed last week to buy 10 percent of octel 
communications corp a voicemessaging firm in milpitas calif 
for about 27 million on monday hewlettpackard said it had 
formed a partnership with telecom australia 
both were relatively small deals but indicative of 
hewlettpackards move away from its traditional base in scientific 
instruments 
those are strictly strategic moves and dont mean the company 
is going on a buying binge cuhney said 
adds canin for all intents and purposes hewlettpackard is a 
computer company today with a very impressive line 
two weeks ago hewlettpackard announced several changes in its 
toplevel management to reflect the rising importance of its 
worldwide computer business which accounted for 5 billion of the 
companys 81 billion overall revenue last year 
hewlettpackard is expanding in all directions making 
terminals personal computers engineering workstations networks 
laser printers software and minicomputers while maintaining its 
reputation for quality medical and scientific instruments 
hewlettpackard even brought in former pittsburgh steelers 
quarterback terry bradshaw teammate lynn swann and coach chuck 
noll for a football rallytype talk to nearly 800 salesmen 
young bet the company a few years ago on the promise of 
spectrum which is based on a technology called risc or reduced 
instructionset computing 
risc relies on much fewer circuit elements than traditional 
designs such as digitals vax and should make it easier for 
hewlettpackard to engineer compatible spectrum models of different 
sizes the technology also gives users more bang for the buck 
in its 49th year hewlettpackard has added about 1000 
engineering marketing and sales personnel to reach 83000 workers 
worldwide thats still about 1000 workers less than its 1985 
peak when the company trimmed down with voluntary severance and 
retirement programs to cope with an industry slowdown

rally that overcame the effects of bad news about the nations 
swollen trade deficit 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks which fell 3325 
points monday to its lowest close in nearly three months recovered 
about half the loss by the end of trading up 1724 to 202151 
broader market indicators also advanced 
brokers called the rally largely a technical reaction to the 
markets recent declines based on fear of rising interest rates 
which erodes the relative worth of stocks between aug 3 and 
monday the dow average had fallen 12979 points raising the 
prospects for at least a partial rebound 
stocks bonds and the dollars value initially fell when the 
commerce department reported a largerthanexpected june trade 
deficit of 125 billion which suggested the us currency would 
have to decline to make us products more competitive and 
discourage americas relentless appetite for imports 
but the impact of the trade report was reversed by investors who 
quickly stepped in to buy stocks when prices reached what appeared 
to be bargain levels brokers said

oversold condition said william r rothe managing director and 
head of overthecounter trading at the baltimorebased brokerage

delaurentiis entertainment group 
inc which has been struggling for months after a string of movie 
flops on tuesday sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy laws 
the move had been expected since friday when the company 
founded by italian moviemaker dino delaurentiis revealed it had 
failed to negotiate a debt swap with bondholders that it had termed 
essential for survival 
the company maker of the movies crimes of the heart and 
weeds and the television miniseries noble house has sold 
assets and sought to restructure debt in order to stay in business 
the company hasnt reported financial results for 1987 but has 
released estimates of a 69 million loss 
delaurentiis himself who owns 619 percent of the compnays 
stock stepped down from management in february 
stephen greenwald chairman and chief executive officer 
declined comment through a spokesman 
under chapter 11 the company continues to operate under 
supervision of a federal bankruptcy judge in an attempt to pay 
creditors and reorganize filing of a chapter 11 petition 
immediately puts the companys debts on hold 
in announcing the filing in us bankruptcy court in los 
angeles the company didnt list assets and liabilities 
after coming to the united states in the early 1970s 
delaurentiis was responsible for several movie successes including 
serpico and a remake of king kong before taking 
delaurentiis entertainment group public with a stock offering in 
march 1986 
the company produced such box office nonstarters as the 25 
million tai pan and the 21 million king kong lives a 
sequel to the king kong remake an attempt to promote million 
dollar mystery by entering moviegoers in a million dollar 
sweepstakes failed to bring in box office gold 
another company strategy was to sell videocassette and paytv 
rights to a movie before it was released in hopes of reaching the 
breakeven point before a movie hit the theaters but the advance 
revenue often didnt cover advertising and distribution costs 
which can run as high as the cost of producing a movie 
i am profoundly saddened to hear that deg has been forced into 
bankruptcy dino delaurentiis said in a news release i 
sincerely hope the company can be revived for the benefit of 
the shareholders creditors and other investors 
the debt swap offer that failed last week would have 
dramatically reduced the companys 65 million bond debt by trading 
existing bonds for stock and bonds with terms more favorable to 
delaurentiis the company hasnt revealed how many bondholders 
agreed to accept the offer other than to call the response 
disappointing 
sale of delaurentiis library of 300 films including the 
graduate and carnal knowledge to british financier michael 
stevens brought 54 million in july the company earlier sold its 
share in an australian film distributor for 7 million 
the company previously announced an agreement for a new line of 
credit with the european bank credit lyonnais but didnt reveal 
the amount 
the bankruptcy filing doesnt include delaurentiis entertainment 
group subsidiaries north carolina film studios inc or onyx 
entertainment inc the companys newly formed production company 
also unaffected by the filing is an affiliated limited 
partnership delaurentiis film partners

likely would establish a solid base for the currency in the near 
future

interest rates than economic indicators

silver futures prices plunged tuesday on new yorks commodity 
exchange falling about 15 cents a troy ounce amid speculation that 
a widening in the nations merchandise trade deficit was not 
necessarily inflationary 
on other markets crop futures mostly were lower livestock and 
meat futures were mixed oil futures slipped and stockindex 
futures advanced 
analysts said the commerce departments morning report that the 
us trade gap had jumped to 125 billion in june after narrowing 
for three consecutive months initially was viewed by 
preciousmetals traders as a harbinger of higher inflation 
accordingly gold and silver futures opened moderately higher in 
new york 
but the market later turned around as traders began focusing on 
the fact that exports dropped slightly which analysts said 
apparently indicated that us industrial production was not 
expanding as rapidly as many had believed that could mean the 
threat of higher inflation may be less than many had feared 
the dollar which initially had weakened on the trade news 
reversed its course in midafternoon and the metals quickly 
followed suit led by silver 
the trade deficit figure doesnt give you the impression the 
economy is very hot said john norris chief trader of precious 
metals with citibank in new york 
norris said another government report showing us factories 
operating last month at 835 percent of capacity a nearly 8year 
high could be viewed as inflationary 
but the notion that the federal reserve would raise interest 
rates further to combat inflation overshadowed the factory report 
and minimized its impact on the inflationsensitive metals markets 
he said 
william oneill director of research with elders futures inc 
in new york said the rise in imports noted by the report could 
reduce some of the capacity pressure on us factories 
if you look at the trade figure its not as inflationary as 
the initial reaction to it might have seemed oneill said 
gold settled 410 lower across the board with the contract for 
delivery in august at 42890 a troy ounce silver was 15 cents to 
154 cents lower with september at 6635 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower tuesday on the 
chicago board of trade amid slack export demand and forecasts for 
showers and cooler temperatures in the corn belt later this week 
the corn market finished sharply lower and was the leader in a 
session that featured relatively light trading and wide price 
swings in the soybean pit 
intense heat hit midwestern croplands again tuesday but 
meteorologists predicted cooler temperatures would begin moving 
into the region by thursday the forecasts plus a lack of 
substantial export business left the markets with little bullish 
news

striking autoworkers and management of 
ltv corps am general division stayed away from the bargaining 
table tuesday in the second day of a strike at two military vehicle 
assembly plants 
both sides said there would be no immediate resumption of talks 
to end the walkout that began when a contract extension expired at 
midnight sunday but a union leader and a company spokesman said a 
long strike could prove costly 
the action has idled nearly 1400 workers and halted production 
at plants in south bend where military trucks are assembled and 
in neighboring mishawaka which produces the hummer the armys 
multipurpose light vehicle 
larry fluke the financial secretary of uaw local 5 said the 
strike was not related to am generals decision last month to close 
the south bend plant and eliminate 400 hourly jobs and 150 salaried 
positions workers agreed to a sixweek contract extension in late 
june talks broke off sunday night 
obviously were unhappy about the plant closing but we 
didnt negotiate from that basis said fluke its not a 
geteven type of thing 
am general president george a maddox said the plant would be 
closed because the division could not afford to compete for new 
truck contracts in the 1990s ltv is protected from its creditors 
under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws 
wilbur berry the locals unit chairman said a federal mediator 
might be called if talks remain stalled he said the two sides 
remain divided over wages severance benefits for workers losing 
their jobs and just a lot of things 
am general spokesman craig mac nab said management would 
continue to follow its policy of not discussing the negotiations 
that began in april 
mac nab said an extended strike could jeopardize am generals 
chances of winning a renewal contract for the hummer the 
divisions reputation as a reliable supplier of military trucks to 
foreign buyers could also be hurt he said 
earlier this monthy ltv corp reported a secondquarter net 
profit of 1576 million up 28 percent over 1987 the 1988 
quarterly statement included a 30 million onetime charge for the 
shutdown of the south bend plant 
the earnings of ltvs missile and electronics group which 
includes am general dropped nearly 50 percent over the second 
quarter of 1987 earning 129 million on sales of 403 million 
the company earned 232 million on sales of 407 in the 1987 
quarter the decline was due to falling military truck sales the 
company said 
the dallasbased corporations steel unit also operates a 
factory in east chicago

pan am corp has renewed its threat to sell some 
of its assets in the wake of stalled negotiations between the 
ailing airline and its biggest union a union official said tuesday 
in a meeting tuesday with leaders of the transport workers 
union pan am chairman thomas plaskett said the carrier will sell 
its south american routes according to union spokesman jim gannon 
he said plaskett made the statement during a meeting in which 
negotiations broke down on a new pan am contract with the transport 
workers 
the talks ended in deadlock and the union plans to file for 
federal mediation on wednesday gannon said 
pan am declined comment on the talks spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
would confirm only that the meeting took place 
last thursday members of the transport workers voted by a large 
margin to reject a contract agreed on in july by the unions 
leadership and pan am management the move dealt the airline a 
major setback in its efforts to cut labor costs 
the proposed transport workers contract had called for a wage 
freeze in return for pan am withdrawing its earlier threat to sell 
assets the airline engaged in sporadic talks with the transport 
workers since february originally had sought a 10 percent cut in 
wages 
in tuesdays meeting plaskett said the company would consider 
any alternatives to the rejected wage freeze but they still had to 
achieve pan ams goal of saving 81 million over the next three 
years gannon said 
pan am which lost 2653 million last year believes it needs 
about 540 million over three years in pay cuts and other 
concessions from its unions to turn itself around 
the unions representing pilots and flight engineers have agreed 
to cuts totaling about 240 million over three years and pan am is 
seeking 90 million in wage reductions from its flight attendants 
the company has imposed 35 million in cuts on employees 
represented by the teamsters union under federal labor rules
