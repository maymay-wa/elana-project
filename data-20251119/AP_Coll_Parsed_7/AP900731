a food and drug administration advisory 
committee on tuesday unanimously recommended approval of interferon 
alpha as the first treatment shown to be effective against 
hepatitis c an fda spokeswoman said 
interferon alpha a substance produced naturally in the body 
that can be made in large quantitities by genetic engineering has 
already been approved for treatment of hairycell leukemia 
kaposis sarcoma and genital warts 
the drug does not cure hepatitis c also known as nona nonb 
hepatitis and is not universally effective but studies have shown 
that it can alleviate some effects of the disease said fda 
spokeswoman faye peterson 
committee members also recommended longterm followup of 
hepatitis patients after the drug receives formal approval 
hepatitis c is a chronic disease that sometimes leads to 
cirrhosis and cancer of the liver which often are fatal as many 
as 200000 people get hepatitis c each year in the united states 
at least half from unknown causes 
known causes include blood transfusions from infected people 
sharing of infected intravenous needles by drug abusers and 
according to some studies sexual relations 
the drug is manufactured by scheringplough corp under the 
brand name intron a 
the advisory panel also recommended against fda approval of 
granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor or gmcsf one of 
a new family of complex proteins that regulate production of blood 
cells gmcsf is critical in the production of white blood cells 
committee members agreed that more research on the drug is 
needed before it can be approved for use in cancer therapy and 
other diseases that have impaired the bodys ability to fight 
infections peterson said 
the drug also genetically engineered is being tested on 
patients whose bonemarrow transplants failed the panel 
recommended the fda allow continued use of the drug for patients 
with this lifethreatening condition 
the drug is made by hoechstroussel pharmaceutical inc 
the body produces gmcsf naturally but in very small 
quantities its gene was identified recently and the drug now can 
be produced through genetic engineering the company said

the senate defeated republican attempts 
tuesday to diminish labors clout at the polls usually on behalf 
of democrats as part of a bill to clean up the way federal 
election campaigns are financed 
on largely partyline votes democrats defeated amendments to 
strip unions of their taxexempt status if they stay in politics 
and to allow their members to demand refunds of any dues spent on 
elections or lobbying 
republicans claimed the votes demonstrate their contention that 
democrats campaign finance reform bill and its spending ceilings 
is a partisan charade that will assure a veto by president bush 
we might as well as go on to something else said senate gop 
leader bob dole of kansas 
so far this campaign reform bill only reforms republicans 
dole said we like reform but its got to be reform that 
applies to both sides 
meanwhile 16 democrats joined republicans in defeating an 
effort by liberals to have the government pick up 70 percent of a 
candidates general election costs through a new 2 checkoff on 
individual income tax returns 
democrats had stripped the provision from their bill last friday 
but sen john kerry dmass tried to put it bank in tuesday 
night his amendment was defeated 6830 
also defeated on a 4949 tie vote was an amendment by sen john 
mccain rariz that would have prevented candidates from rolling 
over any surpluses in their campaign accounts for use by their 
house and senate offices or for future campaigns instead mccains 
measure would have required that any surpluses be turned over to 
the government 
democrats did go along with one republican amendment by sen 
don nickles of oklahoma to prohibit senators and house members 
from using their free postage privileges for mass mailings during 
the calendar years they are up for reelection 
nickles cited figures showing that uses of the congressional 
mail frank nearly double in election years for example they went 
from 53 million in 1981 to 100 million in 1982 from 72 million 
in 1983 to 110 million in 1984 and from 63 million in 1987 to 
113 million in 1988 
also approved was an amendment by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
that would prohibit companies more than 50 percent foreign owned 
from forming political action committees to raise funds for 
candidates 
bentsen whose amendment was adopted by a 7327 vote said pacs 
of foreignowned companies contributed 28 million to candidates 
in the 1988 election a 19 percent increase over 1986 and 5 
percent of the total given by all corporate pacs 
it creates inevitable pressures on us employees to use 
their pac muscle in ways acceptable to the corporate masters in 
london or frankfurt or tokyo he said american campaigns 
should be for americans 
sen mitch mcconnell rky said bentsens proposal was moot 
since democrats and republicans in the senate have now agreed to 
ban pac contributions altogether in the bill 
nonetheless he voted against it saying the amendment would 
strip some 3000 us citizens who work at a toyota assembly plant 
in his state of their political rights should the courts rule that 
a total ban on pacs is unconstitutional 
it does not treat all of us citizens the same way mcconnell 
said if you happen to work at toyota in kentucky you dont get 
the same rights as somebody who works at ford 
on a 5841 vote the senate defeated a mcconnell amendment to 
lift the taxexempt status of unions and other organizations if 
they participate at all in election campaigns 
rejected earlier on a 5941 vote was a republican amendment that 
would have allowed the nations 17 million union members to demand 
refunds of any dues not spent directly on collective bargaining or 
grievances 
republicans contended unions spend tens of millions of dollars 
of the estimated 33 billion to 5 billion in dues they collect 
each year to indirectly benefit their favorite politicians through 
voter registration voter education and turnout programs 
the national right to work committee a group that wants to 
outlaw agency shop contracts under which nonunion workers must pay 
fees to unions estimates that organized labor spends 330 million 
on politics in every twoyear election cycle 
if you dont do anything about this sewer money from unions i 
dont think you have campaign reform said sen orrin hatch 
rutah ninety percent goes to democrats even though 30 percent 
to 40 percent of union members are republicans 
president bush announced a year ago that as a part of any 
campaign finance reform measure he wanted congress to expand on a 
supreme court ruling to give workers a right to seek refunds of any 
union dues spent on politics 
the court ruled in 1988 that a nonunion technician who paid 
fees to the communications workers of america as part of an agency 
shop contract with atampt was entitled to a refund of the portion not 
spent directly on collective bargaining

a grand jury declined tuesday to indict a 
white police officer in the shooting of a black teenager whose 
death this year sparked rioting in the new york city suburb of 
teaneck 
after announcing the grand jurys decision state attorney 
general robert del tufo said he would empanel a new grand jury 
because of errors he said were made in the autopsy 
the grand jury investigated the death of phillip pannell 16 of 
river edge who was shot in the back by teaneck police officer gary 
spath 29 on april 10 pannels death sparked a night of racially 
motivated rioting in teaneck a new york city suburb 
the shooting prompted mobs of angry youths to rampage in an area 
near the police headquarters in teaneck overturning cars and 
attacking journalists black community activists organized marches 
and the killing polarized a community that had prided itself on 
racial harmony 
the dead boys father phillip pannell sr appealed for calm he 
gave reporters what he called a message for the citys young people 
im willing to give america another chance for justice he 
said i feel justice will be served chill out 
after announcement tuesday lawyers from the naacp and community 
leaders met teaneck youths in the parking lot behind the police 
station trying to calm them 
ted wells a lawyer for the national association for the 
advancement of colored people told the teens that calling a second 
grand jury was an extraordinary step 
if there was a scam theyd give no indictment shut up and 
bite the bullet wells explained 
spath met with reporters at his attorneys office and said id 
like to thank the lord jesus christ for carrying me on his 
shoulders weve been praying for the pannell family all along and 
will continue to pray for the pannell family 
the attorney general said the decision that a new grand jury 
probe is warranted is fortified by the fact that the grand jury 
which heard the case was seriously divided 
the attorney general maintained that errors in the autopsy by 
the bergen county medical examiner led to an incorrect conclusion 
concerning the possible actions of mr pannell at the time he was 
shot 
a key question before the grand jury was whether pannell had 
raised his hands in the air and pleaded with police not to shoot 
as some witnesses said or whether he twice stopped and turned in a 
threatening way toward the officers 
the mistake permeated and distorted the investigation and the 
grand jury presentation the medical examiner has admitted his 
error del tufo said 
del tufo said the decision that a new grand jury probe is 
warranted is fortified by the fact that the grand jury which 
heard the case was seriously divided 
spaths attorney robert galantucci accused del tufo and gov 
jim florio of calling for another grand jury to curry favor with 
voters 
it sends a bad message to police officers throughout this 
state it sends a bad message to them but they cant change the 
truth galantucci said they shouldnt be playing politics with 
the grand jury system 
the 21member grand jury was to determine if spath was justified 
in firing his 38caliber service revolver or whether he should be 
indicted on charges of manslaughter or improperly using deadly 
force 
the grand jurors have been meeting once or twice a week since 
late april they reached a decision late tuesday afternoon and 
attorney general robert del tufo scheduled a news conference to 
release the panels findings 
the shooting took place when spath responded to a telephone 
report of a youth with a gun 
the grand jurors heard accounts from more than two dozen 
witnesses including police bystanders and pannells friends 
among those testifying before the panel was officer wayne 
blanco who frisked pannell moments before he was shot by spath 
according to the record of hackensack blanco testified that he 
warned spath that he felt a gun in pannells jacket according to 
the newspaper 
but teenagers with pannell said there was no frisking before 
the youngster ran the man whose telephone call alerted police 
about a youth with a gun backed the youths accounts when he 
testified before the grand jury the newspaper said 
because of the sensitivity of the case it was transferred from 
bergen county to a state grand jury sitting in trenton and it was 
handled by a deputy attorney general 
spath was suspended with pay

republican paul jurgens wanted to match 
his pistolshooting skills against the man he wants to unseat 
democratic rep richard durbin but durbin shot down the idea 
durbin turned down the invitation monday citing the press of 
congressional business in the week before the august recess and he 
took a pot shot at jurgens 
mr jurgens shot himself in the foot when he issued this 
challenge without even checking the congressional schedule he 
said 
jurgens who also mounted an unsuccessful bid against durbin in 
1988 had challenged the fourterm congressman monday to a shooting 
match to be held wednesday during a national tournament in the 
community of barry 
jurgens an oral surgeon from decatur said he proposed the 
match not to see who gets the most bullseyes but to draw 
attention to his differences with durbin on gun control 
both candidates generally support private ownership of guns but 
durbin has voted for some restrictions on the sale of handguns 
jurgens opposes such measures 
jurgens faces an uphill battle against durbin in 1988 durbin 
carried nearly 69 percent of the westcentral illinois district 
jurgens however might have an edge with a gun 
he said he hunts with a rifle several times annually and goes 
targetshooting with a pistol two or three times a year 
durbin said he has gone hunting but doesnt do so regularly

the first known remains of a giant lizard that 
may have dined on baby dinosaurs have been found in mongolia a 
researcher says 
the 80millionyearold skull and forelimb were a highlight of 
the first expedition to that country by western paleontologists in 
65 years said michael novacek 
the lizard which apparently resembled todays komodo dragon 
was perhaps 8 feet long and may have been a juvenile novacek said 
it may have eaten young dinosaurs or dinosaur eggs he said 
its fossil remains were found in the gobi desert near a 
dinosaur nesting site that contained eight eggs he said 
the komodo dragon is the largest living lizard reaching a 
length of more than 11 feet in southeast asian jungles novacek 
said the animal has been known to attack and consume adult humans 
novacek is vice president and dean of science at the american 
museum of natural history in new york he and museum colleagues 
malcolm mckenna and mark norell recently undertook the monthlong 
expedition at the invitation of the mongolian academy of sciences 
the american researchers and mongolian counterparts also found 
100millionyearold remains of shrewsized mammals which may shed 
light on the spread of the ancestors of modern mammals he said 
they also found two unusually wellpreserved skeletons of 
protoceratops a beaked dinosaur that grew 4 to 5 feet long and 
one of an armored dinosaur called an ankylosaur which grew 15 to 
20 feet long novacek said the fossils were about 80 million years 
old 
the wealth of discoveries from the relatively brief expedition 
gives hope that further work will turn up much more material he 
said the museum and the mongolian academy signed an agreement for 
three more expeditions over the next three years he said 
mongolia contains a tremendous potential for exploration that 
you dont see in north america with areas the size of wyoming 
that have not been explored he said

for soviet authorities the geophysical crises are bad enough 
but in a land of limited freedom ecology is also a central 
rallying point for politics 
regional leaders blame moscow for their condition and growing 
new popular movements demand action on a long agenda of problems 
nuclear contamination from atomic testing in kazakhstan for 
example and poor living conditions and child labor among cotton 
pickers in uzbekistan 
their point is always the same outsiders decisions devastate 
local lands and peoples 
in a region that produces 90 percent of the soviet unions 
cotton the word ecology symbolizes the challenge of preventing 
a monoculture from sucking their land dry 
at the madaniyat farm here huge red letters atop the 
headquarters building declare we want communism inside 
director mohammed akhmadov says he is flexible 
we feel the pinch and were adjusting akhmadov said 
fingering a tattered paper listing water flow rates in a decade 
cotton production has dropped 10 percent new land is planted in 
fruit trees and vegetables needing less irrigation 
he said farmers use fewer and safer chemicals and he expected 
onceserious health problems to stop new freedoms allowed farm 
managers to be more commercially and ecologically effective 
words are not important he said what matters is 
production and making peoples lives as good as possible who cares 
what system 
many people are far less optimistic the day that akhmadov 
spoke a local newspaper reported that uzbek collectives used 50 
percent more chemicals than was safe 
they only say they are changing said kovaleyev there are 
quotas plans to meet and farmers stick to old ways if we dont 
stop these addictions much of central asia will be as dead as the 
aral sea 
if some soviet authorities insist the sea will be saved 
oldtimers seem to side with the pessimists 
the fresh air the fat fish we will never see that again a 
desperate old captain said into yatsenias camera now we can 
only scratch by with no place to go and nothing to do then he 
lapsed into a mournful uzbek song of his beautiful dying aral

andrei plesu philosopher and art 
historian was a dissident outcast under the old regime now he is 
culture minister with a spacious office and the freedom to talk 
about democracy and revolution 
since communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was deposed and 
executed in december intellectuals like plesu have become the 
conscience of romania wooed by political parties and foreign 
governments 
they are divided on whether to support president ion iliescus 
government but united in believing there will be no return to 
communism in this nation of 23 million which suffered the most 
violence in the breakup of the soviet bloc 
tomorrow if the government says all private institutions will 
be abolished there would be a second revolution plesu said in 
an interview thats what makes me optimistic about the future 
despite all the problems all the difficulties that we are going to 
face 
many intellectuals worry about a government that although 
freely elected has resorted to some of its disgraced predecessors 
tactics although the communist party is dead its structure 
remains they say 
in june iliescu called loyal miners to bucharest to stop 
antigovernment demonstrations they beat protesters hunted 
intellectuals and ransacked the offices of critical publications in 
the worst violence since the revolution 
nonetheless plesu and others are convinced things have changed 
as the government takes its first steps toward a market economy 
they see a difficult road to real democracy however 
intellectuals were leaders in the struggle against ceausescu it 
was poet mircea dinescu now chairman of the influential writers 
union who announced ceausescus ouster on the state radio 
then came the landslide election victory may 20 of iliescu a 
former alternate member of the communist party politburo and the 
national salvation front a loose grouping of workers peasants 
intellectuals and technocrats that took power during the revolution 
many romanians think the front is controlled by communists 
intellectuals who feel iliescus triumph bodes ill for freedom 
blame other intellectuals who did not speak out strongly for 
democracy after the revolution 
it was romanias first free election in 44 years and writer 
stelian tanase now wishes the group for social dialogue an 
organization of dissident intellectuals had gone on television for 
a few minutes each week to explain the basics of democracy and 
multiparty politics 
who knows he said its too late to have regrets 
tanase edits an anticommunist weekly called 22 which the miners 
tried to shut 
the political campaign was marred by allegations of fraud and 
intimidation that forced many of the more than 50 parties to 
curtail electioneering 
iliescus victory was not questioned but foreign observers said 
his 85 percent landslide showed pluralistic democracy had not taken 
root 
plesu tanase and dinescu belong to the group for social 
dialogue which was formed after the revolution and generally 
opposes the national salvation front 
two months ago the tomorrow society was established to support 
the front its prominent members include literary critic eugen 
simion and authors marin sorescu and augustin bazura 
romulus vulpescu a writer and theater director elected as an 
independent legislator on the front list said i believe the 
front is sincere and that it will truly seek to recreate the 1923 
constitution which was one of the most liberal in the world 
alexandra cornelescu head of the english department at 
bucharest university is a staunch front supporter but concedes 
violence harms intellectuals faith in the government 
tanase said its a long way to democracy and to a free 
romania its very difficult after a half century to change in so 
short a time peoples mentality the people voted for continuity 
they were under stress frightened by possible changes 
democracy that means risk liberty the possibility to lose 
or to win the people dont want to take this chance theyre 
all frightened to lose their jobs 
in plesus view communism has spawned a bureaucracy and 
mentality that likes privilege or power and which has no 
knowledge of marxist thinking 
he said the bureaucrats are opportunists and change will 
take years because there are millions of them 
a press that consists of 1200 publications most of them 
antigovernment doesnt help foster democracy because they are 
incredibly primitive attacking without a point of view plesu 
said they transform the liberty to say truth into the liberty to 
say anything 
thomas kleininger a mathematician who is vice president of the 
group for social dialogue said romania has no history of united 
opposition 
we are beginning from zero he said we have no tradition 
in fighting against communism 
romania had no counterpart to dissident playwright vaclav havel 
now president of czechoslovakia or magazine editor tadeusz 
mazowiecki who became polands prime minister in part that is 
because ceausescu cleverly manipulated the intellectuals dividing 
them and silencing critical voices 
intellectuals always were divided and isolated from much of 
society most sided with the monarchy or fascist leaders before 
world war ii and with the communist dictators afterward reaping 
material rewards denied those who resisted 
plesu and others suffered internal exile and house arrest the 
more careful kept their heads down at noncontroversial jobs 
deploring the situation in private but keeping silent in public 
the revolution transformed the intellectual hierarchy 
overnight dissidents became heroes and ceausescu supporters became 
the outcasts 
most dissidents initially supported the front plesu became 
culture minister in the interim government and writer dan petrescu 
his deputy but dinescu and poet ana blandiana refused government 
posts 
blandiana and doina cornea a former professor of french who was 
romanias bestknown dissident left the front in late january 
accusing it of perpetuating totalitarian practices and breaking a 
promise to stay out of the elections 
kleininger the mathematician predicted the greatest conflict 
in the next two years would be between reformers and the 
bureaucracy 
he said the communist infrastructure will die only if the new 
government renounces its monopoly on power and promotes a real 
multiparty system and private enterprise 
the important thing for us is to bring to the consciousness of 
men that freedom and initiative under harder conditions are more 
important than this feeling of security kleininger said 
like lions in the zoo we never knew what it meant to be 
free

navy searchers on monday found debris on the 
ocean floor near where a cargo door tore off a united airlines jet 
last year killing nine people authorities said 
searchers have yet to confirm the debris is from united airlines 
flight 811 said lt col bob anderson a navy spokesman 
one object wedged in the ocean floor is believed to be a large 
piece of metal which could be the 10by10foot cargo door 
anderson said 
the 224foot navy tug uss narrangansett using a small 
remotecontrolled submarine to search the ocean floor three miles 
down recorded the location of the find 90 miles southsoutheast 
the tug was to return to honolulu on tuesday anderson said 
the orion submarines sonar located the debris but searchers 
were unable to obtain a picture of the find with the subs video 
camera anderson said 
the navy will report the find to the national transportation 
safety board which will decide whether to try to recover the 
debris anderson said 
the boeing 747 carried 355 passengers when it left honolulu 
international airport for new zealand on feb 24 1989 
shortly after takeoff a cargo door opened at 22000 feet 
tearing away a section of fuselage nine people were swept to their 
deaths and five others suffered serious injuries the crew managed 
to return and land in honolulu 
the ntsbs inquiry determined that a faulty design of the doors 
locking mechanism probably caused a cockpit panel light to falsely 
indicate the door was locked 
the ntsb blamed united boeing co and the federal aviation 
administration for failing to correct problems with the door 
the national transportation safety board has completed its 
inquiry into the accident but has requested the search for the 
door with hopes its inspection will lead to better plane safety

portofspain trinidad ap prime minister arthur nr 
robinson and the chief negotiator for his moslem extremist captors 
said monday that they had reached agreement to end a 4dayold 
hostage siege 
robinson other cabinet ministers and lawmakers were among 41 
hostages reported held by the black moslems who stormed the 
parliament building and the government television station on friday 
in a coup attempt robinson suffered gunshot wounds in both feet 
word of the accord came in telephone call to trinidad journalist 
tony fraser from inside parliament and was not immediately 
announced to the nation 
selwyn richardson the justice and national security minister 
said in the call that the agreement called for robinsons immediate 
resignation with elections to be held within 90 days 
richardson said the government granted amnesty to rebel leader 
abu bakr and his followers in the revolt which has left at least 
nine people dead and led to looting on this islandnation of 13 
million residents 
the official said however that the agreement was contingent 
upon the safe return of all members of parliament now held 
hostage 
it was unclear when the hostage release might occur 
the announcement came hours after government and military 
spokesmen said negotiations with the radical moslem group had 
collapsed 
earlier monday security forces exchanged gunfire with the 
rebels at both the parliament building and the staterun television 
station the two buildings were hostages were being held 
speaking from inside parliament late monday robinson said the 
agreement was reached after very difficult bargaining 
the prime minister said he instructed col joe theodore head of 
the trinidad and tobago defense force to make necessary 
arrangements for the evacuation of hostages and rebels as soon as 
possible 
chief rebel negotiator bilal abdullah speaking next on the 
telephone said i wish to totally corroborate what prime 
minister robinson has just said 
the rebels claim robinsons government is corrupt and 
responsible for widespread poverty in this once oilrich country 
they claimed on saturday to have wired robinson with explosives and 
threatened to blow him up if a rescue attempt was made 
government spokesman gregory shaw said robinson was shot in both 
feet and richardson was shot in one leg when rebels stormed 
parliament 
army spokesman maj dave williams reported that the moslems were 
armed with ak47 assault rifles pistols and grenades 
in the first official casualty count williams said at least 
nine people had died in the fighting since friday he said anglican 
negotiator knolly clarke told him additional bodies were inside the 
parliament building but it was not known how many 
the two sides nearly reached agreement earlier monday but a 
government official said negotiations stalled over conditions for 
releasing the hostages who include eight cabinet ministers 
shaw said 41 hostages were being held and about 100 rebels were 
involved in the siege 
he said 16 hostages including the government ministers were 
being held in the parliament building the remaining 25 hostages 
are all employees of the government tv station he said 
among the dead were six rebels two police officers and one 
civilian williams said six rebels were known to be wounded

this years farm bill may take the worry out 
of shopping for organic cucumbers 
other provisions apparently headed for adoption in congress 
would stop exports of pesticides banned domestically expand 
protection of wetlands and erodible fields and encourage farmers to 
cut their use of chemicals that can find their way into the water 
supply 
the legislation which sets agricultural policy for the next 
five years has at its heart a set of support programs for crops 
and livestock 
but this years bill focused as never before on measures 
intended to protect the earth and its waters drafted under the 
watchful eye of lobbyists for environmental groups farmers and the 
chemical industry 
it is an environmentally conscious farm bill sen patrick 
leahy dvt the agriculture committee chairman said after the 
senate passed its version 7021 last fridayit is one that 
allows us to do the things americans want 
the house is expected to finish work on its version this week 
the effort to resolve differences between the house and senate 
bills in conference committee however is going to have to wait 
for the outcome of budget negotiations 
those talks are likely to force a cut in planned spending on 
farm support programs in order to bring down the overall price tag 
estimated at 54 billion over five years for the senate measure 
the senate bill provides for a new official agriculture 
department organically produced label for meats fruits and 
vegetables raised without synthetic chemicals it is likely to be 
added to the house measure 
environmental activists who backed the provision to be known as 
the organic foods production act said confusion over what is or 
isnt organically grown has discouraged consumers and grocers 
alike slowing a movement to cut chemical use in farming 
people have been selling products they said were more 
healthful because they didnt use certain pesticides or 
fertilizers said janet hathaway a senior project attorney who 
follows the issue for the natural resources defense council an 
environmental group 
but different rules on various chemicals apply in different 
states with no rules in some states and very little enforcement in 
others she said 
under the bill a 13member national organic standards board 
would help draw up a list of substances that will be approved or 
barred for anyone who wants to call his operation an organic farm 
states still could run their own organic certification programs 
as some already do food still could be called organic on the 
label so long as at least half of its ingredients are organically 
produced but the official usda stamp would only go to 100 percent 
organic products 
the senate also agreed to prohibit exports of pesticides 
considered too dangerous for use in american farming 
in what is known as a circle of poison such pesticides 
sometimes have been found to return to the united states as residue 
on imported foods 
the senate agriculture committee said it also wanted to protect 
american farmers from unfair competition from foreign producers 
using usmade pesticides that cant be used here 
other sections of the bill would authorize 250 million in 
research on how farmers could use fewer chemicals direct the 
agriculture department to study how its grading standards offer 
incentives for excessive pesticide use and require for the first 
time that farmers keep records of pesticides they use 
still unresolved is a dispute over access to the pesticide 
records the senate bill would allow only certain government 
agencies to see them but environmentalists hope the house will 
vote to allow extensive public access to the information 
both the senate and house bills would expand programs to protect 
fragile wetlands and fields susceptible to erosion from farmers 
eager to expand their acreage the bills also would enact new 
programs to preserve privately owned forests

in this city of bureaucrats lawyers and 
computer nerds how many good oldfashioned macho men are left 
you guessed it folks 
when the kennedy center announced auditions for macho hemen 
to perform as extras in the australian ballets production of 
spartacus this week only 36 showed up 
worse nearly half of them were politely ushered to the door as 
impostors 
the audition fliers posted on bulletin boards at congressional 
offices gyms and dance studios around town included a photograph 
of exactly the kind of guy the kennedy center was looking for a 
lean and mean roman gladiator clad in a flimsy loin cloth his 
rippling muscles straining to burst his leather chest straps 
what shuffled into the rehearsal hall of the kennedy center 
opera house on monday evening fell roughly into two categories 
health spa muscleman and your standard couch potato 
they were short and tall potbellied and trim balding and 
longhaired dressed in jeans tshirts and shorts one wore a 
striped shirt and tie few seemed likely candidates for hungarian 
choreographer laszlo seregis balletic tale of a slave revolt in 
ancient rome 
one who didnt make the cut was eugene woodruff 57 of suburban 
annandale va a supervisor at the us patent and trademark 
office who took his disappointment goodnaturedly 
woodruff has been a supernumerary or extra with the washington 
opera a few times mostly just standing around on stage but never 
in a ballet 
im not a dancer at all he said with a smile i dont 
take part in any strenuous athletics for exercise the only thing 
i do is rifle shooting i also mow the lawn and saw some firewood 
the lure for woodruff couldnt be the money the 19 extras 
selected to play roman soldiers and slaves in spartacus will 
receive 28 for four rehearsals and 40 for four performances 
starting friday 
the extras in opera productions are paid considerably less but 
the pay for spartacus is higher because there is lots of 
marching and escaping and running around on stage said steve 
quinn the kennedy centers liaison with the australian ballet 
colin peasley the touring ballet companys ballet master chose 
19 of the more athleticlooking candidates and began an intensive 
drill to whip them into shape as roman soldiers and slaves 
left right left right he barked as the extras marched 
across the floor to piano music from aram khachaturians score 
grabbing a wooden spear peasley said these are held like you 
hold a thermometer under your arm like this he taught the 
neophyte guards how to sway without getting dizzy and how to 
crouch without looking like youre sitting on the toilet 
he held a roman warriors shield to his chest you must be 
careful how you hold a shield or they begin to look like a 
handbag he said 
woodruff enjoyed his past moments of glory in the operatic 
limelight no matter how obscure but he had no pretensions 
i have no illusions about being a great actor he said i 
do it for the fun of it its a chance to do theater thats 
bigtime without having any real professional skills

no one disagrees that medicare and medicaid 
have helped millions of americans over the past quarter century 
but critics say these two health care safety nets have developed 
too many large holes 
when these programs were enacted many persons expected that 
medicare and medicaid would ensure full coverage of all health care 
services for the elderly disabled and poor said rep edward 
roybal dcalif 
though much has been accomplished there remain many gaps 
and weaknesses in the programs roybal chairman of the house 
select committee on aging said in a report released at a hearing 
of the panel on monday 
with health care costs rising twice as fast as inflation the 
price of private medical insurance is getting beyond the reach of 
many employers are trimming coverage and states are reducing their 
medicaid rolls to cut costs 
though taxpayers spend more than 174 billion a year on the 
programs an estimated 37 million americans have no health 
insurance and medicaid covers only 42 percent of those living in 
poverty and roybal said 200 million people are underinsured for 
catastrophic or longterm illness 
the 25th anniversary of medicare and medicaid which were signed 
into law june 30 1965 provided an opportunity for those who want 
to change the nations health care system to highlight problems in 
the government insurance programs 
but before the hard hitting began roybal and other members of 
the committee marked the anniversary with a large sheet cake iced 
with white frosting and trimmed in red white and blue 
the celebratory mood turned serious as roybal opened the 
hearing outlining the major failings of the two programs 
a national health insurance program is a must for this 
country said roybal who has introduced a bill that would build 
medicare into a federally based nationwide program covering health 
and longterm care 
the bipartisan pepper commission 12 members of congress and 
three white house appointees has proposed building on the 
existing employerprovided insurance system and improving and 
expanding the medicaid program 
sen jay rockefeller dwva chairman of the pepper 
commission said the country has six to eight years to make needed 
reforms in the health care system if nothing is done people are 
going to rise up in protest he said 
medicaid a federalstate program that serves more than 26 
million poor americans is in worse shape than medicare 
rockefeller said eligibility differs from state to state and 
reimbursement rates are so low in some places that some physicians 
refuse to treat medicaid patients he said 
it is time to take the lessons we have learned over these 25 
years and put them to use in finally building a universal health 
system he said 
gail wilensky head of the health care financing administration 
which handles medicare and medicaid said any changes in the 
nations health care system should build on the current system and 
should not strain the us economy 
if we decide to fill insurance gaps we must do so in a way 
that does not lead to overwhelming financial gaps in the future we 
must make sure that we do not create incentives that contribute to 
unnecessary utilization and overspending she said 
the bush administration is conducting a review of the quality 
accessibility and cost of the nations health care system health 
and human services secretary louis sullivan who is leading the 
review has not said what changes he will recommend but he has 
rejected national health insurance as a solution

mayor marion barry says he doesnt foresee any 
rioting in the streets of washington if he is convicted in his 
cocaine and perjury trial 
we blacks have grown as a people in the last 20 years and 
we are not going to destroy what we have brought back barry told 
reporters monday after the prosecution and defense wound up their 
presentations of evidence 
those who talk about that dont represent me said barry 
barry said he didnt believe rioting would really happen he 
scoffed at some local press reports on the possibility of rioting 
like that which happened in the nations capital when civil rights 
leader martin luther king jr was assassinated in 1968 
frankly i really dont see rioting happening no matter what 
happens barry said i want to say i have heard no serious 
consideration of anything like that 
testimony on the 14 criminal charges against the mayor lasted 
six weeks the two sides called 44 witnesses 
barrys trial is expected to go to the jury thursday following 
closing arguments that are likely to last all of wednesday said 
presiding us district judge thomas penfield jackson

arguments to the jury instructions to the jury probably will be 
given thursday morning

jurors following jury instructions 
the six have been sequestered along with the 12 jurors in the 
case since the jury was seated in the case in midjune 
the mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of 
cocaine possession one misdemeanor charge of conspiracy and three 
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his drug use before 
his arrest in an fbi sting operation last january

a coroner who dropped a dead infant 
headfirst onto the floor as part of his research into skull 
fractures is being sued by the childs parents for 2 million in a 
case that has divided doctors over such practices 
some coroners say such research has been carried out in morgues 
for years others say the permission of the next of kin should be 
required 
in the trial which began last month district judge hugh 
brunson must decide whether state law allows coroners to conduct 
experiments not needed to determine the cause of death and whether 
approval from relatives is needed 
no state court has previously ruled on the issue but state 
assistant attorney general chuck yeager said in an opinion last 
year that the law does not authorize such experiments without the 
permission of the next of kin 
dr charles odom a deputy coroner for lafayette parish in 
southern louisiana was fired by his boss coroner robert p 
thompson who found out about the experiment on 4monthold 
christina arnaud and informed the parents 
dwayne and ellen arnaud are seeking damages for emotional 
suffering 
the trial which is being held in lafayette 95 miles west of 
new orleans is in recess but resumes in august 
the baby died of sudden infant death syndrome in 1986 and an 
autopsy was performed by odom the same day 
odom held the baby by the heels and dropped it onto a concrete 
floor findings from the experiment were later used in a 
manslaughter trial in hawaii in which charges against a father 
accused of killing his child were dismissed 
odom now an assistant medical examiner in dallas testified in 
the hawaii trial that he believed the experiments on the infant and 
on another babys corpse proved that children could die from skull 
fractures suffered during accidental falls from the arms of an 
adult 
testifying at the lafayette trial odom said he regarded the 
experiment as proper and said such research is not uncommon 
while the primary purpose of an autopsy is to determine the 
cause and manner of death there is a secondary purpose to gain 
medical knowledge and use that medical knowledge in the service of 
the living odom said 
some doctors defended the practice 
i think its a good thing and a needed thing said dr terry 
welke calcasieu parish coroner theres a lot of knowledge 
brought about by experimentation that is not allowed on the living 
its a good practice to allow it here 
odom and other medical examiners say that skin bone eyes 
heart valves and kidneys are often removed from bodies and used 
elsewhere with and without the knowledge of the family 
dr monroe samuels a medical examiner in orleans parish said 
requests to experiment on corpses during autopsies are submitted 
regularly by medical schools and research centers in new orleans 
we would only do it if it did not deface or deform the body 
he said we do have requests for some surgical techniques but 
those are only done with permission of the next of kin were not 
talking about ghoulish things like leaning on an arm to see how far 
it will go before it breaks or shooting a gun at it 
welke said that in his office doctors have come in to practice 
techniques on cadavers before moving on to live patients 
its done basically because physicians are trying to enhance 
their knowledge he said if the practice is cut off it would 
be a big problem 
but dr sylvan j manuel st landry parish coroner and 
president of the louisiana coroners association was one of a 
number of coroners who said they knew of no experimentation 
unrelated to the autopsy being done in louisiana 
i dont think any of us are doing it or should do it 
manuel said i dont think anything should be done without the 
permission of the family if youre going to take something off the 
body a fingernail even you should have permission of the 
family 
jefferson parish coroner robert treuting testified that 
experiments such as the one conducted by odom help doctors and 
researchers perfect operating techniques and find cures for illness 
treuting said orthopedists have practiced dissecting joints on 
cadavers awaiting autopsies and researchers took some parts from a 
body to study hardening of the arteries 
pathologists have the right to do anything they want with the 
body including keeping it if there is a legitimate research 
reason treuting testified 
but he said it would be callous for the survivors to be told of 
experiments because it would compound their anguish

the union had ordered the walkout june 25 to back demands for a 
a 5457 percent wage increase chiquita which handles nearly 
twothirds of honduras banana exports at first refused to 
negotiate then drew the line at 1433 percent 
in an address to the nation on sunday night callejas called the

take unspecified legal action if chiquita and the union did not 
accept his proposal for a 254 percent increase

chiquitas announcement said the company incurred a loss of 
1445 million in production during the strike

when a big trial happens in a small town 
finding an impartial jury can get complicated 
it seems that everyone from potential witnesses to prospective 
jurors knows everyone else in the trial of shirley kinge who 
faces charges connected to the slaying last year of a couple and 
their two children 
jury selection began last week when 290 of 300 prospective 
jurors questioned were dismissed 
one woman had taught nearly a dozen potential witnesses in her 
seventhgrade home economics class one mans cousin lived across 
the street from mrs kinge another woman said her sons best 
friend was dating the defense attorneys daughter 
all but one prospective juror questioned said they had read and 
heard news reports about the slayings of warren harris 39 his 
wife dolores 41 and their children 11yearold marc and 
15yearold shelby 
a new pool of 100 potential jurors was called to court monday 
by then lawyers had agreed on 10 jurors for the panel which will 
ultimately have 12 jurors and two to four alternates jury 
selection continues this week 
the trial in ithaca is expected to last at least until 
september with more than 300 possible witnesses the length of the 
trial the number of witnesses and the notoriety of the case are 
making jury selection as difficult as it could be said judge 
william barrett 
the slain couple and their children were each bound and shot in 
the head the night of dec 22 at their home in dryden near ithaca 
in this county of 88000 people the bodies were doused with 
gasoline and set on fire 
mrs kinges son michael was a suspect but was killed in a 
shootout in february when police went to his home to arrest him 
mrs kinge 55 was indicted on charges of arson burglary 
possession of stolen property and other offenses she is accused of 
helping her son set the fires at the harris house and using credit 
cards stolen from the family 
one prospective jurors mail carrier may be a witness another 
worked for the same company as harris one volunteered in the 
election campaign of the district attorney and another was the 
football coach for the sons of mrs kinges lawyer william 
sullivan 
aiden payne a home economics teacher in dryden had taught so 
many of the towns firefighters and police officers that barrett 
asked is there anyone in dryden you dont know 
sullivan said he was troubled by the extent to which potential 
jurors had followed the case and expressed opinions about it 
district attorney george dentes would not comment on the jury 
headaches but the judge said knowing about the case does not mean 
a person cannot be a fair juror 
it isnt the fact that youve heard of it its your state of 
mind he said this trial is not about whats been written in 
the newspapers its about whats presented in court 
a number of prospective jurors said they could not set aside 
their opinions about the case but barrett said they are in the 
minority 
i have great confidence in our juries in ithaca he said 
well find a fair and impartial jury were doing it carefully 
and painstakingly but well get there

after losing 42 million last year on an 
electronic information network for doctors the american medical 
association is conceding that physicians arent ready to be 
computer jockeys 
the association plans to discontinue amanet its national 
medical information database on aug 10 for lack of interest 
its a very regretful decision james f rappel ama vice 
president for information resources said monday we really have 
a product we dont have to apologize for at all 
but he said a lack of computer literacy and personal computers 
and doctors failure so far to incorporate the idea into their 
practices were to blame 
subscriptions to amanet were touted as a way for doctors to 
keep up with latest on everything from drugs and diseases to stock 
prices and airline operations 
the ama has lost about 42 million on amanet since it began 
offering it to its 280000plus members in early 1989 rappel said 
at the time it was estimated the system would break even if 40000 
subscribers spent 15 to 20 per month using it 
although we got the number of subscribers we thought we would 
need only 13000 of them were using the service said rappel 
more than twothirds of the subscribers never even logged on to use 
the system he said 
the use of such a thing in a physicians daily practice its 
not there yet rappel said it will be its very close

president bushs son neil agrees with 
regulators on a host of facts in his savings and loan case while 
continuing to deny he had any conflict of interest 
the younger bush was a director of silverado banking savings 
and loan association of denver which failed in december 1988 at a 
cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
in a document released monday by the office of thrift 
supervision bush and the regulators said they agreed on 110 points 
ranging from bushs date of birth jan 22 1955 to complex loans 
and business transactions 
the 34page document called a joint stipulation of uncontested 
facts consists of information previously made public according to 
the ots and bushs attorney james nesland 
however it pulls together details about bushs oil exploration 
company and its relationship with silverado borrowers kenneth m 
good and bill l walters as well as votes that bush made as a 
director approving loans to the two men 
ots officials have accused bush of conflict of interest in 
failing to disclose his business relationships with good and 
walters to the silverado board 
the joint stipulation requested in late may by administrative 
law judge daniel j davidson is part of the proceeding in the bush 
case bush has been ordered to appear at a public hearing sept 25 
in denver before davidson who will then make a recommendation to 
ots director timothy ryan 
in addition to the ots case the federal deposit insurance corp 
is considering filing a negligence lawsuit against bush and other 
silverado directors 
fdic chairman l william seidman told the house banking 
committee on monday that the agency will decide in the reasonably 
near future whether to sue bush and other directors of the 
collapsed thrift 
the document released monday traced the investments made by good 
and walters in bushs company jnb exploration co which drilled a 
succession of dry holes in wyoming and failed to become profitable 
for an investment of 100 bush acquired 234 percent of the 
business in january 1983 his active partners geologists james b 
judd and evans g nash jr held 234 percent and 156 percent 
respectively for investments of 100 and 66 the name jnb came 
from the initials of judd nash and bush 
the silent partners were walters who invested 300000 for 
a 125 percent stake and good who made an initial investment of 
10000 for 25 percent 
good also guaranteed lines of credit for hundreds of thousands 
of dollars to jnb from cherry creek national bank which was 
controlled by walters 
in addition good personally lent bush 100000 so that good 
could trade in a commodities pool on bushs behalf bush was 
allowed to keep any profits that might be earned but was not 
required to repay the loan if the pool wasnt profitable the 
venture was unprofitable and bush never repaid the loan 
in january 1985 nash dropped out of jnb and judd sold part of 
his interest to bush good bought part of nashs interest raising 
his share to 337 percent 
walters withdrew from the partnership in august 1986 by late 
1987 goods share had jumped to 79 percent while judd had 74 
percent and bush held 125 percent bush was named managing 
partner with authority for the management and operations of the 
business bush withdrew from jnb in may 1989 
the document noted that bush voted as a director to approve some 
loans by silverado to good and walters but did not vote on others

shanghai chinas largest city with a population 
of more than 12 million will start fining couples who have a 
second child an amount equal to three times their annual income an 
official newspaper reported 
in most regions of china current fines are 10 percent of income 
stricter birth control regulations to take effect aug 1 will 
end secondchild privileges for farmers living in shanghais 
outskirts for oil workers and for brothers and children of 
revolutionary martyrs said the xinmin new peoples daily report 
which was seen in beijing today 
couples in second marriages will be allowed to have a second 
child only if they already have one child between them the paper 
said 
the report said that couples who have an illegal second child 
will be fined three times the total of their average annual income 
for the two years before the birth couples who have a third or 
more children without permission will be fined four to six times 
their annual income it said 
payment of the fines could be extended for only six years and 
at least 25 percent must be paid within the first year the report 
said 
in most regions of china current fines are 10 percent of income 
for up to 14 years after the birth of a second child 
the average wage in shanghai last year was 2500 yuan 530 
according to the municipal statistics bureau 
china adopted a onechild per couple policy in 1980 the rule is 
widely observed in crowded cities where women usually have jobs 
but is widely ignored in rural areas where families are willing to 
pay fines in order to have more children to help on their farms 
shanghai already has chinas lowest population growth rate 64 
per 1000 the national average is 142 the city says the stricter 
regulations are needed because current birth rates are exceeding 
previously set targets 
the government has acknowledged that its target of limiting 
population currently estimated at 11 billion to 12 billion in 
the year 2000 is not attainable 
estimates for the number of chinese at the turn of the century 
have climbed to 13 billion about 20 percent of the total world 
population

the house in a step certain to rile the white 
house has approved an 83 billion military construction bill that 
slashes president bushs request for overseas projects including a 
new base in italy 
by a 31282 vote late monday the house adopted the legislation 
that cuts 815 million from the presidents proposal for the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 and 183 million from the amount congress 
approved last year for fiscal 1990 
among the other expected issues of contention is deferral of 
254 million for placing mx nuclear missiles on railroad cars and a 
cut of 37 million from the 92 million bush sought for facilities 
for the b2 bomber at whiteman air force base in missouri 
while reducing funds for overseas projects the bill leaves 
domestic work largely intact and in some cases increases 
spending for projects in the home states of members of the house 
appropriations subcommittee on military construction 
the administration said it opposed the legislation citing a 
170 million reduction in money for the nato infrastructure fund 
and a 226 million increase for the national guard and reserve 
the action on a new facility in italy also is likely to draw the 
administrations ire 
the house banned the use through sept 30 1991 of any us 
money from the nato fund for building a new air base in crotone 
italy for the air forces 401st tactical wing 
spain has said the wing of 72 f16 jet fighters must be moved 
from torrejon de ardoz and following negotiations with the united 
states italy agreed two years ago to provide a new home under nato 
auspices 
lawmakers have questioned the wisdom of constructing a new base 
in europe when defense secretary dick cheney responding to the 
lessening threat and budget constraints plans to close others 
overseas and at home 
the base agreement is outdated its yesterdays solution to 
yesterdays problems said rep david obey dwis who chairs 
the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations 
house approval of the military construction bill came as 
cheneys moratorium on new projects issued jan 24 remains in 
effect until nov 15 in its report the military construction 
panel criticized the ban as disruptive to the armed forces 
noting the possible ussoviet treaty later this year to cut 
conventional forces in europe and uncertainty surrounding base 
closings the bill trims 287 million from the presidents budget 
for overseas projects 
among the cuts are a reduction from the pentagons proposed 
amount of 154 million for germany to 33 million a total of 33 
million for south korea from bushs request of 83 million and 10 
million for projects in italy from the administrations proposal of 
45 million 
but in north carolina home of the subcommittees chairman 
democratic rep bill hefner the administration proposed 106 
million for military construction the panel increased the total to 
about 130 million 
among the projects are 2 million for the cherry point marine 
corps air station aviation museum at camp lejeune and 394000 for 
the organizational maintenance shop for the army national guard in 
goldsboro 
the panels ranking republican bill lowery is from california 
the administration proposed spending 314 million for construction 
projects there and the panel increased the amount to 352 million 
among the projects the panel added to the legislation were 9 
million for barracks for the army national guard at camp san luis 
obispo and 6 million for a computer center at the monterey fleet 
numerical oceanography center 
the panel also includes two other californians democrats julian 
dixon and vic fazio

navy searchers using a remotecontrolled 
deepsea submarine said they found what could be the cargo door 
that tore off a united airlines jet hurling nine people to their 
death over the pacific 
a metallic object that could be by the 10by10foot door was 
found wedged in the ocean floor monday in 15000 feet of water 90 
miles south of honolulu near where the boeing 747 ripped open last 
year said lt cmdr bob anderson 
the subs sonar located the debris but searchers were unable to 
get a picture with the subs video camera to help confirm whether 
the debris is from flight 811 he said 
searchers aboard a 224foot navy tug recorded the location and 
were to return to honolulu today anderson said 
the navy will report the find to the national transportation 
safety board which will decide whether to try to recover the 
debris he said 
the jumbo jet carried 355 passengers when it left honolulu for 
new zealand on feb 24 1989 
shortly after takeoff a cargo door opened at 22000 feet 
tearing away a section of fuselage nine people were swept to their 
deaths and five others suffered serious injuries the crew managed 
to return the jet to honolulu 
the ntsb inquiry determined that faulty design of the locking 
mechanism probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the 
door was locked 
it blamed united boeing co and the federal aviation 
administration for failing to correct problems with the door 
the ntsb asked the navy to find the door in hopes an examination 
of it would lead to better plane safety 
the search began wednesday the orion submarine searched 24 
square miles of the ocean floor

name to socialist and then won a parliamentary majority in june 
multiparty elections 
he has been under investigation for abuse of power 
misappropriation of state property and incitement to national 
hatred prosecutors have yet to file any formal charges and no 
trial date has been set 
in a letter read in the grand national assembly by deputy 
chairman ivan glushkov on monday zhivkov said i do not want to 
be a toy in the hands of whatever political grouping he cited 
what he said were arguments against his appearance prior to a 
possible trial

responsibility for that has happened in bulgaria in the last 
decades both good and bad i have made mistakes but no 
crimes zhivkov said in the letter 
stoyan ganev a spokesman for the opposition union of democratic 
forces udf said zhivkov was now posing conditions for his 
appearance 
he added it was now unclear when zhivkov would speak but he did 
not think this would happen in the next few days

president despite a compromise offered by the socialist party to 
try to overcome the countrys worsening political crisis

nutritional labeling on packaged food would be 
more prominent and easier to read under legislation receiving 
unanimous house approval 
the bill approved by voice vote monday would require that 
specific information about nutritional value and number of calories 
be highlighted on food labels by larger type bold type or 
contrasting color 
it also would require that any claims about the food be 
consistent with government definitions for example if a product 
claims to be low in salt or light the manufacturer must be using 
the standards set by the department of health and human services 
the bill does not preempt state laws on health warnings but it 
does supersede state laws on health claims nutrition and 
ingredient labeling for the sake of uniformity 
similar legislation is pending in the senate 
the version passed by the house would require that labels state 
serving size or unit of measure customarily used 
number of calories per serving and number of calories derived 
from fat 
amount of each of the following nutrients fat saturated fat 
cholesterol sodium carbohydrates complex carbohydrates sugars 
dietary fiber and total protein 
the measure won qualified support from the center for 
science in the public interest which sought to allow states to 
supersede federal labeling requirements with their own tougher 
rules 
congress and the bush administration have been moving along 
similar tracks in the first major reorganization of the nations 
foodlabeling system in nearly two decades 
the food and drug administration earlier this month proposed 
sweeping regulations that would require nutrition labeling for 
nearly all packaged foods and for fresh produce and seafood 
earlier the agency proposed a set of regulations covering health 
claims

state officials said patients of a 
florida dentist who may have given aids to a woman during a tooth 
extraction could be tracked down and urged to take an aids test 
but the patients couldnt be told why 
florida law protects the identity of anyone who has aids even 
from those who may be infected by that person officials said 
monday 
the centers for disease control last week reported a 21yearold 
college student apparently got aids from her dentist even though he 
wore gloves and a mask 
the agency said the case was the first in the nation in which a 
health professional apparently transmitted aids to a patient 
researchers could not positively say how the woman got infected 
but the cdc did rule out sexual encounters or intravenous drug use 
state health officials have refused to comment publicly on news 
reports that the dentist practices somewhere in florida two 
sources however confirmed monday that it was a florida dentist 
they spoke on condition they were not identified 
brian ballard gov bob martinezs chief of staff said that if 
the case originated in florida the health and rehabilitative 
services department may under the law track down the dentists 
patients and ask them to take aids tests 
the patients would not be told however that their connection 
to the dentist was the reason they were asked to take an aids test 
said hrs spokesman steve konicki 
that same guarantee of confidentiality applies to anyone with 
aids to encourage them to disclose names of people to whom they may 
have transmitted the disease 
confidentiality is an important part of contact tracing 
said state rep lois frankel chairwoman of the task force that 
produced a 1988 florida aids law

germany after world war ii 
the change was reflected in a letter obtained monday from east 
german prime minister lothar de maiziere to world jewish congress 
president edgar bronfman which said talks should be convened to 
discuss compensation for the burden caused to israel with the 
absorption and integration of refugees from germany 
previously east germany had agreed to pay reparations to jewish 
organizations but not to israel 
even with the change east germany cannot afford the large sum 
of money involved and negotiations about the amount probably will 
take place next year after the east is united with wealthy west 
germany officials said the united germany will assume the 
financial responsibilities of the east once unification is 
completed by the end of this year 
talks on the subject between israeli and east german officials 
broke down in copenhagen on july 5 on the issue of reparations to 
israel for absorption of the refugees according to the israel 
foreign ministry 
at israels request the world jewish congress then intervened 
with the office of de maiziere said wjc executive director elan

the jury that convicted a man of fatally 
plunging his 2yearold stepson headfirst into a toilet returns 
wednesday to decide whether to send him to the electric chair 
thomas coe 23 was found guilty monday of child abuse and 
murder in the death of bradley mcgee 
the case led to reforms in the way florida protects youngsters 
considered at risk of child abuse 
he deserves death pam kirkland bradleys foster mother for 
14 months said of coe hopefully this will send a message that a 
child is not your property to mistreat or treat any way you want 
its a child and you will treat him right or else 
the jury hears arguments wednesday on whether coe should be 
sentenced to death or to life in prison without possibility of 
parole for 25 years 
coe had testified he was irate steamed and out of 
control in 1989 when he dunked bradley for soiling his pants 
during toilet training the boy died the next day 
the case generated a firestorm of criticism of floridas 
department of health and rehabilitative services which was 
responsible for supervising bradley 
the boy had been under state care from the age of 4 months when 
his mother abandoned him at a mall to a woman who sold pretzels a 
state social worker later recommended he be returned to his mother 
and coe they had the child only two months before he died 
the social worker margaret barber was convicted earlier this 
year of child abuse for her role in the case she never told a 
judge about a psychological report that described the couple as 
infantile explosive and unable to handle children 
bradleys death also led to a change in law to make a childs 
safety rather than reuniting families the top priority of hrs 
the legislature passed the bradley mcgee act last fall 
allocating 79 million for hundreds more childprotection workers 
also another law went on the books to protect foster children from 
being returned to abusive homes 
coes attorneys urged jurors to convict him of a lesser offense 
such as manslaughter arguing that the dunking was merely 
punishment and that there was no intent to harm the child 
prosecutor john aguero countered there is no rational 
explanation for an irrational act this was a senseless killing 
prosecutors said bradleys slaying was the culmination of weeks 
of bizarre abuse at the hands of his stepfather medical experts 
testified that bradleys body was covered with bruises some of 
them up to two weeks old when he died 
coes wife sheryl mcgee coe 21 testified that he often pushed 
the childs face into feces and ground his fist and cayenne pepper 
into the boys genitals 
mrs coe admitted to sometimes aiding in abuse and beating 
bradley with pillows just before he died she pleaded no contest to 
murder and aggravated child abuse and is serving a 30year prison 
term

195 percent closing at 3103566 the index had lost 217603 
points or 658 percent between july 20 and july 30

longterm interest rates that had been discouraging stock 
investors buying interest 
participants finally began to pick up underpriced issues after 
the consecutive drops said masahiro umemori an analyst with 
nomura securities co 
also fueling the rebound were rounds of indexlinked largescale 
arbitrage buying in an attempt to take profits from price gaps 
between the spot and the futures markets he said 
however umemori said todays surge was unlikely to reverse the 
markets recent downward trend because interest rates are still 
considered to be high

the dollar was especially weaker against european 
currencies said masao kanemaru a dealer with fuji bank 
with japanese interest rates going up market players were less 
interested in the us currency he said 
financial markets believe that with the us economy continuing

a former eastern airlines foreman who pleaded 
guilty to falsifying maintenance records says he ignored vital 
repairs on orders from superiors 
elia dragone on monday became the first eastern employee to 
plead guilty in what prosecutors describe as a conspiracy to 
overlook maintenance problems 
dragone 29 of jersey city nj told a federal judge he 
altered log books work cards and other records to make it look as 
if vital repairs had been done 
he said the fraud was orchestrated by his superiors at the 
troubled airline to avoid costly flight delays and cancellations 
eastern and nine managers were charged last week in an 
indictment unprecedented in the airline industry the indictment 
alleges conspiracy fraud falsification of documents and

wooden buildings at three separate shinto shrines 
burned down in western japan early today in nearly simultaneous 
fires police said 
the fires broke out between 119 am and 132 am at shrines 
in the nara prefecture state cities of kashihara yamatotakada 
and gose police said 
the shrines are widely identified with the history of the 
imperial family and prefecture police official said extremists 
opposed to the scheduled november coronation of emperor akihito may 
have been responsible 
no injuries were reported but six buildings were destroyed 
shintoism is japans indigenous religion based on nature 
worship shamanism and elaborate ceremonial rites 
the police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
authorities had found several batteries and pieces of lead that 
could have been used to trigger fire bombs 
of the three ancient shrines the iwasononi imasu taku mushitama 
shrine in yamatotakada city was most heavily damaged its main 
building and the hall of worship totaling 2125 square yards were 
destroyed 
nara the nations capital between 710 and 794 has many sites 
related to the imperial family 
police believe that two other incidents in which two stolen 
cars in nara were bombed on the same day may be connected to the 
fires 
groups including the chukakuha middle core faction and other 
radical leftist groups oppose the monarchy and have vowed to use 
violence to disrupt ceremonies connected with the coronation 
the groups particularly oppose the coronoations rice ceremony 
during which the new emperor is believed to commune with the gods 
they claim it is a remnant of prewar nationalism 
the ceremony is to be conducted 10 days after akihitos nov 12 
coronation 
chukakuha claimed credit for an arson attack that destroyed a 
shinto shrine in akita northern japan in early july

ok so john cleves symmes theory that the 
world is hollow was a little weird but his hometowns still proud 
of him 
a 150yearold stone monument to the philosopher has been 
removed from symmes park for restoration the monument a pedestal 
topped by a 20inch globe with openings at the poles is chipped 
and worn 
we are dedicating the finished product as a bicentennial gift 
to the city said sonia august of a conservation group the town 
was founded in 1791 
symmes 1826 theory of concentric spheres won popular 
backing in the 19th century and led to the formation of the hollow 
earth society 
he argued the earth is made up of five spheres one within the 
other with openings at each pole wide enough for explorers to 
travel from one end to the other 
the concept he said explained reports of open water around the 
northern ice rim northward migration of birds and animals and

the government today ordered a second 
teenage hijacker returned for trial in the soviet union saying 
sweden could not afford to be known as a haven for hijackers 
acting justice minister mona sahlin said soviet authorities have 
guaranteed that anatoly michajlenko 19 will be tried only for the 
hijacking the reason he was being extradited 
she said the soviets promised not to charge him with evading 
military service which is not an extraditable crime in sweden 
michajlenko was expected to be sent back within two weeks 
he was among five young men who hijacked soviet domestic 
airliners in june and early july three to sweden and two to 
finland all five asked to stay saying they were political 
dissidents or fugitives from the soviet army 
besides michajlenko sweden has extradited one hijacker and is 
considering the case of another finland has said it will extradite 
one hijacker and is reviewing the case of the second 
in ordering the extraditions swedish officials have said they 
believe democratic changes in the soviet union now make it possible 
for hijackers to receive a fair trial 
human rights groups soviet exiles and some ukrainian 
politicians asked that michajlenko be allowed to stay in sweden on 
humanitarian grounds 
ms sahlin said after a special cabinet meeting today that it 
was important that sweden not become a destination for hijackers 
she said the government will follow michajlenkos case and we 
believe these soviet guarantees are satisfactory to ensure that 
he is treated as sweden has asked

lawmakers in soviet armenia say the republic is 
capable of policing itself and will not abide by mikhail s 
gorbachevs order that armed groups turn in their weapons and 
disband a local activist said 
last wednesdays decree was gorbachevs latest attempt to stem 
more than two years of ethnic unrest in the southern caucasus and 
central asian republics the disturbances have claimed more than 
400 lives caused millions of dollars damage and produced 
thousands of refugees 
the armenian parliament decided monday that the gorbachev decree 
contradicts the armenian peoples natural right to selfdefense 
as outlined in armenias constitution as well as the un charter 
said ovanes muradian a spokesman for the armenian national 
movement 
soviet television said late monday that the decree was being 
ignored with few weapons seized and armed attacks continuing in 
armenia 
soviet interior minister vadim a bakatin said last week that 
military force would be used if the decree was disobeyed but 
acknowledged problems could arise in implementing it without the 
republics full cooperation 
muradian said armenias parliament voted to suspend gorbachevs 
decree on the territory of armenia and in the disputed 
nagornokarabakh region and that it also declared armenia could 
police itself without outside interference 
but the lawmakers said they were willing to negotiate with 
gorbachev on the issue muradian added the activist speaking by 
telephone from armenias capital of yerevan gave no vote total for 
the resolution 
gorbachevs decree gave illegally armed militants 15 days to 
turn in their weapons or risk having them confiscated it 
encompassed all groups that threatened lives seized arms 
assaulted soldiers or police or attacked military or civilian 
facilities 
since june 4 battles between ethnic kirghiz and uzbeks over 
land distribution have killed at least 212 people 
bakatin said that besides armenia illegally armed groups 
operate in moldavia georgia azerbaijan latvia lithuania and 
estonia 
the leadership of georgia on monday appealed to the public for 
order citing an increase in lawlessness and activity by armed 
groups 
bakatin estimated 10000 to 20000 armenians were involved in 
illegally armed groups but said others put the figure at 40000 to 
as many as 100000 
he said interior ministry troops would be sent to republics 
requesting them and army troops could go in if a state of 
emergency were declared 
interior ministry soldiers already patrol the armeniaazerbaijan 
border at least 200 people have been killed mostly over who 
should govern nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian enclave inside 
azerbaijan

the world health organization today raised its 
estimate of the number of people infected with the deadly aids 
virus to at least 8 million citing the diseases spread in asia 
and black africa 
the latest estimate of 8 to 10 million infections worldwide is 2 
million above the previous figure but within a range the agency has 
cited for some time 
particularly in asia the virus has been spreading much more 
quickly than expected who said 
the toll of hiv infection around the globe is worsening 
rapidly especially in developing countries dr michael merson 
head of whos antiaids program was quoted as saying in a 
statement issued by the agency hiv is the aids virus 
in summarizing regional developments the statement said the 
rate of new hiv infections generally was slowing in the developed 
world but merson warned against complacency since the spread is 
still quickening in some industrialized countries who didnt 
identify those countries 
the agency said that in subsaharan africa the estimate of 
hivinfected people had doubled to 5 million from 25 million in 
1987 due to the diseases spread in rural areas who said 1 in 40 
adult men and women are now believed to be virus carriers compared 
with 1 in 50 estimated earlier 
in asia the virus has spread rapidly among intravenous drug 
users and female prostitutes at least half a million asians are 
believed infected in an area where aids was virtually unknown two 
years ago 
who said the virus spread in asia latin america and 
subsaharan africa could force a dramatic upward revision of 
its prediction that 15 to 20 million infections will have occurred 
by the year 2000 
the un agency also said aids will kill at least 3 million 
women and children worldwide in the 1990s due to rising 
heterosexual transmission six times more than in the 1980s 
who has long said 5 to 10 million people worldwide are believed 
infected with hiv but has recently narrowed its estimates 
its previous figure issued last spring was 6 million to 8 
million 
the virus is transmitted through blood and other body fluids 
infection with the virus is different from developing aids 
itself which destroys the bodys immune system there is no known 
cure 
who lists more than 260000 reported aids cases worldwide but 
says the actual total is two to three times higher

scores of cattle and sheep farmers broke into a 
slaughterhouse and burned seven tons of imported german and irish 
meat to protest foreign competition police said today 
the incident occurred monday night in the maineetloire region 
of western france two days after farmers in the area poisoned 94 
sheep imported from britain 
police said a group of farmers stopped a meat truck monday 
morning that was empty of cargo but carried documents indicating 
meat had been delivered to a slaughterhouse in the town of 
fosseentigne 
in the evening about 100 men entered the slaughterhouse and set 
fire to seven tons of meat in a cold storage room police said no 
estimate of the damage was given 
the attack saturday occurred at a farm in deuxsevres where 206 
british sheep purchased by a french cooperative arrived friday for 
fattening before going to slaughter 
the farm owner joseph drouet heard noises in his sheep pens 
and found 94 of the animals dead police said they apparently had 
ingested an insecticide 
a caller claiming to represent local sheep farmers later 
telephoned media organizations to claim the attack in the name of 
deuxsevres herders 
sheep herders in the region have protested falling prices for 
months they blocked the route of the tour de france bicycle race 
july 2 and forced the riders to detour 
major farming organizations condemned the poisoning but said 
sheep herders were suffering from the loss of income 
its absolutely necessary to give them some hope said 
raymond lacombe president of the national federation of 
agriculture unions 
the government approved 113 million in aid last week to sheep 
herders to help them weather the poor market

a newspaper reported today that israeli tanks 
fired on battling shiite moslem militiamen in south lebanon 
killing at least 10 guerrillas and wounding 15 
an army spokesman refused to confirm or deny the report but 
defense minister moshe arens warned that israel would take a role 
in the fighting if the battles threatened israeli interests 
the daily newspaper yediot ahronot reported that israeli tanks 
opened fire monday on the village of jarjou a site of rival shiite 
militia fighting just beyond israels selfproclaimed security zone 
in south lebanon 
at least 10 fighters of the rival hezbollah and amal militias 
were killed in the shelling and about 15 were wounded the 
newspaper said it did not cite sources for the report 
in a statement published in beirut today hezbollah also 
reported israeli fire aimed at militia fighters monday it said 
three of its fighters were killed and two wounded the firing came 
from an outpost of israelibacked militiamen about a halfmile 
from jarjou the statement said 
both protagonists in the lebanese dispute are enemies of israel 
dating to the jewish states threeyear occupation of south 
lebanon which began with a june 1982 invasion to drive out 
palestine liberation organization guerrillas 
israel carved out a 6 to 10milewide security zone along 
the lebanese border after it withdrew the bulk of its soldiers the 
zone is intended to prevent guerrilla raids across the border 
the fighting between hezbollah and amal erupted july 16 the 
latest stage in an intermittent 3yearold battle to gain mastery 
over lebanons shiite community some 186 people have been killed 
in these artillery battles and 560 wounded by lebanese police 
count 
much of the latest combat has occurred on the rim of the israeli 
security zone 
arens told israel radio there is a danger that the situation 
will get worse and endanger our interests 
earlier arens told yediot ahronot if the combat reaches a 
point in which we see that our interests are endangered in 
other words when the situation becomes intolerable from our 
standpoint there will be no choice and we will get involved 
a source in south lebanon who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the israelis appeared to be warning the militiamen to steer 
clear of the border rather than signaling intentions to intervene

the cheers started behind the thirdbase box 
seats and grew louder as the news spread through the stands 
finally it erupted into a 90second standing ovation at yankee 
stadium 
george steinbrenner was out 
the guy got exactly what he deserved trevor bickford of 
westbury ny said monday night thats what should happen to 
any owner that constantly makes decisions to hurt the club 
in the dugout the yankees werent so happy 
the fans may have been cheering but i wasnt pitcher dave 
righetti said its sad he really loved the idea of owning the 
yankees and now its been taken away from him itll certainly be 
different not having him around here 
word that steinbrenner had been busted by commissioner fay 
vincent for dealing with a gambler came in the fourth inning as 
fans listening with portable radios quickly spread the news 
throughout the crowd 
after the standing ovation detroit first baseman cecil fielder 
quieted the crowd with his major leagueleading 33rd homer 
accounting for the tigers only runs in a 62 loss to the yankees 
before a crowd of 24037 
i actually thought people were running on the field from the 
thirdbase line the noise was so loud yankees pitcher dave 
lapoint said 
people were actually mean about the situation and i guess 
venting their own frustrations he said its a shame that the 
fans who were out there erupted and made a joke out of it it upset 
a lot of us the man was always generous to the players 
many fans however did not like the way steinbrenner treated 
them the man had hired and fired managers and criticized his own 
team in his 18 years at the helm 
ive been a yankee fan since i was a little kid and it really 
hurt me to see this team turned into a joke said frank fedak of 
monroe conn hes ruined the morale of the team and the morale 
of the fans im ready for a new owner 
hes worse than pete rose pete rose was only a manager 
said lori waller of farmingville ny steinbrenner was an owner 
and should have taken his responsibility much more seriously 
but john rizzi a fan from rockland ny said of 
steinbrenners ouster i dont feel this is right 
we were dead for 10 years and he made us a winner again he 
said the next owner might not care at all or even take this club 
to jersey

mayor teddy kollek has suspended his leftwing 
deputy for signing an ad supporting reserve soldiers who refused to 
serve in the occupied territories 
i see the incident as a matter for harsh condemnation 
there are few points deserving of national consensus that should be 
accepted by all of us and one of these is army service kollek 
said in a letter to deputy mayor ornan yekutieli published today 
in the daily haaretz newspaper 
the ad published in haaretz last week expressed respect for 
the courageous step of four reserve soldiers who served jail 
sentences for refusing to serve in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
more than 100 reservists have served jail terms for refusing to 
serve in the occupied lands since the palestinian uprising against 
israeli occupation began in december 1987 
kolleks spokeswoman bonnie boxer said the mayor a member of 
the centerleft labor party suspended yekutieli on monday and 
asked him to refrain from representing the municipality until 
there is further discussion of the subject 
the ad was signed by 43 members of the leftwing citizens 
rights movement to which yekutieli belongs it was later denounced 
by the partys leadership 
haaretz quoted yekutiel as saying the ad was a show of support 
for a party member who served a jail sentence for refusing to serve 
in the territories and did not advocate refusing to serve in the 
military

greater germanwest european world power

the name red army faction the group claimed responsibility for 
the attack on neusel in a letter left at the scene of the crime

the soviet defense ministry said today that a 
ukrainian resolution to keep its army conscripts from serving 
outside the republic could impair the soviet unions ability to 
defend itself 
the republics parliament on monday adopted a resolution 
declaring that ukrainians drafted into the soviet army should not 
be used to quell ethnic violence in other parts of the country 
such as armenia and kirghizia 
lawmakers of the countrys second most populous republic 
addressed the resolution to the supreme soviet of the ussr and 
expressed the view that ukrainian conscripts should only serve in 
the republic the interfax news agency said 
the resolution also said that ukraininan troops attached to the 
republics interior ministry should not be used to put down ethnic 
clashes in other republics 
they appealed to the supreme soviets of azerbaijan armenia 
kirghizia and uzbekistan to provide law and order on their 
territories themselves interfax reported from kiev 
asked to comment on the resolution defense ministry spokesman 
vladimir nikanorov said our approach to forming armed forces of 
the ussr is that they must be a socialist multinational 
exterritorial and professional army 
from a military point of view it is a step backward it can 
lead to the ruining of the armys capabilities and impair the 
countrys defense he said 
furthermore economically and technically it is not really 
feasible politically it can lead to transferring interethnic 
differences into military conflicts he said 
the ukrainian parliament on july 16 declared that its laws take 
precedence over national law the declaration said the republic had 
the right to set up its own armed force currency citizenship and 
banking system 
the declaration said the republics youth cannot perform 
military service outside the republic without the parliaments 
permission 
the ukrainian decree followed other republics such as russia 
and the three baltic states clamoring for more independence from 
central authority

safety specialists had concerns about 
potential explosions in storage tanks at the hanford atomic weapons 
plant since the 1970s but authorities didnt acknowledge the 
problem until recently an internal investigation revealed today 
concern about possible explosions because of hydrogen 
accumulation in some of the atomic waste tanks at the weapons plant 
in eastern washington state surfaced last march when the energy 
department made the information public 
but a report by the departments office of nuclear safety 
concluded that a string of plant operators dating back 13 years 
were aware that flammable gas was being generated in the tanks and 
the significance was known as early as the late 1970s 
meanwhile a safety advisory panel to energy secretary james 
watkins suggested the department may not be taking the concern 
about the tanks seriously enough 
the technical basis for the analysis from which the hanford 
operator draws comfort about the safety of the tanks is weak 
considering the potential consequences of an accident the 
departments advisory committee on nuclear facility safety said in 
a letter to watkins 
the findings were released today by the senate government 
affairs committee at hearings into the safety concerns over the 
storage tanks at hanford and other weapons facilities 
sen john glenn dohio committee chairman said the panel 
wants to examine what threat the tanks pose to workers at the 
weapons plants and to nearby populations the committee has 
estimated a single tank could explode with the force of 36 tons of 
tnt and release significant radiation 
the hanford weapons facility has 177 nuclear waste storage tanks 
which contain highly radioactive byproducts from more than 40 years 
of plutonium production last march the energy department said 
some of the doublewalled tanks could explode because of a buildup 
of highly flammable hydrogen 
while acknowledging a problem the department repeatedly has 
said the likelihood is low of an explosion that would penetrate 
both walls of any of the tanks is low 
but in the letter to watkins john ahearne chairman of the 
advisory committee on nuclear facility safety suggested the 
potential for danger is underestimated 
the waste tanks are a serious problem the possibility of an 
explosion of an unstable chemical or a flammable gas must be taken 
seriously because of the amount of radioactive materials that 
could be released ahearne wrote 
top management of doe and the contractor is paying more 
attention to maximizing waste storage capacity and to minimizing 
potential leakage from the tanks than to achieving higher levels of 
tank safety he continued 
ahearne said there is an urgent need to determine what is in 
the tanks what are the risks and what actions should be taken to 
ameliorate the hazards the operators have only sketchy 
information on conditions ins the tanks 
in olympia wash meanwhile gov booth gardner said there 
appears to be no immediate danger to public health and safety 
from a cyanide compound that is in many of the tanks there had 
been concern last year that the compound may unleash a chemical 
reaction that would lead to an explosion 
concern about the cyanide issue prompted the later disclosure 
about the hydrogen buildup in the tanks since then the hydrogen 
problem has gained most of the focus and is considered the more 
troublesome

three members of congress today asked for an 
investigation into alleged neglect of former contra rebels and 
their families who remain in jungle camps along the honduran border 
humanitarian aid for the usbacked rebels which had been 
provided by the agency for international development has been made 
the responsibility of the united nations high commissioner for 
refugees 
sen harry reid dnev and reps duncan hunter rcalif and 
cass ballenger rnc said the recent effort has been a failure 
and that many of the rebels now face starvation the leftist 
sandinista government which they had been fighting was replaced in 
elections this year by a usbacked political coalition 
we put guns in their hands but now we cant put food in their 
mouths reid told a news conference 
the three lawmakers called for an investigation by the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress into why 
adequate aid is not being provided 
a state department official speaking only on condition of 
anonymity said the us government believes that the rebels are 
being adequately cared for and denied that the united states had 
broken faith with the contras 
an estimated 30000 to 40000 rebels and family members remain 
in the jungle camps the lawmakers said many of them with war 
injuries infant mortality is high they said 
a supplemental money bill passed earlier this year included 35 
million for continued humanitarian aid to the rebels as well as for 
repatriation of the fighters the lawmakers alleged that people are 
being starved in the camps to force them back into nicaragua but 
only about 1000 a month are being moved they said

a leader of canadas mohawks warned today that his 
groups land dispute with the government could produce a 
bloodbath and urged the united nations to sent observers to 
monitor the situation 
kenneth deer also told a un human rights panel that the 
mohawks have little confidence in canadian authorities and their 
ability to control police in the standoff 
there is always the possibility of a provocation or an 
accident which will produce a bloodbath between the two opposing 
forces deer said 
he also appealed to the panel to recommend that an international 
delegation is sent to canada to observe the situation and monitor 
any negotiations we have confidence in the justice of our 
cause deer said we have no qualms with an international 
observation team 
his statements drew rare applause from the almost 300 
representatives of various nongovernmental organizations attending 
the meeting of the un human rights commissions working group on 
indigenous populations 
three weeks ago police stormed a barricade manned by armed 
mohawks at oka a village 18 miles west of montreal the mohawks 
were protesting the proposed expansion of a golf course onto land 
they claim is ancestral 
a provincial police officer was killed in the shootout but it 
is unclear which side fired the fatal bullet the government has 
said the bullets caliber did not match that assigned to provincial 
police 
since the confrontation police and mohawk warriors have been 
manning opposing barricades 
police have also blockaded the entrances to oka and deer said 
the police were limiting the amount of food that could be brought 
into the area 
we are a peaceful people who have shared our lands but the 
pressure brought upon us at this point is unbearable he said 
he referred to canadas treatment of its native population as 
the roots of the system of apartheid 
it is for each of us to give respect and dignity to each other 
equally only then can the weapons of war be buried forever he 
said 
canadian ambassador gerald e shannon told the panel monday that 
the federal government hopes that its purchase of the disputed land 
will lead to an early end to the standoff 
shannon said the federal government expects to conclude the 
purchase of the 67acre plot this week for use by the mohawks of 
the kanesatake reserve 
deer said the federal purchase plan validates the action of 
the mohawk people to defend their territory but later he said 
that the incident at oka is no longer about land it is to break 
the spirit of the mohawk people 
but the mohawk people will never surrender never give up our 
land our culture our language he said it is our destiny 
perhaps to struggle forever

sales of new homes jumped 8 percent in june to 
their highest level in four months the government reported today 
the commerce department said new home sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 581000 units in june after gaining a 
revised 23 percent in may the june figure was the highest level 
since february when sales totaled 606000 at an annual rate 
the may increase was even stronger than the 04 percent advance 
first reported last month before the may increase new home sales 
had dropped for five straight months 
at the same time inventories of new homes fell to a 75month 
backlog at the june sales pace that was down from 82 months in 
may and 84 months in april 
the increased sales and lower inventories could stimulate 
renewed construction in an industry that analysts have said was 
slowed by high interest rates consumer caution because of adverse 
economic news and a glutted market 
the national commitment rate for 30year conventional 
fixedrate mortgages ranged from 1029 percent to 1010 percent in 
june according to surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the rate had dropped to 998 percent by last friday 
the national association of realtors reported last week that 
sales of existing homes rose 12 percent in june to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 334 million units it was the first 
increase since a 32 percent gain in november 
the realtors reported today that its index measuring the ability 
of the typical family to purchase a medianpriced existing home was 
1029 in june down from 1047 in may 
that means a family earning the national median income of 
34250 in june had 1029 percent of the income needed to qualify 
for conventional financing covering 80 percent of a medianpriced 
home costing 97500 
the median income means that half of the families earned more 
and half less while the median price means half of the homes cost 
more and half less 
in its report the commerce department said the median price of 
a new home rose 16 percent to 129900 while the average price 
advanced 21 percent to 152900 
sales in the northeast which have been sluggish for more than a 
year jumped 36 percent to an annual rate of 102000 units sales 
in the south also advanced up 136 percent to an annual rate of 
243000 units 
elsewhere sales dropped they were down 58 percent to an 
annual rate of 146000 units in the west and down 43 percent to an 
annual rate of 90000 units in the midwest 
for the first six months of 1990 new home sales have fallen 97 
percent below sales of the first half of 1989 when they totaled 
340000 units

poland says a soviet secret policeman who 
signed the order for the world war ii massacre of polish officers 
in the katyn forest is still alive and should be interrogated the 
pap news agency reported today 
polands justice ministry alleged that pyotr karpovich 
soprunenko was a major in the nkvd the precursor to the kgb when 
he signed the list of 4200 officers ordered to be executed at 
katyn in the spring of 1940 pap said 
the ministry in a communique monday said soprunenko is living 
in moscow pap reported 
justice minister aleksander bentkowski of poland has asked 
soviet general public prosecutor aleksander sukhorev to interrogate 
soprunenko in the presence of a polish investigator pap said 
in all 15000 polish officers the cream of polish society 
called up from the reserves were murdered after being interned at 
three camps when the red army occupied eastern poland in 1939 
for decades successive soviet governments maintained the 
massacre was committed by the nazis only in april did authorities 
acknowledge as polish and western historians had long contended 
that the slaughter was by the nkvd at stalins behest 
a mass grave in the katyn forest near smolensk was discovered in 
1943 it contained the remains of more than 4200 soldiers and the 
remains of the others have not been found

the man who saved a detroit zoo 
chimpanzee from drowning said he never feared for his own life as 
he wrestled the 135pound primate 
he was looking at me said rick swope a 33yearold truck 
driver from cement city i think he knew that i was helping 
him so swope said he wasnt afraid 
swope was visiting the zoo sunday with his wife cynthia and 
their three children 
we watched the chimpanzees for probably about half an hour or 
so and we were just getting ready to go when i heard a splash he 
said i just caught out of the corner of my eye this chimpanzee 
flying through the air 
everyone in the whole place was just standing around watching 
this monkey drown swope said monday when he went down the 
second time i knew i had to do something 
swope scaled the 4foot fence and plunged into the cold murky 
water he reached the chimpanzee and pulled it back to the island 
he was pretty lifeless swope said when i brought him out 
of there i wasnt sure he was still alive 
zoo officials are unsure why the 18yearold 135pound male 
chimpanzee jumped into the moat surrounding its 1acre island home 
said spokeswoman pat butkiewicz chimpanzees cannot swim and 
generally are afraid of water 
in april a week after the 75 million exhibit opened a 
20yearold female chimp drowned in the 5footdeep moat 
zoo director steve graham said the exhibit would be partially 
closed while the design of the moat was being reevaluated 
graham said swopes rescue was brave but reckless because 
chimps are three to five times stronger than humans a zoo employee 
was trying to use a pole to save the chimp when swope jumped in the 
water officials said 
swope who doesnt have any lifeguard or veterinary training 
said he kept one arm around the chimps stomach during the rescue 
i thought maybe i could pump some water out of him he said 
when he got his strength back i let him go 
swopes family each year visits the suburban detroit zoo about 
75 miles northwest of their home he said chimpanzee exhibit is one 
of his childrens favorites 
theyre happy it turned out the way it did too theyre glad 
i went in and got him he said they wouldnt expect anything

supreme court nominee david h souter returned 
to capitol hill today for private meetings with senators and 
sidestepped questions about news coverage seeking to discern his 
views on abortion 
theres nothing id wish to say souter replied when asked 
if he had any complaint about the media coverage thats not an 
endorsement he added 
he was questioned as abortion rights advocates were calling 
profoundly alarming what they say is the latest glimpse of 
souters possible views on abortion 
asked whether he would be spending much time in briefings with 
white house aides before his senate judiciary committee 
confirmation hearings begin sept 13 souter said i havent 
worked out a schedule 
souter commented while posing for photographers before he met 
privately with sen charles grassley riowa one of the 
committees staunchest abortion foes 
souter was to pay a similar courtesy call to another 
antiabortion committee member sen dennis deconcini dariz 
later in the day 
senators on both sides of the politically explosive issue say 
abortion will be discussed during the confirmation hearings 
the latest attempt to determine souters abortion views was made 
by the liberal people for the american way the group which 
supports abortion rights released copies monday of a 1976 brief in 
which the new hampshire attorney generals office headed by souter 
referred to abortion as the killing of unborn children 
in an earlier case argued in 1972 when souter was the states 
deputy attorney general new hampshire defended its strict 
antiabortion law against a constitutional challenge by arguing 
the maintenance of an unborn childs right to birth is a 
compelling interest which outweighs any rights of a mother to an 
abortion except when necessary to preserve her life 
richard v wiebusch whose signature appears on the 1976 brief 
as an assistant attorney general said today that souter wasnt 
involved in the preparation of the case 
i dont recall him looking at the language talking to me 
about the argument or approving any line of argument said 
wiebusch now a lawyer in private practice in manchester nh 
he said the brief did not represent anyones personal view on 
abortion but was the result of the obligation of the attorney 
generals office to defend regulations adopted by a state social 
services agency 
i chose the language wiebusch said it seemed to me to be 
the best way at the time to make the case he said he did not 
know souters opinions on abortion 
the us supreme court legalized abortion in its 1973 decision 
in roe vs wade 
the senate should ask judge souter to address himself to the 
1976 document said arthur kropp president of people for the 
american way he said the language suggests a clear sympathy for 
an antiabortion viewpoint 
kate michelman of the national abortion rights action league 
added judge souters use of rhetoric commonly used by 
antichoice extremists is profoundly alarming 
but rebecca hagelin of the antiabortion concerned women for 
america said the language used in the 1976 brief tells me 
absolutely nothing about how he is going to rule if given an 
opportunity to reassess roe vs wade 
this is an attempt by the opposition to create a lot of 
hoopla everyone seems to be grasping at straws she said as 
someone who is passionately prolife id love to know his views on 
this subject but it would be inappropriate to ask 
douglas johnson of the national right to life committee called 
the 1976 brief a very tenuous link to souter and his personal 
views johnson said souter is likely to answer judiciary 
committee questions in generalities and refuse to discuss specific 
cases that will come before the court 
abortion rights activists say such answers should be deemed 
unacceptable 
the 1976 brief submitted to the 1st us circuit court of 
appeals the court on which souter now serves argued that new 
hampshire was under no legal obligation to spend medicaid funds for 
abortions 
many thousands of new hampshire residents find the use of tax 
revenues to finance the killing of unborn children morally 
repugnant the brief contended 
the nations highest court in 1977 ruled that states have no 
legal obligation to pay for nontherapeutic abortions sought by 
women on welfare the court in 1980 upheld a ban on federal 
spending for most welfare abortions 
antiabortion groups expressed dismay last week when it was 
reported that souter served on the board of a new hampshire 
hospital and attended a meeting when it voted to allow abortions at 
the facility

the irish republican army today claimed 
responsibility for killing lawmaker ian gow a close friend of 
prime minister margaret thatcher and outspoken critic of the ira 
so long as britain controls northern ireland the ira said in a 
statement the ira will continue to strike whenever and wherever 
the opportunity arises 
gow 53 a conservative party lawmaker was killed monday 
morning when a bomb exploded under his car at his home in hankham 
southeast england the ira claim was made in a statement to press 
association britains domestic news agency 
rodney lind assistant chief constable of the sussex police 
told reporters today police were following up several leads based 
on tips from the public police recovered some components of the 
bomb and checks were being made at ports in the belief the 
guerrillas may have fled by ferry to the continent he said 
dressed in black mrs thatcher attended a service in memory of 
gow on monday night at the anglican parish church in the village of 
hankham 60 miles south of london where gow lived with his wife 
jane 
gow was chairman of the northern ireland committee in the house 
of commons the committee discusses the affairs of the province 
where the ira is fighting british rule but has no power over 
legislation 
however the ira statement noted that gow was a close personal 
associate of mrs thatcher it also noted that he was mrs 
thatchers personal parliamentary secretary and thus one of her 
closest advisers during her first four years in power from 1979 to 
1983 
gow was one of a small group of influential tories who in 
the late 1970s formulated the british policy pursued in ireland 
since the 1979 tory election victory the statement said 
gow was also a close friend of airey neave the conservative 
party spokesman on northern ireland who was killed by a car bomb in 
1979 the irish national liberational army an ira splinter group 
claimed responsibility for that attack 
the independent newspaper said today the assassination of ian 
gow may represent an attempt by the ira to cause personal hurt to 
margaret thatcher and goad her into overreacting to his death 
his symbolic importance lay in his close association with the prime 
minister 
the gow and thatcher families were close and often spent 
christmas together 
looking somber and shaken mrs thatcher told reporters in 
london before leaving for hankham that the slaying would make no 
difference to her conservative governments fight against terrorism 
mrs thatcher attended the church service at hankham with mrs 
gow the widows two sons ages 20 and 22 and friends of the 
family the group lit candles in gows memory 
jane gow said in an interview with the brighton argus that her 
husbands death will not diminish our resolve to be as strong as 
he was in fighting this terrible wickedness 
we want to share ians great courage in defying evil and 
terrorism she said in the interview published today 
scotland yards chief antiterrorist officer george 
churchillcoleman said gow had been warned he was on a list of 100 
lawmakers judges and civil servants found in an ira bomb factory 
in south london in december 1988 
gow resigned from mrs thatchers government in 1985 in protest 
over the angloirish agreement signed nov 15 of that year the 
accord gave the government of the republic of ireland which is 95 
percent roman catholic and lays constitutional claim to northern 
ireland a formal consultative role in the running of the province 
gow sided with the provinces protestant leaders in opposing the 
accord saying northern ireland should be governed like any other 
part of britain but he remained a staunch supporter of other 
government policies 
the mainly catholic ira wants to unite the province with the 
republic of ireland under socialist rule 
irish prime minister charles haughey joined british politicians 
in condemning the attack the fourth slaying of a member of 
parliament since sectarian and political fighting erupted in 
northern ireland in 1969 
the ira has claimed responsiblity for a series of bombings in 
england including one may 16 that killed sgt charles chapman at a 
army recruiting office 
other recent targets have included londons stock exchange the 
carlton club a traditional conservative party watering hole the 
stock exchange and a royal air force base in northwest london 
in washington the state department condemned the killing and 
offered condolences to gows family 
mrs thatcher narrowly escaped an ira bombing that killed five 
people at a hotel in brighton during the conservative partys 
annual conference in october 1984

the nations governors were ending their 
summer conference today hurling partisan charges of blame for the 
savings and loan crisis 
democratic governors meeting privately approved a resolution 
calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the widening 
crisis which is estimated to cost 300 billion or more in a 
taxpayers bailout 
a republican ad in the mobile register blamed congressional 
democrats for the sampl problems and provoked an angry response from 
ohio gov richard celeste chairman of the democratic governors 
he called the ad deceitful and the most outrageous 
distortion of the truth he blamed republicans for upsetting the 
normal spirit of bipartisanship at the governors conference and 
said the bush administration has failed to lead on the sampl crisis 
im surprised this is in the mobile paper while the national 
governors association is meeting celeste said 
the ad pictured 12 congressional democrats including resigned 
house speaker jim wright it was signed by the republican national 
committee in washington 
it said you wont see these democratic leaders around 
mobile and theyre the guys who let the sampl problem explode 
into a 325 billion national crisis 
democratic national chairman ron brown in mobile for the 
meeting said the ads were a sign of absolute panic by 
republicans over the sampl debacle 
a republican governor john mckernen of maine said democrats 
have been trying to use the sampl issue and republicans want to 
make sure people realize theres enough blame to go around 
the ad was an escalation in the growing partisan rancor over the 
sampl crisis as the fall elections approach another rnc ad ran a day 
earlier 
the ads apparently were provoked by a resolution pushed by 
democratic governors and subject to vote by governors of both 
parties calling for a national commission to investigate the sampl 
scandal the white house on monday said it rejected that suggestion 
the bipartisan national governors association was adjourning 
after a final session to consider resolutions to install washington 
state gov booth gardner a democrat as the new chairman and gov 
john ashcroft of missouri a republican as vice chairman 
in party caucuses democrats elected colorados roy romer and 
mississippis ray mabus chairman and vice chairman of their 
democratic governors association 
gardner said monday he planned to shift the governors 
associations focus to health care problems including cost 
containment and broader access to care for the poor during his 
oneyear term 
the arena is moving toward the states he said neither 
the administration nor congress wants to deal with it 
governors in both parties voiced concern about the growing size 
of the sampl bailout topping 300 billion by some estimates 
but the policy statement of concern approved by the 
associations executive committee and up for a vote today by the 
full association drew quick rejection from the white house and a 
republican charge of partisanship 
we do feel it is unnecessary to create another bureaucratic 
body stephen hart a deputy white house press secretary said in 
washington 
we think the best thing to do is to work quickly on the 
current caseload with the funds and the processes we now have in 
place which are working hart said we feel its not time to 
point fingers but its time to get the money thats owed to the 
depositors back in their hands 
the statement on sampls asks congress and the white house to 
establish a national commission to investigate the crisis it was 
pushed by virginias democratic gov douglas wilder who said the 
commission should find the failures behind the sampl crisis and a way 
to provide equitable recovery of taxpayers money 
republican gov carroll campbell of south carolina said 
democrats would find plenty of blame in their own back yard 
the governors also were voting on a new policy statement 
recommending a national education commission 
the panel including six governors four members of congress 
and four administration officials would assess how states and the 
federal government fare in meeting the governors goals for 
education reform 
governors in both parties were united in opposing an 
administration plan worked out with congressional republicans to 
raise federal revenue by limiting the federal tax deduction for 
state and local taxes 
democratic governors led by massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
planned to send bush a letter strongly urging him to drop that 
plan they said it would encroach on state tax bases and penalize 
the very states that raised taxes on upperincome people to pay for 
services and balance their own budgets

a decrepit soviet truck 
lurches down the highway to vietnam bearing claygrimed wreckage of 
a us aircraft 
the export of war scrap is an everyday scene in eastern laos 
bringing cash to impoverished villagers but widespread scavenging 
of aircraft crash sites is hindering us efforts to account for 
americans missing from the indochina war 
us planes flew hundreds of thousands of bombing sorties 
against communist targets in laos between 1965 and 1973 and some 
never made it back to home base 
their crews make up most of the 533 us servicemen still listed 
as missing in action in the country 
the united states began ground searches for the mias in 1983 
and washington recently has issued upbeat statements telling of 
improving cooperation with the laotian government 
but progress remains slow partly because of the difficulty in 
coordinating searches with understaffed laotian ministries so far 
just 36 sets of remains have been identified and repatriated 
vital evidence that would help identify crash sites is being 
carted away for sale and its not just aircraft scrap but human 
remains too 
still washington have faced fewer problems cooperating with the 
government in laos the only indochinese country with which it has 
diplomatic relations than in cambodia and vietnam 
the first six sets of suspected mia remains were returned from 
cambodia last week a total of 1678 americans are missing in 
vietnam 83 in cambodia while six are missing over chinas coastal 
waters 
in 1987 a group of private us citizens and republican 
congressmen began distributing leaflets in laos offering a 24 
million reward for the return of any live american prisoner 
the offer has done irreparable harm to search efforts us 
officials say 
they say they have been swamped by sightings of live missing 
americans mostly by laotian refugees who want to resettle abroad 
more than 17000 interviews have not yielded a single credible case 
people figure that if someone is offering so much money for a 
live american they are also willing to pay for bones a us 
official said 
even though us policy does not sanction financial rewards for 
mia remains a slick cottage industry has grown up turning out 
bones and bogus dog tag military identifications these are offered 
to us searchers through middlemen in neighboring thailand 
some people were even willing to dig up their mothers 
grave said one american expert who did not want to be identified 
a genuine american skeleton might be split up into several sets 
of remains in the hope of more rewards and that reduces the 
chances of identifying the remains a us official said 
provincial officials say they are willing to support fully us 
efforts to find their missing but even they admit there is a 
tradeoff 
many planes came down here people know where they are said 
lahoun maprayvong an district official in the heavilybombed 
southeastern province of savannakhet 
washington must do more to rebuild what the bombing destroyed 
he said 
it is according to the agreement if they want to know where 
the bones are the local people need help he said we need 
hospitals and schools the united states gives some assistance to 
the laotian government in return for mia cooperation but in june 
richard solomon secretary of state for asian affairs admitted 
that washington had been unable to address laotians 
humanitarian concerns in a meaningful way 
lahoun says some villagers are unwilling to reveal crash sites 
he says its because they have bad memories of the bombing but 
theres money to be made from the gleaning of us crash sites 
and that can make a difference in rural areas where annual per 
capita income is below 170 
villagers and traders have systematically stripped many crash 
sites of anything of value this includes many key aircraft parts 
bearing serial numbers that would help identify its crew 
aircraft aluminum is recycled into buckets cooking pots 
spoons traditional jewelry even river canoes 
traders say the topquality metal fetches high prices abroad it 
is trucked to vietnam and thailand with some sent on to japan and 
beyond 
but the trade is slowing down one by one crash sites are 
denuded some sites have only a few fragments of metal and bone 
left only in the most remote regions are there undisturbed sites 
us officials say 
they hope easing cold war tensions and gradually improving 
relations with communist indochina will improve access and allow 
more widespread searches

one of three former northwest airlines pilots 
accused of flying while intoxicated had a higher tolerance for 
alcohol because he is an alcoholic his lawyer said today 
in an opening statement at the pilots trial attorney peter 
wold said capt norman prouse has been an alcoholic for many years 
but he said prouse performed flawlessly during a march 8 flight 
from fargo nd to minneapolis 
being an alcoholic does not mean you are under the influence 
of alcohol all the time wold said a person who consumes 
alcohol builds up a tolerance 
wold and william mauzy the attorney for 1st officer robert 
kirchner said they would prove their clients were not impaired 
during the earlymorning flight by the alcohol they consumed the 
previous night 
mauzy told the federal court jury to concentrate on the smooth 
operation of the 91passenger flight instead of on the pilots 
drinking the night before and the results of bloodalcohol tests 
taken after the flight 
kirchner of highland ranch colo piloted the boeing 727 the 
plane carrying 91 passengers left as scheduled at 625 am less 
than seven hours after kirchner prouse of conyers ga and flight 
engineer joseph balzer of antioch tenn were seen drinking at a 
lounge in moorhead 
balzers lawyer was to make an opening statement later in the 
day 
in her opening prosecution statement assistant us attorney 
elizabeth de la vega said that there would be much evidence about 
heavy drinking the night before the flight she said witnesses will 
testify that there was tension between the pilots and some bar 
patrons that threatened to erupt into violence 
de la vega said bloodalcohol tests taken after the flight 
showed that prouse still had an equivalent of eight drinks in his 
system while the plane was in the air and that kirchner and balzer 
had the equivalent of three beers each still in their systems 
all three defendants were in fact under the influence of 
alcohol when they were operating flight 650 that morning she 
said 
a bar patron tipped the federal aviation administration and 
northwest that the crew was quite intoxicated and might be 
piloting an earlymorning flight according to court records 
an faa investigator has testified the pilots were late reporting 
to the departure gate and that they smelled of alcohol while he 
was phoning for instructions on how to handle the situation the 
plane departed 
when it arrived at the minneapolisst paul international 
airport an faa official made a citizens arrest of the trio 
us district court judge james rosenbaum has said the trial is 
expected to last about two weeks

netherlands this week for distribution among homosexuals in the 
soviet union 
the free eightpage russianlanguage publication contains news

in large packages others in letters addressed to individuals 
several gay soviet soldiers stationed in east germany have 
offered to help distribute the journal krol said 
krol conceded that many copies are likely to be confiscated by 
soviet authorities

homosexuals in the soviet union where homosexual relations carry a 
maximum prison term of fiveyears 
we hope this will contribute toward the setting up of a gay 
movement in the soviet union similar to those in hungary poland 
and the gdr east germany krol said

times change and so should toilets one school 
board in tokyo has said 
but board officials in edogawa ward trying to phaseout 
japanesestyle squat toilets in public schools have met 
opposition from parents and teachers who believe the westernstyle 
sitdown version is unclean 
it would stand to reason that millions of westerners cant be 
wrong but edogawa school board official maoto mori said tuesday 
that while most japanese use western toilets at home many would 
prefer not to use them elsewhere 
the problem is that you actually place your bottom directly 
on a westernstyle toilet mori said some people especially 
women have said they just arent comfortable using such toilets in 
public 
but mori says there is nothing to worry about concerns about 
sanitation are completely unnecessary 
to assure comfort for all mori said the board has suggested 
that for every seven toilets in each school five be western and 
two japanese three schools in the ward will remodel their 
lavatories this year he said 
one does not sit on or in any other way come in contact with a 
japanesestyle toilet which is a porcelained hole in the floor 
many japanese even refuse to touch the flush lever of public 
toilets with their hands using their feet instead 
the edogawa school board has decided to remove japanesestyle 
toilets in elementary and junior high schools because of growing 
popularity of the western toilet in private homes 
according to estimates made by toto japans main toilet maker 
80 percent of all toilets in japan and nearly 100 percent of all 
household commodes are westernstyle 
mori said opposition to the plan has not been that great 
but the school toilet dilemma warranted topofthepage 
treatment tuesday in the domestic news section of asahi shimbun a 
leading national newspaper 
under the headline teachers say wait to western toilets 
was a cartoon depicting two smiling youngsters one foreign and one 
japanese using the contending varieties 
the accompanying article quoted a teacher in one edogawa 
elementary school as complaining that though the japanesestyle 
commodes only needed to be cleaned once a week that wont be 
enough for the western model 
it said the education ministry has set no national guidelines 
regarding which kind of toilet schools should use 
a school board official in koto ward edogawas neighbor said 
schools there were sticking to their japanese facilities although 
schools have one westernstyle toilet on each floor 
he said japanese toilets are better because they are easier to 
clean and generally preferred by women 
japanese toilets also tend to make for shorter visits perhaps 
also a plus in the eyes of japans often disciplinarian school

kuwaiti and iraqi delegations met 
today to negotiate a bitter oil and border dispute diplomats said 
iraq had massed 100000 troops on kuwaits border more than triple 
the number originally estimated 
the reported iraqi troop buildup including hundreds of tanks 
and armored personnel carriers dwarfs the kuwaiti army which has 
a total of about 20000 troops 
persian gulfbased diplomats who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the troops have been concentrated along the border 
since last week when iraq began threatening kuwait and accusing 
the small persian gluf state of stealing oil and conspiring with 
the united states but they said the number of troops was at first 
difficult to determine 
delegates from the feuding countries first met in the presence 
of saudi king fahd and crown prince abdullah later the delegation 
leaders met privately kuwait was represented by its prime 
minister sheik saad alabdullah alsabah and iraq by izzat 
ibrahim deputy chairman of its revolutionary command council 
the media were barred from the meetings and no details were 
released 
the iraqkuwait dispute broke out on july 17 when iraqi 
president saddam hussein accused kuwait and the united arab 
emirates of driving down oil prices by producing far above the 
quota set for them by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries saddam said the quota violations had cost his country 
14 billion because of low oil prices 
iraq also demanded compensation for 24 billion worth of oil it 
claimed kuwait stole from the rumailah oil field which straddles 
the border between the two nations iraq also said kuwait should 
forgive some 15 billion in loans it extended to baghdad during the 
eightyear iraniraq war that ended in 1988 
saddams tough talk and show of force helped win his country 
and other price hawks at opecs meeting last week an agreement to 
raise oil prices from 18 to 21 a barrel as well as pledges that 
kuwait and other quota violators would reduce their production 
kuwaiti and iraqi officials agreed to meet in jiddah after 
intensive mediation efforts by king fahd and egyptian president 
hosni mubarak 
kuwaiti leaders had insisted that iraq pull back its troops 
before conciliation talks could began but later dropped its demand 
kuwaiti officials are also asking that iraq agree to demarcate 
the disputed border between the nations a move iraq has refused 
iraq has historically laid claim to all of kuwait and has long 
coveted the kuwaiti islands of bubiyan and warba which command 
access to southern iraqi ports 
diplomatic sources have said they expected arab mediators to 
persuade the two sides to sign a treaty of nonbelligerency as a 
first step to protracted negotiations on borders and compensation 
in kuwait newspapers expressed hope that the jiddah meeting 
would lead to a final just settlement of the iraqkuwait 
dispute in a manner ensuring the legitimate rights of each of the 
two countries 
baghdad papers adopted a harsher line stressing that the jiddah 
meeting was an opportunity for kuwait to perceive iraqs demands 
and respond to its rights

rembrandt will get his first 
oneman international show next year when 130 of the 17th century 
dutch masters works will tour berlin amsterdam and london 
organizers said tuesday 
although rembrandts paintings have been on tour before the 
septembermay show will be the first touring exhibition devoted 
exclusively to the greatest artist of the netherlands golden age 
organizers said 
as far as i know there has never been a traveling exhibition 
on rembrandt before said uwe wieczorek of berlins 
gemaeldegalerie which is putting together the tour together with 
berlins kupferstichkabinett amsterdams rijksmuseum and londons 
national gallery 
the rijksmuseum held the largest previous exhibition of 
rembrandts works in 1969 with about 20 works on display 
the announcement of next years tour comes on the heels of a 
major exhibit of the works of the 19th century dutch impressionist 
vincent van gogh 
the fourmonth van gogh exhibit which ended sunday drew more 
than 12 million visitors to amsterdams van gogh museum and the 
kroellermueller museum in the eastern dutch city of otterlo 
wieczorek said the plan of the exhibition is to show paintings 
once attributed to rembrandt that are now being attributed to his 
pupils and compare them to paintings which we are absolutely sure 
were rembrandts 
he added that the rembrandt exhibition will mark the end of two 
decades of research into the masters works by art experts 
that research is expected to show that half of the existing 400 
paintings thought to be done by rembrandt were actually painted by 
others wieczorek said 
the exposition will display 50 paintings 40 drawings and 40 
etchings by rembrandt and 45 or so works by his pupils 
among the paintings to be displayed are woman bathing 
jeremiah lamenting the destruction of jerusalem and the 
mennonite preacher anslo and his wife 
rembrandt who lived from 1606 to 1669 is considered the 
greatest of the dutch old masters who flourished in the 17th 
century 
his style is famous for its masterful contrast of light and 
darkness

a house armed services panel today slashed 
nearly 2 billion from president bushs fiscal 1991 budget request 
for the strategic defense initiative lawmakers said 
in a closeddoor session the subcommittee on research and 
development approved spending 29 billion on the antimissile 
shield commonly known as star wars bush had sought 47 billion 
for sdi in the military budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
the full armed services committee was meeting later in the day 
to put the finishing touches on its 283 billion defense bill a 
reduction of 24 billion from the presidents original request in 
january 
the research subcommittee also eliminated 548 million bush 
sought for the mx nuclear missile on railroad cars and 202 million 
in research money for the midgetman missile 
instead the panel set up an advanced strategic missile pot of 
more than 600 million for development of the next generation of 
nuclear missiles the subcommittee also called on bush to make a 
recommendation in 90 days for one new missile 
the full armed services committee is expected to approve the 
actions of the research and development subcommittee which 
overwhelmingly adopted its portion of the defense bill by a vote of 
174 
following the lead of the procurement subcommittee which on 
monday night eliminated all funds bush sought for the b2 stealth 
bomber the research subcommittee approved enough funds to complete 
the program at the 15 planes under development 
in addition the research panel approved 238 million for the 
v22 osprey the tiltrotor aircraft that defense secretary dick 
cheney wants to cancel the procurement subcommittee had added 165 
million for the aircraft which takes off like a helicopter but can 
fly like a plane 
its exactly where we want it to be said rep curt weldon 
rpa a supporter of the v22 osprey which is manufactured in his 
district 
the congressman said the house armed services actions set the 
stage for bargaining with the bush administration and the senate on 
saving the aircraft from the budget ax 
following the lead of its chairman rep les aspin dwis the 
panel on procurement and military nuclear systems adopted a plan 
monday to remove the money the pentagon requested to buy two 
stealth aircraft 
to meet the houseapproved level for military spending in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 the procurement subcommittee had to 
slash 11 billion from bushs overall request of 73 billion 
among the major subcommittee cuts were 13 billion for a 
program to move the mx nuclear missile from fixed silos to rail 
cars a 12 billion reduction in the classified request for the 
navys a12 attack plane and costly restrictions on the c17 
transport plane 
the panel requires cheney to certify that the first successful 
flight of the c17 has occurred after that certification the air 
force may seek to reprogram funds to buy two aircraft 
the administration had requested 21 billion for the two planes 
and related items 
the panel eliminated the 13 billion bush sought for the amraam 
missile 
it was the costly and controversial b2 bomber however that 
suffered the deepest cut 
support for the radarevading aircraft has eroded in congress 
where lawmakers have criticized the cost of a single plane nearly 
865 million in a climate of fiscal constraint and a lessening 
soviet threat to the west 
aspin dealt a serious blow to the program last week when he 
announced his support for legislation that would end production of 
the aircraft which is manufactured by the northrop corp at the 
15 planes under development 
the chairmans decision came despite cheneys revised program 
which calls for a total of 75 of the aircraft instead of 132 with 
two of the planes being finished in fiscal 1991 rather than five 
the aircraft still has support in the senate where the armed 
services panel approved the administrations request bipartisan 
efforts are expected however to kill the program when the full 
senate takes up the defense bill later this week

the senates democratic majority turned back a 
republican attempt today to reduce the political clout of unions in 
presidential and congressional elections 
by a 5941 vote the senate rejected a proposal to allow the 
nations 17 million union members to demand a refund of any dues 
their unions spend on political activities 
if you dont do anything about this sewer money from unions i 
dont think you have campaign reform said sen orrin hatch 
rutah ninety percent goes to democrats even though 30 percent 
to 40 percent of union members are republicans 
the senate defeated a similar gopsponsored plan by a 6335 vote 
in may rejecting a proposed amendment a bill easing restrictions 
on federal employees political activities 
that bill was subsequently vetoed by bush and the senate 
sustained his veto 
today four republicans sens alfonse damato of new york mark 
hatfield of oregon james jeffords of vermont and ted stevens of 
alaska joined all 55 democrats to defeat an amendment to a 
campaign finance reform bill 
bush said a year ago congress should expand a 1988 supreme court 
ruling to give workers a right to seek a refund of their dues spent 
by unions on politics 
no american not one should be compelled to give money to a 
candidate against his or her will he said 
on monday democrats overrode unanimous republican opposition to 
a provision in the bill that would provide 20 million in public 
financing to senate candidates every two years to buy television 
advertising time 
the supreme court ruled in the 1988 case that a bell system 
technician who paid fees to the communications workers of america 
as party of an agency shop contract with atampt but was not a member 
of the union was entitled to a refund of the portion not spent 
directly on collective bargaining 
hatchs amendment today would have extended that right to union 
members as well as nonmembers covered by collective bargaining 
agreements 
hatch said most union members do not know that their leaders are 
spending up to 150 million of their dues every two years on 
political activities such as voter registration 
with a bipartisan compromise on campaign finance reform out of 
reach for now republicans appeared content to let democrats have 
their way in the knowledge that president bush will veto it 
we are faced with a bill that everyone knows isnt going 
anywhere since its a spendinglimits bill that president bush 
simply will not sign said senate gop leader bob dole of kansas 
sen david boren of oklahoma the chief author of the democratic 
measure acknowledged the bill will never become law without 
support from bush and congressional republicans but he expressed 
hopes the two sides will sit down in september to strike a deal 
once the house has passed its version 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said he hoped to bring two 
democratic proposals and a republican alternative up for votes 
before the house begins a fiveweek recess on friday democratic 
sources however expressed doubts it could be fitted into this 
weeks schedule 
house republicans accused democrats in that chamber of cynically 
writing a bill that would establish spending ceilings but also 
preserve corporate union and trade association pacs in the face of 
a certain veto by bush 
this is a joke said house gop whip newt gingrich of 
georgia all the reform groups in the country are going to be 
enraged at them so they want to get it over with take their 
beating and go home 
in contrast to an abolition of pacs first proposed by bush and 
republicans in the senate and now reluctantly also endorsed by 
senate democrats both parties bills in the house would retain 
pacs 
house republicans would reduce the contributions a single pac 
can make to any one candidate from the currently allowed 10000 to 
2000 for both primary and general elections 
both democratic proposals in the house would establish a 
spending ceiling of 550000 on house races one would limit pac 
contributions to half that amount and the other would limit them to 
40 percent but with up to 100000 in public financing for each 
qualifying candidate 
reform groups considered a litmus test the senates vote monday 
to provide party nominees for the senate from 180000 to 11 
million each in government vouchers to buy broadcasting time if 
they abide by spending limits 
its a backdoor attack on spending limits and a test vote to 
see where they stand said joan claybrook president of public 
citizen which supports taxpayer financing of election campaigns 
all 44 republicans present voted for the amendment by mcconnell 
the leading opponent of the democratic plan to strike from it what 
it called a food stamp voucher for politicians two democrats 
howell heflin of alabama and j james exon of nebraska both 
longtime opponents of public financing also supported mcconnells 
amendment 
in addition to the public financing of tv ads the democratic 
bill provides discount mail subsidies to candidates abiding by the 
spending limits as well as funds to counter broadcast ads by 
independent groups costing over 10000 
additional public financing would also be provided to candidates 
whose opponents exceed the voluntary spending ceilings 
mcconnells amendment would have eliminated all those potential 
public sources of money in the democratic bill underneath the 
hood its the same old lemon running on taxpayer financing and 
spending limits he said 
the democraticproposed spending limits on senate races based 
on the size of a states votingage population range from 
slightly under 2 million in lesspopulous states such as nevada 
montana and north dakota to 103 million in the largest state 
california

testimony in the federal court challenge to 
pennsylvanias restrictive abortion law today took aim at a 
provision requiring women to notify their husbands before getting 
abortions 
attorneys for a group of doctors and abortion clinics seeking to 
overturn key sections of the law tried to show that battered women 
would not take advantage of exemptions in the law from the 
notification requirement 
psychologist lenore walker testified that battered women are 
very reluctant to talk about physical or emotional abuse because 
that forces them to relive the painful experience 
as for the requirement that husbands be notified of abortions 
forcing a battered woman to notify her husband is like giving him 
a hammer to beat her she said 
under the law women would have to sign a statement for their 
doctor certifying that they had informed their husband or that 
they had not because they feared bodily harm if they did so 
because the husband was not the father because the pregnancy 
resulted from spousal rape or because the woman could not locate 
the husband after diligent effort 
the only exception for the requirement of a signed statement 
would be in the case of a medical emergency 
ms walker also criticized a section of the law that requires a 
24hour waiting period for an abortion ms walker said forcing an 
abused woman to wait 24 hours before obtaining an abortion would be 
detrimental 
the case which opened monday is being watched by activists on 
both sides of the abortion debate because of its potential to 
present a challenge to roe vs wade the 1973 ruling that 
established the right to an abortion 
the lawsuit argues that the abortion controls passed by the 
legislature in 1988 and 1989 infringe on the rights of women 
the measures require a woman to notify her husband before 
obtaining an abortion and wait 24 hours between visiting a clinic 
and receiving an abortion doctors must offer counseling to women 
seeking abortions and minors must get the consent of one parent or 
a court order to receive an abortion 
portions of the law have been blocked by the federal court 
pending a ruling on the lawsuit 
only guam a us territory in the pacific has adopted more 
stringent controls 
us district judge daniel h huyett iii is not expected to rule 
until the fall and whatever the outcome appeals are likely 
kathryn kolbert an american civil liberties union attorney for 
the plaintiffs testified monday the law erodes privacy rights 
established under roe 
this act puts government in the operating room and at the 
kitchen table with women making decisions on abortion she said 
it questions the ability of women to make independent decisions 
other witnesses characterized the law as studded with provisions 
that might not be in the best interest of the patients health 
senior deputy attorney general kate l mershimer representing 
the state predicted the restrictions would be upheld we think 
we have the evidence in the current supreme court cases to uphold 
the statute ms mershimer said 
some sections of the law are similar to those ruled 
unconstitutional by the us supreme court in a 1986 pennsylvania 
case 
the states 1988 law was largely an attempt to redraft many of 
the voided provisions the 1989 law was passed after the supreme 
court in a missouri case gave states greater leeway to restrict 
abortion

allowing the nazis to form a new government

toured cambodia last week with representatives of operation usa

the proposed transitional government recognized by the united 
nations included the khmer rouge which killed hundreds of 
thousands of people during its 1975 to 1978 reign vietnam 
installed the current communist government after invading in late 
1978

the white house expressed frustration with 
stalled budget talks and prodded democrats today to come up with 
their own plan to reduce the 169 billion federal deficit 
an agreement was made to simultaneously table proposals we 
are ready they are not deputy white house press secretary alixe 
glen said after president bushs latest round of talks with the 
leaders of congress thats where the level of frustration is 
coming in 
once the democrats put a package on the table we can continue 
to move forward probably at a faster pace she said 
i dont think anybody sandbagged anybody rep richard 
gephardt dmo the house majority leader said after the 
hourlong oval office meeting 
gephardt said he did not think there was any reneging on the 
democrats part about putting proposals on the table simultaneously 
gephardt added there may have been some miscommunication 
about what was supposed to happen 
its safe to assume that everyone is frustrated weve 
been at this for 83 days ms glen told reporters i think all 
sides would have hopes that we would have been a little farther 
along by this point 
gephardt said the two sides will decide in the next few days 
whether to keep negotiating into august or wait until september to 
put their plans for slashing spending on the table 
if they decide to go ahead now gephardt said it could mean 
keeping congress in session or calling the lawmakers back from 
vacation to ratify a deal 
todays meeting took place against the backdrop of complaints 
from gop leaders upset with democrats for failing to propose a 
deficitcutting plan details of republicanfavored tax increases 
began filtering out of the talks last week 
the question is when is the best time to try to put together 
the final disagreements to bridge them and then to put a deal 
before the american people and congress said gephardt there 
are good arguments on both sides for august and there are other 
arguments for september it will be decided in the next few days 
if the negotiators wait until september it will allow bush and 
the lawmakers to take their summer vacations without embracing 
controversial packages of spending cuts and revenue increases 
but pushing the showdown into september would bring the summit 
negotiators closer to the grammrudman deadline of oct 1 when 
automatic cuts would be inflicted on most federal programs if bush 
and the lawmakers fail to produce their own agreement 
gephardt said the negotiations now in their 12th week have 
accomplished quite a lot including the basic agreement to 
reduce the deficit by 50 billion in the first year and 500 
billion over five years 
in the aftermath of news reports revealing higher taxes and 
other unpopular elements of an administration budget plan gop 
leaders spent an hour with bush on monday discussing what their 
next step should be 
i dont think the president has been nearly tough enough on 
the democrats rep bill frenzel rminn told reporters after 
mondays session all the republicans advised him it was time to 
call their hand 
congressional democrats said they feel little pressure to 
quickly present a deficitcutting plan to republican budget 
negotiators 
plans put forward by leaks never cause response requirements 
on the other side of the negotiations said house speaker thomas 
s foley dwash 
the gop leaders said that among the options they discussed was 
having bush call a special session to keep congress in town in 
august and force lawmakers to work out a budget deal 
keep them here and turn the air conditioning off said rep 
silvio conte rmass 
canceling the cherished annual summer recess however would 
anger many members of congress some leaders acknowledged 
the president doesnt want to alienate members when he wants 
to work with congress said house minority leader robert michel 
rill 
the administration plan includes higher taxes on alcohol and a 
limit on the federal tax deductibility of state and local income 
taxes 
congress monthlong recess is set to begin over the next two 
weeks fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 the talks began may 15

the failure of secretary of state 
james a baker iii to forge an agreement with southeast asian 
nations on the fate of boat people leaves the refugees in danger of 
being pushed back out to sea 
baker ended a fiveday tour of southeast asia on tuesday 
leaving singapore for the soviet union for meetings with his soviet 
counterpart eduard a shevardnadze 
while baker was in southeast asia both sides had hoped a 
solution would be found for the 130000 boat people mostly from 
vietnam and cambodia in refugee camps in the region southeast 
asian officials say about 80 percent are nonpolitical refugees and 
should be repatriated 
the united states and vietnam have refused to sanction the 
compulsory return of refugees who flee their homeland for economic 
reasons rather than political persecution 
shortly before baker arrived the association of southeast asian 
nations comprising malaysia thailand singapore indonesia the 
philippines and brunei declared their right to refuse temporary 
refuge to boat people 
malaysia has taken the lead pushing off more than 8700 people 
in the past year according to refugee workers 
at the associations annual meeting baker sought compromise but 
issued a veiled warning going it alone he said in an apparent 
reference to malaysia would leave the nations of this region to 
reap a whirlwind of humanity without international support 
baker however agreed to create a new category for refugees who 
do not object to being sent home he also offered to join with 
others in a new best effort to resettle or return all asylum 
seekers by the end of 1992 
boat people in the new category would qualify for repatriation 
after specified review procedures were completed and other 
conditions met us officials said 
we appreciate these moves but we in asean think they dont 
yet go far enough indonesia foreign minister ali alatas said 
referring to the southeast asian association 
in danger of collapse is the comprehensive plan of action signed 
in geneva by 35 nations in june 1989 
that stipulates southeast asian countries should continue to 
provide shelter for all who arrive but boat people would no longer 
automatically qualify for refugee status 
instead refugees would be screened to determine whether they 
had a justifiable fear of political persecution or were simply 
seeking a better life in the west economic migrants would be sent 
back home 
in an attempt to break the stalemate the european community has 
offered financial incentives designed to encourage more voluntary 
repatriation and ease the burden of maintaining boat people in 
southeast asian camps 
the offer has been wellreceived said abel matutes ec 
commissioner of northsouth affairs and more details on the offer 
were to be given to the un high commissioner for refugees by 
october it was not immediately clear when the offer was made

after a threeweek suspension caused by an attack on a convoy 
appolo lawoko an employee of the world food program said seven 
trucks loaded with 210 tons of corn headed for the arid karamonja 
region under a military escort 
the world food program stopped deliveries july 7 after 
unidentified gunmen killed a driver and seriously wounded two 
people loading the trucks 
only 1173 of the 5000 tons of grain the agency earmarked for 
karamonja this year had been delivered when the attack occurred 
relief officials in kampala say an estimated 220000 people in 
the region are threatened with famine caused by a severe drought 
in 1980 starvation caused by a similar drought killed thousands 
of mainly nomadic people in karamonja which borders kenya in the 
east and sudan in the north 
the region is also home to remnants of insurgent groups who took 
up arms against president yoweri museveni after he seized power in

the nations murder toll is headed toward a 
record high this year with an 8 percent expected increase in the 
number of slayings that is attributable mainly to drugrelated 
crime the senate was told today 
if this pace continues and there is every reason to believe 
it will 1990 will be the bloodiest year in american history 
said senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden ddel 
the committee issued a forecast of 23220 murders in america 
this year at the present rate that is 2000 or 8 percent over the 
1989 toll the total would also top the previous record high of 
23040 murders in 1980 
scarce supplies of cocaine in the nations major cities have 
contributed to the carnage causing drug pushers to fight each 
other for turf the committee said 
it also blamed the proliferation of assault rifles these 
firearms have become the weapons of choice for drug dealers and the 
weapons of doom for law enforcement personnel said a report 
prepared by the panel it said a third cause is a fresh wave of 
teenagers the offspring of the socalled baby boomers entering 
the highcrime years 
the projected toll would make 1990 the third straight year of 
increasing murders in the united states

sales of new homes surged 8 percent in june 
the sharpest increase since november the government said tuesday 
in a report that many analysts said indicates the sluggish housing 
industry has bottomed out 
we believe that the second quarter was the low point said 
david seiders chief economist for the national association of home 
builders he and other analysts said they expected continued but 
subdued growth in both new and existing singlefamily markets for 
the remainder of the year 
the commerce department said new home sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 581000 units after posting a revised 23 
percent gain in may may sales first were reported last month to 
have risen just 04 percent the first advance in five months 
despite the increase in june new homes sales for the first six 
months of 1990 have fallen 97 percent below sales of the first 
half of 1989 when they totaled 340000 units 
the june increase was the sharpest since a similar 8 percent 
gain in november analysts attributed the increase to lower 
mortgage rates which they said should spur renewed interest in 
home sales for the remainder of the year 
we expect mortgage rates to trend downward in the weeks ahead 
which should boost sales of new homes as well as existing homes 
said john a tuccillo chief economist for the national association 
of realtors 
the realtors reported last week that sales of existing homes 
rose 12 percent in june to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
334 million units it was the first increase since a 32 percent 
gain in november 
the average rate for 30year conventional fixedrate mortgages 
ranged from 1029 percent to 1010 percent in june according to 
surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp the rate had 
dropped to 998 percent by last friday 
nevertheless mark obrinksy an economist with the federal 
national mortgage association and other analysts said they did not 
expect rates to fall much farther and they predict only a gradual 
increase in future sales 
in addition to the psychological factor of singledigit 
rates richard peach deputy chief economist with the mortgage 
bankers of america said favorable weather also enticed buyers in 
june 
we had a very soggy april and may particularly in the eastern 
part of the country peach said when its cold and damp 
people dont like to go out and shop around for new houses 
sales in the northeast which have been sluggish for more than a 
year jumped 36 percent to an annual rate of 102000 units sales 
also rose in the south up 136 percent to an annual rate of 
243000 units 
but they dropped elsewhere down 58 percent to an annual rate 
of 146000 units in the west and off 43 percent to an annual rate 
of 90000 units in the midwest 
the commerce department said the median price of a new home rose 
16 percent to 129900 the median income means half of the homes 
cost more and half less the average price advanced 21 percent to 
152900

a federal committee today approved historys 
first use of gene therapy to treat fatal diseases 
the recombinant dna advisory committee of the national 
institutes of health approved two procedures in which foreign genes 
will be inserted into the cells of patients who have one of two 
fatal diseases 
the therapies are for treatment of patients with a malignant 
skin cancer and for children with an inherited immune system 
deficiency 
this is an historic decision said gerard j mcgarrity the 
chairman of the committee what we have done today is add gene 
therapy to vaccines antibiotics and radiation in the medical 
arsenal 
medicine has been waiting thousands of years for this said 
mcgarrity the president of the coriell institute for medical 
research in new jersey 
the cancer therapy will involve putting a gene that causes cells 
to produce a protein called tumor necrosis factor into special 
white blood cells these cells will then be injected into the 
patient and the tumor necrosis factor will attack the skin cancer 
tumors 
the immune disease treatment calls for placing a gene into white 
blood cells of patients who are born without this gene the gene in 
a normal person produces an essential enzyme for the development of 
the immune system children born without this gene have virtually 
no immune system or bodily defense against disease 
the most famous patient with this immunity disorder was a boy in 
houston known only as david who spent his whole life in a plastic 
bubble 
mcgarrity said that the 17member committee voted unanimously 
for the cancer therapy and had only one dissenting vote for the 
immunity disorder therapy 
gene therapy has been controversial and a number of groups have 
resisted its implementation but the vote today met almost no 
objections from people attending the open meeting 
some groups fear that gene therapy could be used to manipulate 
normal human development and create genetic abnormalities 
dr french anderson director of the immune deficiency treatment 
program said that abuses of this technique are guarded against by 
a torturous pathway to approval he said it has taken more than 
three years and presentations to more than a dozen committees and 
hearings for the therapy to be approved 
despite difficulties anderson said the therapy is so powerful 
that it could be abused and there needs to be firm safeguards in 
place

the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but their 
rights have been blown away and for what

the coast guard said 500000 gallons of 
oil leaked into galveston bay from two barges 10 times its 
original estimate and some oil floated ashore from a slick up to 
15 miles long 
none of the oil had yet touched environmentally sensitive 
marshes the coast guard said state officials talked with the 
coast guard today about using oileating bacteria on the heavy 
crude 
skimmer ships and floating booms were sent to the area some 
streamers of oil had reached the gulf of mexico the coast guard 
said 
the barges carrying a total of 168 million gallons of heavy 
refinery oil collided saturday with the greekregistered tanker 
shinoussa while being towed by a tug through the bay the tanker 
while damaged did not leak any of its 24900 metric tons of jet 
fuel 
some of the oil had reached the texas city dike and pelican 
island and redfish island peninsulas in galveston bay this 
morning the coast guard said after officials flew over this site 
those areas arent heavily populated with wildlife coast 
guard chief petty officer todd nelson said today there are other 
areas in galveston bay where theres a lot of wildlife and were 
still concerned about those areas 
the spill already has killed fish around redfish island and 
officials were worried about its impact on wildlife in marshes and 
bogs in the area no oilcovered birds had been found yet 
any way that spill heads it is going toward wetlands and 
estuaries with unique species of herons egrets wading birds and 
nesting birds and it is very probable that we are going to have 
impact on them soon nelson said monday 
environmentalists criticized the cleanup effort saying 
emergency officials wasted precious time getting skimmers and oil 
booms to the site 
were not happy with that either nelson said today were 
also not happy that it took two days to get skimmers on site 
either 
he blamed the delay on problems getting permission for skimmers 
from the clean gulf coop an organization of gulf shippers since 
the barge does not belong to the coop 
texas water commission chairman buck wynne and blanton moore a 
representative of state land commissioner garry mauro met with the 
coast guard today for permission to put oileating microbes on the 
spill 
mauro said the microbes were successfully tested on a spill 
after the june 8 explosion on the mega borg almost 4 million 
gallons of light crude spilled into the gulf from the stricken 
norwegian supertanker 
the revised estimate of the size of the latest spill came after 
crews monday finished removing oil from a listing barge pushed it 
aground and determined how much oil was left in a second barge 
partly submerged in the channel 
the second barge stopped leaking monday evening about 50 hours 
after the collision they said officials estimated 48000 gallons 
of oil leaked from the listing barge meaning most of the oil came 
from the nearly sunken vessel 
divers today placed cable slings around the barge which was 
sitting on a ledge nelson said the sling operation had to be 
handled carefully because a mistake could send the barge toppling 
into the 40footdeep shipping channel and more oil could spill 
thousands of feet of collection booms surrounded that barge 
any spill over 100000 gallons is considered major said the 
coast guard which originally estimated 50000 gallons had spilled 
the spill forced the closing of the busy channel and idled 
nearly 60 ships in the gulf and at houstons docks 
it is holding up traffic and will continue to do that it is 
unlikely that channel traffic will be opened up today nelson 
said 
nelson said the oil was not as toxic to wildlife as that spilled 
in the gulf by the norwegian tanker mega borg earlier this summer 
but it is thicker and more environmentally persistent in its 
ability to stick to shorelines he said the mega borg spilled 39 
million gallons

the united states is placing new restrictions 
on exports of items to iraq which could be used for that countrys 
development of missiles or chemical and biological weapons 
assistant secretary of state john h kelly told congress on tuesday 
and he said the bush administration also has under active 
consideration the step of returning iraq to the us list of 
nations which sponsor or support terrorism which would carry 
additional economic sanctions 
iraqs threats against against neighboring kuwait and its 
massing of troops along the two countries disputed border are just 
the latest moves by president saddam hussein that cause grave 
concern in the united states kelly told the house foreign 
affairs middle east subcommittee 
iraq is a major power in the region this power carries 
responsibility with it he said in a statement 
kellys comments the most detailed public explanation yet of 
administration moves against iraq came a day before the full 
foreign affairs committee was to vote on much tougher legislation 
proposed by rep howard berman dcalif imposing a range of 
sanctions on iraq 
the state department has asked the commerce department to place 
restrictions on export of items with potential weapons uses that 
are much like the curbs already in place for nuclear technology 
according to kellys testimony and to congressional sources briefed 
on the moves 
the change would mean a license is required for any item that 
could be destined for a program of chemical or biological weapons 
development or for use in developing missile delivery systems for 
weapons kelly said 
new restrictions should be put in place within the next month 
he said under questioning from the subcommittee chairman rep lee 
hamilton dind 
kelly added that the sanctions which stem from worries about 
the proliferation of destabilizing weaponry in the region and 
husseins threats to use them would not have a major impact on 
bilateral trade the united states sold some 13 billion worth of 
goods to iraq last year most of it farm commodities 
the sanctions are being imposed under a law that allows the 
government to restrict exports in order to distance the united 
states from the activities of other governments which it finds 
objectionable 
asked whether the administration contemplates additional steps 
aimed at iraqs alleged support for terrorists kelly said we 
are reviewing that matter and we have that under active 
consideration 
but he said the administration remains opposed to the berman 
legislation because it would allow the president little flexibility 
to lift the sanctions unless he could certify that iraq was meeting 
human rights weapons proliferation and terrorism concerns 
we believe what are needed are devices to modulate actions 
against countries not meataxe approaches kelly told the 
subcommittee 
of the overall situation in the middle east kelly said tensions 
are higher than a year ago but asked by hamilton if he were 
fearful of war kelly responded if i were i dont think id want 
to say it before this body 
kelly also denied an assertion by rep mel levine dcalif 
that sour personal relations between president bush and israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir have hampered progress in the middle 
east peace process to personalize the relationship does a 
disservice to both governments he said 
but levine contended that the situation is nonetheless real 
there is no warmth between the two leaders he said adding 
that bush often omits mention of shamir when talking about his 
contacts with leaders in the region

hopes that liberias bloody civil 
war would end with a quick victory over president samuel doe have 
vanished as rebels hungry for power and vengeance fight among 
themselves 
rebel leader charles taylor who had bragged in interviews that 
he would chase doe from his presidential mansion in the liberian 
capital monrovia remains bogged down in fighting six miles away 
fighters loyal to prince johnson who split with taylor three 
months ago have fought their way into the city center where doe 
remains in his fortified israelibuilt mansion guarded by loyal 
troops doe has refused to resign 
at one stage in the siege of the capital the rebels suddenly 
withdrew from their positions around monrovia reportedly because 
johnsons forces had attacked taylors men 
doe does not want to relinquish power charles taylor wants 
power at all cost prince johnson wants to get rid of both said 
a senior western diplomat who has been monitoring reports on the 
fighting from his monrovia embassy 
liberias 24 million people are the big losers since the civil 
war began the vast majority of casualities have been civilians 
does soldiers began the slaughter in northern nimba county 
where 100 rebels invaded from neighboring ivory coast on christmas 
eve 
angry at their inability to halt the rebel advance frustrated 
troops turned on civilians of the gio and mano tribes killing 
raping looting and setting homes ablaze the two tribes form the 
main support base for the rebels 
initially the guerrillas did not attack civilians and appeared 
to be the good guys in a battle against a corrupt and 
nepotistic government that brutally suppressed opposition but this 
lasted only as long as they were moving through through territory 
populated by tribes friendly to their cause 
as soon as the rebels advanced southward into territory 
populated by tribes that backed doe reports of the murder of 
civilians began to emerge most of those killed were members of 
does tribe the krahn or the mandigo tribe which also backs the 
government 
monday morning government troops went on a rampage inside a 
refugee center in the capital and carried out one of the worst 
known massacres of the war survivors said 600 people mostly women 
and children who had been trying to flee the violence were killed 
the us state department put the casualties at 200 
the victims were from the gio and mano tribes 
doe denied reponsibility for the church atrocity and said it was 
carried out by rebels dressed in army uniforms but survivors said 
they were attacked by soldiers speaking krahn 
the standoff in monrovia bears an eerie resemblance to the 1985 
coup attempt led by brig gen thomas quiwonkpa the general whose 
forces included johnson took the entire city of monrovia by 
surprise 
but doe and his troops emerged from the mansion and killed them 
soldiers subsequently killed thousands of gios and manos in 
nimba county setting the stage for the rebel invasion late last 
year 
for a time it appeared the rebels would quickly take monrovia 
western diplomats in the capital whose governments had switched 
sides and now opposed the president told reporters does soldiers 
would flee at the first sight of rebels 
that was six weeks ago 
instead taylors national patriotic front has been unable to 
break the remnants of does 72nd infantry battalion 
as taylor remained bogged down outside monrovia johnsons men 
waded through a swamp last week to launch a surprise attack on 
does forces in downtown monrovia 
the arrival of johnsons men dashed hopes of a simple ending to 
the war 
taylor accused johnson of being a tool of the united states 
which he said was trying to stop him from taking power johnson 
said taylor was a communist on libyas payroll 
taylor is of mixed americoliberian and native african ancestry 
the americos descendants of freed american slaves who founded the 
country ruled liberia until doe took power in a 1980 coup 
does coup was hailed throughout the country because it ended 
the domination and subjugation of native liberians by americos who 
like does krahn people constitute only 5 percent of the 
population 
johnson is the son of gio parents and there were fears the 
ethnic background of the two men could lead to a new war

the united states needs more scientists from 
abroad and must change its laws to attract them or it will see 
other countries get the advantage american scientists told 
congress on tuesday 
some countries like taiwan and south korea have programs to 
repatriate their science and engineering nationals from the united 
states offering them financial inducements including cash 
incentives for repatriation air fares and other benefits said 
karl willenbrock assistant director of the national science 
foundation 
he said about a third of the advanced researchers in government 
laboratories are foreigners who were let in only on condition they 
return home when their projects are done 
there is evidence that asian scientists who have become us 
citizens are going back to their native countries in growing 
numbers because of better opportunities said philip e schambra 
director of the fogarty international center at the national 
institutes of health 
schambra said efforts of the 12 countries in the european 
community to dismantle barriers among them are expected to create 
five to six million new jobs in service research and development 
this is happening just as scientists from eastern europe are 
getting a new chance to move schambra pointed out 
meanwhile he said australia new zealand and canada have 
policies to attract highly skilled immigrants 
how we deal with this issue will to a large degree determine 
the pace of research progress on aids cancer treatment and other 
public health priorities he predicted 
the laws the scientists want to change favor the admittance of 
foreigners related to people already in the united states 
family members accounted for 75 out of every 100 legal 
immigrants in 1987 while only four out of 100 came for jobs said 
ronald a tekely of the national foreign trade council an 
association of us companies involved in world trade 
it is obvious that our current immigration laws do not promote 
the immigration of highly skilled people despite the shortages in 
certain occupations tekely said 
willenbrock said the united states is not producing enough 
scientists and engineers of its own 
increasingly women and minorities will constitute a larger 
percentage of our work force and these groups historically have low 
rates of participation in the sciences and engineering he noted 
all testified before the subcommittee on science research and 
technology of the house science committee

president bush and british prime minister 
margaret thatcher will help celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 
aspen institute an organization designed to help global leaders 
focus on critical issues 
we wanted the strongest leaders we could get said david t 
mclaughlin president and chief executive officer of the institute 
its the first time two heads of state have come were 
absolutely delighted 
bush is scheduled to give the opening address thursday at the 
institute and thatcher who arrives wednesday will give the 
closing address on sunday 
the theme of this years symposium is renewal leadership and 
values for the 21st century 
the nonprofit institute is the brainchild of the late chicago 
businessman walter paepcke whose dream was to help refocus the 
worlds attention on the cultural contributions of germans at a 
time when its eyes were turned to the brutal horrors left by the 
nazi regime 
in 1950 he convinced humanist dr albert schweitzer to travel 
from his home in africa to aspen to help celebrate the 200th 
birthday of german poet and statesman wolfgang goethe that was the 
seed that launched the 11 millionayear institute 
the principle thrust of the institute then and very much 
today was to bring together leaders from the private sector to 
really discuss some of the critical issues of our time said 
mclaughlin the former dartmouth college president who has headed 
the institute since 1987 
when schweitzer arrived he found a near ghost town with 
mudpaved streets and little else to offer when bush and thatcher 
arrive this week they will find an upscale posh ski resort 
former west german chancellor willy brandt and supreme court 
justices are among the speakers who have addressed the institute 
nearly 1000 people will gather for this years symposium which 
will feature forums on the environment education eastern europe 
developing third world countries and national health care 
bush and thatcher are scheduled to meet thursday their fourth 
round of discussions in three months 
prior to her symposium address thatcher plans a whirlwind tour 
friday of the national center for atmospheric research in boulder 
and the strategic defense initiative national test facility and the 
north american aerospace defense command in colorado springs 
a number of current and former global executives will lead the 
symposium forums including paul volcker former federal reserve 
board chairman rita klimova ambassador of the czech and slovak 
federal republic robert s mcnamara former president of the world 
bank group and ernest l boyer president of the carnegie 
foundation for the advancement of teaching 
in the past 40 years the institute has grown from its base in 
aspen to include administrative headquarters at wye md and 
branches in germany france italy japan and the united kingdom

federal safety investigators today criticized 
exxon corp for operating tankers with reduced crews who dont get 
sufficient rest they said that situation existed on the exxon 
valdez which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into alaskas 
prince williams sound 
the national transportation safety board was voting today on the 
causes of the nations worst oil spill 
its initial conclusions found that the captain of the vessel 
improperly handed over the helm to his third mate the board said 
the mates fatigue contributed to his inability to guide the vessel 
around ice 
the board found that similar conditions of deck officers with 
inadequate rest exist on other exxon tankers due to a company 
policy of operating with reduced crews 
it also criticized exxon incentive awards for crews who work 
long hours and said the oil company has manipulated shipboard 
reporting of overtime and workload 
the 340page report by the national transportation safety board 
staff was getting a final review by board members before it is to 
be made public in several weeks the board planned to vote on the 
probable cause of the march 24 1989 spill 
the panel considered a long list of conclusions and 
recommendations stemming from the disaster 
among the boards conclusions in the early discussion were 
the decision by the exxon valdez captain to leave his third 
mate in charge as the tanker was being maneuvered around a massive 
ice floe was improper and went against exxon policies and coast 
guard rules 
coast guard rules on staffing ships do not adquately consider 
the workload 
the coast guard has been unduly narrow in perspective in 
allowing exxon ships to operate with inadequate crew failing to 
consider the amount of work required in loading the ships before 
they go out to sea 
board chairman james kolstad said the accident was the costliest 
the board ever investigated he said cleanup costs had so far 
totalled 2 billion 
the investigation was aimed at greatly reducing the risk of 
similar accidents kolstad said 
with one vacancy on the fivemember ntsb the possibility of a 
deadlock loomed on some issues although reports normally are not 
brought to the final stage until members have had a chance to read 
them and discuss any disagreements with staff investigators 
the report covers drug and alcohol testing of the crew the 
exxon crews operation of the vessel coast guard traffic control 
standards for staffing tankers and coast guard facilities that 
guide them and government and private emergency response to the 
spill said board spokeswoman drucella andersen 
it does not however cover the cleanup operation which is an 
environmental matter she said 
ms andersen said the board received no formal complaint or 
allegation about the blood alcohol tests taken on joseph hazelwood 
the exxon valdezs captain more than 10 hours after his ship broke 
open 
hazelwoods lawyers claimed last week that tests purportedly 
showing that his blood had a 06 percent alcohol content were 
botched and were followed by a cover up that denied him a fair 
trial earlier this year in alaska the coast guard standard for 
drunkenness is 04 percent 
an alaska jury acquitted the captain of being intoxicated but 
convicted him on one misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of 
oil a judge fined him 50000 and ordered him to spend 1000 hours 
cleaning alaskan beaches hazelwood has appealed the verdict 
last week the coast guard dismissed charges of drunkenness and 
misconduct against hazelwood but suspended his license as a ships 
master for nine months after he pleaded no contest to breaking 
coast guard rules 
the violations included drinking within four hours before taking 
command of the vessel and leaving the bridge to his first officer 
while the tanker was headed for jagged bligh reef where it split 
open 
safety board conclusions carry no legal force but are used as 
possible guidelines for congressional and other government action 
by law ntsb analyses and conclusions are not admissible as 
evidence in courts 
kolstad took charge of the investigation shortly after the spill 
and sent an eightmember team to look into various aspects of the 
accident and the futile attempts to stop the spread of the oil 
kolstad received some criticism from former board investigators 
for not going to the site himself he said he did not want to add 
to the list of highprofile transportation and environmental 
officials drawing attention there 
two months after the exxon valdez ran aground the ntsb held a 
weeklong public hearing in alaska interviewing 27 witnesses and 
collecting 115 exhibits 
the 987footlong ship has since been renamed the exxon 
mediterranean and has been undergoing tests for service on oil 
trade routes in the mediterranean sea or the middle east 
the transportation department congress and other agencies have 
looked into various aspects of the spill but the ntsb conducts the 
official inquiry into all accidents involving planes trains 
ships highways and pipelines

the irish republican army said tuesday it killed a 
british lawmaker because of his friendship with prime minister 
margaret thatcher and his role in developing british policy on 
northern ireland 
the group said that as long as britain controls the province 
the ira will continue to strike whenever and wherever the 
opportunity arises the statement was sent to press association 
britains domestic news agency 
ian gow 53 a close adviser to mrs thatcher and a conservative 
party lawmaker was killed monday when a bomb exploded under his 
car parked at his home in hankham southeast england 
gow was chairman of a parliamentary committee on northern 
ireland that discusses affairs of the province but has no power 
over legislation the ira has been fighting british rule in the 
province for two decades 
police believe at least two people were involved in the bombing 
and they may have made several reconnaissance visits to the village 
in recent weeks scotland yard set up a telephone hotline tuesday 
to take calls from anyone who may have seen suspicious activity 
around the gow home 
rodney lind assistant chief constable of the sussex police 
said police were following leads based on tips from the public 
police recovered some components of the bomb and checks were being 
made at ports in the belief the assailants may have fled by ferry 
to the continent 
mrs thatcher visited the gow home to comfort gows wife jane 
later she attended a memorial service with mrs gow and her two 
sons at the anglican parish church in hankham 60 miles south of 
london 
the gow and thatcher families were close and often spent 
christmas together 
the ira statement noted gow was a close personal associate 
of mrs thatcher it also noted gow was mrs thatchers personal 
parliamentary secretary and one of her closest advisers from 1979 
to 1983 
gow also was a close friend of airey neave the conservative 
party spokesman on northern ireland slain by a bomb in 1979 the 
irish national liberational army an ira splinter group claimed 
responsibility for that attack 
the independent newspaper said tuesday the assassination of 
ian gow may represent an attempt by the ira to cause personal hurt 
to margaret thatcher and goad her into overreacting to his death 
mrs thatcher said the slaying would make no difference in her 
governments fight against terrorism 
in a statement issued tuesday mrs gow sent a message to the 
ira you will never win 
she said her husbands death will not diminish our resolve to 
be as strong as he was in fighting this terrible wickedness 
we want to share ians great courage in defying evil and 
terrorism mrs gow said 
scotland yards chief antiterrorist officer george 
churchillcoleman said gow had been warned he was on a list of 100 
lawmakers judges and civil servants found in an ira bomb factory 
in south london in december 1988 
gows death prompted appeals for increased vigilence by 
potential ira targets currently only politicians of cabinet rank 
ministers in the northern ireland office and top civil servants 
qualify for 24hour protection 
politicians lawyers and others were urged to remove addresses 
and telephone numbers from reference books such as whos who keep 
vehicles locked and in a garage overnight leave front porch lights 
burning avoid announcing plans in advance and check underneath 
their cars 
the ira has claimed responsiblity for a series of bombings in 
england recently including those at londons stock exchange a 
traditional conservative party club and a royal air force base in 
northwest london

a federal judge was asked tuesday to 
reduce the prison sentences of two brothers convicted in the ptl 
scandal 
david and james taggart top aides to ptl founder jim bakker 
were convicted last year of evading more than 525000 in income 
taxes on 12 million they took from the television ministry 
us district judge robert potter last year sentenced david 
taggart to 18 years and five months in prison potter sentenced 
james taggart to 17 years and nine months they are imprisoned in 
alabama and must serve 8 years each before being eligible for 
parole 
defense attorney ben cotten told potter during a hearing that 
the sentences were too harsh because the taggarts were not evil 
or meanspirited and they had cooperated with prosecutors he 
said the long sentences did nothing to deter other whitecollar 
criminals 
potter who said his decision would take a few weeks disagreed 
i think the length of the sentence does provide some 
deterrence he said i think the public recognizes this if 
they see someone whos embezzled a couple of million dollars and 
get a couple of years in jail theyd say he got a pretty good 
deal 
the taggarts testified against their former boss in his trial 
last fall bakker was convicted of 24 counts of fraud and 
conspiracy and sentenced to 45 years in prison 
they did not attend the hearing tuesday 
assistant us attorney jerry miller who prosecuted bakker sat 
with cotten at the hearing and told the judge the taggarts 
testimony was candid and straightforward miller declined to 
give his opinion on the sentences because he did not prosecute 
their cases 
earlier this year potter reduced the sentence of former ptl 
executive richard dortch after he testified against bakker and 
other defendants 
dortch who was indicted with bakker on identical charges 
pleaded guilty to reduced charges before the trial and was 
sentenced to eight years in prison potter later reduced his 
sentence to 30 months

british embassy are located said the us state department and 
british foreign office today 
the reported rebel advances come one day after government troops 
massacred hundreds of people in a lutheran church compound in 
monrovia 
the rebels in mamba point were believed to be under the command 
of prince johnson the main rebel force of his rival charles 
taylor remained bogged down in the citys eastern suburbs

through the embassy quarter without inflicting any great damage to 
the embassies said a spokesman for the british foreign office in 
london 
state department spokesman richard boucher said in washington 
thatthe situation on the ground remains fluid it does appear 
that the rebels are in control where the us embassy is located 
doe in his first interview in a month told the bbc that his 
troops were not responsible for mondays massacre 
i do not want to believe that the armed forces of liberia 
would just walk into a church and kill innocent people doe said 
he said rebels wearing army uniforms attacked the refugees 
doe telephoned the bbc from his executive mansion where he has 
been holed up since rebel forces reached the citys suburbs more 
than a month ago 
witnesses said more than 600 people were killed when government 
soldiers stormed the church grounds before dawn monday and 
slaughtered 600 people most were children and women and many had 
their heads smashed open or blown to pieces by bullets

that government troops slaughtered at least 200 people at the 
church compound there was no independent confirmation of the 600 
dead figure 
president bush today met with president gnassingbe eyadema of 
the west african nation of togo who told reporters he has been 
urging doe since early this year to talk with the rebels 
but unfortunately we couldnt get ourselves understood 
eyadema said doe doesnt want to meet anybody we think that if 
at the time the rebels had accepted negotiations everything would 
have been right they didnt accept that

liberian troops have bombarded a christian radio station that was 
used by rebels causing considerable damage

he could not confirm reports of the attack but arnold said the 
stations 10 americans staff and relatives evacuated the facility 
last thursday 
arnold said the americans had all left liberia 
the victims in mondays massacre belonged to the gio and mano 
tribes which have supported the rebels seeking to overthrow doe 
most of does troops are from his krahn tribe and the mandingo 
tribe 
it was not the first massacre of civilians in this 7monthold 
war on may 30 government soldiers attacked un headquarters in 
monrovia where hundreds of gios and manos had taken refuge they 
abducted about 30 men and teenage boys and most of the bodies 
were found later on a beach outside the capital 
the rebels also have been accused of killing civilians 
but none of the attacks has been on the scale of mondays 
massacre 
the lutheran world federation in geneva said today it was 
horrified and deeply grieved by the incident and it urged the 
united nations to intervene in the civil war the federation is an 
umbrella for 106 lutheran churches worldwide 
relief workers feared many of the wounded would die a spokesman 
for the belgian group doctors without borders which is running the 
only field hospital operating in monrovia said monday night they 
had not been able to get to the church 
refugees had sought protection at the church in late may after 
government soldiers attacked them at un headquarters in monrovia 
thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war are crowded into 
refugee camps in the capital their numbers have swelled recently 
as rebel troops have stormed the city 
the rebels invaded in late december from neighboring ivory coast 
in a bid to oust doe whom they accuse of rights abuses and 
corruption

ballet master colin peasley came to town 
searching for some musclerippling hunks to perform as extras in 
the australian ballets production of spartacus but he should 
have looked elsewhere 
washington has plenty of government bureaucrats lawyers and 
computer nerds but roman gladiators are in short supply 
short sleeved shirts with plastic ballpoint pen protectors yes 
but loincloths forget it 
the kennedy center circulated fliers around town announcing 
auditions for macho hemen to appear this week in hungarian 
choreographer laszlo seregis balletic tale of an abortive slave 
uprising in ancient rome 
peasley was too gentlemanly to wince when 38 of washingtons 
finest examples of raging testosterone showed up monday night 
about half were muscular enough to stay but the rest looked more 
or less like veteran couch potatoes 
after whispered consultations with maina gielgud artistic 
director of the australian ballet peasley politely showed the 
softies to the door then he began drilling the winners including 
an aerobic instructor a government lawyer a rock musician a 
birthday balloon delivery man and a us park service policeman 
to whip them into shape as roman soldiers and slaves 
among those who didnt make the cut were whitehaired jules 
renaud 76 a retired agriculture department forestry expert who 
said his bride of five months had encouraged him to try out 
youre an attractive man she had told him 
another who took his disappointment goodnaturedly was eugene 
woodruff 57 of suburban annandale va a supervisor at the us 
patent and trademark office whose physique suggests hes no 
stranger to an evening in front of the tv set with a bag of nacho 
chips 
woodruff has performed as an extra in several washington opera 
productions mostly just standing around on stage and he was eager 
to try a livelier role in spartacus which requires a lot of 
marching and lunging and dashing here and there 
im not a dancer at all he said grinning i dont take 
part in any strenuous athletics for exercise the only thing i do 
is rifle shooting i also mow the lawn and saw some firewood 
as woodruff walked out the door peasley was barking left 
right left right to the 19 finalists as they marched across the 
floor to piano music from aram khachaturians score 
grabbing a wooden spear peasley said these are held like you 
hold a thermometer grasp them in the center and keep them under 
your armpit like this 
he taught the neophyte gladiators how to sway without getting 
dizzy and how to crouch without looking like youre sitting on 
the toilet 
he held a roman warriors shield to his chest you must be 
careful how you hold a shield or they begin to look like a 
handbag he said 
the extras or supernumeraries will receive 28 for four 
rehearsals and 40 for four performances of spartacus starting 
friday the pay is somewhat higher than the usual rate for opera 
supers because of the ballets complex stage movements 
the money wasnt the lure for woodruff 
i have no illusions about being a great actor he said i 
do it for the fun of it its a chance to do theater thats 
bigtime without having any real professional skills

a letter received tuesday and signed 
by west germanys most notorious terrorist group said the attack 
last week on a government official was the start of a long 
fighting phase 
the letter threatened more attacks and urged terrorism groups to 
build a revolutionary hostile power in western europe to combat 
imperialism led by west germany it was signed red army 
faction and dated july 29 the day after a car bomb attack on 
interior ministry official hans neusel 
the group claimed responsibility for that attack in a letter 
left at the scene of the crime 
neusel walked away with minor cuts after a bomb rocked his sedan 
as he was driving to work the latest letter said the bomb was 
meant to guarantee his certain death but we calculated the 
amount of explosives too low 
the attack on neusel was the start of a long fighting phase 
against the newly arisen greater germanwest european world 
power it said 
the communique went on to denounce the process of german 
unification and vowed support for leftist terrorists in spain 
it further demanded that jailed leftist terrorists in spain and 
across western europe be held together in common cells rather than 
separated from each other 
the red army faction has frequently demanded its jailed members 
in west germany be held together in common prison areas west 
german officials have refused 
the fivepage letter written in german did not contain the 
gangs symbol of a star superimposed by an assault rifle the group 
has often used the symbol on previous written claims of 
responsibility 
however the federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said the 
letter appeared to be authentic 
spokesman hansjuergen foerster noted that a similar letter was 
sent to news agencies several days after the assassination of 
deutsche bank president alfred herrhausen who died in a november 
1989 car bombing similar to the attack on neusel

while the us secretary of state 
and the soviet foreign minister try wednesday to bring peace to 
afghanistan soviet veterans scarred by the afghan war will be 
undergoing therapy nearby 
some of the 1 million soviets who fought during the red armys 
nineyear intervention in afghanistan are being treated at the 
baikal sanitorium a 192acre health resort overlooking lake baikal 
the hilltop retreat set among cedars and birch trees is best 
known as the intended site of a 1960 superpower summit between 
soviet premier nikita s khrushchev and president dwight d 
eisenhower the summit was scrapped after the downing of american 
gary powers spy plane 
three decades later secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will be meeting in 
the central siberian city of irkutsk 43 miles to the northwest 
they will try to agree on a formula for a ceasefire and a 
political reconciliation in afghanistan where moslem rebels have 
been fighting the sovietbacked government for 12 years 
the sanitorium is one of eight nationwide treating soviet 
veterans of the war that baker and shevardnadze will try to end 
capt anatoly sadayev is still tormented physically and 
emotionally by the machinegun attack that put a bullet in his leg 
while he served in afghanistan from 1983 to 1985 
i remember it as though it were yesterday but i dont want to 
recall it again the 34yearold officer said tuesday as he 
pedaled an exercise bicycle 
sadayev has undergone several operations on his leg and is 
receiving further treatment during a 24day stay at the sanitorium 
trousers hide the scar but he walks with a limp a fixed pad on 
the bottom of his left sneaker helps him walk 
in another room a 24yearold veteran was being treated for 
lower back pain medicated cloth patches were placed on his back 
aside from treatment of their physical wounds the veterans also 
see psychologists at the center 
like some american veterans of the vietnam war some soviet 
soldiers who fought in afghanistan feel their countrymen do not 
appreciate their suffering sadayev is one of them 
if you remember the film rambo where he says i love my 
motherland well let my homeland love me as much as i love it and 
then there wont be any problems sadayev said 
among the problems veterans say are the governments slowness 
in providing free medical care counseling proper housing and jobs 
the soviets began withdrawing their troops from afghanistan in 
may 1988 but did not decide until october 1988 to set up 
rehabilitation centers the baikal sanitorium was opened to 
veterans in march 1989 
sanitorium doctors have complained they are virtually cut off 
from foreign colleagues and therefore cannot learn from their 
experiences especially from doctors treating vietnam war veterans 
they have no detailed specialized programs for treating soldiers 
who are mixed with other guests at the sprawling complex 
our task is to do everything so they and their families live 
normally so they have everything because they werent guilty for 
that war and didnt want to be there said dr alexander 
kitaisky baikal sanitoriums chief doctor 
sadayev calls the soviet intervention a mistake of history 
that cost more than 13000 soviet lives but he doesnt dwell on 
the past 
i am happy that i am alive i continue to live i have a 
family he said he is now studying law in the russian city of 
kurgan

freshmen to stay until they had completed basic training the only 
exception was for those with physical disabilities

wanted freshmen to build a sense of accomplishment by completing 
the rigorous basic training program many of those who qut early on

aflcio leaders wrestling with the abortion issue 
agreed today that the powerful labor federation should continue its 
decadelong path of neutrality on the divisive subject 
the executive council of the 142 millionmember organization 
voted not to take a position on abortion 
the overwhelming view of the council was that this was a 
matter of deep conscience conviction and religion on the part of 
union members aflcio president lane kirkland said 
kirkland said only two or three members of the 34member council 
dissented during todays voice vote he said the group did not 
think any stance taken by the union as a whole could change the 
minds of individual members 
three members of the council are women 
todays vote was to accept the recommendation of an 18member 
panel of aflcio union presidents who monday urged the full 
governing council not to take sides on abortion 
on monday one of the union leaders who had ben pushing a 
prochoice stand accused colleagues of dragging their feet on 
an issue crucial to luring more women and minorities into the 
struggling labor movement 
however the union leader who spoke on condition of anonymity 
also said prochoice forces could find solace in the fact that the 
resolution acknowledged the right of privacy and the right of 
people to choose based on their own conscience 
i dont consider it a total defeat its not strong 
enough but considering the circumstances we did about as well we 
could the leader said its more of a standoff 
leaders urging neutrality contend that the abortion issue is 
just too divisive for the labor movement and a prochoice stand 
would threaten unions organizing efforts 
those officials complained that abortion had nothing to do with 
traditional collective bargaining issues such as hours and pay 
but prochoice forces noted that the aflcio has gotten involved in 
other social issues such as civil rights 
there was no organized move afoot for the federation to condemn 
abortion 
however both the national right to life committee and cardinal 
john j oconnor of the roman catholic archdiocese of new york had 
campaigned for the aflcio not to take a stand they noted that a 
recent supreme court decision gives union members the right to 
withhold dues spent on political issues 
many union leaders interpreted that campaign as a threat by the 
committee and oconnor that they would lobby members to withhold 
union dues if the aflcio went prochoice 
a prochoice position would have put the federation in line with 
the stance taken by many of its political allies such as the 
democratic party and various womens and civil rights groups 
at a convention last fall of delegates from all 90 aflcio 
unions the delegates declined to adopt any of the halfdozen 
prochoice resolutions submitted and instead referred them to the 
executive council at its meeting last february in bal harbour fla 
instead of taking up the issue at that highly publicized 
meeting aflcio president lane kirkland appointed the 18member 
committee to study the issue and make a recommendation at this 
meeting in chicago where the federation is not in as bright a 
spotlight

president gnassingbe eyadema of togo promised 
president bush on tuesday that he would allow the establishment of 
another political party in his west african country to give his 
people some democracy

situation in liberia during their twohour white house meeting 
said assistant secretary of state herman cohen 
togo has offered asylum to liberian president samuel doe who is 
holding out at his palace in monrovia against a challenge by rebels 
seeking his ouster 
but cohen said the asylum question was not discussed at the 
white house meeting he said both leaders support a role for the 
united nations in establishing a ceasefire in liberia 
eyadema whose country is one of the poorest in the world also 
urged bush and other friends of africa to start a marshall plan for 
the continent similar to the massive western aid program for the 
newly emerging democracies in eastern europe 
in departure statements on the white houses south lawn bush 
said he was encouraged by eyademas promise to provide his people 
with more political openness cohen said eyadema pledged he would 
do away with the oneparty state and allow the togolese another 
political party so they could have more choice 
the path to development and the path to democracy are one and 
the same bush told eyadema in his statement in heavily accented 
french bush also sent his best wishes to the people of togo 
eyadema who took power in a bloodless military coup in 1967 
runs an authoritarian state 
the state departments annual human rights report says that 
while togo has a serious problem of torture in its prisons the 
situation has improved under the 2yearold togolese human rights 
commission which reports to eyadema 
in eyademas departure statement he noted that africas debt 
will exceed 600 billion by the year 2000 and he urged that 
appropriate remedies must be found for the grave problems of our 
continent which is the victim of famine and calamities 
eyadema is here to promote togos newly created export 
processing zone which will allow us and other businessmen to 
produce merchandise in the west african country and to export it to 
europe free of duty several us government agencies are helping 
the project get started 
in his meetings eyadema hopes to interest american businessmen 
in investing in togo in return they will get better access than 
they enjoy here to the large market being created in europe by the 
1992 merger of the economies of the 12nation european economic 
community 
togo twice the size of maryland with a population of 33 
million has been largely dependent on agriculture since it gained 
independence in 1960 hopes of improving the economy through the 
sale of phosphate in the 1970s collapsed with a drastic fall in the 
world price of that commodity 
in return for support from the international monetary fund togo 
has been selling or liquidating governmentcontrolled enterprises 
and offering generous incentives to foreign investors

baseball finally did to new york yankees owner 
george steinbrenner what hed been doing to managers for 18 years 
it showed him the door 
baseball commissioner fay vincent on monday stripped 
steinbrenner of control of the team for allegedly paying a gambler 
to dig up dirt on a ballplayer 
for all purposes mr steinbrenner agrees that he is to be 
treated as if he had been placed on the permanent ineligible 
list vincent said i hope this sad episode is now over 
fans rose in a 90second standing ovation when news spread to 
yankee stadium the decision brought shouts of no more george 
i will not comment on the decision steinbrenner said im 
very happy it was resolved im very satisfied with the resolution 
and thats all im going to say 
as one of the most controversial some say hated names in the 
games history steinbrenner was famous for hiring and firing 
managers five times in the case of billy martin he changed 
managers 18 times and pitching coaches 31 times 
steinbrenner 60 who headed a group that purchased the yankees 
from cbs inc in 1973 can retain partial ownership but was given 
six months to reduce his stake to below 50 percent from 55 percent 
his 33yearold son hank will become the new general partner 
said steinbrenners lawyer stephen kaufman 
vincent said it would be possible for a member of steinbrenners 
family to be the new general partner but warned the family member 
would face expulsion if george steinbrenner was found to have any 
involvement with the operation of the club his sons appointment 
is subject to the approval of vincent and the other major league 
teams 
hank steinbrenner the oldest of steinbrenners four children 
has been involved in the daily operations of the club since 1986 
last year he also was the head soccer coach at vanguard high 
school in ocala fla and worked breeding horses at his fathers 
stud farm there 
under the restrictions george steinbrenner will be allowed to 
consult on major business decisions but cannot participate in 
player deals and he must get vincents permission in writing to 
attend major league games as anything other than an ordinary fan 
he cannot for example sit in the owners box or visit the 
clubhouse 
also the yankees must certify in writing to the american league 
president every six months that steinbrenner has had no involvement 
with the team 
steinbrenner accepted the terms of his punishment and agreed not 
to contest the decision in court as he had threatened to do 
vincent said 
its sad said yankee pitcher dave righetti he really 
loved the idea of owning the yankees and now its been taken away 
from him 
the guy got exactly what he deserved a yankee fan trevor 
bickford of westbury ny said after word reached yankee stadium 
thats what should happen to any owner that constantly makes 
decisions to hurt the club 
vincent punished steinbrenner for starting a relationship with 
gambler howard spira and paying spira 40000 in january vincent 
said steinbrenners actions violated the best interests of 
baseball clause that gives the commissioner practically unlimited 
powers to protect the integrity of the game 
last august pete rose was banished from the game for betting on 
baseball 
steinbrenners downfall stemmed from a feud with yankee dave 
winfield whom he signed in 1980 steinbrenner turned on his star 
outfielder after winfield went 1for22 in the 1981 world series 
loss to los angeles 
winfield and steinbrenner sued each other three times in the 
1980s and winfield finally was traded to the california angels in 
may 
that deal came after spira said he was paid by steinbrenner to 
provide information to discredit the outfielder spira went public 
with the 40000 payment in march and vincent started the 
investigation 
mr steinbrenner has offered multiple and conflicting 
explanations of his decision to give 40000 to spira ranging from 
charity to extortion vincent said 
i am pursuaded that neither extreme was at work here rather

kuwaiti and iraqi negotiators 
embraced warmly tuesday as they began talks on their oil and border 
dispute sources said diplomats reported that iraq had massed 
100000 troops on kuwaits border 
gulfbased diplomatic sources said the iraqi force triple the 
number earlier reported included about 300 sovietmade tanks and 
dwarfed the entire kuwaiti army of 20000 troops 
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
troops have been concentrated along the border since last week 
when iraq began threatening kuwait iraq accused the small persian 
gulf state of stealing oil from a disputed border region and 
forcing oil prices to drop the diplomats said the number of troops 
was at first difficult to determine 
the delegation leaders crown prince and prime minister sheik 
saad alabdullah alsabah of kuwait and izzat ibrahim deputy 
chairman of iraqs revolutionary command council met privately for 
two hours 
there were no details on the negotiations but sources said the 
meetings will continue wednesday 
diplomatic sources have said they expect arab mediators to push 
the two sides to sign a treaty of nonbelligerency to be followed 
by protracted negotiations on borders and compensation 
the iraqkuwait crisis broke out on july 17 when iraqi president 
saddam hussein accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of 
driving down oil prices by exceeding quotas set for them by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries saddam said the move 
cost iraq 14 billion in lost revenue 
saddam also demanded compensation for the 24 billion in oil he 
claimed kuwait pumped illegally from an oil field which straddles 
the unmarked border between the two countries 
iraq also demanded that kuwait forgive 15 billion in loans it 
extended to baghdad during the eightyear iraniraq war 
iraqs tough talk appeared to have succeeded kuwait and the 
uae agreed to stick to their oil quotas at an opec meeting last 
week opec member states also agreed to a longstanding iraqi demand 
to raised target crude oil prices from 18 to 21 a barrel 
kuwaiti and iraqi officials agreed to meet in jiddah after 
intensive mediation efforts by king fahd and egyptian president 
hosni mubarak 
kuwaiti leaders had insisted that iraq pull back its troops 
before conciliation talks could began but later dropped that 
demand 
kuwaiti officials also asked that iraq agree to demarcate the 
disputed border between the nations a move iraq has refused 
iraq has historically laid claim to all of kuwait and has long 
coveted the kuwaiti islands of bubiyan and warba which command 
access to iraqs sole outlet into the persian gulf 
the mediators have succeeded in toning down a vitriolic campaign 
against kuwait by the iraqi staterun media 
on tuesday the iraqi delegation left baghdad without any public 
announcement 
the leading althawra daily newspaper called the jiddah meeting 
an opportunity for kuwait to perceive iraqs demands and 
respond to its rights 
in contrast the kuwaiti delegation left for jiddah with fanfare 
and publicity 
the kuwaiti papers said they hoped the jiddah meeting was the 
start of a final just settlement of the differences between 
iraq and kuwait in a manner ensuring the legitimate rights of 
each

americans working with refugees expressed 
mixed reactions tuesday to congressional proposals to lend money to 
immigrants so they can establish themselves without going on 
welfare 
the author of one measure rep stephen solarz dny said his 
plan would establish a federal program of refugee loan guarantees 
to encourage private lenders to give loans to employable refugees 
solarz said at a house hearing on resettlement that his goal was 
to make optimum use of scarce refugee resettlement dollars so 
that more victims of persecution and oppression can come to the 
united states 
the solarz plan calls for qualifying refugees to receive an 
average loan of 7500 to be repaid over a decade even if the 
default rate were 30 percent solarz said that his estimates 
suggest that the refugee program might save as much as tens of 
millions of dollars per year 
another proposal from sen howard metzenbaum dohio would give 
some refugees interestfree loans to cover half the average cost of 
resettlement the refugees would be required to repay the loans 
nicolas dimarzio executive director of the us catholic 
conferences migration and refugee services said the group could 
not endorse private sponsorship proposals right now because it 
didnt know enough about them 
we are concerned that while both of these approaches seek to 
eventually reduce federal outlays for refugees neither ensures 
that these programs would result in an increase of refugee 
admissions to the united states he said 
moreover he said he could not be sure the proposals would be 
equitable 
gary rubin of the american jewish committee a group that 
promotes the rights of jews around the world refused to endorse 
the proposals and said more study is needed 
it will obviously be a very complex task to set up a workable 
program rubin said the proposed legislation does not yet 
take all of these factors into account 
private sponsorship initiatives are expected to allow about 
15000 refugees primarily those from the soviet union and cuba to 
find new lives in the united states this year 
there are some 15 million refugees around the world and many 
are eager to come to the united states for a new life about 
125000 refugees will settle in the united states in 1990 at a 
total cost of about 600 million

chancellor helmut kohl will urge east 
germany to spend as little as possible on new weapons 
following revelations east berlin plans a huge new purchase of 
soviet arms officials said tuesday 
meanwhile east german labor minister regine hildebrandt pleaded 
for an emergency infusion of west german aid east germany stands 
before a social and financial collapse if new aid doesnt come 
soon ms hildebrandt said 
kohls government has resisted east german requests for aid to 
supplement the sums bonn is already spending to lay the economic 
and social groundwork for unity west germany contends east berlin 
could do much more belttightening 
such contentions intensified after the east german government 
admitted late monday that it plans to spend 622 million on new 
sovietmade weapons the purchases were revealed earlier in west 
german media reports 
kohl has been under intense pressure to scuttle east germanys 
armsbuying plans on tuesday the chancellor and his coalition 
partners agreed to tell east germany to procure as few weapons as 
possible a government official said on condition of anonymity 
it was not known when kohl would address the issue with the east 
berlin government or whether he would suggest a monetary limit 
west germanys education minister juergen moellemann of the 
liberal free democratic party had demanded the purchases be 
blocked 
the weaponspurchasing plans have put east german defense 
minister rainer eppelmann a pastor and avowed pacifist in an 
uncomfortable media spotlight 
he says he is proceding with the purchases only because 
contracts were signed some eight years ago eppelmann said that 
backing away from purchases would mean paying considerable 
financial penalties to the soviets 
but several west german politicians say the purchases are a 
waste of money since the east german army will likely be disbanded 
by the years end 
many west germans are already worried that the high costs of 
unification will lead to financial sacrifices and higher taxes and 
oppose extra expenditures by the financially beleaguered government 
in east berlin 
ingrid matthaeusmaier a highranking member of west germanys 
main opposition social democratic party called the 
weaponspurchasing plans a security and financial scandal 
she also said the west german government has long known about 
the weapons procurements but did nothing to stop them 
on monday night east german officials acknowledged the 
government planned to buy the soviet military hardware over the 
next six months the weapons include two missilecarrying vessels 
antitank rockets a helicopter and machine guns west german news 
media have reported 
east germany was also close to buying 32 mig29 fighter jets 
worth 628 million but that plan was scuttled when the west german 
defense ministry said it would have no use for the sovietmade 
airplanes reports said 
meanwhile pressure mounted on west germany to free more 
financial aid for east germany 
the east german labor minister said she feared the spiraling 
unemployment following the july 1 economic unification of the 
german states would breed social unrest 
if something doesnt happen soon then much will collapse which 
should not be allowed to collapse ms hildebrandt said 
more than 250000 east germans have lost their jobs as companies 
and factories try to survive the countrys switch to capitalism 
some experts say joblessness could climb to 3 million 
as the two germanys bicker over money progress seems to have 
been made in efforts to forge a new treaty setting out the 
technicalities for dec 2 elections for an allgerman parliament

the united states is preparing 
emergency assistance for this beleaguered caribbean country but 
there are no plans to send military reinforcements the us 
ambassador said tuesday 
we havent been asked and we arent considering any type of 
military support ambassador charles gargano said at the us 
embassy a few blocks from the state television house where a 
radical moslem group has held hostages since friday 
the group also seized the parliament house and is holding 
hostages there including government officials prime minister 
arthur nr robinson was freed tuesday five days after being 
seized the attorney general said 
because of widespread looting trinidad could face food 
shortages and the united states is preparing emergency supplies 
gargano said 
he said a force of some 200 caribbean soldiers were standing by 
on barbados to help if requested 
the ambassador who has been staying in the embassy along with 
12 other diplomatic personnel and six marine guards said he is in 
regular contact with trinidadian officials 
he said there are no signs of splintering in the government or 
security forces and there is no popular support for the rebels 
the government is in total control of the country he said 
gargano named in 1987 said the crisis came out of the blue 
for us in fact we were quite shocked this country appeared to be 
a model of democracy 
the us stakes here are high he said he said there are 2000 
to 4000 us citizens in trinidad including many trinidadians who 
hold dual citizenship 
trinidad is a major us trade partner in the caribbean and has 
been a proamerican democracy for its three decades of nationhood 
he said 
things have been moving apace in terms of democratization in 
this hemisphere we would like to see it continue as a strong 
democracy gargano said 
he said the moslem group led by former trinidad policeman abu 
bakr has been controversial in trinidad and has made antiamerican 
statements 
our impression is that it was a tiny fanatical sect he 
said estimating bakrs followers at 250 to 350 people 
he said some members of the group have traveled to libya and 
there is some evidence of training given to some members he 
said they also have received funding from libya but gargano added 
there was no evidence of libyan involvement in their move against 
the government

held hostage were not released the government announced 
attorney general anthony smart gave no details of how and under 
what conditions the prime minister who had been shot in both feet 
during the uprising was freed but the release of robinson alone 
indicated the 5dayold standoff between the government and moslem 
extremists was not over 
we continue to pray for the safe return of the rest of the 
hostages smart told state radio 
he said robinson was the only one of the 41 hostages released 
smart said robinson who was freed at 120 pm edt is in 
good spirits

accepted an agreement under which he would resign and bakr and his 
men would be granted amnesty 
but government officials said today that no such agreement 
existed and that robinson had made the statement under duress 
bakr said earlier today that the rebels agreed that winston 
dookeran the deputy prime minister would replace robinson when he 
steps down dookeran was released from the parliament building 
friday 
the interim government would be a coalition consisting of 
representatives of all major political parties along with bakrs 
jamaat almuslimeen group 
the group which is believed to number 250 to 300 has blamed 
robinson for widespread poverty in this onceoil rich caribbean 
nation near venezuela it has little support among the populace 
bakr is a former policeman who converted to islam in 1980 and 
has long considered himself a champion of the downtrodden he 
founde jamaat almuslimeen which means the moslem group in arabic 
in 1984 
robinson easily won parliamentary elections in 1986 under the 
constitution the next elections dont have to be held until 1991

funding from that country in a conversation with local radio

as fighting raged near the us embassy in 
monrovia the bush administration said tuesday it may call for a 
un peacekeeping force to bring an end to the sevenmonth old 
conflict in liberia 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said there 
were no plans to evacuate the 400 americans remaining in liberia 
despite a deterioration in the security situation a us naval 
flotilla was waiting offshore in case evacuation is required 
boucher said there was intensive fighting that apparently left 
rebels in control of an area where the us embassy is located 
rocket fire was reported in that area on tuesday but only one 
building was said to have been damaged 
according to the latest reports fighting was continuing but at 
less intensive levels than monday boucher said us officials have 
been in contact with rebel and government forces and both have 
indicated a willingness to abide by american admonitions to respect 
foreign embassies 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen said bullets 
ricocheted off several us buildings at the height of the fighting 
around the diplomatic enclave but no one was hurt 
none of the combatants have targeted our people he said 
the administration was facing additional pressure on tuesday to 
intensify diplomatic efforts toward a peaceful solution that 
pressure increased following a massacre over the weekend in which 
forces loyal to president samuel k doe broke into a lutheran 
church and killed hundreds of civilian refugees 
cohen said the rebels also were committing atrocities and the 
united states has reliable information that they were executing any 
government soldiers they capture 
boucher acknowledged that previous us diplomatic efforts have 
not borne fruit 
were now examining what role the united nations can play in 
resolution of this conflict he said our ambassador to the 
united nations has begun consultations in this regard we have also 
heard from other quarters that there is possible interest in un 
security council action 
cohen briefing reporters at the white house said the united 
states supports the formation of an international peacekeeping 
force 
even if doe is dislodged from power peace would not necessarily 
be assured because of a split in the rebel forces cohen said 
on capitol hill rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the 
house foreign affairs subcommittee on africa said congress has 
been urging the administration to put liberia on the un security 
councils agenda and to take a more active role in removing doe 
from the scene 
our concern is to try to reduce the volatility stop 
largescale ethnic tensions said wolpe 
the administration is concerned not only about the americans in 
liberia but also the estimated 37000 liberians who have sought 
refuge at us installations in liberia cohen said the united 
states could not offer them food because it has barely enough for 
us personnel 
us officials have promised to evacuate soviet diplomats and 
envoys from some allied countries in the event the fighting 
continues to escalate

motorists who clog californias 
freeways on wednesday begin paying the states biggest tax hike 
ever a voterapproved nickelagallon levy on fuel aimed at 
reducing the highway gridlock 
this nickel is adding insult on top of injury said dennis 
radabaugh a contra costa sheriffs deputy who lives in walnut 
creek he said the increase was one of several nickels thats 
obviously going to raise my whole cost of living 
the tax rises an additional cent jan 1 then one more penny 
each subsequent new years day through 1994 that will provide the 
majority of funding for an 18 billionplus 10year highway and 
masstransit rail construction program that voters approved june 5 
in the form of proposition 111 
altogether the average california motorist will soon be paying 
more than a cent per mile in excise and sales taxes 
road and rail construction has not kept pace with population 
because of inflation and political paralysis on the issue drivers 
waste more than 400000 hours a day because the average speed on 
urban freeways has fallen to about 20 mph during commuting hours 
in the next decade the number of licensed drivers is expected 
to rise 18 percent currently there are about 19 million registered 
drivers in california and some 25 million vehicles 
the new levies will double the current state excise tax per 
gallon of gas from 9 to 18 cents there already is a federal excise 
tax of 91 cents per gallon and a sales tax per 1 of 625 to 725 
cents depending on how much the county tacks on above the states 
basic 625 cents 
the state excise tax also will go up at the same rate on diesel 
aviation fuel for light airplanes and marine gasoline 
but drastic as that may seem to californians the states gas 
tax after the initial nickel hike will rank 37th among states and 
12th after the full increase goes into effect up from 47th said 
penny hill a spokeswoman for the road information program a 
washingtonbased nonprofit research organization 
state excise taxes on gas range from 223 cents per gallon in 
nebraska to 75 cents a gallon in georgia she said 
proposition 111 was supported by a bipartisan government 
business and labor coalition 
it was rejected by rural voters who believed they would benefit 
less than cities despite plans to distribute funds throughout the 
state 
but there was no organized opposition and the scattered critics 
for the most part see the tax as unfortunate but necessary 
service stations owners are not happy about the gas tax were 
usually opposed to any tax increase but we know this one was 
designated for transportation improvements said art boswell a 
spokesman for the california service station and automotive repair 
association 
state officials said they believe motorists will take the tax 
hike in stride everyone they said is used to fluctuations in gas 
prices which are also expected to rise because of increases in the 
cost of crude oil 
some service station attendants in san francisco los angeles 
san bernardino and sacramento said it was business as usual tuesday 
while others said sales were up to 25 percent brisker as people 
stocked up before the price went up a few stations said they ran 
out of gas early because of the increased business 
i saved a dollar said bill morris of concord who filled up 
the 28gallon tank of his 1969 oldsmobile to avoid the tax hike he 
owns four cars but prefers the old 10mileagallon guzzler 
not everyone was so concerned 
customers arent too worried about it when youve got a bmw 
you dont worry if it costs 3 more to fill up the tank said 
jeffrey masko a service station cashier in the highrent pacific 
heights neighborhood of san francisco

republican newspaper ads blaming democrats 
for the savings and loan crisis triggered outrage among democratic 
governors tuesday as the national governors association ended its 
annual meeting with a round of partisan fingerpointing 
democratic governors approved a resolution among themselves 
calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate 
the sampl debacle and charging that the bush administration has 
moved slowly to prosecute sampl fraud 
it went beyond a policy statement approved later by the full 
governors association democrats and republicans calling on 
president bush and congress to name an independent commission to 
investigate the savings and loan collapse the sampl bailout is 
expected to cost taxpayers as much as 500 billion 
the governors accepted a republican amendment offered by gov 
james martin of north carolina that softened the statements 
language a bit to say the commission should not delay action on the 
sampl crisis and should have no power to grant immunity from 
prosecution for witnesses 
democratic governors were quick to denounce newspaper ads 
sponsored by the republican national committee that blamed 
congressional democrats for the sampl debacle the ads ran in the 
mobile register on monday and tuesday 
one of the ads pictured 12 congressional democrats including 
resigned house speaker jim wright and sens alan cranston of 
california and bob kerrey of nebraska it said you wont see 
these democratic leaders around mobile and theyre the guys 
who let the sampl problem explode into a 325 billion national 
crisis 
ohio gov richard celeste chairman of the democratic governors 
called the ads deceitful and the most outrageous distortion 
of the truth he blamed republicans for upsetting the normal 
spirit of bipartisanship at the governors conference and said the 
bush administration has failed provide leadership on the sampl crisis 
in the governors final bipartisan meeting democratic gov 
michael dukakis of massachusetts the defeated 1988 presidential 
nominee called the ads garbage and said we had enough of 
that in 1988 
the ads were regarded by democrats as an escalation in the 
growing partisan rancor over the sampl crisis as the fall elections 
approach and it represented the most biting partisan dispute to 
erupt at a national governors meeting in half a dozen years 
republican gov john mckernan of maine said democrats have been 
trying to use the sampl crisis as a political issue 
republicans want to make sure people realize theres enough 
blame to go around mckernan said 
democratic national chairman ronald brown in mobile for the 
governors meeting said the ads were a sign of absolute panic 
by republicans over the sampl debacle he compared it to bushs use 
of willie horton the felon who attacked a maryland couple while on 
furlough from a massachusetts prison against dukakis in 1988 
theyre kind of willie hortonizing the sampl issue brown said 
celeste said if theres a willie horton in the sampl crisis 
its neil bush that was a reference to the presidents son who 
is charged with violating conflict of interest regulations while he 
was on the board of a colorado savings and loan 
some republicans criticized the ads timing during the 
conference james thompson of illinois said the ads have no place 
at this conference 
gov carroll campbell of south carolina head of the republican 
governors tried to smooth over the partisan differences when 
meeting with his democratic colleagues saying theres enough 
blame to go around on the sampl collapse 
but in an interview campbell angrily blamed browns appearance 
in mobile monday on behalf of the democratic candidate for governor 
of alabama paul hubbert and browns remarks critical of host gov 
guy hunt the states firstever republican governor who is locked 
in a tight reelection race 
campbell said browns remarks and appearance showed a total 
lack of class and opened the door to the gop attack ads 
mark gearan director of the democratic governors association 
dismissed campbells remarks saying the first ad was purchased 
before browns arrival 
democrats also pointed the finger at new republican national 
committee chief spokesman charles black at the rnc spokeswoman 
leslie goodman dismissed democratic complaints and defended the ads 
any time a bunch of democrats get together in the same place 
there is a propensity for a lot of hot air and distortion of the 
facts she said we just want to keep giving our subtle 
reminders of their culpability 
the call for an independent commission came on a nearunanimous 
voice vote despite white house comments on monday that bush would 
ignore the request 
the governors adjourned after a final session where washington 
state gov booth gardner a democrat was installed as the new 
chairman and gov john ashcroft of missouri a republican was 
named vice chairman 
in party caucuses democrats selected colorados roy romer and 
mississippis ray mabus as chairman and vice chairman of their 
democratic governors association

lawrence singleton changed his plea from innocent to no contest 
on the misdemeanor pettytheft charge 
i dont think i can get a fair trial i never have said

his highly publicized 1987 release 
a security guard in a suburban brandon drug store spotted 
singleton taking a 10 camera from a display on april 8 and heading

hillsborough county judge debra behnke imposed the maximum

the communist party won a wide 
majority in the nations first free legislative elections and 
invited opposition parties to join the cabinet the party chairman 
said tuesday 
a preliminary count of sundays election returns indicated the 
communists won about 60 percent of the 53 seats in the small hural 
one chamber of parliament said hurmetbek vice chairman of the 
national election commission like many mongolians he uses a 
single name 
the preliminary count also indicated that the communists won at 
least 343 seats in the great hural 
hurmetbek said new elections may be required for 28 great hural 
seats he said there were legal errors in three or four races and 
in the other cases neither candidate received ballots from a 
majority of eligible voters many voters apparently did not know 
how to mark the ballots because it was the first time they had to 
choose between candidates 
a communist victory had been guaranteed in the elections in this 
sovietbloc country because the five new opposition parties lacked 
the time to put up candidates for each seat 
the small hural will meet between the great hurals nearannual 
sessions and will draft legislation and make daytoday decisions 
from the results we could see that the mongolian people have 
great trust in the mongolian peoples revolutionary party party 
leader gombojavyn ochirbat told a news conference using the formal 
name of the communist party 
but he also said the communists were ready to open talks with 
the opposition and give them an unspecified number of seats in the 
new cabinet 
we believe that in the new government new political 
parties should be represented ochirbat said he said no date had 
been set to start talks with the opposition but they know about 
it that we are ready to negotiate 
he said the participation of opposition parties will be vital 
for political stability and national unity 
he said the governments first steps should be to make the 
election law more democratic and to revise the constitution and 
other laws to protect the media and religion 
mass protests and a hunger strike by prodemocracy demonstrators 
last winter and spring forced the communists to legalize opposition 
parties and agree to elections after decades of authoritarian rule 
batbayar chairman of the opposition social democratic party 
said the oppositions gain of about 40 percent of the seats in the 
small hural was a victory 
for a long time our people were under the exploitation of 
communism he said now we are just coming from the darkness 
into a bright future we think that anyway this election was the 
end of orthodox communism in mongolia 
but opposition parties have also said the balloting was not a 
true measure of the popular will 
the parties were legalized in may after the nominating process 
had begun more weight was given to rural votes which tended to 
favor the communists some opposition activists said local 
communist officials intimidated rural voters into supporting them 
the communists have ruled this remote central asian nation of 2 
million people since 1921 making it the worlds secondoldest 
communist state after the soviet union 
ochirbat maintained that the communists are committed to the 
same reforms as the opposition parties including replacing state 
economic planning with a marketstyle economy the government 
tentatively plans to begin freeing price controls for nonessential 
goods in january

a computerized databank of actions taken 
against incompetent physicians and dentists will open its 
electronic doors sept 1 health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan said tuesday 
the national practitioner databank is intended to prevent 
physicians and dentists who have been disciplined from moving to 
another state and setting up new practices without detection he 
said 
the databank will store reports of malpractice actions 
licensure disciplinary actions by state medical and dental boards 
and actions by professional societies hospitals and other health 
care entities after a formal peer review process 
the reports must be made beginning sept 1 actions taken before 
then do not have to be reported 
hospitals will be required to check the databank when a 
physician or dentist applies to join the medical staff or receive 
clinical privileges sullivan said 
also hospitals will be required to check the databank every two 
years concerning physicians and dentists on their medical staffs or 
those who have clinical privileges 
state licensing boards also will have access to the information 
and individual physicians dentists and other health care 
professionals will be able to see their own records attorneys 
representing a physician or dentist may have access under limited 
conditions 
charges for use of the databank will be 2 per name for each 
request however individual practitioners will not be charged for 
seeing his or her own file 
the ralph naderfounded group public citizen has been critical 
of the data bank because members of the public will not have access 
to the information and retroactive reporting will not be required 
the public citizen health research group recently put out its 
own information in a book called the 6892 questionable doctors 
disciplined by states or the federal government it lists the 
names of physicians and dentists who have been disciplined

police said three suspects showed no remorse 
tuesday when they were charged with murdering a 9monthold boy by 
blindly firing through a door to settle a dispute with the infants 
uncle 
an angry mayor david dinkins questioned about the fourth 
slaying of a child in the city in eight days asserted that the 
random violence does not mean the city is out of control 
this is not dodge city he declared 
gunmen went to an apartment in the bronx on monday and fired 
repeatedly through the door behind that door rayvon jamison sat 
in a childs walker and was struck by at least one of those 
shots said police commissioner lee brown 
brown said the three suspects under arrest were trying to gun 
down the infants uncle joseph jamison 
he was the object of the shooting the child was the victim of 
the senseless violence said brown 
jamison and eight others including the victims mother and 
grandmother were inside the apartment when the baby was shot 
jamison 29 had chastised one of the suspects last thursday for 
a throwing a bottle and animosity had escalated over the weekend 
brown said 
the petty nature of the dispute adds to the tragedy of this 
shooting brown said it also gives a clear message that the 
value or the sanctity of life means little to someone who has easy 
access to weapons 
no remorse was shown by the three men when they learned of 
the childs death said police detective ellen hale 
the suspects were charged with seconddegree murder criminal 
possession of a deadly weapon and reckless endangerment brown 
said 
the three previous slayings of children all occurred in the 
borough of brooklyn veronica corales 9 was killed while sleeping 
in her parents car 3yearold ben williams died in his sleep when 
18 bullets were fired through the front door of his home and 
1yearold yaritimi fruto was fatally wounded by a gunman who also 
killed her father 
the rash of killings has put dinkins under pressure and the 
mayor reacted angrily to reporters who questioned his electionyear 
pledge to become the toughest mayor on crime in city history 
there is law and order things are not out of control and this 
is not dodge city said dinkins one cannot guard against the 
kind of random violence that occurred when they shot in these doors 
and took the lives of children 
despite dinkins assertion the city is on its way to a record 
number of homicides for the third straight year if projections 
hold up last years alltime high of 1905 murders will be 
surpassed this year 
the three under arrest were identified as anthony rupert 18 
and two cousins thane bobie west 18 and mike solomon 22

the house voted overwhelmingly tuesday to 
toughen criminal penalties for ripoffs by savings and loan 
officials and to create a special prosecutor and a national 
commission on the scandal 
the legislation was brought hastily to the full house so 
lawmakers could vote tough on sampl crime before they recess for the 
summer at weeks end it passed 4244 
the american taxpayers have been terrorized by thugs whose 
weapons were pens not guns said rep charles schumer dny 
if this measure is enacted there will be no more excuses for 
government inaction he said 
the agency overseeing the bailout of the thrift industry has 
said it will need up to 100 billion in fiscal 1991 alone to deal 
with the tidal wave of insolvencies 
the bill would increase the maximum prison terms up to life in 
prison for the worst offenders and boost fines that could be 
levied against individuals and institutions convicted of savings 
and loan crimes 
it also would create new felony categories to close loopholes 
for those who conceal assets from the government or who try to 
obstruct government inquiries into financial institutions and give 
the government new authority to go after the assets of failed sampls 
the bill would authorize adding 153 million to the federal 
governments law enforcement efforts and create a special 
counsel within the justice department to oversee a new financial 
institutions fraud unit 
it also would create a national commission opposed by president 
bush to examine the causes of the thrift crisis and propose steps 
to prevent its repetition 
banking committee chairman henry gonzalez dtexas one of the 
few to vote against the measure said proponents hoped the measure 
would fool the american people that the crisis was being solved 
what we have here is a bastard child with all the defects 
he argued gonzalez panel expert on the issue was bypassed by 
the house leadership in its push for swift electionyear action 
id say baloney but i dont even know if that word is 
sufficient to describe what is happening today said rep paul 
kanjorski dpa who joined gonzalez in his lonely criticism of 
the bill 
rep jim leach riowa acknowledged that the bill might be a 
bit overzealous but congress had to act the sampl operators had 
proven he said that you dont have to break into fort knox to 
steal the governments gold 
only reps craig washington dtexas and philip crane rill 
joined gonzalez and kanjorski in voting against the bill 
the senate passed its version of a savings and loan crackdown as 
part of an overall crime bill the two chambers must reconcile 
their differences before a bill can be sent to the president

if inquiring minds really want to know joan 
lunden is not leaving good morning america or getting a 
divorce or having an aliens baby 
she confided all this tuesday after telling viewers of abcs 
morning show that national enquirer reporters have been asking her 
colleagues if she seems troubled lately 
it was a preemptive strike she said afterwards i told 
them her colleagues i could either do that or just be a wimp and 
sit back and let them make up whatever they want and print it 
as far as i know this was just something we were checking out 
and weve no plans to run a story said ian calder editor of the 
tabloid paper in lantana fla 
during tuesdays show lunden speaking with cohost charles 
gibson said two freelance reporters working for the enquirer had 
been calling her colleagues and in one case one of them posed as 
an abc publicist 
she said the tabloid newshawks said things about her like we 
hear shes been acting strange lately crying on the set 
depressed she mockwhimpered and we want to know whats 
going on in her life 
she and her friends have been taking bets on what the enquirers 
story will be she said jokingly posing a multiplechoice question 
am i going to leave the show leave my husband or maybe have 
an alien baby and it turns out they apparently voted for my 
husband and i to get a divorce 
after the show she said she isnt leaving her toprated show 
and she and her husband michael krauss are not getting a divorce 
and im not having an alien baby 
the enquirer this week has a story with the headline friendly 
aliens altered my body and changed my life 
calder said the queries about lunden concerned problems her 
husband a tv producer has had due to lawsuits stemming from 
production bills for everyday a syndicated program on which 
lunden is hostess he said 
we had a tip that that caused some trouble between them 
said calder who denied that the freelancers checking out the tip 
posed as other than themselves 
i think what we were checking out was in the wake of the 
financial problems that her husband had had if this would affect 
the marriage he said as far as he knows he said it never 
came to anything 
there was no query about whether lunden and her husband who 
have three children were divorcing said calder 
no i think thats going too far as far as i know we never 
got a tip they were thinking about getting a divorce

scattered rain lower temperatures and 
shorter days helped firefighters battle more than 100 blazes that 
have burned more than 2 million acres of alaskan wildlands a 
spokeswoman said tuesday 
smaller fires burned in washington idaho oregon and california 
several days of cloudy skies and temperatures in the 50s and 60s 
across much of alaskas interior have reduced the intensity of many 
fires said sue mitchell a spokeswoman for the interagency fire 
information center 
and were having darkness at night now which really helps 
cool things down she said 
earlier this summer the sun was almost continually above the 
horizon and temperatures in some places were in the 90s drying out 
forests and tundra 
alaskas wildfire season began on july 1 as lightning strikes 
ignited dozens of blazes in remote regions 
on tuesday more than 100 fires burned across the state 
more than 827 firefighters battled the tok river fire near the 
town of tok 175 miles southeast of fairbanks the blaze has charred 
about 91200 acres 
crews have nearly surrounded the 142squaremile fire with a 
fire line mitchell said using bulldozers and hand tools crews 
have removed vegetation along more than 60 miles of fire line 
hoping to rob the advancing fire of fuel 
the states largest fire burned across 275000 acres along 
either side of the coleen river on the southern flank of the brooks 
range inside the arctic national wildlife refuge

the house armed services committee dealt a 
serious blow tuesday to president bushs hopes of building a fleet 
of 75 stealth bombers halting the program at the 15 b2s now under 
construction lawmakers said 
the committee meeting in private rejected an attempt to save 
the 75plane fleet at nearly 865 million each the radarevading 
bomber is the costliest plane ever built 
the death knells for the bomber began last week when the 
committees chairman rep les aspin dwis said he supported 
halting production at 15 planes 
monday night the panels procurement subcommittee eliminated 
funds for a 75bomber fleet the full committee voted 3420 tuesday 
to reject an amendment by rep ike skelton dmo to reverse the 
subcommittees action aspin told reporters 
separately the research and development subcommittee chopped 
nearly 2 billion from bushs 1991 budget request for the strategic 
defense initiative and eliminated research money for two nuclear 
missiles 
also meeting in private the subcommittee approved spending 29 
billion on sdi commonly known as star wars 
later in the day the full committee was expected to vote on the 
overall bill which would allocate 283 billion for defense in the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 
bush who in january proposed spending 307 billion on defense 
in fiscal 1991 had called for 47 billion for sdi a 900 million 
increase over the amount congress appropriated in fiscal 1990 
congressional support for the antimissile shield however has 
weakened significantly as the soviet threat fades overseas and 
economic problems rise at home 
earlier this month the senate armed services committee approved 
a fiscal 1991 defense bill that cut almost 1 billion from bushs 
sdi request 
to meet the houseapproved budget target of 283 billion for 
overall military spending the house committee has been forced to 
slash 24 billion from bushs request of early this year 
since thursday the six subcommittees have been making 
substantial reductions to meet the target and on tuesday the 
research panel focused on a handful of strategic programs 
bush had called for spending 548 million on the 
multiplewarhead mx missiles and on moving the missiles from silos 
to rail cars the fiscal 1991 budget also included 202 million for 
the singlewarhead midgetman 
the research subcommittee eliminated all research funds for the 
two missiles and instead created a 600 million advanced 
strategic missile pot for developing the next generation of 
missiles 
the panel also called on bush to report to the committee in 90 
days on which new missile the administration wants mx or 
midgetman and end the debate that has festered for years 
the research subcommittees actions came less than 24 hours 
after the armed services subcommittee on procurement and military 
nuclear systems eliminated 13 billion for financing the mx 
railgarrison program 
as for the b2 bush had proposed a fleet of 132 bombers last 
january in april the administration scaled its proposal back to 
75 
while making substantial cuts in strategic programs the panel 
rejected an effort by defense secretary dick cheney to kill the 
marine corps v22 osprey the tiltrotor aircraft that takes off 
like a helicopter but can fly like a plane 
the subcommittee approved 238 million for the osprey on 
monday the procurement subcommittee added somewhat less 165 
million for the v22

the justice department is reviewing the 
appeals court decision that upset oliver l norths irancontra 
convictions because of concern about its possible impact on future 
cases officials said tuesday 
in a 21 decision a panel of the us circuit court of appeals 
here ordered a witnessbywitness review of the evidence to 
determine if norths trial was influenced by congressional 
testimony he gave under a limited grant of immunity from 
prosecution 
the use immunity grant meant that the detailed descriptions 
of the irancontra affair that north gave congress couldnt be used 
against him as evidence in a criminal trial 
independent councsel lawrence e walshs office is considering 
whether to seek a rehearing of the case by the full 12member 
appellate court or to ask the supreme court to review the issue 
walsh has at least a month to decide 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said officials were 
concerned about the decisions impact on a limited number of cases 
where the government might want to prosecute someone whose 
congressional testimony received widespread publicity 
other department officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the new procedures could have wider implications particularly 
in cases where defendants receive limited immunity from courts or 
grand juries 
north a former national security council aide was convicted 
last year of three felonies including aiding and abetting the 
obstruction of congress and destruction of government documents 
gesell placed north on probation and ordered him to perform 1500 
hours of community service 
the appellate court held that us district judge gerhard a 
gesell should have conducted extensive hearings to determine if 
grand jurors witnesses and prosecutors were influenced by norths 
congressional testimony which was aired on network television 
gesell had held that the elaborate procedures that walsh imposed 
to shield grand jurors and his staff from the publicity prevented 
the case from being influenced by norths testimony 
walsh also placed under court seal evidence his investigation 
found before north appeared on capitol hill to prove that the case 
was derived independently from the congressional testimony 
as it stands the decision applies only to federal courts in the 
nations capital but those courts try many of the socalled 
political cases in which criminal defendants already have been 
subjects of congressional inquiries 
eramian said the department was conducting its own review of the 
july 20 decision 
he stressed that the justice department was not necessarily 
contemplating participation in any appeal under the independent 
counsel law the justice department could file a 
friendofthecourt brief to state its legal views on the case 
the appeals court panels majority set what federal prosecutors 
called a very high perhaps impossible standard for proving that 
evidence was not derived from testimony that a defendant gave under 
a limited immunity grant 
some legal experts say the north decision radically extends a 
1972 supreme court decision that bars prosecutors from introducing 
evidence that was derived in any way from testimony obtained as a 
result of limited immunity 
what they did in this case was to virtually change use 
immunity into transactional immunity under which the government 
agrees not to prosecute someone in return for their cooperation 
said g robert blakey a notre dame law professor who drafted the 
1970 use immunity statute 
the court in effect created a rule that once anything was 
disseminated as widely as norths testimony it necessarily 
affected the trial blakey said 
gerald caplan a george washington university law professor 
called the north decision sort of an ingenious way of overruling 
a supreme court decision from a group that would otherwise be 
thought to have a prosecution bias

the ruling laurence h silberman and david sentelle president 
carter appointed patricia wald the appellate courts chief judge 
who dissented from the decision 
the two majority judges simply let north off blakey said

campaign reforms approved by the senate 
envision new multimilliondollar public contributions to senate 
candidates at the same time taxpayers are cutting back donations to 
presidential campaigns 
the senate still debating the measure has approved provisions 
that include public financing of up to 20 million for broadcast 
time the money would be available to candidates who agree to stay 
within a spending limit 
also approved monday were other incentives to abide by the 
ceiling including postal discounts help in responding to 
interestgroup attacks and money to offset funds raised by an 
opponent who exceeds the spending limit 
the public money for the senate races would come from the 
existing and already strained fund for presidential campaigns 
taxpayers can choose to contribute to the fund by earmarking 1 
from their tax returns 
but contributions to the presidential campaign are dwindling 
the presidential fund is in trouble said fred eiland a 
spokesman for the federal election commission we have been 
saying since two years ago that there is a problem and that its 
going to be more serious and that congress needs to do something 
taxpayer participation in the presidential campaign fund reached 
an alltime high of 287 percent in 1980 and fell to a record low 
of 201 percent in 1988 the fec said 
donations to the fund dwindled from 336 million in 1987 to 
322 million in 1989 eiland said 
tax returns through may 1990 brought in about 25 million and 
the internal revenue service says relatively few returns are still 
expected from taxpayers given extensions 
the strain on the fund has been compounded by inflation as 
participation has dropped payouts to candidates have been rising 
each year to adjust for inflation 
the fec has advised the president congress and the treasury 
secretary that it expects a 202000 shortfall in 1992 when the 
presidential campaign is projected to cost about 184 million 
if no incumbent is seeking reelection in 1996 that could mean 
more candidates for both major parties the fec projects a 238 
million shortfall that year for an election expected to cost about 
270 million 
the fec paid out 178 million for the 1988 election as of may 
1990 there was a balance of 108 million in the presidential 
campaign fund

the aflcio voted tuesday to remain neutral on 
abortion but said it resented government intrusion into personal 
matters 
the overwhelming view of the council was that this was a 
matter of deep conscience conviction and religion lane 
kirkland president of the labor umbrella group told reporters 
the vote by the aflcios 35member executive council rejected a 
call from some members who wanted to back abortion rights in hopes 
it would help recruit women and minorities into the struggling 
labor movement 
we resent and resist government intrusion into matters that 
are essentially private the executive council said in a 
policy statement issued at the groups annual midsummer meeting 
the aflcio therefore adopts a carefully considered policy 
of deferring to the individual judgments of its affiliates and 
their members on abortion said the statement issued by the 
governing board 
three members of the council dissented during the voice vote 
in voting to remain neutral the council adopted the 
recommendation of an 18member panel of aflcio union presidents 
kirkland declined to speculate at a news conference about 
whether a prochoice vote would have helped expand the 142 
millionmember organization 
the group has never in its 35year history voted on abortion 
rights he said 
there was no organized move afoot for the federation to condemn 
abortion 
however the national right to life committee and cardinal john 
j oconnor of the roman catholic archdiocese of new york had 
campaigned against the aflcio taking a stand 
they noted that a recent supreme court decision gives union 
members the right to withhold dues spent on political issues 
many union leaders interpreted that campaign as a threat by the 
committee and oconnor that they would lobby members to withhold 
union dues if the aflcio went prochoice 
we received a very large volume of mail on both sides of the 
issue kirkland said we dont regard that as pressure you 
only have pressure if you feel pressure 
on other issues the aflcios governing body voted to 
support president bushs call for new taxes to raise revenue 
and curb the budget deficit but new revenues should be sought 
through higher bracket rates for the wealthy and corporations as 
well as higher taxes on inherited wealth the union said 
oppose proposals such as a national valueadded tax or raising 
excise taxes on cigarettes beer and social security benefits the 
union also said it opposes efforts to eliminate or reduce the 
federal deduction for state and local taxes 
support an individual federal campaign contribution limit of 
100 per candidate and 1000 per year coupled with a ban on all 
political action committees

a group of democratic senators introducing a 
package of bills tuesday to improve medical research on women said 
women have been illserved in a medical system that is dominated by 
men 
rep barbara mikulski dmd leader of the effort said women 
have been ignored in a disgraceful pattern of neglect 
she pointed to the national institutes of health where she said 
13 percent of funds are spent on womens health research and few 
women are included in clinical trials testing experimental drugs 
and procedures 
even though heart disease is the no 1 killer of women nearly 
all the heart disease research is done on men she said also the 
breast cancer death rate is rising but no one knows why she 
said 
clearly there has been an imbalance said sen paul simon 
dill 
this gender bias must be corrected said sen brock adams 
dwash what were really talking about is womens lives 
two proposals to create an nih office for womens health 
research and development and require that more women be included in 
clinical trials were to be offered as amendments to a bill 
reauthorizing nih the bill was to be taken up by the senate labor 
and human resources committee on wednesday 
other bills in the package would broaden research on 
contraception infertility aids in women breast cancer and 
osteoporosis improve and broaden health education programs for 
women and offer more screening for early detection of cancer 
similar legislation is pending in the house 
the package would cost about 240 million which mikulski said 
was a very modest amount but she said she did not expect all 
of the bills to pass this year

prices farmers get for raw products were 
unchanged from june to july but the overall commodity index was 
still 27 percent above a year ago the agriculture department said 
tuesday 
prices were higher during the month for lettuce apples and 
milk but declines were reported for cattle wheat and eggs the 
departments agricultural statistics board said in its preliminary 
report 
most prices are midjuly averages which will be revised next 
month for example the latest report showed june prices dropped 2 
percent instead of the 13 percent decline indicated a month ago 
the report also showed prices farmers pay to meet expenses were 
up 05 percent from april when the previous estimate was made and 
34 percent above july 1989 the prices paid index is computed 
quarterly 
meanwhile department economists say consumer food prices are 
going up much faster this year than the earlier prediction of 3 
percent to 5 percent 
ralph l parlett jr of the departments economic research 
service said in a telephone interview that a new 1990 forecast due 
out in august will put us right back to the early 1980s when 
retail food prices were climbing steeply 
according to usda records annual food price increases were 86 
percent in 1980 and 79 percent in 1981 before slowing their upward 
rise in the next few years 
parlett did not disclose the new forecast but indicated the 1990 
increase would probably exceed 6 percent food prices rose 58 
percent in 1989 the most since 1981 
its obvious that 3to5 percent forecast is out in left 
field he said beef and pork thats whats doing it pork 
particularly 
recent forecasts show the net cash income of farmers in the 
range of 55 billion to 59 billion compared with about 54 
billion in 1989 the record was 572 billion in 1988 
net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
in another method taking into account changes in inventories 
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that 
1990 net farm income may be in a range of 47 billion to 51 
billion compared with 49 billion last year 
based on the preliminary figures the july price index for 
livestock and poultry dropped 12 percent from june but still 
averaged 89 percent more than a year ago meat animals were down 
15 percent from june but averaged 11 percent more than in june 
1989 
milk prices rose 30 cents in july to an average of 1410 per 
l00 pounds that was up 150 from july 1989 the farm price of 
milk rose to a record 16 per hundredweight in december before 
easing down 
crop prices overall rose 16 percent from june but averaged 
44 percent below the yearearlier level 
vegetable prices rose 20 percent from june but were down 14 
percent from a year earlier lettuce tomatoes and sweet corn led 
the july increase 
fruit prices were up 79 percent from june and 13 percent above 
a year ago apples grapefruit and peaches rose in july while 
oranges pears and lemons were down 
wheat prices pressured by a bumper harvest dropped 27 cents 
during the month to 281 per bushel 
feed grains declined with corn prices down two cents from june 
to 261 per bushel 
the report said 
cattle averaged 97 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
down from 9810 in june but up from 9460 in july 1989 those are 
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 6010 per 100 pounds unchanged from june but up 
from 4590 in july 1989 
corn at 261 a bushel was down from 263 in june but up 
from 247 a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 281 per bushel compared with 308 in june and 378 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 710 per 100 pounds compared with 708 in june 
and 745 in july 1989 
soybeans were 588 per bushel unchanged from june but down 
from 683 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 637 cents per pound compared 
with 623 in june and 595 a year earlier

too little is known about the risk of an 
explosion that could rupture nuclear waste tanks at the hanford 
weapons plant in washington state a government advisory panel said 
tuesday 
the possibility of a blast may be greater than plant operators 
acknowledge because there is only sketchy information on 
conditions in the tanks said the energy departments advisory 
committee on nuclear facility safety 
the hanford tanks present a serious situation if not an 
imminent hazard the committee said 
the 177 underground tanks at hanford in southcentral washington 
state hold thousands of gallons of highly radioactive sludge from 
decades of plutonium production at the weapons plant 
officials last march said they were concerned because an 
explosion could be triggered by an accumulation of hydrogen or 
other unknown chemical reactions in some of the 20 doublewalled 
tanks at the facility 
leo duffy who heads government cleanup efforts at atomic 
weapons facilities said tuesday the chance of an explosion is low 
but is still a serious problem 
highly radioactive wastes also are stored in tanks at the 
savannah river weapons plant near aiken sc and at a plant near 
west valley ny but those tanks contain different chemicals and 
do not pose the same risks as the tanks at hanford energy 
department officials have said 
westinghouse hanford co which runs the 560squaremile 
facility in southcentral washington has played down the 
possibility of an explosion 
but the energy department panel suggested in a letter to energy 
secretary james watkins that the hanford operators may have 
incomplete or incorrect information 
the technical basis for the analysis from which the hanford 
operator draws comfort about the safety of the tanks is weak 
considering the potential consequences the panel said each 
successive review of the hanford tanks indicates that the situation 
is a little worse 
the panel made the assessment in a july 23 letter to watkins 
made public by the senate governmental affairs committee on tuesday 
john ahearne chairman of the advisory panel declined to 
characterize the risk of an explosion because of the lack of 
information 
he said no one knows what chemical combinations are in the tanks 
and unreliable temperature sensors may be misleading 
there is an urgent need to determine what is in the tanks 
what are the risks and what actions should be taken to ameliorate 
the hazards the advisory panel report said 
an accident involving similarly stored wastes in the soviet 
union in 1957 released huge amounts of radiation and contaminated 
an area covering hundreds of square miles forcing the evacuation 
of 10000 people to this day children are not allowed near the 
areas that were heavily contaminated and agricultural crops from 
the region are not allowed to be sold elsewhere officials said 
but duffy said the soviet site is not the same as the hanford 
plant 
we have a huge gap here were trying to find out whats in 
the existing tanks duffy said 
sen brock adams dwash calling for more investigation said 
the energy department and plant operators remind him of three 
witches with a bubbling caldron saying bubble bubble toil and 
trouble theyre stirring it and dont seem to know whats in 
there

released tuesday by the ac nielsen co a rating point represents 
921000 households 
it also was no 1 in every target demographic group said david 
marans a vice president for media research at the j walter 
thompson advertising agency in overall ratings abc pulled even 
with nbc the perennial winner both averaged an 89 rating for the 
week cbs was third at 84 but each averaged only a 17 share or 
17 percent of the televisions in use in prime time 
that meant hardly anyone was watching marans said 
the three networks share was a 51 for the week thats among 
the lowest if not the lowest ever recorded he said they 
received about half the available viewers that has to be a cause 
for heartache for them

under the pressure of a lawsuit filed by four 
major newspapers the national endowment for the arts reversed 
itself tuesday and announced that a meeting of its advisory council 
to review controversial grant decisions will be open to the public 
chairman john e frohnmayer abandoned plans for a news blackout 
of the council sessions later this week after the los angeles 
times the new york times the washington post and the philadelphia 
inquirer sued the nea in us district court on monday 
it is highly unusual for any agency of the federal government 
to conduct application review in the glare of public scrutiny 
frohnmayer said in a statement but i am convinced that there are 
significant advantages to having our citizens aware of how this 
small amount of their money is invested in cultural activities all 
americans enjoy as a result of the endowment 
the nea is an independent federal agency with a budget of 171 
million most of which supports a wide variety of artists and arts 
institutions with federal grants that must be matched by private 
funds 
the 26member national council on the arts the endowments 
presidentially appointed advisory body plans to begin a threeday 
meeting here friday in the past its meetings have been open to 
the public except for sessions devoted to reviewing grant 
applications recommended by the neas panels of outside arts 
experts on theater dance music and other disciplines 
as late as monday frohnmayer had insisted that the councils 
grantreview sessions would be closed but on tuesday he said he 
decided to lift the news blackout partly because a majority of 
council members had voted at their last meeting in may to open the 
sessions 
in their lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order against 
the nea the four newspapers said a news blackout would prevent the 
public from observing the council as it reconsiders frohnmayers 
veto of panelapproved grants to four controversial avantgarde 
theater performers in late june 
after frohnmayers announcement the newspapers lawyers 
withdrew the lawsuit 
one of the lawyers patrick j carome had said earlier that the 
nea was acting as if theyre giving away private money when in 
fact its taxpayer dollars arts supporters said the public is 
entitled to know how its tax money is being spent 
at the council meetings this weekend frohnmayer also was 
expected to ask the council to reconsider its recommendation that 
he reject two grants to the institute of contemporary art in 
philadelphia he said the councils discussion of the grants in may 
was inadequate and its information was incomplete 
it was the same philadelphia institute that started the current 
nea controversy when it used endowment funds to organize a 
traveling exhibition of sexually explicit works by the late 
photographer robert mapplethorpe 
last fall at the urging of sen jesse helms rnc and other 
nea critics congress voted to prohibit federal support for any 
artistic works that may be considered obscene and include 
depiction of sex acts sadomasochism homoeroticism or sexual 
exploitation of children 
frohnmayer told an independent commission created by congress to 
study the neas grantmaking procedures that he still opposes 
legislation to restrict the content of federally supported art 
but the endowments chairman said he believes that an arts 
project that is so offensive that it simply leads to 
confrontation and solidification of positions should not receive 
government support 
frohnmayer has issued guidelines to nea grant applicants to 
refrain from using federal funds to create works that might violate 
the supreme courts 1973 obscenity standards he told the 
commission monday that he could accept a law imposing penalties on 
nea grant recipients who are convicted on obscenity charges

health sector instead of barring them from private practice

the brotherinlaw of a former mexican 
president was found guilty tuesday of racketeering kidnapping and 
conspiracy in the death of us drug agent enrique camarena 
ruben zuno arce a successful guadalajara businessman was the 
third defendant to be found guilty in a trial which sought to place 
blame on many in the 1985 kidnapmurder of camarena and his pilot 
alfredo zavala avelar he wasnt charged with murder 
the case has strained relations between mexico and the united 
states because of us officials allegations of complicity between 
mexican officials and drug dealers 
prosecutors said the slayings were revenge for drug enforcement 
administration raids on marijuana and cocaine plantations that cost 
the drug barons 5 billion in profits 
zuno is the brotherinlaw of luis echeverria the former 
president of mexico his lawyers maintained he had nothing to do 
with the camarena affair and merely had the bad luck to sell his 
guadalajara home to a drug kingpin who used the place as a torture 
chamber 
the key evidence against zuno came from two government 
informants who were former mexican policemen one of them told of 
seeing zuno at a meeting in which drug barons discussed the need to 
kidnap a drug enforcement agent 
the other witness told of alleged drug trade activities by zuno 
his lawyers claimed he was an upstanding businessman without ties 
to the underworld 
the same jurors previously convicted two other defendants of 
racketeering and kidnapping 
juan jose bernabe ramirez a former mexican policeman was found 
guilty of kidnapping but innocent of murder on monday last week 
reputed drug baron juan ramon matta ballesteros was convicted of 
the camarena kidnapping but the jury also declined to convict him 
of murder 
one verdict remains pending against javier vasquez velasco who 
is accused of murdering two american tourists in an apparent 
mistake killing 
jurors resumed their deliberations tuesday afternoon following 
announcement of the verdicts and lawyers were told by us district 
judge edward rafeedie to refrain from commenting until all the 
verdicts were in 
rafeedie scheduled sentencing for zuno on sept 18 zuno faces a 
maximum sentence of life in prison 
the 31yearold camarena was kidnapped off a guadalajara street 
in february 1985 testimony showed the agent was tortured and 
interrogated by drug lords before being slain along with avelar 
their bodies were found a month later on a ranch 65 miles from 
guadalajara 
the trial was the second stemming from the camarena murder 
which strained usmexican relations and embarrassed mexico with 
testimony about dealings between corrupt law enforcement officers 
and drug dealers 
in a 1988 los angeles federal trial two defendants were 
convicted of multiple charges including murder in the camarena 
case and a third defendant was convicted of aiding the escape of 
mexican drug lord rafael caro quintero 
the dea has vowed to capture every person involved in the 
slaying so far 22 people have been charged in this country over 
20 have been imprisoned in mexico

the secretary said ive got some questions i want them 
answered williams said the inspector generals office is 
conducting what i would characterize as a limited investigation of 
the a12 schedule and cost projections 
the aircraft has been the focus of some controversy since the 
navy announced earlier this year that it was a year behind schedule 
a delay widely interpreted as foreshadowing extra costs 
the announcement amounted to an embarrassment for cheney because 
he had ordered a monthslong review of the militarys costliest 
aircraft programs but the study had failed to turn up any such 
problems 
meanwhile both the house and senate armed service committees 
have moved to pare funding for the program 
and navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii ordered his own 
personnel to look into the problems 
the navy study is somewhat broader than the pentagons 
williams said 
theyre looking at program management techniques theyre 
looking at cost schedules when this information became available 
that sort of thing the spokesman said he said officials were 
closely coordinating their work for both studies 
officials at mcdonnell douglas corp and general dynamics corp 
the planes contractors have reported that the first flight of the 
plane would be delayed until late 1991 
the problems reportedly involve the planes composite materials 
which save weight and lower radar reflections but are very 
difficult to fabricate into aircraft parts 
following his review of aircraft programs cheney announced in 
april that he was sharply cutting the proposed a12 purchase 
although the navy had originally planned to buy 858 of the 
longrange carrierbased aircraft the secretary said he 
envisioned buying 620 
no cost for the supersecret program has been made public but 
it has been reported that the plane was being developed under a 
48 billion fixed price contract and extended production could run 
upwards of 55 billion 
one of the problems youre faced with from time to time in 
this business is the problems of cost overruns and slips in 
schedule but obviously i was not happy with the way the a12 
thing was handled cheney said in june

raise badlyneeded hard currency 
those released under the deals were allowed to take their 
families with them to the west starting in the 1970s those 
released also included people jailed for trying to flee to the

one of three former northwest airlines pilots 
accused of flying while intoxicated doesnt get drunk easily 
because he is an alcoholic his lawyer said tuesday at his trial 
a person who consumes alcohol builds up a tolerance to 
alcohol your body resists the effects of alcohol attorney peter 
wold said referring to his client capt norman lyle prouse 
prouse is not a skid row drunk and had no trouble flying a 
boeing 727 from fargo nd to minneapolis march 8 despite 
evidence that he consumed at least 17 rum and diet cokes the night 
before wold said in his opening argument 
prouse of conyers ga 1st officer robert kirchner of 
highland ranch colo and flight engineer joseph balzer of 
antioch tenn are charged with operating the aircraft while under 
the influence of alcohol the federal felony carries a maximum 
penalty of 15 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
prouse had been drinking for 35 years and entered a treatment 
program after his arrest wold said 
assistant us attorney elizabeth de la vega said in her opening 
statement tuesday that while the pilots may not have been 
staggering drunk results of bloodalcohol tests will show their 
skills were seriously impaired 
all three pilots had bloodalcohol contents exceeding 04 
percent the federal aviation administrations limit for flying 
according to test results admitted tuesday as evidence 
defense attorneys said tuesday that the flight carrying 91 
passengers went flawlessly 
the issue is not what his condition was the night before or 
what his alcohol content was the next day wold said the 
government must show their abilities were impaired 
there were no problems with altitude no problems with 
direction no problems with speed said william mauzy the 
attorney for kirchner you cant fake a perfect landing 
wold said he would introduce as evidence radar tapes and tapes 
of conversations between the pilots and air traffic controllers so 
the jury could judge their responses 
the blood tests showed prouse still had the equivalent of eight 
drinks in his system after the plane departed at about 625 am 
the tests found kirchner and balzer had the equivalent of three 
beers each still in their systems said de la vega 
a bar patron tipped the faa and northwest that the crew drank 
heavily at a bar in moorhead minn adjacent to fargo according 
to court records 
an faa investigator has testified the crew smelled of alcohol 
when they arrived late at the departure gate while the 
investigator phoned for instructions on how to handle the 
situation the plane departed 
an faa official made citizens arrests when the plane landed at 
the minneapolisst paul international airport 
northwest fired the three for violating a rule prohibiting 
drinking within 12 hours of a scheduled flight the faa revoked 
their pilots licenses 
according to bills from the speak easy bar introduced as 
evidence prouse ordered 15 rum and diet cokes while kirchner and 
balzer shared seven pitchers of beer over about six hours 
kathryn litch a waitress at the bar said other patrons bought 
kirchner and balzer another pitcher of beer and that prouse drank 
at least 2 more drinks after kirchner and balzer left about 1040 
pm 
the flight left about eight hours later 
us district court judge james rosenbaum has said the trial is 
expected to last about two weeks

the governmentsponsored student loan 
marketing association said tuesday it was pumping another 200 
million into a troubled student loan guarantee agency 
the loan to the higher education assistance fund heaf buys 
time for government officials who are trying to arrange a takeover 
to avoid a default by the fund the association known as sallie 
mae had loaned the fund 200 million previously 
heaf based in overland park kan is the largest of 47 state 
or private nonprofit agencies guaranteeing student loans a week 
ago it disclosed that it was in danger of defaulting on its claims 
officials from the education department and the office of 
management and budget have been trying to avoid that by arranging 
for another guarantee agency or sallie mae to take over heaf 
they had said they hoped to resolve heafs problems this week 
but etta fielek a spokeswoman for the education department said 
the new loan will carry heaf into the 1991 fiscal year starting 
oct 1 
were pleased with this arrangement because it provides a 
stable period during which the negotiations can continue she 
said 
sallie mae said in a statement it was making the loan as a 
result of discussions with the department of education and that 
it had received assurances from the department as to its 
continued payment of heafs claims which provide the 
collateral 
the education department fully reimburses most of the guarantee 
agencies for student loan defaults but provides only partial 
reimbursement to heaf and others with a record of guaranteeing too 
many bad loans 
fielek said the loan from sallie mae will allow heaf to withhold 
about 300 million in claims until the next fiscal year thus the 
guarantee agency will get 100 percent reimbursement from the 
education department for those claims instead of 80 percent 
sallie mae which is federally chartered but shareholder owned 
finances about four of every 10 student loans by purchasing the 
loans from banks and other lenders 
we believe the action we are taking today will be both helpful 
to assuring stability in the education credit market we serve and 
in the best interest of our shareholders said lawrence a hough 
sallie mae president

parliament in the central republic 
of bosniahercegovina on tuesday adopted amendments to its 
constitution calling for free multiparty elections in november the 
state news agency reported 
under the amendments passed by the regional assembly 
bosniahercegovina has become a sovereign and democratic state of 
equal citizens tanjug said 
multiparty elections are scheduled to be held nov 30 the new 
parliament is likely to meet before the end of the year tanjug 
said 
the adoption of the amendments enabling the holding of free 
elections has been in line with similar steps already taken or 
under way in other yugoslav republics 
the liberal republics of slovenia and croatia held free 
elections earlier this year in which centerright parties won the 
majority those elections marked the first free balloting in 
yugoslavia in 50 years 
serbia the largest of yugoslavias six republics has so far 
resisted a multiparty system and serbians recently voted in a 
referendum for free elections to be postponed until after a new 
constitution is adopted 
serbia will be the last republic to hold free elections 
probably next year 
a new law adopted by the serbian parliament in july permits 
the formation and registration of political parties in the republic 
but bans political activity in factories and at the workplace 
the move marked the first tentative step by yugoslavias 
conservative republic toward a multiparty system 
in a related development tuesday the assembly of the southern 
republic of montenegro also adopted amendments to its constitution 
introducing political pluralism tanjug said 
elections are to be held in the republics of montenegro and 
macedonia this year

as the second summer of cleanup from 
the exxon valdez oil spill nears an end disputes are arising about 
whether a third summers work will be necessary 
the coast guards highestranking officer commandant adm j 
william kime said sunday after a visit to prince william sound 
that he saw enough oil to warrant the return of cleanup crews next 
summer 
but exxon officials and others in the coast guard think kimes 
assessment is premature 
there is a good likelihood no future work will be required in 
1991 exxon spokesman karsten rodvik said tuesday 
more than 1000 people are working on the cleanup according to 
exxon which counts office workers and other shore personnel in 
that total 
the effort to mop up whats left of 11 million gallons of heavy 
crude oil uses 31 aircraft and 66 boats 
exxon spokesman frank dobbs said cleanup efforts were ahead of 
schedule everywhere but on kodiak island where he said erratic 
weather had hindered crews 
by tuesday crews had finished cleaning 488 of about 600 
targeted sites dobbs said 
exxon plans to begin scaling back operations in prince william 
sound on aug 15 based on the onset of winter weather last year 
it will continue working through midseptember in the gulf of 
alaska 
exxon wants to wait until after a shorline survey next spring to 
decide if more work is needed rodvik said based on what happend 
last winter when storms and daily tides washed away much of the 
oil the company said theres a chance crews wont have to return 
in 1991 
commissioner dennis kelso of the states department of 
environmental conservation and environmental protection agency 
chief william reilly have already said the cleanup should continue 
next summer

rail authorities suspended shipments to the 
southern republic of georgia because a political protest and strike 
have halted virtually all trains traveling into the republic 
soviet media reported tuesday 
georgian activists began blocking the key railway junction of 
samtredia six days ago to protest what they see as georgian 
officials attempts to block fair multiparty elections scheduled 
for october 
nearly 200 trains carrying 500000 tons of cargo are stranded 
and 40000 passengers have been kept waiting according to the 
official news agency tass and soviet television news 
on tuesday locomotive drivers in the black sea town of sukhumi 
went on strike blocking all rail traffic on the coast the 
georgian capital of tbilisi is also blocked the evening news show 
vremya reported 
as a result officials decided to ship food gasoline coal and 
ore meant for georgia to the other 14 republics 
it is a harsh action in a country where everything is in short 
supply 
however rail authorities failure to alter train shipments in 
the face of azerbaijans blockade of armenia last year led to 
hundreds of trains backing up on the rails to the caucasus that 
in turn caused a shortage of railcars throughout the nation 
thousands of tons of food shipments rotted 
the blockade also threatens the harvest in the farming areas of 
georgia and armenia which produce much of the soviet unions fresh 
fruits and vegetables the interfax and tass news agencies reported 
tuesday 
the georgian blockade is particularly dangerous for armenia 
with the georgian link disrupted armenia is dependent on lines 
through azerbaijan which were cut for two months last year as part 
of the two republics deadly territorial dispute

the military announced tuesday 
it was disbanding a controversial secret unit that opposition 
leaders claimed was involved in the unsolved killings of 
antiapartheid activists 
opponents of the whiteminority government had been demanding 
president fw de klerk disband the militarys civil cooperation 
bureau as a signal that he was serious about curbing abuses by the 
countrys security forces 
the chief of the defense forces gen jannie geldenhuys said 
the civil cooperation bureau was being closed down and members were 
being transferred to regular army units 
geldenhuys gave no reason for the decision 
opposition activists have accused the civil cooperation bureau 
and other branches of the security forces of involvement in the 
killings of dozens of antiapartheid figures in recent years 
antiapartheid leaders welcomed the governments decision 
the bureau was made up of people trained to kill people 
with tremendous vested interests in the status quo and with an 
interest in derailing the present blackwhite negotiating 
process said denis worrall a coleader of the liberal 
democratic party 
murphy morobe spokesman for the antiapartheid united 
democratic front said the important thing is whether the 
bureau has really been disbanded or whether it will be transformed 
into the same beast under another guise 
de klerk appointed a judicial commission in march to investigate 
the killings of antiapartheid activists 
during weeks of testimony top military officials have 
acknowledged that the bureau formed in the mid1980s bombed 
antiapartheid targets the bureau also has claimed responsibility 
for delivering a baboon fetus to the home of anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize 
but military officials have denied bureau involvement in 
killings of opposition figures 
the military has said the bureau had 139 members and an annual 
budget of 11 million and was engaged in highly sensitive 
intelligence gathering operations in south africa and abroad 
however defense minister magnus malan and other top military 
officials have claimed they didnt know about the bureau until last 
november 
the judicial hearing into the unsolved killings of 
antiapartheid activists was scheduled to resume wednesday after a 
sixweek break 
in the past year former policemen have said they were part of 
authorized death squads that killed antiapartheid figures police 
have denied authorizing any killings 
there has been no evidence directly linking the civil 
cooperation bureau to the alleged police death squads 
since assuming power last year de klerk has downgraded the role 
of the security establishment which figured far more prominently 
under his predecessor pw botha 
de klerk says he wants to end the countrys apartheid system of 
racial segregation and negotiate a powersharing agreement between 
the 5 million whites and 30 million blacks

the justice department knows very little 
about the 55 billion of unpaid debts other government agencies 
have referred to 94 us attorneys for collection auditors told 
congress tuesday 
a general accounting office review of the governments 
debtcollection program found that the justice department has yet 
to put in place a system to keep track of the growing number of 
referrals of unpaid debts by other agencies 
our main concern is whether justice has adequate systems and 
plans for collecting this aging and growing debt gao auditor 
lowell dodge told the house govermnent operations subcommittee on 
government information justice and agriculture 
the subcommittee chairman rep robert e wise jr dwva 
asked justice department officials to consider a policy of 
prohibiting travel by criminal defendants who owe large fines 
wise cited the case of former deputy white house chief of staff 
michael k deaver who received court permission earlier this year 
to take his family on an eightday trip to the bahamas 
deaver who was convicted of lying under oath about his lobbying 
activities after leaving the white house was fined 100000 and 
placed on probation he was given until april 1992 to pay the fine 
and has asked the court to reduce it to 25000 
when the probation department recommended that deaver be given 
permission to take the trip it noted that he had paid only 2350 
of the fine according to court records produced by wises staff 
justice department officials said they would consider working 
with court and probation officials to adopt a travel policy for 
people who owe criminal fines 
in its review gao found that the amount of uncollected debts 
owed government agencies is growing rapidly debts that were 
delinquent for at least a year grew from some 12 billion in 1983 
to about 28 billion last year gao said 
during the 1989 fiscal year the nations us attorneys 
collected 216 million while the departments civil division which 
litigates larger debts had collected 346 million 
but gao said it didnt know the status of most of 55 billion 
worth of debt referred for collection to us attorneys 
the justice department has information on the 11 billion it 
has entered into its debtcollection system but it knows very 
little about the 55 billion which has been referred to various 
us attorneys and is still in processing or litigation dodge 
said 
justice does not have a system for tracking all referrals 
dodge said 
the justice department failed to report to the office of 
management and budget as planned during the 1989 on longrange 
plans for consolidating debt collection gao said 
justice department officials have started to implement a 
central door program to keep track of all debts referred from 
other agencies but dodge said that the department does not have a 
written plan to make changes in its computer and accounting systems 
we are concerned about whether justices informal planning 
approach will be successful dodge said 
robert ford a deputy assistant attorney general for 
debtcollection management testified that the agency has collected 
35 billion since 1982

cincinnati bengals cornerback lewis billups 
will have to serve 30 days in jail for pointing a gun at two 
undercover police officers a cincinnati judge said tuesday 
but because of the backlog in serving misdemeanor sentences the 
football player probably wont have to begin his term until late 
january or early february hamilton county common pleas judge ralph 
winkler said 
winkler sentenced billups to 30 days in the hamilton county 
justice center on two counts of aggravated menacing and fined him 
1000 and court costs he also sentenced billups to 180 days in 
jail but suspended 150 days of that sentence on a third 
misdemeanor count of improper handling of a firearm while in a 
motor vehicle 
all three sentences will be served concurrently 
winkler said that even if jail space becomes available during 
the national football league season he would delay billups jail 
time 
billups 25 is a fouryear veteran the bengals drafted in 1986 
from north alabama he is involved with a contract dispute with the 
bengals and has not reported to their training camp at wilmington 
college 
all of the charges stem from a jan 4 incident when two 
cincinnati police officers said that billups pointed a pistol at 
them then led them on a highspeed chase into suburban northern 
kentucky where billups lives 
billups had pleaded guilty to the three firstdegree misdemeanor 
charges and ohio prosecutors dropped a felony charge of carrying a 
concealed weapon

a state judge on tuesday ordered an insurance 
company to pay for a bone marrow transplant that doctors said may 
save the life of a man with an aidsrelated illness 
supreme court justice elliott wilk rejected the contention by 
empire blue cross and blue shield that the operation used for 
years to treat people with impaired immune systems was 
experimental when used to treat aids 
wilk issued a preliminary order directing empire blue cross and 
blue shield to pay the estimated 150000 cost of the operation for 
thomas bradley 
his physician dr h kent holland of johns hopkins oncology 
center in baltimore said in a sworn statement that bradleys 
condition was deteriorating and that the new york man could soon 
become too weak to survive the transplant 
time is therefore of the essence holland said 
bradley 46 was about to undergo the operation earlier this 
month when the insurance company notified him it would not cover 
experimental procedures 
wilks decision sends a message that a treatment doesnt 
become experimental all over again just because its being used to 
treat aids said bradleys lawyer evan wolfson 
the insurance company said in a statement that it would consider 
appealing the ruling 
despite our real sympathy for mr bradley we have an 
obligation to safeguard the resources entrusted to us by millions 
of subscribers to cover medical care thats been proven beneficial 
and appropriate said spokesman john kelly 
bradley an administrator in the suffolk county school district 
of bayportblue point wanted to have bone marrow transplant as 
soon as possible said wolfson 
bradley had a 90 percent chance of surviving the operation 
which could extend his life by at least two years holland said in 
his statement 
his donor is his identical twin bob a teacher in the same 
district doctors said the fact that the two are identical twins 
should greatly enhance the chances for success 
bradley learned he was infected with hiv the virus that causes 
aids in 1986 and has a severely depressed immune system he was 
diagnosed with aidsrelated condition or arc because he has 
suffered the specific opportunistic infections listed by the 
centers for disease control as defining aids wolfson said 
johns hopkins spokeswoman valerie mehl said six people with aids 
have undergone bone marrow transplants at the baltimore center in 
the past 18 months two have since died of causes unrelated to the 
operation she said

leaders of the palestinian uprising said 
tuesday they were forming a higher judicial committee to try to 
reduce the killings by palestinians of arabs suspected of 
collaborating with israel 
the announcement came in a leaflet distributed in the occupied 
territories and signaled the first national institution to be 
founded for the wouldbe state of palestine 
the insurgency against israeli occupation in the west bank and 
gaza strip began in december 1987 and is backed by the palestine 
liberation organization 
leaders of the uprising acted amid a rise in the murders of 
palestinians suspected of collaborating with israeli authorities 
in july palestinians killed 15 fellow arabs for informing or 
collaborating in other ways according to figures compiled by the 
associated press 
in contrast three palestinians died in july as a result of 
clashes with israeli troops and a fourth arab was killed in a 
prison breakout according to the israeli information center for 
human rights in the occupied territories 
the four fatalities constitute the lowest onemonth death toll 
since the uprising began officials at the human right group said 
during the uprising 725 palestinians have been killed by 
israeli soldiers and civilians and 45 israelis have been killed by 
palestinians a further 243 palestinians were slain by fellow 
arabs most on suspicion of collaborating 
the judicial committee appeared to be a first step by local 
palestinians toward creating a bureaucracy to deal with internal 
problems 
most palestinians reject dealings with israeli police and 
military courts especially after the plo declared an independent 
state in the occupied lands in 1988 
israel rejects formation of a palestinian state many third 
world countries recognize the wouldbe state but not major western 
governments 
the leaflet said the higher judicial committee will establish 
legal procedures for the state of palestine including those which 
pertain to interrogations of suspected collaborators 
it said operating details would be announced later but 
meanwhile correct methods should be used in interrogations and 
members of one faction should not investigate the activities of 
other factions 
the leaflet condemned torture in interrogations saying it is 
incomprehensible that we should use such methods when we ourselves 
are the victims of such methods at the hands of the israelis 
palestinians repeatedly complain of israeli beatings solitary 
confinement and other punishment to force confessions israel 
denies using torture 
many suspected collaborators were brutally killed after harsh 
interrogations 
radwan abu ayyash chief of the arab journalists association in 
the west bank said a judicial committee likely would be made up of 
lawyers and traditional village judges who would investigate 
incidents and determine what kind of action should be taken 
he suggested such a panel could deal with land disputes theft 
and the like as well as cases of suspected collaborators 
in other developments tuesday 
three palestinian truck drivers from jericho in the west bank 
were charged in a west bank military court with plotting to 
assassinate foreign minister david levy 
a military court in lod within israel charged a 40yearold 
mother of 12 children with carrying messages and money for the 
plos fatah faction 
a 7yearold israeli boy was seriously hurt in hebron in the 
west bank when hit in the head by a stone thrown at the car he was 
riding in the army said 
army gunfire wounded at least seven palestinians during 
stonethrowing clashes in the occupied territories including a 
12yearold boy shot in the head with a plastic bullet and listed 
in serious condition arab and israeli reports said the army said 
it was checking the reports

a 500000gallon oil spill unleashed by 
a shipbarge collision could be an evironmental disaster in the 
rich fishing grounds and teeming wildlife habitats of galveston 
bay a state official said tuesday 
the spill began saturday when a tanker ship struck two barges in 
the houston ship channel which is in part dredged though the bay 
by tuesday a 17milelong slick had formed heavy oil had 
washed up on a dike in texas city about three miles northwest of 
galveston and on a nearby peninsula and island the coast guard 
said 
the deaths of two seabirds were blamed on the spill which has 
already killed an undetermined number of fish 
the houston ship channel closed since the spill began partly 
reopened during the afternoon dozens of ships have been prevented 
from leaving or reaching houston at an estimated cost of 15 
million a day 
another texas official criticized what he characterized as a 
lack of response to the disaster 
galveston bay is protected from the gulf of mexico by barrier 
islands which contain delicate nesting grounds for birds and other 
wildlife the bay the richest estuary on the gulf coast is an 
important fishing ground for shrimp and other commercially valuable 
species 
experts fear the spill will take a heavy environmental toll 
both because the oil is thick and because it is unlikely to 
dissipate in the enclosed waters as did the light crude spilled in 
the gulf by the tanker mega borg in june 
the worst kind of spill you can have is one behind these 
barrier islands which is what weve got said larry mckinney 
director of resource protection for the texas department of parks 
and wildlife 
mckinney predicted the spill would rank as the worst in the gulf 
region 
at least 100 bird species including the endangered brown 
pelican and at least 75 kinds of fish inhabit the galveston bay 
area he said 
cleanup crews used five skimmer vessels and a vacuum truck to 
suck up oil contained by thousands of feet of booms by monday 
night about 20000 gallons of oil had been cleaned up the coast 
guard did not have an updated figure for tuesday 
workers also began cleaning crude on the dike and at the port 
bolivar and on pelican island next to galveston island 
this is a mess i have never in my 25 years being out here 
seen this dike look like this said darnell vaughn of la marque 
who had her children rachel 8 and jerod 12 with her 
coast guard rear adm jim loy who flew in from new orleans to 
survey the spill said a flyover convinced him the situation was 
under control 
its a very manageable situation perhaps not being managed as 
well as it could be loy told a news conference 
he said he saw streaks of black oil at eagle point a 
residential development with private docks 22 miles north of 
galveston that cleanup crews should have been attacking heavy 
black oil was reported on sandy beaches there tuesday morning 
loy said hed suggested that cleanup contractors bring in about 
five more skimmers but said barge owner apex towing co had been 
doing a good job generally of keeping the oil from environmentally 
sensitive areas 
i want to strike while the irons hot he said were 
never going to get better weather conditions than we have right 
now 
coast guard officials said a hearing to determine the cause of 
the accident would begin wednesday morning 
in another development state officials urged the federal 
government to let them use oileating microbes on the spill before 
the oil reached the environmentally sensitive marshes 
once it gets to the marshland trying to clean up the marsh is 
almost impossible so why not try it mckinney said its not 
going to hurt anything 
us environmental protection agency spokesman roger meacham in 
dallas said the technique known as bioremediation is promising but 
that not enough information exists on its effectiveness or its 
impact on marine life to endorse its largescale use in every 
situation 
texas water commission chairman bj buck wynne texas land 
commission representative blanton moore and mckinney met with coast 
guard capt thomas greene in galveston to discuss the proposal 
greene said the coast guard was hesitant to grant permission 
we want to be careful there isnt something else introduced into 
the area that could cause more problems he said 
in austin land commissioner garry mauro criticized the response 
to the spill 
the point is this oil spill occurred saturday at 230 pm 
all these decisions should have been made in advance of this 
spill mauro told a news conference 
were not happy with that either said coast guard chief 
petty officer todd nelson 
the greek tanker shinoussa collided with two of three barges 
being towed by the tugboat chandy n south of redfish island 15 
miles north of galveston 
one barge nearly sank and the other listed both spewed 
catfeed oil a refinery oil similar to no 5 oil into the bay 
the doublehulled tanker did not lose any of its 29400metricton 
load of jet fuel 
no oil has spilled since monday evening nelson said 
divers continued strapping slings beneath the submerged barge 
tuesday so cranes could lift the vessel as water and oil were 
pumped off nelson said 
the ship channel reopened to oneway incoming barge traffic 
greene said up to 30 barges have been stacked up along the 
intracoastal canal near galveston and about 70 more waited further 
down the canal he said 
after clearing incoming barge traffic the coast guard planned 
to allow some oneway barge traffic out of the channel 
in addition to the barges up to 60 ships were waiting to get in 
the channel and about as many were waiting to leave greene said 
the disruption is costing about 15 million a day said west 
gulf maritime association president ted thorjunssen 
there is a little bit of everything out there oil steel and 
general cargo said carl bond operations manager for the marine 
exchange

george steinbrenner stripped by the baseball 
commissioner of his right to run the yankees said tuesday he wants 
his son to succeed him 
also tuesday commissioner fay vincent revealed that he had 
planned only to suspend george steinbrenner but the yankees owner 
asked for what amounted to a lifetime ban 
the action against steinbrenner on monday ends a stormy 17year 
reign punctuated by numerous firings of managers and feuds with 
players including onetime star outfielder dave winfield 
vincent punished steinbrenner for besmirching the image of 
baseball by paying known gambler howard spira 40000 it had been 
suggested the payments were in exchange for information on winfield 
that steinbrenner could use to force the player to accept a trade 
that his contract allows him to refuse 
in a session tuesday with several reporters vincent suggested 
the penalty he planned to impose was for a fixed term and was less 
severe than the punishment steinbrenner agreed to after 11 hours of 
negotiations monday 
i have to say to you i found some aspects of yesterday strange 
and i still find them strange this morning vincent said 
a baseball official speaking on the condition of anonymity 
said vincent had proposed suspending steinbrenner for two years and 
putting him on three years probation 
steinbrenner agreed to give up control of the team and resign as 
general partner by aug 20 
on tuesday the commissioner placed the yankees under american 
league supervision for the next five years he also barred all 
contact between steinbrenner and the team without vincents 
permission that would apply to steinbrenners son if he became 
manager 
steinbrenner confirmed tuesday that he wants his 33yearold 
son hank to take over the daytoday operations of the yankees 
the move already cleared by vincent must still be approved by the 
teams limited partners and major league clubs 
i have no desire to return as general partner steinbrenner 
said that will rest with my sons i have other endeavors which i 
plan to devote most of my available time to now which are very 
important to me 
vincent ordered that for five years the yankees must seek league 
approval for the hiring firing promotion demotion or 
reassignment of any officer of the club during that time the 
team also must ask league approval to sue or file a grievance 
against a player and to hire lawyers and investigators involved 
with player dealings 
steinbrenner would be allowed to consult with team managers in 
four areas television and radio contracts concessions agreements 
governmental and lease agreements and banking relationships 
vincent also barred phil mcniff the american shipbuilding co 
executive who headed steinbrenners investigation of winfield from 
having anything to do with the yankees winfield eventually was 
traded to california 
mcniff supervised steinbrenners relationship with spira who is 
under an eightcount federal indictment for attempting to extort 
the yankees owner and for threatening steinbrenner and winfield 
steinbrenners baseball problems could affect his position as a 
vice president of the us olympic committee 
usoc president robert helmick said the organizations executive 
committee will review steinbrenners status at its next regular 
meeting aug 22 in colorado springs colo 
when the head of a major sport in the united states says an 
individual has operated contrary to the best interests of that 
sport obviously we must be very concerned helmick said

debris found on the ocean floor 90 miles south 
of here probably fell from a united airlines jumbo jet that ripped 
open last year the leader of the deepsea search said tuesday 
i would say its a very good chance better than 50 percent 
its the debris field from the jet said bob whaley leader of 
the search 
the largest piece of debris a metal object about 10 feet long 
is roughly the size of the 10by10foot cargo door that tore away 
from the boeing 747 along with a chunk of fuselage sweeping nine 
passengers to their deaths whaley said 
the national transportation safety board asked the navy to find 
the cargo door in hopes an examination of it would help the agency 
write better aviation safety rules 
its up to the ntsb to decide if there should be an attempt to 
retrieve the debris the agency hadnt made a decision by late 
tuesday said lt cmdr bob anderson a navy spokesman 
whaley said several factors make him think the debis is from 
united flight 811 
the debris was found in an area where navy radar tracked the 
door falling into the ocean 
the bottom nearly 15000 feet down is flat and silty older 
objects on the ocean floor probably would have sunk into the silt 
the largest piece roughly matches the size of the cargo door 
the debris field about three miles long runs north to south 
the direction the plane was traveling 
searchers aboard a 224foot navy tug used a small 
remotecontrolled deepsea submarine to find the debris 
the subs sonar located the debris but searchers were unable to 
get a picture with the subs video camera to help confirm whether 
the debris is from the jet 
the jumbo jet carried 355 passengers when it left honolulu for 
new zealand on feb 24 1989 
shortly after takeoff a cargo door opened at 22000 feet 
tearing away a section of fuselage nine people were swept to their 
deaths and five others suffered serious injuries the crew managed 
to return the jet to honolulu 
the ntsb inquiry determined that faulty design of the locking 
mechanism probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the 
door was locked 
the agency blamed united boeing co and the federal aviation 
administration for failing to correct problems with the door 
the search which began a week ago covered a 24squaremile 
section of ocean floor

kabul radio said tuesday that abdul 
rahim hatif deputy vice president of afghanistan will head the 
government while president najibullah is away on a brief trip to 
the soviet union 
the state radios announcement was monitored in islamabad 
najibullah who uses only one name flew to moscow on sunday for 
official meetings and a medical checkup the unexpected visit led 
to speculation that the united states and the soviet union had 
reached an agreement on how to end the 12yearold war in 
afghanistan 
us secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze will discuss afghanistan during two 
days of talks in the siberian city of irkutsk beginning wednesday 
like najibullahs trip hatifs appointment as acting president 
took many people by surprise 
such appointments are rarely made during a short trip by the 
president and hatifs selection apparently bypassed najibullahs 
secondincommand sultan ali keshtmand 
keshtmand seen as a hardline member of the ruling party was 
appointed two months ago to the newly created post of first vice 
president 
hatif 64 is not a member of the ruling hezbewatan or party 
of the homeland which until last month was known as the peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan 
but hatif was brought into the sovietbacked government in 1987 
as the party sought to broaden its base of support and initiated 
efforts to distance itself from the bloody marxist past 
hatif had served under former king zahir shah who was 
overthrown by his cousin mohammad daoud in 1973 and has been living 
in exile in italy 
daoud was killed during the 1978 coup that installed a marxist 
government and brought the red army into afghanistan a year later 
soviet troops remained in afghanistan for nine years to fight 
moslem guerrillas moscow ended direct military involvement in 
february 1989 but continues to supply the kabul government with 
weapons and ammunition 
the conflict has become a stalemate with soldiers holding the 
cities and guerrillas controlling the countryside

its great to share ideas about the things that they do and 
what we do said boatsmate 2 regiald white 23 who chatted with 
the soviets through an interpreter about the price of uniforms and 
seamens pay 
they really like meeting people said white who hails from

prime minister toshiki kaifu accepted on tuesday 
proposals to reduce the role of political parties and 
specialinterest money in elections to the upper house of 
parliament officials said 
the recommendations offered by the electoral review committee 
mark a step toward political reform in japan following scandals 
that caused two prime ministers to resign last year the committee 
was set up in june 1989 to lessen the power of money in japanese 
politics 
the government plans to draw up legislation based on the 
proposals but opposition is strong and analysts believe it 
unlikely the government will adopt the proposals without change 
the report recommended keeping the mixed system of national and 
regional constituencies used in selecting the 252 delegates to the 
upper house but suggested voters be allowed to choose candidates 
by name when voting in the national constituencies 
that would decrease the role of parties and increase the 
importance of policy in campaigning the council argued critics of 
japans political system frequently cite lack of substantive policy 
debate during electioneering 
the report suggested the government provide more money for 
candidates to lessen their dependence on outside financing 
it recommended toughening election laws and requiring stricter 
reporting on the use of political funds 
kaifu pledged political reform to restore the prestige of his 
liberal democratic party and trust in the government he became 
prime minister last august after his two predecessors resigned in 
quick succession over money and sex scandals 
earlier proposals from the committee constituted a plan to 
reshape the more powerful lower house the panel suggested 
reformulating japans system of multipleseat constitutencies to 
bring greater equality to reduce politicians ability to raise 
money on their own and to tighten rules on reporting political 
donations

the us environmental protection agency 
issued a wideranging smogcutting plan tuesday that includes a 
proposal to ban driving on some days in the region with the 
nations dirtiest air 
the courtordered plan is aimed at cutting ozone in los angeles 
to 14 percent of current levels by early next century and is a 
backup to one approved in 1989 by the south coast air quality 
management district ozone is a major component of smog 
the plan stemmed from an environmentalist lawsuit filed against 
1982 district air quality standards guidelines that current 
officials of the regional agency call timid they were superseded 
by stronger local rules last year 
the districts current threeyear plan affects everything from 
lawnmowers to petroleum refineries at an estimated cost of 262 
billion a year 
later steps of that plan include the use of technology not yet 
developed making its effectiveness a guessing game 
the district covers orange county and parts of los angeles san 
bernardino and riverside counties an area where more than 12 
million people live in the worst air pollution in the country in 
1988 the most recent year available los angeles exceeded the 
national standard for ozone 150 times compared with 20 times for 
new york and chicago 
the most stringent sections of the epa plan which doesnt 
become final until next year wont go into effect until after 
1995 the entire plan would take effect only if state and regional 
governments fail to significantly reduce smog 
state and local authorities have been engaged in an 
extraordinary effort to address this problem themselves which we 
all hope will render a federal plan as unnecessary epa western 
regional administrative director daniel w mcgovern told a downtown 
news conference 
environmentalists who brought the lawsuit characterized the epa 
plan as insurance to make the district deliver 
we have been very concerned that the local district has been 
backsliding said coalition for clean air president jan 
chattenbrown whose organization was a plaintiff with the sierra 
club this plan will send a clear message if the district 
wont do the job the epa will step in 
the epa guidelines include a reluctant proposal for nodrive 
days to reduce carbon monoxide under such a plan motorists with 
odd numbers on their license plates would be permitted to drive 
every other day and those with even tag numbers on another 
the nodrive days would be enforced from november through 
february and would force affected commuters to find some other way 
to work either through car pools or mass transit 
it is in the spirit of presenting all possibilities that we 
are presenting the nodrive day it is not one we are 
endorsing said mcgovern 
the nodrive plan could be used by the year 2000 if other 
methods fail 
the federal plan takes longer to achieve goals set by the 
regional agency the district plan calls for reducing current ozone 
averages by 86 percent in 2007 the epa by 2010 
it is our hope and expectation that the state plan will 
achieve its goals well in advance of the federal plan mcgovern 
said 
the epa will not use its proposed backup system until 1996 at 
the earliest because of confidence in current efforts said david 
howekamp chief of air and toxics for the agency 
he said the agency will be measuring pollution levels to 
determine whether the epa should begin enforcing its proposed 
regulations 
some features of the epa backup plan include 
mandatory reduction of emissions by 6 percent a year from 
pollution sources such as consumer products industrial and 
commercial solvents pesticides commercial food preparation and 
architectural coatings such as paint 
extending pollution control standards to construction 
equipment pleasure boats and offroad vehicles 
an ultra clean motor vehicle program that would require 
all new motor vehicles meet emissions limits 85 percent to 90 
percent cleaner than those for vehicles now sold

six teams of scientists will receive 28 
million in federal funds to develop drugs that attack the 
infections killing people with aids government officials announced 
tuesday 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases is 
setting up a program that will provide a formal way for basic 
research scientists to collaborate with drug companies to design 
new drugs they said 
the urgency of the aids epidemic demands innovation anthony 
fauci director of the institute said in announcing the program 
a version of this program is already being used to bring 
together scientists of diverse backgrounds to work on drugs that 
attack the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids 
three drugs discovered through the program are now being tested in 
clinical trials and others are in the pipeline he said 
aids activists have been strongly critical of federal scientific 
research on aids because they say too much attention has been 
focused on antiviral drugs to attack hiv and not enough on drugs 
to prevent and treat opportunistic infections 
in its announcement of the new research the institute said that 
the research program for antivirals did not preclude research on 
opportunistic infections but few applications for research in this 
area were received 
as a result the institute last year issued a request for 
applications specifically addressing opportunistic infections the 
institute said 
opportunistic infections some rare some ordinary often 
attack aids patients whose immune systems have been weakened by the 
disease causing 90 percent of aidsrelated deaths 
the most common infection is pneumosystis carinii pneumonia 
which occurs in about 85 percent of aids patients

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said wednesday he expects a breakthrough toward ending 
the 11yearold afghan civil war during his talks with us 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
we will be able to help solve the afghanistan question 
shevardnadze said minutes before meeting baker in the first of 
three scheduled oneonone meetings over two days 
shevardnadze also said he and baker would finalize plans for a 
third summit between president bush and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev the summit is expected to take place in moscow around 
the end of this year or early 1991 
speculation that an agreement on afghanistan or a ceasefire 
might be near was fueled when afghanistans sovietbacked president 
najibullah suddenly flew to moscow on sunday 
soviet officials initially said najibullah had come to the 
soviet union for health reasons 
but shevardnadze speaking to reporters in front of the concrete 
guest house in this eastern siberian city said najibullah was on 
vacation in the soviet union 
on tuesday official radio kabul reported that deputy vice 
president abdul rahim hatif would temporarily act as president 
while najibullah is in the soviet union 
when asked whether najibullah would return to afghanistsan 
shevardnadze hesitated and then said he will return to 
afghanistan just like any of us return home after vacation 
the united states backs the pakistanbased moslem guerrillas 
fighting the afghan government 
earlier shevardnadze said the positions of boths sides on 
resolving the afghan conflict were moving closer together and the 
issue of a settlement is now being posed differently 
the bakershevardnadze meetings were also to cover the civil war 
in cambodia us economic aid to the soviet union the middle east 
conflict and the divided korean peninsula 
explaining the choice of irkutsk as the venue for the talks 
tass quoted shevardnadze as saying such outoftheway locations 
were convenient 
less time is wasted on protocol and there are time and the 
conditions for a truly working atmosphere said shevardnadze who 
arrived in irkutsk 2600 miles east of moscow late tuesday 
shevardnadze said arrangements were to be made during his 
meetings with baker on the ussoviet summit tass said quoting 
remarks made on his flight to irkutsk baker arrived for the talks 
early wednesday 
shevardnadze in his inflight interview said bush and 
gorbachev had agreed on the new meeting during their december 
summit in malta and that it should take place before the end of the 
year tass said 
this was why there was extremely little time left to prepare the 
new summit said shevardnadze as quoted by tass 
gorbachev and bush last met in june in washington 
in washington a white house official said a summit probably 
will be held in moscow next year but could come earlier if a 
nuclear weapons treaty is ready for signing 
i am not excluding or including the possibility of a moscow 
summit by the end of the year said alixe glen white house deputy 
press secretary 
also on the flight shevardnadze hailed the recent meeting 
between gorbachev and west german chancellor helmut kohl on german 
unification as a breakthrough tass said at that meeting 
gorbachev agreed to nato membership for a united germany 
shevardnadze said the next round of formal unification talks 
scheduled for september in moscow would be the concluding one tass 
reported those talks will involve the four world war ii allies 
plus leaders of the german states 
hope for resolving cambodias 12yearold civil war remains 
muted 
baker on tuesday ended a fiveday trip in southeast asia 
leaving singapore without securing the support of the regions 
foreign ministers for an abrupt aboutface in us policy toward 
cambodia 
in midjuly baker announced the united states was ending eight 
years of support for the cambodian resistance and would begin 
direct talks with vietnam which backs the cambodian government 
those talks are scheduled for aug 6 in new york 
the goal was to distance the us government from the khmer 
rouge the most powerful member of the resistance coalition the 
khmer rouge killed an estimated 1 million cambodians during its 
bloody 197578 rule 
but the cambodian question remains complicated because the 
united states and the soviet union exercise limited influence in 
the region 
najibullahs departure for moscow sparked speculation that us 
and soviet officials had reached a tacit agreement that the afghan 
president would hand over some power to a council of afghan forces 
prior to a nationwide election 
the last time an afghan president took a quick trip to moscow 
was in 1985 that president babrak karmal never returned to his 
post and was replaced by najibullah 
us negotiators have dropped their demand that najibullah step 
down now they say he could remain as president during the 
election providing he cedes control of the military state media 
and secret police to a neutral body 
the soviet union is believed to have agreed to these terms and 
the composition of the neutral body is now at issue 
since 1979 usbacked rebels have battled first soviet troops 
and then sovietsupported afghan forces in a war that has left more 
than 15 million people dead including 13000 soviet troops and 
left millions more homeless 
more than 115000 soviet soldiers withdrew from afghanistan in 
1989 after nine years of military intervention 
after the talks in irkutsk baker and shevardnadze will take a 
cruise on lake baikal on thursday baker is to fly to mongolia for 
talks with the government and a hunting trip

the social security administration will 
schedule no more hearings for disability benefit appeals in 
september if they involve travel or other outside expenses an 
agency spokesman said tuesday 
the decision does not affect thousands of hearings already 
scheduled nor does it mean that additional hearings cannot be 
booked said philip gambino a social security spokesman 
the hold on additional travel or outside expenses is temporary 
and happens annually as the agency approaches the end of its fiscal 
year in september gambino said 
its not unusual gambino said 
he denied a report published in the wednesday editions of the 
new york times saying that the agency had suspended hearings 
in september because of the yearend financial crunch 
we havent canceled any hearings he said 
were still going to do hearings during september gambino 
said i cant even tell you if were going to do less in 
september than we are in august 
he estimated that the agency holds some 20000 hearings a month 
at more 200 locations around the country for people who are 
appealing decisions that deny or reduce the social security 
disability benefits they receive

1986 notified the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san 
francisco that she had dropped her appeal of an earlier ruling on 
the suit

claims that she was a victim of discrimination and was forced out 
of office 
i would like to have been able take it on to an appeal and 
another court trial harrington said but i exhausted all of my 
resources it was just too costly in money and emotionally

she may as well save her energy and get on with her life the

entitled to increased benefits under a pension plan approved by 
voters in november under the new plan harrington could receive an 
annual pension of 36679 plus costofliving increases 
portland city attorney jeff rogers said it cost more than 
300000 to defend the case he said the city agreed it wouldnt

britishtrained lt gen christon tembo a 
former army commander being tried on charges of plotting to 
overthrow the government was freed tuesday on orders of president 
kenneth kaunda 
screaming supporters and jubilant relatives mobbed tembo on the 
steps of the high court in lusaka 
he and three other senior army officers whose release was 
announced by kaunda on june 25 earlier appeared briefly in court to 
hear judge weston muzyamba discharge them 
muzyamba told tembo purported leader of the 1988 attempt lt 
cols biswayo nkunika and chongo shula and maj knight mulenga 
that they were discharged from detention but not acquitted of 
capital charges of treason

tailored gray suit in court he raised two fists in a victory 
salute and told reporters he felt great

cervical cancer tests done every three years 
instead of every year are a lot less expensive and the overall 
accuracy is nearly the same a researcher says but others strongly 
disagree 
previous studies show that tests every three years on women aged 
20 to 65 are about 96 percent as effective at detecting cancerous 
or other abnormal cells as annual exams according to dr david m 
eddy of duke university 
in addition the threeyear exams offer a twothirds reduction 
in cost risk and inconvenience according to eddys article in 
wednesdays edition of the journal annals of internal medicine 
but women at high risk for cervical cancer including those who 
smoke use oral contraceptives or have multiple sex partners may 
prefer exams every one to two years said eddy who reviewed 
studies on test frequency 
other researchers cautioned against following a recommendation 
based on cost and said physicians must consider human factors when 
deciding how often to examine their patients for cervical cancer 
the question is where to draw the line eddy said 
ideally this should be decided by women themselves 
while some researchers believe that women tested every three 
years will be more likely to forget the exam any interval from one 
to four years will deliver virtually the same benefits 
according to eddy 
however dr george malkasian the immediate past president of 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists warned that 
the death rate from cervical cancer would probably increase if 
eddys recommendation were followed 
cervical cancer strikes more than 13000 american women a year 
and causes about 7000 deaths annually if the cancer is caught in 
the early stages the survival rate after five years is about 90 
percent aid malkasian a senior consultant at the mayo clinic 
said in a telephone interview 
the most common test for cervical cancer is the pap test which 
detects abnormal or cancerous cells in the cervix the opening to 
the womb the test costs an average 76 per patient 
other cancer specialists argued that other factors should play a 
role in a womans decision regarding pap tests they point out that 
the test is one of the main reasons the number of deaths from 
cervical cancer has dropped 70 percent since it was first widely 
used in the 1940s 
many medical organizations including the obstetricians and 
gynecologists college and the american cancer society recommend 
that women who are at least 18 years old or sexually active have 
pap tests annually for three years after three negative tests 
women can reduce the frequency of the tests on their physicians 
advice the groups suggest 
some cancer specialists including dr robert young president 
of philadelphias fox chase cancer center believe that as more 
women rely on their gynecologist as their only provider of health 
care annual pap tests can supply the only contact between patient 
and physician 
despite eddys contention that only anecdotal evidence suggests 
that physicians are more likely to discover other medical problems 
in women who have annual pap tests there are certain realities 
that get lost in a cost analysis young said in a telephone 
interview 
he said he feared recommendations regarding pap tests based only 
on costeffectiveness would discourage some women from being 
examined at all of the 7000 women who die each year of cervical 
cancer 85 percent never had a pap test prior to the diagnosis 
according to young 
we need to encourage the wider use of pap smears he said

in the city once notorious for the label banned 
in boston a tour of robert mapplethorpes controversial 
photographs made its final stop tuesday opening to strong protests 
and equally fervent support 
one public television station showed seven sexually explicit 
photographs from the socalled x portfolio on its nightly 
newscast 
the exhibit has drawn the wrath of conservative sen jesse 
helms rnc been canceled in washington inspired limits on 
federal arts grants and drawn criminal charges in cincinnati 
largely because of the uproar the show is expected to draw at 
least 50000 people in boston it runs through oct 4 
a news conference in support of the show coordinated by an 
eclectic group calling itself the boston coalition for freedom of 
expression included speeches by artists and playwrights a march 
and rally were planned for wednesday when the exhibit opens to the 
public at the institute of contemporary art 
hours after that news conference a coalition of 13 groups 
calling itself first amendment common sense held a volatile 
statehouse news conference in which it pressed public officials to 
halt the exhibit as obscene and unlawful 
were calling for a revival of common sense said evelyn 
dubel to protest this bizarre and illegal behavior that 
threatens the wellbeing of our citizens were concerned about the 
wellbeing of our neighbors especially our children 
joe reilley a leader of morality in media a group which says 
it favors family values and opposes pornography alluded to 
upcoming legal action but refused to specify what that action would 
be 
one protester was arrested for interrupting the common sense 
coalition news conference which also featured heated questions 
from members of gay rights groups 
david ross director of the art institute said he was proud to 
have the exhibit and unafraid of the controversy surrounding the 
show of 124 photographs taken by mapplethorpe from 1969 until 
shortly before he died of aids last year in boston at the age of 42 
what we have to fear is the suppression of these ideas ross 
said pointing to a button being sold in conjunction with the show 
that said fear no art 
were talking about art this isnt the combat zone ross 
said referring to bostons red light district this is not a 
pornography exhibit this show is a celebration of beauty 
producers of wgbhtvs ten oclock news said they decided to 
focus on the controversial photographs in their newscast rather 
than concentrating on mapplethorpes portraits and flower studies 
the coverage thus far never shows you this all you get is 
what is in the mind of the newspaper writer and we want our 
coverage to let the viewer decide with both sides presented 
said john vanscoyoc the stations managing editor 
some of the most controversial photographs were shown including 
those depicting sadomasochism and homoeroticism about 24 minutes 
of the halfhour newscast was devoted to the exhibit and the 
accompanying controversy 
alan foster news director at the station said at least 63 
calls were received on the stations response line within 15 
minutes of the shows conclusion the line was attached to an 
answering machine and it would not be known until wednesday how 
callers felt about the broadcast foster said 
another 20 callers had managed to dial the stations newsroom 
directly 
those have been universally positive foster said one guy 
said brilliant show terrific journalism 
mary catherine kilday enforcement chief of the federal 
communications commission in washington said the agency does not 
monitor television or radio programming and we do not currently 
have authority to enforce indecency complaints after 8 pm 
a mapplethorpe exhibit scheduled in june 1989 in washington 
dc at the corcoran gallery of art was canceled after helms 
branded the artists work obscene helms objections prompted 
congress to limit national endowment for the arts grants 
before those limits were imposed organizers of the mapplethorpe 
tour received about 30000 from the nea about 10 percent of the 
cost 
controversy was mild when the tour began in philadelphia in late 
1988 and it only drew about 12000 visitors but in cincinnati this 
spring the exhibit spurred a rally and march by supporters and 
opponents of the works 
the cincinnati exhibit led to an obscenity indictment against 
the director of the contemporary arts center but a federal judge 
barred police from confiscating photographs from the exhibit 
two of the disputed photographs in cincinnati involved children 
in one a boys genitals are exposed in the other a girls 
genitals are exposed five others show homosexual acts

this years farm bill may take the worry out 
of shopping for organic cucumbers 
other provisions apparently headed for adoption in congress 
would stop exports of pesticides banned domestically expand 
protection of wetlands and erodible fields and encourage farmers to 
cut their use of chemicals that can find their way into the water 
supply 
the legislation which sets agricultural policy for the next 
five years has at its heart a set of support programs for crops 
and livestock 
but this years bill focused as never before on measures 
intended to protect the earth and its waters drafted under the 
watchful eye of lobbyists for environmental groups farmers and the

a coroner who dropped a dead infant 
headfirst onto the floor as part of his research into skull 
fractures is being sued by the childs parents for 2 million in a 
case that has divided doctors over such practices 
some coroners say such research has been carried out in morgues 
for years others say the permission of the next of kin should be 
required 
in the trial which began last month district judge hugh 
brunson must decide whether state law allows coroners to conduct 
experiments not needed to determine the cause of death and whether 
approval from relatives is needed 
no state court has previously ruled on the issue but state 
assistant attorney general chuck yeager said in an opinion last 
year that the law does not authorize such experiments without the 
permission of the next of kin

shamrock says the poster isnt 
the only thing thats green and comes from ireland 
teenage mutant ninja turtles do too 
their fans may not realize it but some of the turtle cartoons 
invading the worlds tv screens are made by an oftentedious 
process in ireland a country that makes up with humor and 
motivation for its lack of any background in cartoonmaking 
the irish may be unfamiliar with cowabunga but they know a 
jobcreating export opportunity when they see one which is why the 
industrial development authority of ireland is willing to help pay 
its way 
working from rough comicstrip storyboards drawn at murakami 
wolf swenson the burbank calif owner of the animation rights 
dozens of artists and technicians hunch over drawing boards and 
photography machines producing 35mm films that will be sent back 
to burbank to be made into videocassettes 
housed in a functional office block in the center of the city 
murakami wolf dublin ltd turns out a 22minute cartoon every month 
or so to feed the global appetite for teenage mutant ninja 
turtles 
each cartoon requires some 13000 separate drawings and the 
work that falls to the junior animators is tedious but for 
ireland with its chronic doubledigit unemployment anything that 
creates jobs is worth a try and the industrial development 
authority sees the turtles as irelands ticket to becoming a key 
player in animation for television 
one of the advantages of ireland is a well educated young 
population it hasnt got a background in animation as such but 
the people are very trainable says eamonn lawless the dublin 
account who manages the studio 
as well as that theyre culturally compatible with the united 
states and with europe 
teenage mutant ninja turtles in case anyone hasnt heard 
are four terrapins who were dropped into a radioactive brew and 
mutated into talking pizzascoffing teenage wisecrackers a rat 
named splinter trained them in the ancient oriental art of ninja 
combat and loosed them on americas streets to battle for justice 
americans may take such amiable nonsense in their stride but 
some europeans have found it a trifle too manic the british 
broadcasting co insists on the title teenage mutant hero 
turtles apparently believing that british audiences may have 
difficulty with ninja 
as far as they were concerned it was too violentsounding 
said lawless in an interview at his spartan office desk 
lawless hadnt heard of the turtles until he was approached two 
years ago to head the dublin operation but he says he quickly 
caught the bug 
irish generally are fairly nonconformist in their attitude 
and theyre laidback to most things he said besides id not 
regard myself as a stereotype accountant i have always liked 
cartoons 
the dublin connection is a tribute to the industrial development 
authoritys broadminded approach and to jimmy murakami an 
accomplished american animator who has lived here for 17 years 
dreaming of bringing the cartoon industry to ireland 
the ida pays the studio a onetime grant of up to 9000 pounds 
14700 for each new job created half when the employee starts 
work and the rest if the job is still there six months later 
the studio opened in february 1989 having promised to create 
126 new jobs it has in fact created 130 according to ida 
spokesman michael flood it produced seven cartoons in 1989 and 
will make 10 this year 
it also illustrates the globalization of the entertainment 
industry stories are created in california animation is done in 
ireland and south korea and the cartoons are shown worldwide 
south korea produces far more turtle cartoons than ireland but 
murakami and lawless believe the irish have the advantage of 
language and humor 
theyre easier to work with and they know what youre talking 
about says chuck swenson a partner in the california studio who 
has been here for eight months helping oversee the operation 
half the charm of the turtles is their laidback subversive 
dialogue what swenson calls that inane californian slang 
that makes it all the more important for animators to have a feel 
for english and an acute sense of timing 
for instance lawless cites a cartoon in which a turtle has run 
out of pizza money and turns to the camera saying this means im 
gonna have to gulp get a job it takes a subtle hand to match 
the gulp to the phrase 
also adds swenson the idea of not being very excited over 
getting a job doesnt really translate in eastern asian societies 
where everybody would love to have a job

seven summers have passed since roy radins 
corpse was found in a mountain grave but the pudgy 
cocainesniffing theatrical producer whose murder is an enduring 
hollywood mystery has not been forgotten 
his sordid killing a tale of drug world greed and a hollywood 
movie deal gone sour is the subject of the new book bad 
company drugs hollywood and the cotton club murder 
the book debuts on the eve of the cotton club murder trial 
and attorneys for the defendants are outraged at its timing 
were extremely concerned about our ability to get a jury 
now said attorney marcia morrissey who represents chief 
defendant karen delayne laynie greenberger 
she said the books publication plus its serialization in the 
los angeles times and newsday raises the likelihood that potential 
jurors have been prejudiced against the defendants and that 
accounts of greenbergers life are filled with inaccuracies 
the author steve wick insisted the timing of the books 
release was coincidental i dont think this book will keep them 
from selecting a jury i dont think ive convicted these 
people before trial as a journalist i need to be fair to all 
parties 
wick a reporter with new york newsday said he began probing 
radins death after the producers mother came to him in 1985 
asking him to find out what happened to her son 
radin had left for hollywood in the spring of 1983 to negotiate 
a deal with movie tycoon robert evans to produce the movie the 
cotton club radin disappeared in may and his bulletriddled body 
was found that june 
i was fascinated that a man as savvy as radin could come out 
here for a business deal and be murdered wick said in an 
interview 
the larger significance of the cotton club case said wick 
is as a story of the greedfilled 80s and the impact of 
cocaine in hollywood 
the public is fascinated by the case because they think it 
says something about hollywood but for me the fascination is the 
drug angle the drug organizations he said i think radin 
would be alive today if he wasnt so wrecked on cocaine the last 
week of his life 
four people have been charged with radins murder and are set to 
stand trial a legal technicality delayed the scheduled start of 
the trial on monday 
the star defendant is greenberger a former cocaine dealer once 
romantically involved with evans she introduced evans to radin and 
was a key player in negotiating the cotton club film 
prosecutors allege she arranged radins murder because she was 
being cut out of the deal 
her codefendants are three former bodyguards for hustler 
magazine publisher larry flynt alex marti william mentzer and 
robert ulmer lowe all have pleaded innocent 
wick said he tried to be particularly fair to evans the most 
famous figure in the strange saga 
i dont think hes a murderer wick said of the producer 
but i think he used terribly bad judgment in getting involved 
with these people some things that happened after the murder 
raise some very troubling questions about evans 
for instance he questions why greenberger telephoned evans on 
the night radin was murdered phone records show the call but wick 
said evans claims to not remember what was said 
he also notes that evans told some investors radin was murdered 
before the producers body was found 
i dont know how bob evans knew roy radin was dead but he 
knew said wick 
i had a number of conversations with him wick said of 
evans he was such a troubled wounded guy he comes off as a 
tragic guy broken used in many ways he felt very much the victim 
and in some ways he is 
evans lawyer robert shapiro said he had not read wicks book 
and could not comment on it 
evans declined to testify during a preliminary hearing in the 
cotton club case invoking fifth amendment protection against 
selfincrimination 
wick said that although he is convinced evans had no hand in the 
murder he wonders whether the moviemaker could have prevented it 
i asked him could you have saved this mans life wick 
recalls he said i didnt know he was in trouble 
the key character in wicks book is greenberger the last person 
to be seen in radins company when he stepped into a limousine en 
route to a beverly hills restaurant he tracks her life from a poor 
southern upbringing to a powerful role in the cocainedealing 
capital of miami 
what shaped her was miami in the late 70s he said her 
life story is the story of a woman who coveted money and all it 
could buy she got trapped by the money and glamour she was so 
attracted to the glamour and lights and the beverly hills 
lifestyle after meeting evans she thought it was all going to come 
together and it was ruined by a big dope named roy radin 
but morrissey said the details of greenbergers life in florida 
are untrue and apparently not based on court records or sources 
much of the book is just made up she said its what the 
author imagined happened 
she said greenberger is anxious to start her trial believing 
she will be vindicated 
wick acknowledged that the prosecutions case against 
greenberger presented at the preliminary hearing is far from open 
and shut 
there is a good chance this woman could prevail at a trial 
he said i dont want to mess up her case i wish her well i 
think its going to be a very tough case

peter orsinos eyes flash with anger when 
anyone tells him the death of his 8yearold son was an act of god 
peter orsino jr was eating in the cafeteria of the east 
coldenham elementary school last nov 16 when a 90mph wind 
demolished a 12foot cafeteria wall later shown to be of defective 
design peter and eight other children died in a shower of concrete 
and glass 
it wasnt an act of god the boys father said because 
god doesnt make buildings 
orsino and several other bereaved parents have channeled their 
grief and anger into a tenacious effort to get the state to change 
laws regarding inspections of school buildings but a top school 
official said these efforts and lawsuits filed in the wake of the 
disaster have caused bitterness 
eight months after the storm clouds lifted this closeknit 
rural hamlet 50 miles north of new york city is divided between 
those who want to forget the tragedy and those who cant 
pictures from that day remain etched in memory tearful parents 
rushing up to the school to see if their children were alive or 
dead 
sympathy poured in from across the country and gov mario cuomo 
attended a memorial service for the nine dead children three days 
after the disaster 
when the initial shock wore off parents from seven of the nine 
families started to meet regularly at the town firehouse it was a 
way to talk through their grief said john lichtler whose 
7yearold daughter joanna was killed 
that grief turned to anger when a state report on the disaster 
concluded that the cafeteria wall built with the rest of the 
school in 1959 was not capable of withstanding hurricaneforce 
winds 
accidents happen every day people are hurt and killed said 
frances soltis who lost her 7yearold son adam but our 
children were not out in the street running in front of cars and 
they werent playing with matches they were eating their lunch in 
a school cafeteria they were in a place where they were supposed 
to be safe 
in march the parents of seven east coldenham victims signed a 
letter to cuomo urging legislative action on school building 
safety 
the parents want architects and engineers sent to every school 
in the state at regular intervals to detect possible dangers they 
want blueprints checked to see if others have design flaws similar 
to east coldenhams defects were discovered at four other new york 
schools after the disaster 
the parents anger their continued outspokenness has not been 
wellreceived by some of their neighbors 
bruce armbrister who lost his 7yearold stepson said he had 
to restrain himself from attacking one man who told him what are 
you fighting for youre going to be a millionaire 
armbrister and 32 others parents of the 24 children who were 
injured or killed along with others who say their children were 
traumatized have filed negligence lawsuits against the state 
orange county and the school district 
the lawsuits have caused resentment among unaffected parents who 
wonder what the claims could do to tax bills said james coonan 
superintendent of the valley central school district 
school officials are stuck between two emotional camps coonan 
said 
an incident about three weeks after the disaster typified some 
of the problems 
while driving one of her three surviving children to east 
coldenham to school soltis saw the buildings american flag flying 
at fullstaff for the first time since the storm it was like a 
dagger through my heart she said 
she lowered the flag to halfstaff in the late autumn chill 
the next day she found the flag at fullstaff again again she 
lowered it 
they reach a point where they dont want to confront it 
anymore soltis said i see it in the other families they 
got through with minimal damage to their family they survived so 
theres a tendency to block it 
i dont expect people to feel what i feel she said but i 
expect them to respect my sons memory and to respect my familys 
grief 
coonan said no disrespect was intended to storm victims school 
officials agreed to keep the flag flying at halfstaff for the rest 
of the school year drawing phone calls from other parents who 
complained it was an unpleasant reminder for their children he 
said 
the flag will be flying at fullstaff again when school opens in 
september 
you get trouble when you go from sad to mad coonan said 
theres a lot of anger when people lose children and that anger 
is kind of out there looking for some place to land and it lands on 
different people at different times its not always pleasant when 
it happens but people tell us its normal 
lichtler leads the effort to change state school inspection 
laws a computer programmer at the us military academy he has 
compiled a bulging file of newspaper stories about shoddy school 
construction 
the chairman of the education committee in the new york state 
assembly angelo del toro is backing the parents with a bill that 
would require schools to be inspected once every three years 
new yorks legislature did not act on the proposal before 
recessing for the summer earlier this year partly because of a 
lastminute proposal from cuomo the governor concerned about the 
cost of mandatory inspections suggested training local school 
officials to make the inspections themselves 
although the valley central schools all have been inspected 
some school districts are concerned about the expense of hiring 
experts for regular inspections said richard jansen until 
recently the school board president 
our children should be safe but there has to be a real 
rational way of doing it jansen said i could see some 
problems down the road when the expenses would just get bigger and 
bigger 
to the bereaved no price is too high 
soltis said her three children will go to private school this 
fall and armbrister said he isnt sure if east coldenham is safe 
enough to send his daughter to kindergarten there next year 
we have to feel that our childrens lives amounted to 
something lichtler said if we can save one child then their 
lives would have been at least been extended for a purpose

somewhere it is written that heroism is being 
brave when theres nobody watching 
the man who beat the blacklist john henry faulk on pbs 
tonight is about such a man unjustly shunned and disgraced who 
stood up to his oppressors at a time when fundamental american 
values were unfashionable 
and he beat them 
faulks story in interviews with bill moyers and narration by 
studs terkel is an american tragedy that began in one of our 
nations nastier eras the era of the blacklist red scares and 
loyalty oaths 
aware inc a selfappointed public guardian would for a fee 
tell broadcasters if certain performers were communist 
sympathizers if a broadcaster balked aware inc would pressure 
sponsors and ad agencies 
such was the tenor of the times it was said that ed sullivan 
would not allow performers on his show that aware inc had not 
cleared 
faulk host of cbs radios popular afternoon show johnnys 
front porch won office in 1955 with members of the performers 
union the american federation of television and radio artists who 
pledged to end awares influence 
in 1956 aware falsely accused him of being a known communist 
sympathizer his shows sponsors and stations started getting 
calls about faulks alleged involvement with commie front 
organizations 
aware accused him of attending a meeting at which a known 
communist was present true faulk acknowledged it was the first 
anniversary dinner of the united nations and the communist was 
soviet foreign minister andrei gromyko 
his sponsors began deserting the show by coincidence his 
ratings dropped and cbs fired him in the summer of 1957 he was 
succeeded by arthur godfrey and was never to work in network 
broadcasting again 
unemployed and unemployable faulk did the unthinkable he filed 
a libel lawsuit against aware inc and its officers seeking 15 
million in damages 
faulk was broke and living on loans from friends but he 
retained the great attorney louis nizer the great newsman edward 
r murrow by then a cbs board member gave him 7500 to help pay 
nizers retainer 
i am not making a personal loan to you of this money murrow 
said i am investing in america 
for five years aware delayed the trial faulk moved back to his 
native texas started an advertising agency and eked out a living 
finally in 1962 the case was played out in an 11week trial 
the jury awarded him a thenrecord 35 million 
one lone man with virtually no resources nizer later wrote 
dragged the defendants into court and although outrageously 
outnumbered withstood starvation and disgrace and summoned up 
enough strength to battle them into submission 
the jurys award marked an end to the blacklist and the demise 
of aware inc but the damage to faulks career was complete he 
still couldnt get a job 
the record award was reduced by an appeals court to 725000 of 
that the moribund aware inc eventually paid 175000 but it went 
to faulks creditors 
he stayed in texas and achieved prominence in the south as an 
afterdinner speaker and a passionate advocate for the first 
amendment he also mounted a oneman show pear orchard texas 
in which he portrayed a number of the mythical towns inhabitants 
faulk died of cancer on april 9 1990 
in the interviews with moyers which took place in the last year 
of his life he was cheerful merry and passionate about his life 
and his battle 
the final irony of the man who beat the blacklist is that 
faulk didnt really beat it he fought the blacklist to a draw he 
did it alone and asked no quarter from the scoundrels who 
oppressed him

yvette hernandez never votes not for mayor of 
new york not for congress not even for president but if puerto 
ricos future comes to a vote shes ready to head for the nearest 
polling place 
why shouldnt i vote im puerto rican she declares 
that this furniture saleswoman has lived in new york for 17 
years matters little she was born in puerto rico and if the 
island is to decide its future independence statehood or no 
change she wants a say 
she is not alone even as congress debates when and if to hold a 
plebiscite a parallel debate is going on in and out of the 
mainland puerto rican community should puerto ricans who left the 
island and even the descendants of those emigrants have a vote 
in its destiny 
we think of ourselves as one nation and puerto rico is never 
out of mind for us and thats a fact explains us rep jose 
serrano dbronx 
serrano himself puerto rican born has proposed an amendment to 
the plebiscite legislation that would extend the vote to anyone 
born in puerto rico or with at least one parent born on the island 
the proposal is unprecedented according to columbia university 
law professor henry p monaghan 
there is no case in which there have been people who are not 
living in a territory who are enfranchised he said 
the idea of 25 million people on the mainland taking part in 
the plebiscite doesnt sit well with everyone especially sergio 
pena clos a member of the islands senate 
theyve left the island theyve abandoned the island and now 
they want to vote said pena clos theyll be affecting my 
destiny the islands destiny and the destiny of my descendants 
serranos reply this is not an election for public office 
this is an election on status political status and that 
decision belongs to all the puerto rican people 
serranos words echo on the streets of east harlem home to many 
of new yorks 1 million puerto ricans 
this is something that is a big decision this is not like an 
election that takes place every four years said carlos de jesus 
the new yorkborn son of a woman from puerto rico because 
depending on the outcome of that vote many people here might just 
want to go back to puerto rico 
his wife carmen also born in new york wants to vote 
no matter where in the world they are now they should be 
allowed to vote its our right and no one has the right to take 
that away she said 
puerto rico in fact has not been independent since it was 
conquered by ponce de leon for spain in 1509 the island remained a 
spanish colony until the spanishamerican war of 1898 when became 
a us territory 
puerto rico became a us commonwealth in 1952 exposing its 
people to a dizzying array of contradictory rights and 
proscriptions 
puerto ricans are us citizens and are eligible for military 
service but cannot vote for president they elect their own 
governor and legislature but their representative to congress has 
no vote there federal law applies to the island but puerto ricans 
pay no federal taxes 
in a 1967 nonbinding referendum 60 percent of puerto ricans 
said they wanted to retain commonwealth status while 39 percent 
wanted statehood but recent polls indicate that a slim majority 
favors statehood 
it is not clear that they will have an opportunity to vote in 
the near future president bush who strongly backs statehood for 
puerto rico has urged congress to pass plebiscite legislation 
mandating that whatever is decided by the voters be implemented by 
1993 
in a letter to the house subcommittee considering the bill bush 
wrote how can we applaud the exciting and momentous movements 
toward freedom in eastern europe latin america and elsewhere while 
refusing to grant to our own citizens the right to 
selfdetermination 
but the chances of passing such a bill in 1990 appear slim 
action on the house version has been delayed by the illness of del 
ron de lugo dvi chairman of the interior subcommittee on 
insular and international affairs 
the bills senate counterpart which has been approved by the 
energy and commerce committee still must be considered by the 
finance agriculture and judiciary committees before it can go to 
the full body and because its an election year congress is 
hoping to adjourn earlier than usual 
still the debate about who would vote continues off the island 
and on 
rafael hernandez colon puerto ricos governor and leader of the 
procommonwealth popular democratic party has said he favors 
allowing firstgeneration puerto ricans living in the united states 
to vote in the plebiscite but believes most island residents oppose 
the idea 
and former gov carlos romero barcelo of the prostatehood new 
progressive party said any effort to determine who would be 
eligible to vote would be a logistical nightmare 
pena clos noted that puerto rico has about 35 million people 
about 21 million of whom eligible to vote 
how can 25 million people living in the united states be 
allowed to affect the future of those on the island he asked 
miguel colom who moved to new york 12 years ago agrees that he 
and others living here have no business voting on the islands 
future 
im an american thats it he said 
why should they vote if they live here theyre not affected 
by what happens there i know a lot of people who say im puerto 
rican but if they sit down and think about it theyll realize 
they were born here live here and work here why should they vote 
there 
gilberto seda was born in new york its not that i dont care 
about puerto rico i do he said and its not that i deny im 
puerto rican but my homeland is new york 
but serrano said such thinking is too narrow if this were the 
united nations this would be easy to understand that there is a 
nation of puerto ricans just as there is a nation of jews around 
the world and a nation of palestinians he insisted 
which is the same reasoning that puertorican born yvette 
hernandez the nonvoter uses in asserting her right to vote in 
a plebiscite 
i live here but im puerto rican so i should vote she 
said

it would take broadcast music inc 28 years 
and six months to relive all its yesterdays 
or yesterday to be precise the beatles classic that paul 
mccartney once called scrambled eggs until he thought of a 
better title is the mostbroadcast tune in the song publishing 
companys vast catalog its gone past the 5 million mark 
played back to back that would amount to more than 28 years 
worth of yesterday said frances preston bmi president and 
chief executive officer 
preston knows this arcane piece of musical trivia because thats 
what her company does 
through computersheets bmi keeps track of how 
many times songs are played in order to funnel royalty checks to 
its stable of more than 60000 and radio log ssongwriters the company 
is 
celebrating the 50th anniversary of its birth with a series of 
public events this year 
its not celebrating bmi its celebrating the creativity of 
the great songwriters and publishers who have built this catalog 
preston said 
with the american society of composers authors and publishers 
bmi is involved in a highstakes competition thats invisible to 
most music fans but very important to those who make money off 
music bmi against 
the music business establishment and has now become the 
establishment said author marc eliot who wrote about the 
companys birth in his book rockonomics the money behind the 
music 
the companies work by signing a royalties contract with 
songwriters occasionally getting into a bidding war for bigname 
artists musicians are assured a source of income at a time when 
they may be struggling to make it in the business or after their 
time has passed 
the companies check how many times a song is performed on radio 
television or elsewhere and collect license fees that are 
distributed to songwriters in the case of yesterday it means 
estimating airtimes through logs kept by radio stations on what 
songs they play 
its not just the beatles version of the tune thats counted 
but renditions recorded by ray charles placido domingo elvis 
presley merle haggard lawrence welk the supremes frank sinatra 
and about 100 others 
and its not just on radio stations but every time the song is 
performed at trade shows in shopping malls on elevators and even 
on airplanes preston said 
back when bmi was formed in 1939 ascap had a virtual monopoly 
on song publishing broadcasters angered with the royalty rates 
demanded by ascap and the limited number of licensed composers they 
could play on the air started the company eliot described in his 
book 
the new company had an opendoor policy for all sorts of 
musicians that were essentially ignored by ascap including country 
music rhythm and blues and eventually rock n roll preston 
said 
they just became a house organ a scab union in order to gain 
representation for what ascap considered the garbage of the pile 
eliot said it turned out to be the cream of the crop 
bmi signed artists who werent part of the traditional tin pan 
alley such as leadbelly woody guthrie and hank williams in the 
early years when rock n roll started it gave bmi access to a 
goldmine of hits from chuck berry the everly brothers bb king 
the beatles and the rolling stones 
by the late 1950s bmi was jokingly referred to in the industry 
as big money incorporated eliot said in rockonomics 
today the two companies compete on almost an even keel eliot 
said bmi because its still more willing to take a chance on 
unknown artists still has an advantage in rock and pop music 
while ascap has the lead in such areas as broadway and television 
he said 
theyve become more conservative theyve become less 
embattled he said of the two companies they realize theres 
room at the table for both plates its better to exist without a 
cold war 
preston said the constant advance of new technology keeps bmi 
royalty hunters busy for instance the use of music as a 
motivational tool at trade shows and corporate meetings is a 
lucrative part of the business that was hardly thought of a decade 
ago 
the increased use of sampling old riffs in new songs 
particularly by rap artists presents a fascinating new challenge 
for the publishing companies eliot said 
in some cases older artists whose work is being appropriated 
dont appreciate what the new musicians have done he said 
its still an open question that may have to be decided by 
courts former members of the 60s rock band the turtles were 
furious with rappers de la soul for using part of their music 
without permission mc hammer recently cut rick james in on part of 
the royalties for u cant touch this which borrows the melody 
from james hit superfreak 
bmi has planned several events to celebrate its anniversary 
including giving a special achievement award to michael jackson 
but one anniversary commemoration may make music fans envious 
the company has produced a threecd set of some of its best 
music including the pop charts and television themes its 
virtually an encyclopedic look at whats been popular for the last 
50 years from the tommy dorsey bands opus no 1 to the miami 
sound machines rhythm is gonna get you 
dont look for it in stores however the company is just 
distributing it to people in the industry politicians and the 
media 
ive had so many calls from people asking if they could buy it 
somewhere she said but its not for sale

bong jae jang rises before dawn and goes to the 
brooklyn terminal market where he stocks up on green plantain 
haitian mangos and other fruits and vegetables popular with the 
caribbean immigrants who used to shop at his store on church avenue 
in flatbush 
these days jangs trip is an academic exercise he knows most 
of the produce will sit unsold on the shelf rot in the july heat 
and wind up in the trash bin outside 
whos going to buy this he asks holding up a 
cellophanewrapped hunk of a vegetable called pium kim that is 
besieged by a swarm of tiny flies 
after six months a blackled boycott of jangs greengrocery 
continues even though the television cameras are gone and the 
pickets who gather outside the front door each afternoon have 
dwindled to a handful 
the boycotters avowed aim is to force the store to close 
jangs troubles began jan 18 when giselaine felissaint a 
haitian immigrant got into an argument with several of his 
employees over some merchandise one of them touched her she says 
the man knocked her down another employee says the man put his 
hands on her and she laid down 
five months passed before the stores manager pong ok jang was 
charged with assault but the incident immediately became a symbol 
of the tensions between the citys black and korean communities 
within a few months hundreds of demonstrators were gathering 
outside the store each day along with almost as many police and 
journalists pickets yelled racial slurs at the koreans and urged 
them to go back to where you came from 
tensions were heightened by the trial of some white youths 
accused of killing a black youth in the bensonhurst section in a 
special televised speech to the city mayor david dinkins pleaded 
for calm and understanding 
the problem runs far beyond a simple assault charge many blacks 
resent the way they are treated in some of the korean grocery 
stores that have opened in their communities and some are jealous 
of the immigrants business success the selfemployed account for 
67 percent of all city workers but only 34 percent of all black 
workers 
skeptics derided the boycott as a news media creation that would 
end as soon as the last camera crew departed they were wrong by 5 
pm there usually are about a dozen demonstrators behind the blue 
police barricades that line the sidewalk outside the store few 
neighborhood residents defy their cries of boycott and venture 
inside or visit another korean grocery across the street 
the stores have become a symbol of what has happened across 
this city in terms of the lack of recognizing the humanity of black 
people says george dames a spokesman for the flatbush coalition 
for economic empowerment a boycott group it was not an isolated 
incident 
since may however tensions there have been lessening if not 
dramatically then incrementally says lonnie soury spokesman 
for the citys human rights commission 
the rev roy thompson of st pauls episcopal church agrees i 
can drive by the store without getting stuck in traffic for a 
halfhour 
dinkins has appointed a factfinding panel and called for an end 
to the boycott but none seems likely soon there still have been 
no direct negotiations between the korean and haitian communities 
let alone jang and mrs felissaint she has refused to denounce the 
boycott and has filed a 6 million suit against the store 
people say end it but we cant just wave a magic wand 
says soury of the human rights commission which is trying to get 
talks started 
were trying to identify leaders who represent those with 
legitimate interests there are people who dont have an interest 
in settling the issue he says we think that if we can get a 
group of people who can meet we can make progress but theyre not 
meeting now 
according to a poll taken last month only 13 percent of new 
yorkers supported the boycott while 58 percent supported the 
koreans among blacks only 27 percent sympathized with the 
boycotters while 37 percent sided with the koreans boycott 
leaders say the results simply reflected biased news coverage 
jang 35 says he came here in 1983 and worked for five years at 
another store before opening his own before the boycott he says 
he routinely worked 17 hours a day and was robbed three times he 
shows off the scar where a robbers bullet entered his abdomen last 
year 
his business is being sustained largely by 5000 to 7000 a 
month in donations from the citys other korean grocers they 
will support him until the boycott is over says michael kang of 
the korean produce association he is their maginot line they 
think theyre going to be next 
jang is infuriated by the refusal of the police department to 
enforce a judges order that the protesters be kept 50 feet from 
his door the city has appealed arguing that the police should be 
allowed to use discretion in deciding where the protesters should 
stand 
jang says neither dinkins nor police commissioner lee brown 
wants to stand up to the boycotters and pass responsibility for 
dealing with them back and forth he does not speak english very 
clearly but he gets his point across they play a pingpong 
game they killing my dream 
to soury the boycott is a tragedy two immigrant groups are 
pitted against each other he says when they should be 
fighting together to demand more government aid for small 
businesses for blacks and koreans and everyone else

steven kutcher has had a bugeyed fascination 
with creepy crawly critters ever since he captured his first 
firefly when he was 4 
since then he has mixed his serious study of bugs with 
hollywood makebelieve cashing in on science to become a 
behindthescenes star in fright movies such as the spidery 
arachnophobia 
i use hollywood to educate ive learned to work both sides of 
the track said kutcher 43 whose thinning hair wispy beard and 
slight features give him the look of a student of bugs 
i know there will be people who cant sleep at night and there 
will be more calls to exterminators because of this movie 
kutcher said in a recent interview but i dont want to frighten 
people with spiders my hope is that people will be more educated 
about spiders than they were before 
in the real world kutcher is an entomologist in the 
entertainment world he is a bug wrangler and hollywoods best 
known insect expert his ultimate goal is to lecture school kids 
and write books about bug behavior but he allowed you dont get 
the money you do when you frighten the wits out of people 
oh yeah fright the bite in arachnophobia comes from the 
audiences paralyzing fear of spiders the jitters are noted from 
nursery rhymes such as little miss muffet to government 
studies 
the top phobia among females and the second scariest thing next 
to heights for males is the fear of spiders bugs mice and snakes 
according to a 1988 study by the national institute of mental 
health 
and just watch how fast people move if they walk into a silky 
spider web in the dark 
hollywood hyped the anxiety by giving unreal powers to spiders 
in arachnophobia such as a poisonous bite that kills in 
seconds the eightlegged creatures that did all the killing are 
harmless delena spiders from new zealand and kutcher had one crawl 
on his face to show how benign it is 
the longlegged delena which fits in the palm of the hand was 
one of 12 species considered for the part it was cast because of 
its ability to run jump walk upside down and spin a web 
but tinseltown for years has taken liberties to scare the 
bejabbers out of audiences with sharks killer bees rats snakes 
scorpions frogs ants crocodiles and even killer rabbits 
with jaws if you stay out of the water you are safe 
humans and spiders live in the same world they can be underneath 
your seat kutcher said 
a spider projects an image of being very dangerous he said 
but is something that small going to eat you if you educate 
yourself you can overcome this fear people should learn which 
spiders are dangerous 
spiders have their good points they eat roaches and other 
housebold bugs 
they are relatively safe even the doubledfanged gargantuan 
tarantulas that were used in arachnophobia the zebrastriped 
tarantulas are as large as an extended hand they can barely be 
felt when their hairy legs crawl on your skin and they throw off 
little hairs that feel like fiberglass 
the important thing is to be gentle kutcher said 
if you pick a puppy up by the tail or a kitten by the 
whiskers its going to bite or scratch you if you pick up a 
spider by its leg it will try to defend itself i try to be very 
delicate kutcher said 
during an interview kutcher wore a tshirt adorned with the 
image of a tarantula a wristwatch that had a spider circling a web 
to mark time and a baseball cap that said bugs are my business 
he once had a radio show that had a bug boss 40 featuring such 
songs as bo weevil and elusive butterfly of love 
for a wedding in california he released 1000 butterflies as 
part of the nuptials 
and his bedroom skylight features a real spider web the 
downside is that the bodies of trapped flies sometimes fall on his 
pillow 
kutcher has been making movies with bugs for 14 years he 
directed 6000 beetles in prince of darkness placed 3000 
grasshoppers on the faces of richard burton and linda blair in 
the exorcist ii the heretic and put a disarmed wasp on farah 
fawcetts thigh in extremities 
he even gets into the act himself last year he sat in a bathtub 
with 100000 meal worms for david letterman 
and he is a veteran with spiders among his tv credits is the 
movie tarantula the deadly cargo 
how does one train a spider very carefully said kutcher 
anyone can take a bucket of cockroaches and dump it on the 
table my job is to direct them i use their behavior and adapt it 
to what the film director wants kutcher said 
actually spiders cant be trained in the traditional sense like 
dogs cats bears or dolphins they dont sit up and beg or jump 
through hoops for food or rewards but there are tricks to control 
the eightlegged extras 
in arachnophobia invisible vibrating wires set up 
boundaries that the spiders wouldnt cross moviemakers also 
corralled spiders with the spray wax lemon pledge which the 
hairylegged spiders wouldnt walk in 
heat made the spiders active and blow dryers coaxed them to 
walk 
kutcher travels with a cache of six tarantulas that means he 
also carries a bag of crickets to feed them 
he spins stories of reallife spiders that can throw their webs 
like a fisherman throws a net and he tells of spiders that look 
like ants or bird droppings 
what a life kutcher said marveling at his career look 
at all the things that have happened to me because i like spiders 
people say yuck he plays with bugs but i get to work with 
damsels in distress i never knew when i was in school id be 
coaxing a tarantula to crawl up a womans leg for hollywood

the battle of 
the little bighorn has resumed 114 years after lt col george 
armstrong custer made his last stand and indians won their last 
major victory of the plains wars 
this time barbara booher is under attack 
booher female and indian is the national park services 
superintendent at the most famous battlefield in the american west 
the place where custer lost to sitting bull and crazy horse but 
became a legend of machismo and bravery 
her appointment has triggered letters of protest to washington 
from custer fans who claim she is unfit for the job 
supporters counter that her tenure already has meant more jobs 
at the battlefield for qualified indians and will result in a much 
more balanced view of the controversial battle 
i think barbara was selected for all the wrong reasons 
because she is a woman and an indian said bill wells of malibu 
calif who serves on the board of both the nonprofit custer 
battlefield historical and museum association and the little big 
horn associates a group dedicated to preserving custers memory 
i dont think she was qualified and she was illprepared i 
think she is way in over her head wells said 
but ms boohers arrival is hailed as a miracle by local indian 
leaders long angry at what they believe is a slanted emphasis at 
the park toward custer and the 7th cavalry at the expense of proper 
recognition for the sioux and cheyenne warriors who won the battle 
its been a coming of age for a monument that has been in the 
dark ages said janine peasewindy boy president of nearby 
little big horn college at crow agency mont 
barbaras a breath of fresh air superintendents prior to her 
were consistently more interested in military history from the 
custer point of view theres nothing more symbolic than an indian 
and a woman to upset these socalled historians who are mostly 
white and male she said 
the debate over ms boohers appointment began even before she 
arrived here in june 1989 she had never worked for the park 
service before she was named superintendent for the past 17 years 
she worked for the federal government in alaska first with the 
federal aviation administration then as the allotment coordinator 
with the bureau of indian affairs in anchorage 
but in march 1989 as an executive management trainee assigned 
to park service regional director lorraine mintzmyer in the rocky 
mountain region she so impressed her mentor that ms mintzmyer 
the highest ranking woman in the park service offered ms booher 
the job at custer 
i recognized that her native american heritage might be a plus 
for her in an area where many native americans live and work but i 
hired her because of the skills she demonstrated not because of 
her heritage said ms mintzmyer 
i have been very pleased with her work at custer despite the 
fact there have been a few critics she said but i wouldnt 
have become the first woman superintendent if someone hadnt 
decided to ignore the critics and give me a chance 
born and raised on the uintah and ouray indian reservation in 
utah ms boohers father was of cherokee descent and her mother is 
northern ute she is a softspoken woman who suffers from glaucoma 
in both eyes although she is a pilot and owns two airplanes back 
in alaska 
i was very proud to be selected and im still proud but i 
had no idea it would be like this with such high visibility 
said ms booher 49 i suppose i was a little naive i was told 
it was a tough assignment and now i know what that means this is 
not a job its a way of life 
there is nothing neutral about the custer battlefield people 
say it is an enigma that theres an aura that draws people this 
story is known all over the world all id ever heard about it in 
school was from the custer point of view and when i came here on 
my own as a tourist in 1973 i thought well thats all cavalry 
this is the only place where all the monuments are to the losers 
in her first year ms booher has doubled the hiring of indians 
at the monument and tangled with critics over whether the classic 
novel bury my heart at wounded knee should be sold in the gift 
shop which is run by a historical association that considers the 
book slanted in favor of indians 
the new superintendent aims to create a more historically 
accurate presentation of what really happened when about 225 
cavalry soldiers died with custer on june 25 1876 
in 1988 indian activists staged angry demonstrations on 
horseback to protest the park services museum exhibits which they 
say reflect the worshipful myths that have grown up around the 
custer story in the past century sixteen displays revolve around 
the cavalry while only eight depict indian activities 
the battle occurred soon after gold was discovered in the black 
hills of the dakotas and an influx of whites surged into lands 
considered sacred by the indians the invasion of settlers and 
miners followed on the heels of many broken treaties 
in the spring of 1876 three army columns numbering about 2500 
soldiers were dispatched into the territory to drive hostile sioux 
and cheyenne bands onto reservations custer and his men were part 
of that force which ultimately succeeded in breaking the back of 
indian resistance in the west 
my goal is to help convey the reasons for the battle and its 
real significance said ms booher i would like to update and 
expand the exhibits and the park brochure is going to be revised 
but she is quick to point out she cannot take unilateral action 
its not as easy to accomplish that as people think we have 
to follow the guidelines and policies that govern all changes in 
parks and those are already in place i am merely an 
administrator

a top priority is establishment of a monument to the indians who 
died at the battlefield marble headstones and two tall marble 
markers authorized by congress honor fallen white soldiers only a 
painted board notes the death of indians 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo the only indian serving 
in congress and the proud possessor of a knife used by his 
greatgrandfather in the battle of the little bighorn and rep ron 
marlenee rmont are cosponsors of legislation to authorize both 
the indian monument and a national design competition 
jim court a former superintendent who believes he was forced 
out in 1986 because of philosophical differences with the park 
service lives in nearby hardin and now raises money to buy land 
around the battlefield he believes the current indian owners might 
turn the acreage into tourist attractions and the nonprofit 
organization he founded seeks to acquire the property and then deed 
it to the park 
court an avid devotee of the battlefield site is highly 
critical of ms boohers management 
ive been writing letters to congressmen to get things 
changed said court they the park service seem to have lost 
sight of what they should be doing over there 
ms boohers office which formerly was courts offers a 
sweeping view of the battlefield where so much blood was spilled so 
long ago but today on a table beside the superintendents desk 
there is an imposing statue of an indian on horseback his arm 
raised his lance ready the bronze is titled the warrior 
yet there also is a framed poster quoting the legendary chief 
joseph of the nez perce tribe hear me my chiefs i am tired my 
heart is sick and sad from where the sun now stands i will fight 
no more forever 
barbara booher the only indian woman superintendent in the park 
service has surrounded herself with meaningful symbols of a 
complex heritage 
all of life is a test and i suppose this is part of that 
test she said i feel like i was supposed to come here i 
am responsible for seeing that these resources are taken care of 
for future generations of all people 
and that is what im going to do

on the 
losers side there was no one left to tell the tale to describe 
the last moments of custers life the valor of his troops the 
tactics of sitting bull the cunning of crazy horse 
the winners fled in all directions on their fleet ponies 
victorious indians whod just won the biggest and last battle in 
their 300year war against white encroachment into a bountiful land 
that once had been all theirs 
later their stories would be sought out not only by a 
government seeking judgment against them but also by historians 
scholars and a multitude of the curious each would tell a 
different story 
this much is for certain 
the battle of the little bighorn took place in what was then 
dakota territory 60 miles southeast of billings mont 
on june 25 1876 a scorching sunday five companies of the 7th 
cavalry numbering about 225 officers and troopers advanced onto a 
ridge above the little bighorn river they were under the command 
of lt col george armstrong custer then only 36 years old but 
already a flamboyant controversial civil war hero 
below along the riverbank was an encampment of about 10000 to 
15000 indians composed of northern cheyennes and teton sioux the 
sioux actually were seven separate tribes hunkpapa blackfoot 
oglala brule two kettle sans arc and miniconjou 
custer ordered the attack his troopers were vastly outnumbered 
and outflanked the soldiers including two of custers brothers 
fought desperately but hopelessly against an estimated 2500 to 
4000 indian warriors the rescue party found only mutilated 
bodies no soldier survived 
crazy horse surrendered on may 6 1877 at camp robinson neb 
and was dead within six months killed in a guardhouse fight 
sitting bull finally gave up in 1881 and died a broken man 
ever since that day 114 years ago when custer made his last 
stand says the national park service in its official handbook 
for the custer battlefield national monument the full truth of 
what happened has eluded the assiduous quest of countless students 
into the void has fallen such an accumulation of myth and 
legend that an entranced public has little hope of distinguishing 
truth from fiction 
an enormous body of literature has amassed because of the 
battle countless poems and paintings have been inspired by it 
generations have watched exaggerated film versions of the 
historical event 
still the presses roll and the cameras turn says the park 
service booklet the public buys the controversy rages and 
there is no consensus of what happened or why on that bleak montana 
ridge in americas centennial summer

stock prices may have risen to record highs this 
year but the game isnt getting any easier for small investors 
trying to figure out how to play the bull market without getting 
gored 
what are they to make of an environment where the dow jones 
industrial average can fall 100 points in about an hours time as 
it did on the morning of monday july 23 
or how can anyone invest conservatively when supposedly stable 
blue chips like american telephone amp telegraph mcdonalds and dow 
chemical may suddenly nosedive as they have done in recent weeks 
on even a mildly disappointing earnings report for a single 
threemonth period 
it is hard to recall another time when one poor quarter no 
matter what the reason could wipe out 20 to 25 percent of a 
stocks value said jay donnaruma an analyst at first albany 
corp in albany ny 
it is downright scary and that type of volatility will just 
keep even more people away 
amid all this seemingly chaotic activity financial advisers see 
some object lessons for what individual investors can and cannot 
reasonably hope to achieve in stocks and stockrelated investors 
in the blue monday market drop last week for example 
william brennan a specialist in financial planning at the big 
accounting firm of ernst amp young saw a clear message for small 
investors 
that kind of volatility indicates that they shouldnt be in 
the market on a shortterm basis brennan said 
the prudent investor has to make a longterm commitment to 
me longterm means for the foreseeable future unless there is 
some dramatic change in their own circumstances 
to further minimize the effects of shortterm market 
fluctuations brennan argues for a plan of regular periodic 
purchases rather than attempting to buy at bargain prices 
such a strategy he said gives investors the benefit of a 
system called dollarcostaveraging since over time fixed amounts 
of their money will buy more shares whenever prices are low 
even if they have expertise most small investors simply lack 
the necessary time and tools to trade stocks shortterm analysts 
say furthermore frequent trading usually incurs heavy transaction 
costs and taxes that increase the odds against success 
a longterm investment by contrast avoids most of those 
pitfalls while giving investors a chance to participate in the 
growth of the general economy and specific businesses 
greg smith an analyst at the investment firm of 
prudentialbache securities says he believes individual investors 
today are investing avidly in stocks especially through mutual 
funds seeking to keep up with inflation in such important areas of 
the economy as health care 
more and more people perceive that inflation is a staple with 
us particularly in the service sector smith observed they 
know that as they age they will have to buy services particularly 
health care services 
stocks he added have about as good a track record as an 
inflation fighter as anything else and they tend to be more liquid 
than alternative real assets such as real estate and collectibles 
while investing for the long term averts or minimizes some 
significant risks it is by no means a sure thing 
people who opt to own individual stocks might be smart or lucky 
enough to pick a company like philip morris which increased about 
tenfold in value from the late 1970s to the late 1980s while 
paying dividends that increased every year 
or they could wind up with a stock like lomas financial corp a 
major firm in the mortgage banking business which sold for more 
than 22 a share as recently as 1988 and last week traded for less 
than 50 cents 
for a haven from such misadventure many investors these days 
turn to professional managers running diversified portfolios of 
investments such as mutual funds 
in search of still more stability and certainty of course many 
individuals steer clear of stocks in favor of interestbearing 
investments with stated values that dont fluctuate for instance 
bank certificates of deposit and moneymarket mutual funds 
but the key problem with this sort of perceived safety brennan 
says is that youre always losing money to inflation

at a business dinner in paris an american 
executive scoops up a business card from a japanese counterpart 
scribbles his number on it and hands it to a saudi arabian on his 
left 
wrong wrong and wrong dorothy manning would say 
manning is a cultural consultant whose job is to guide 
globetrotting ceos through the thicket of international customs 
that can ensnare the bestplanned business deal 
for instance she says its a faux pas to talk business over 
dinner in france do so and youll be seen as an oaf fair game for 
some cutting french wit 
similarly one should never jot down a name or number on a 
business card in japan such cards are taken very seriously and 
should not be treated in a cavalier manner 
in saudi arabia it is the height of poor manners to pass 
documents with the left hand why the left hand is used for 
bathroom functions 
other countries are small they depend on external commerce 
manning says the japanese thoroughly study us and the europeans 
grew up in a situation where they have to deal with other 
countries 
up until now weve been so big and strong it hasnt been 
necessary manning adds 
no more 
with europe united the japanese economic juggernaut steaming 
ahead and communism crumbling in the east bloc american business 
must compete in an everexpanding global market that means plenty 
of opportunity for consultants like manning who charges between 
about 350 and 750 a day per executive 
frank mandicott an international support services manager for 
general electric aerospace in syracuse ny said he has used 
several such consultants although it can be difficult to persuade 
corporate management to pay for cultural consulting he doesnt 
doubt the value 
the money is well spent mandicott said monday if you go 
abroad and offend your host and lose the contract whats the cost 
of that 
manning says the central problem in doing business 
internationally is establishing trust 
people tend not to trust each other because they dont 
understand each other she says if you see someone who dresses 
differently who has different customs youre not sure theyre 
being open with you until you know thats normal for them 
of course whats normal from one country to the next can vary 
quite widely 
for instance in many moslem countries written contracts dont 
exist and in korea contracts are viewed not as a binding pact but 
a document from which to depart if conditions change 
other tips for the international executive 
dont send chrysanthemums to a colleague in france they are a 
symbol of death 
never show the sole of your foot to an associate in saudi 
arabia doing so implies you feel you can tread upon someone and 
is very insulting 
holding up two fingers will get you a cab quickly in the 
soviet union but think twice before doing so two fingers mean 
youll pay double 
but sometimes even the cultural consultants can err manning 
organized 8 am breakfast forums on business protocol for 
international executives 
all was well until she realized that the timing for some might 
be off 
the moroccans brought it up right away manning says they 
said they didnt get up that early

after decades of trying to top unrealistic 
production quotas china appears to be setting its sights on an 
economic restructuring similar to soviet perestroika 
the economic plans still aim at the lofty goal of quadrupling 
chinas 1980 gross national product by the year 2000 
but they are also intended to cure major impediments to economic 
growth including energy and transportation shortages and poor 
management that have left almost onethird of the nations 
industrial capacity idle 
minister of the state planning commission zou jiahua told a 
national conference on industrial production sunday the government 
is adjusting the economy to stop unnecessary production and to 
stimulate markets that were stifled during the inflationcurbing 
economic retrenchment that began in 1988 
chinas economy for the time being is not a question of 
production speed but the speed of the operation of the national 
economy as a whole the official xinhua news agency quoted zou as 
saying 
in addition to recent cuts in interest rates to stimulate 
investment the government has raised the states purchasing price 
for coal and allocated 1 billion for modernizing industries zou 
noted 
to stimulate demand for oversupplied items he said the state 
monopolys control over institutional purchases of office equipment 
and furniture color television sets refrigerators and hotel 
furbishings would be relaxed 
both china and the soviet union are struggling with major 
structural adjustments but chinas markets are full of goods 
unlike in the soviet union where stores are bare 
the russian term perestroika refers to the economic and 
social restructuring of society to make it run more efficiently 
the failure to revive the chinese industrial economy despite 
1988s austerity measures has raised fears of a recession 
according to one official estimate 34 percent of all chinese 
firms are in the red a figure that climbs to more than 50 percent 
in many areas shanghais industrial output edged up only 08 
percent from january to june while production in most interior 
provinces actually fell 
an infusion of 42 billion in loans for slumping industries 
from january to march double the amount for the same period in 
1989 led mainly to further overstocking of unsold products 
many chinese economists say fundamental structural problems 
namely poor quality and inefficiency resulting from inept 
management are hindering the economic recovery 
this country cannot afford to keep industry going by issuing 
endless loans feng ronger a director in the peoples bank of 
china told the englishlanguage china daily 
it is high time to change the countrys industrial structure 
and product mix ms feng was quoted as saying 
premier li peng and communist party general secretary jiang 
zemin have also urged structural reforms 
the market sluggishness that has appeared is not allround 
sluggishness it is structural sluggishness mainly due to 
the serious impropriety of our industrial structure resulting from 
many years of old practices the poor quality of enterprises and 
the poor quality or nonmarketability of some products li said 
in an economic report earlier this month 
li said banks should increase loans earmarked for upgrading 
enterprises and their equipment improving energy conservation and 
developing new products 
some economists have suggested that china adopt a shareholding 
system for its stateowned enterprises becoming a major 
stockholder in firms that raise their own capital and engage in 
profitsharing 
but the sheer size of chinas economic problems coupled with 
the potential for political unrest raises doubts as to just how 
much efficiencyoriented planners will be able to achieve

a former eastern airlines foreman pleaded guilty 
to falsifying maintenance records that allegedly allowed unsafe 
airplanes to fly 
elia dragone 29 of liberty avenue in jersey city nj told a 
federal judge monday at his arraignment that he ignored vital 
repairs but altered records to make it look like they had been done 
he said he also falsified aircraft log books work cards and 
computer records to get eastern aircraft into the air and avoid 
costly flight delays and cancellations 
he said the fraud was orchestrated by his superiors at the 
airline 
dragone was the first employee of the troubled airline to plead 
guilty to what prosecutors say was a conspiracy to overlook 
maintenance problems 
eastern and nine of its managers were charged last week in a 
60count criminal indictment that alleges conspiracy to defraud the 
government wire fraud falsification of documents and obstruction 
of justice 
dragone named in 20 counts of the indictment pleaded guilty 
before us district judge i leo glasser monday to two counts 
conspiracy and obstructing a federal aviation administration 
investigation into the airline 
he faces five years in prison and a 250000 fine on each count 
when he is sentenced scheduled for oct 17 he was allowed to 
remain free on his own recognizance 
in exchange for cooperating in the investigation the government 
will dismiss the other charges against dragone and recommend 
leniency in sentencing assistant us attorney charles w gerber 
said 
according to a fourpage plea agreement signed june 18 dragone 
will testify at trials against eastern and its employees he will 
also cooperate in investigations of the airline by the faa and 
other government agencies 
prosecutors could not say how long he worked for eastern or when 
he left the company 
the indictment unsealed july 25 named eastern and nine of its 
highlevel management employees including edward upton former 
vice president of maintenance and engineering and thomas lewis 
easterns maintenance director for the region from washington to 
montreal 
they and the other defendants are to be arraigned aug 6 
the criminal indictment was unprecedented in the airline 
industry 
eastern is struggling to regain passengers rebuild service and 
reorganize in bankruptcy court 
the indictment covering july 1985 to october 1989 alleged a 
scheme to pressure and intimidate employees to keep the aircraft 
in flight at all costs 
the probe began two years ago after an eastern maintenance 
supervisor voluntarily told federal prosecutors about 
irregularities at the airline 
no accidents or injury resulted from the alleged violations and 
eastern said it has taken full corrective action the faa said 
the airline now meets safety standards

patients in dozens of pediatricians offices are 
going to be exposed to special video programs with commercials 
starting this week 
the service is called healthlink television the executive 
overseeing it david moore said monday that tv sets and video disc 
players for showing the program would be in operation by wednesday 
in 100 pediatricians offices in new york chicago and los angeles 
plans are to expand nationally to 2500 doctors offices by the 
end of august 5000 by the end of september and 20000 by early 
1991 he said 
doctors will be given a onehour program on a laserdisc that is 
to be played continuously on the tv system during the business day 
the program will focus on health care topics with up to nine 
minutes of commercials each two to four minutes long per hour 
between program segments 
healthlink television is the first of two commerciallysponsored 
video programs that are being produced for audiences in medical 
waiting rooms 
healthlink is a subsidiary of hearstabcviacom entertainment 
services a joint venture of capital citiesabc inc the hearst 
corp and viacom international inc 
the other video program is special reports television being 
produced by whittle communications of knoxville tenn and 
debuting in october whittle is 50 percentowned by the 
entertainment giant time warner inc 
both services are aimed principally at mothers visiting the 
doctor either for themselves or with their children 
they are the latest example of media vehicles developed to 
enable advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences other 
commercial targeted programming includes the channel one news 
program for teens in the classroom programs for women at the 
beauty parlor and a news show for shoppers in the grocery checkout 
line 
these efforts are contributing to the erosion of the audience 
for network television and are being blamed partly for the weakness 
in advertising for mass media such as the consumer magazines 
moore said healthlink tv will be installed in september in 
offices of obstetricians and gynecologists as well as those of 
pediatricians and said that family practitioners will start getting 
the service a month later separate programs developed with advice 
from doctors in each medical specialty will be created each month 
for each type of office 
on the first healthlink program the only paid commercials are 
for tylenol the pain reliever from johnson amp johnson public 
service messages also were included 
moore said two other advertisers he declined to identify have 
made firm commitments to sponsor the programs for family 
practitioners 
healthlink also announced that it has signed three physicians 
with experience in television as hosts for its three programs 
dr nancy snyderman a medical correspondent for abcs good 
morning america and kpixtv in san francisco will host the 
pediatrics program 
dr holly atkinson vice president of programming and medical 
affairs at the cable channel lifetime medical television will host

chrysler corp said today its secondquarter 
profit plunged 472 percent from last year mainly because of 
incentive costs 
the company said it earned 180 million or 81 cents a share 
during the april through june period compared with 341 million or 
146 a share during the same period last year secondquarter 
earnings last year were inflated by 8 million from the sale of 
chryslers gulfstream aerospace inc subsidiary 
without the gulfstream sale its profit would be off only 46 
percent from results of 333 million or 142 a share a year ago 
revenues fell 111 percent to 88 billion from 99 billion 
during the apriljune period last year 
if not for the huge yeartoyear increase in perunit 
incentive costs we would have made more money this quarter than we 
did in the second quarter of 1989 chrysler chairman lee iacocca 
said the company will not say specificialy how much it spent on 
incentives during the quarter but spokesman tom houston said it 
was more than 1000 for every car and truck sold 
chryslers earnings were in line with wall street analysts 
expectations 
for the first half of this year chryslers earnings fell 637 
percent to 251 million or 113 a share from 692 million or 
296 a share last year revenue for the first half dropped 158 
percent to 165 billion from 196 billion 
last thursday general motors corp said its secondquarter 
profit fell 40 percent to 9901 million and ford motor co said 
it made 7707 million down 45 percent from a year ago 
gm and ford blamed part of their decreases on economic problems 
in brazil where both companies have large manufacturing factories 
chrysler has a small overseas presence 
incentives ate into profits for each of the big three during the 
second quarter ford treasurer david mccammon said incentives cost 
the automaker an average of 1025 per vehicle sold during the 
period gm refused to release percar incentive costs 
chrysler has been more bullish about using incentives to boost 
sales than the other two companies in january for the first time 
in history chrysler offered a 1000 rebate on its popular 
minivans and sales soared 
but when the incentives expired sales plummeted 
chryslers car and truck sales through the first half of this 
year ran 13 percent behind last years pace gms were down 35 
percent and fords were off 78 percent 
chryslers profit in the first quarter dropped 80 percent to 
71 million compared with last year analysts and company 
officials have estimated that the company wont make any money in 
the third quarter mainly because of retooling at its two minivan 
plants which interrupts production of some of the companys most 
profitable vehicles 
automakers are wholesalers that make money on cars and trucks 
sold to dealers consequently when production stops the company 
loses money the effects of production halts usually show up in 
retail sales figures within three months depending on inventory of 
unsold vehicles

newmarketonfergus ireland ap the worlds most powerful 
agriculture ministers today played down a surprise proposal by the 
european community to cut global farm support by 30 percent over a 
decade 
the ec proposal was only a start us agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said 
he made his comments at a news conference at the conclusion of a 
twoday private meeting of the senior agriculture officials of the 
united states the ec japan canada and australia 
japanese agriculture minister tomio yamamoto said the gathering 
was not the place for negotiations 
we did not discuss substance and details yamamoto said 
canadian agriculture minister donald mazankowski told reporters 
earlier if you start from a distorted playing field and you 
apply the 30 percent cuts youd still end up with a distorted 
playing field 
the ec commissioner ray macsharry made the proposal early 
monday at the socalled quint meeting which was held at dromoland 
castle near shannon in western ireland 
a dispute over europes huge farm subsidies is threatening the 
successful conclusion of current global trade liberalization talks 
under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the united states and 14 other farm exporting countries want the 
12nation ec to end its export credits system and cut direct 
subsidies for farmers which the critics say distort trade 
european commission spokesman john cooney said that macsharrys 
proposal was an important initiative 
people have been saying the commission has been stalling he 
said monday the proposal has taken the lead in these talks 
but mazankowski said its hard to really get a real fix on 
it until we really see all the details its very difficult to make 
an accurate assessment 
he said the united states and canada already may have 
implemented such cuts 
mazankowski said what were really after is specific 
reductions in the three specific areas of market access internal 
support and export refunds 
the canadian minister added were going to enter into more 
intense negotiations as we move forward 
the us delegation said it would be inappropriate to negotiate 
a proposal outside gatts current uruguay round of talks ms shipp 
noted that macsharry yeutter and their colleagues were not the 
actual gatt negotiators 
macsharrys proposed figure of course needs great 
clarification and articulation she said 
however the us and ec teams continued to express confidence 
that with hard work an overall gatt agreement would be reached on 
time in december 
macsharrys proposed overall 30 percent cut in farm support 
covers the period 1986 to 1996 and includes ec cuts which already 
have been implemented cooney said 
cooney cited achieved reductions of 10 percent in support for 
crops and a 15 percent cut in livestock support 
details will be worked out and the proposal will be presented to 
the european commission in september cooney said the commission 
would have to approve the plan before it could be presented at 
gatt he said 
gatt negoitators are to meet again in geneva switzerland in 
late august they agreed at a meeting last week to compile lists 
and costs of their farm support by oct 1 
complicating the negotiations are disagreements about how to 
measure support 
the developed worlds farm subsidies cost consumers and 
taxpayers 245 billion last year according to the parisbased 
organization for economic cooperation and development 
the cost to ec consumers and taxpayers was 93 billion to 
japans 68 billion and the to united states 46 billion the 
24nation oecd said

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
the early strength was centered in the soybean pit and rooted in 
two factors a strong cash market for soybeans and a weekly 
government report that showed corn and soybean development still 
lagging far behind the normal pace 
in addition to higher cash prices for soybeans analysts said 
relatively few delivery notices were posted this morning at the 
board of trade 
today is the first opportunity for traders to declare their 
intent to deliver soybeans against the august contract a low 
number of notices indicates strong cashmarket demand 
mondays weekly agriculture department cropprogress report 
showed corn and soybean development still lagging far behind the 
normal pace although the crops were rated in very good condition 
the slow pace of crop development is a function of heavy spring 
rains which delayed planting in some areas an early frost in the 
midwest which is considered unlikely could damage latematuring 
soybeans analysts said 
thats the only thing the bulls can hang their hats on and it 
wont mean much if we get a normal frost date said joel karlin 
an analyst with research department inc in chicago 
in early trading wheat futures were cent to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 294 a bushel 
corn was 1 cent to 1 cents higher with september at 262 a 
bushel oats were cent to 1 cents higher with september at 
128 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower to 5 cents higher with 
august at 593 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 10 cent to 43 cent higher with august at 
7807 cents a pound feeder cattle were 02 cent lower to 20 cent 
higher with august at 8925 cents a pound live hogs were 55 cent 
to 45 cent higher with august at 6105 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 165 cents to the limit 2 cents higher with august at

blinder robinson amp co once the largest 
pennystock brokerage in the world has filed for protection from 
its creditors while it reorganizes under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws 
blinder robinson said in a statement issued monday that it has 
ceased to do business as a brokerage it said it intends to 
transfer its 250000 customer accounts and brokerage operations to 
another unidentified brokerage firm 
founder and president meyer blinder was not immediately 
available for comment 
robert davenport head of the security and exchange commissions 
regional office in denver said the sec has been aware of blinder 
robinsons teetering finances in recent weeks but did not know of 
the bankruptcy until monday night 
once the largest pennystock firm in the world blinder 
robinson had shrunk to onethird its former size amid 
investigations by federal regulators and investor lawsuits it 
recorded a loss of 148 million in 1988 and 117 million in 1989 
penny stocks are low cost high risk securities usually trading 
for less than 3 per share they are not listed on stock exchanges 
and typically are used to raise capital for new or small companies 
according to a filing made monday with the sec blinder 
robinson owed its customers 48 million in cash and other 
brokerage firms 400000 the brokerage also owed customers and 
other brokerage firms 70 million in securities the filing said 
blinder robinson was the target of numerous state and federal 
investigations blinder himself faces charges of racketeering and 
wire fraud in indictments handed down earlier this year by a grand 
jury in nevada 
although the government lawsuits cost blinder robinson millions 
in legal fees over the past decade a civil lawsuit won by onetime 
denver stockbroker donald walford may have been the last straw 
walford won a judgment worth about 57 million earlier this 
month when the colorado supreme court refused to hear any more 
appeals from blinder robinson that judgment which has not been 
fully paid by the firm had prompted meyer blinder to threaten 
bankruptcy in recent weeks 
in a state supreme court filing last week walfords attorney 
steve miller told the court blinder had threatened bankruptcy and 
had told him you took me out even though the sec couldnt for 
years you can tell that to the press 
miller said monday the bankruptcy might mean part of the 57 
million judgment never will be paid but he added it also means 
my civil lawsuit has closed the doors to blinder robinson 
blinder who in 1987 paid himself 94 million while the 
brokerage brought in about 138 million in revenues has taken a 
battering this year from government regulators as well 
on july 13 the sec filed a 24 million lawsuit against the 
selfproclaimed king of the penny stocks just three days after he 
lost the supreme court appeal to the walford lawsuit on april 27 
the sec ordered blinder out of the brokerage business and his firm 
to be shut for 45 days the order was stayed however pending 
appeals 
in the most critical blow delivered by the government a federal 
grand jury in las vegas nev handed down an 11count criminal 
indictment in february the indictment charged blinder and four 
other men with racketeering securities fraud and conspiracy to 
violate racketeering laws 
in november 1988 internal revenue service agents along with 
the sec staged a fourday raid at the blinder building looking for 
evidence of money laundering and stock fraud the evidence from 
that raid served in the grand jury investigation

a top federal regulator said today the fund 
protecting commercial bank deposits is under very substantial 
stress and probably will suffer a third consecutive loss this 
year 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said we may well have another loss in the current year 
he told the senate banking committee the loss could drop 
reserves in the fund to between 50 cents and 60 cents per 100 in 
bank deposits 
speaking to reporters during a break in the hearing seidman 
said it would not be unreasonable to predict a 2 billion loss 
in the bank insurance fund lowering reserves to roughly 11 
billion 
the fund has lost money in every year since 1988 when it began 
with reserves of 18 billion the fund is declining despite 
increases in the insurance premiums paid by banks 
seidman said after a review of more than 1000 problem banks in 
the country his agency believes the fund is still adequate to 
handle bank failures 
at this point we believe we can handle anything we can see 
he said 
seidman also said most bank and thrift customers are 
illequipped to evaluate the health of the institutions where they 
deposit their money 
only a small proportion of depositors have the resources and 
ability to make informed judgments about the condition of a bank 
he said 
even the best regulators wall street types and financial 
gurus have a very poor record of foreseeing banking problems much 
in advance he said in testimony prepared for the senate banking 
committee 
seidman whose agency insures deposits at commercial banks and 
thrifts avoided commenting on specific proposals to revise deposit 
insurance laws but he said any proposals designed to increase 
depositor oversight of banks have their limitations 
in the wake of the sampl debacle many conservative economists 
advocate scaling back deposit insurance they argue that 
depositors knowing their money was protected by the government 
didnt care if they were putting it into institutions run by high 
flyers 
however seidman stressed requiring bank and thrift owners to 
risk more of their own capital as a way to reduce managers 
temptation to take excessive risks 
it seems appropriate that serious consideration should be 
given to phasing in higher capital requirements for banks he 
said 
seidmans views are broadly consistent with those offered in 
recent weeks by treasury secretary nicholas f brady and federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan 
both expressed reluctance to lower the current 
100000peraccount limit on deposit insurance but commented 
favorably on strong capital standards 
however both brady and greenspan expressed interest in trying 
to limit deposit insurance to one account per person a subject 
seidman did not address in his prepared remarks 
the treasury department is studying the deposit insurance system 
and is expected to offer recommendations for change by the end of 
the year 
meanwhile lobbyist robert j thompson said he would refuse to 
honor a subpoena from sen howard metzenbaum dohio for testimony 
before the senate judiciary antitrust committee today about his 
role in arranging the purchase of a failed sampl by arizona insurance 
executive james m fail 
thompson a former aide to thenvice president george bush said 
in a twohour interview with the washington post that he arranged 
meetings for fail and his associates with various federal officials 
and was paid his regular fee received backing for a 150000 loan 
and was promised 2 percent of the profits on the deal 
the paper quoted thompson as calling the subcommittee hearing 
a rigged game and saying senator metzenbaum is not 
interested in fair play or he truth about the bluebonnet 
transaction he is interested only in headlines 
thompsons lawyer stanley m brand former chief counsel for 
the house of representatives said thompson is refusing to comply 
with the subpoena because metzenbaums subcommittee is exceeding 
its jurisdiction by probing thompsons personal and business 
finances and has violated his privacy by leaking confidential 
information to the news media 
metzenbaum has asked sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the 
senate judiciary committee to schedule a vote for thursday on 
compelling thompson to comply with the subcommittee subpoena 
separately a senior treasury department official suggested 
monday that congress could avoid voting on a 100 billion savings 
and loan bailout for 1991 until next year by passing a stopgap bill 
for no more than 10 billion 
the proposal which would postpone action on the larger 
appropriation until after the november election was raised by 
treasury under secretary robert r glauber

interco inc which has been struggling to pay 
off its large junkbond debt has reached a basic restructuring 
agreement with its creditors a company spokesman announced tuesday 
the deal between the footwear and furniture maker and its banks 
medium term noteholders and subordinated debenture holders 
apparently will keep the company from going into bankruptcy 
although no details of the agreement were released tuesday the 
company did say it will not be required to make any principal or 
interest payments on its bonds until october as part of the 
agreement 
the waiver of payments includes a 38 million interest payment 
that was due monday and also allows interco to make an 86 million 
interest payment that was due july 16 sometime before aug 15 
as we have stated previously interco has four successful core 
companies however intercos debt is much larger than these 
companies can support we believe that the financial restructuring 
under discussion will alleviate the problems caused by intercos 
excessive debt levels said richard loynd chairman and chief 
executive officer 
negotiations on the restructuring are continuing loynd said 
and more details will be released soon 
interco based in st louis was a diversified manufacturer 
until 1988 when it was forced to borrow 165 billion to fend off a 
hostile takeover attempt 
since then the company has been selling off subsidiaries in an 
attempt to repay its debts it has retained four companies 
converse inc florsheim shoes lane co and broyhill furniture 
industries 
however intercos debt repayment plan faltered when interco 
subsidiaries brought far less than the company had anticipated and 
company officials began looking for ways to restructure its debts 
in june the company told subordinated debenture holders that it 
wouldnt be able to make a scheduled interst payment and instead 
asked bondholders to convert their bonds to common stock 
under that plan which is still pending before the securities 
exchange commission the holders of intercos senior subordinated 
debentures due in 2000 were asked to exchange 1000 principle 
amount of those bonds for 70 shares of interco common stock and 
900 principle amount of a new issue of 6 percent accrual 
convertible debentures

the trade ministry said tuesday the nation should 
begin sharing its technical prowess with the rest of the world 
partly to help ease foreign trade friction 
an advisory report released by the ministry of international 
trade and industry said japan should sell more technology overseas 
and should welcome increased numbers of foreign researchers at 
government and private institutes 
it said japanese companies voracious appetite for new 
technology causes the country to import more foreign technology 
than it exports in the form of patent royalties and proprietary 
rights despite its growing technological prowess 
its time to look to see what are the root causes of trade 
irritation and as a country which now produces 15 percent of the 
worlds gross national product to cope with them as quickly as 
possible said hidetoshi nishimura director of the ministrys 
machinery and information industries bureau 
after attaining economic growth on the basis of technology 
imported from the west it is time for japan to export its 
technology to the rest of the world he said 
he said the ministry would try to encourage transfers of 
technology by creating favorable conditions including tax 
credits in a program being formulated 
private companies pay for about 80 percent of japans research 
and development compared with less than 50 percent in the united 
states and carefully guard their technology from rival businesses 
this has led to questions about whether they would be willing to 
share their most advanced technology with foreign interests 
last year japanese companies were the top four recipients of 
patents in the united states and reportedly filed nearly half the 
patents in the world 
in the 1960s and 1970s before the development of extensive 
private japanese research capabilities the trade ministry played 
an important role in guiding japanese research efforts for 
developing key technologies in areas such as computers and 
semiconductors 
but as trade friction has intensified in recent years 
especially with the united states the ministry has begun pursuing 
a reversal of its exportfirst orientation 
the report said japan bought 439 million more technology from 
overseas in 1988 than it sold while the united states sold 73 
billion more than it acquired 
the ratio of japanese technology exports to imports has 
increased but remains at a deficit nishimura said 
about 87000 japanese researchers were working aboard in other 
industrialized nations during 1988 while only about 9000 
researchers from those countries were in japan the report said 
nishimura said the growing costs of research in basic science 
also have increased the need for international cooperative research 
programs and for japan as a wealthy country to take a stronger 
role 
in the past western nations took a leading role in the 
exchange of research now is the time for japan to do so he said 
the ministry is preparing budget requests for implementation of 
the report which was prepared by a committee of academics and 
officials from companies such as sony hitachi and toyota 
nishimura said

the white house today threatened to veto 
legislation making its way through congress aimed at curbing junk 
mail on fax machines and telephoneanswering devices 
white house deputy press secretary alixe glen said the measure 
was unnecessary 
the number of complaints are small and there are already 
systems and infrastructures in place to deal with the problem 
she said 
by voice vote the house approved legislation monday to 
authorize the federal communications commission to set up a 
national clearinghouse for listing telephone subscribers who object 
to the endless faxes and unsolicited messages the senate has not 
yet acted on the bill 
this legislation empowers consumers and businesses with the 
ability to just say no to unsolicited telephone advertisements 
said rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house energy 
and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance 
under the bill the fcc also would establish penalties for 
advertisers who fail to abide by the clearinghouse list 
solicitations by charitable and political organizations would be 
exempt from the ban 
consumers either private individuals or businesses could 
specify that they do not wish to receive advertising by fax 
machines or automatically dialed prerecorded telephone 
solicitations 
the legislation was crafted with help from the fcc the 
telephone industry and the direct marketing industry markey said

a civil rights leader indicated today 
that an agreement was near that would lead him to call off protests 
during next weeks pga championship at a heretofore allwhite 
country club 
the rev abraham woods birmingham president of the southern 
christian leadership conference said it seems as if we may be 
able to put this thing behind us 
woods said an announcement on the matter would be made later in 
the day and that a shoal creek country club representative would 
attend 
woods had threatened to lead protests during the aug 912 pga 
stop because the founder of the allwhite shoal creek club hall 
thompson said last month that the private club south of birmingham 
would not be pressured into accepting black members 
thompson later apologized saying his remark had been taken out 
of context and the citys black mayor and others have been working 
behind the scenes for days to try to defuse the issue his office 
had no immediate comment today on the report of a possible 
settlement 
woods said in a telephone interview that he was asking that 
shoal creek immediately take in the mayor richard arrington who 
is black as an honorary member with all rights and privileges 
and start the process of accepting two other birmingham blacks who 
have said they wanted to join as regular members 
we are hopeful that their response will be such that they will 
accept it and we can put this thing behind us he said 
the rev joseph lowery president of the atlantabased sclc was 
to attend the news conference in city hill along with arrington 
jim awtrey executive director of the pga and an unnamed shoal 
creek official woods said 
an honorary membership for arrington and a start on accepting 
the two others would be practical steps woods said were 
not fishing for policy steps on paper mayor arrington as an 
honorary member would break the color barrier then they can start 
the process on other blacks and we can let the process run its 
course 
it takes about six months for a proposed member to be accepted 
by shoal creek on an expedited basis 
meanwhile a spokeswoman for lee trevino who won the 1984 pga 
at shoal creek said he has decided to take part in this years 
tournament after saying last week he was having second thoughts 
about it 
he is planning on being there judy pierre of lee trevino 
enterprises said today from dallas 
on monday the nbcowned tv station for los angeles had joined 
the protest saying it would not show highlights of the 
championship and spalding sports worldwide the nations largest 
golf ball manufacturer said it was pulling its ads as several 
other companies did last week 
burbank califbased knbc the networks secondlargest 
affiliate would report only the results of the tournament said 
the stations sports director fred roggin 
were not trying to ignore the golfers or the fans of golf 
said jeff hoffman a sports producer at knbc our stance is 
directed at the course were not interested in publicizing or 
showing the course on our station 
the tournament will be televised on abc and on espn the cable

interco inc the manufacturing firm that 
nearly destroyed itself by using junk bonds to fend off a hostile 
takeover attempt apparently has solved its nagging debt woes 
the company which owns converse and florsheim footwear 
companies along with furniture manufacturers lane co and broyhill 
industries announced a basic restructuring agreement with its 
creditors tuesday 
the deal between the st louisbased company and its banks 
mediumterm noteholders and subordinated debenture holders 
apparently will keep the company from entering bankruptcy 
proceedings 
it was reached after four days of marathon meetings in new york 
involving 50 to 60 people representing the various creditors 
we all felt that interco was basically a very sound operation 
that had the terrible misfortune of getting trapped with a terrible 
balance sheet said wilbur ross senior managing director of 
rothschild inc which served as chief negotiator for subordinated 
debenture holders 
this was a situation that deserved a peaceful ending rather 
than a contentious one 
the agreement involves restructuring about 19 billion in bank 
loans bonds and other corporate notes 
interco took on 165 billion in debt in 1988 in an effort to 
protect itself from a takeover attempt by corporate raiders steven 
and michael rales of washington 
at the time the company made mens and womens apparel 
operated 201 retail stores such as doityourself hardware stores 
and discount clothing stores and owned footwear and furniture 
companies 
to pay off its debt the company announced plans to sell off all 
of its companies except the four it currently operates 
however the plan faltered when interco subsidiaries brought far 
less than the company had anticipated that coupled with the 
junkbond market collapse left the company with more debt than it 
started with 
company officials were forced to look for another solution 
although no details of the restructuring agreement were released 
tuesday the company did say it will not be required to make any 
principal or interest payments on its bonds until october 
the waiver of payments includes a 38 million interest payment 
that was due monday and also allows interco to make an 86 million 
interest payment that was due july 16 sometime before aug 15 
as we have stated previously interco has four successful core 
companies however intercos debt is much larger than these 
companies can support we believe that the financial restructuring 
under discussion will alleviate the problems caused by intercos 
excessive debt levels said richard loynd chairman and chief 
executive officer 
additional details will be released after the various parties 
review and approve the basic agreement interco officials said 
were now putting everything on paper and making sure that 
everything that we put down is actually what we agreed to ross 
said but the main accomplishment is that weve reached an 
agreement that will put the company in a very good position to move 
forward 
ross said tuesdays agreement will include general provisions of 
a proposal made by the company in june that asked bondholders to 
accept common stock in exchange for their bonds

a prestigious dutch retailer on tuesday 
announced it is buying fao schwarz a venerable old american toy 
store chain known to generations of shoppers as the ultimate place 
to browse for playthings 
the us subsidiary of nv koninklijke bijenkorf beheer kbb 
will acquire the 17 stores operated by fao schwarz as well as its 
catalog business for an unannounced price 
officials disclosed few details of the deal with fao schwarzs 
present owners an investment group that includes the chains two 
highest ranking executives 
the acquisition will give kbb an entry into american retailing 
and provide the dutch company with a springboard from which to 
expand in the united states 
fao schwarz is the preeminent retailer of fine toys in the 
world and we are committed to building on faos tradition of 
excellence arie maas chairman of kbb said in a news release 
peter l harris president and chief executive officer of fao 
schwarz said in an interview that he foresees the chain moving 
into europe and japan after the acquisition 
harris said he and his management team will continue in their 
current roles but chairman peter c morse who along with harris 
led the investment group that bought fao schwarz in 1986 is 
leaving 
the new yorkbased toy store company which was founded in 1862 
was family owned for about its first 100 years after a succession 
of corporate owners it was bought by swiss retailer franz carl 
weber in the late 1970s 
although its reputation didnt suffer much among casual 
customers fao schwarz lost some of its luster in the early 80s 
analysts say harris said annual sales were below 20 million when 
the investment group bought it in the mid1980s 
he said the chains sales are expected to exceed 50 million 
this year 
analysts credit the current management with restoring fao 
schwarzs stature within the industry and say the chain again is 
highly regarded for innovative merchandising 
fao schwarz has managed to prosper in a difficult retailing 
environment by emphasizing service and taking a creative approach 
to displaying merchandise harris said the merchandise itself 
such as an eightfoot stuffed giraffe that sells for 4500 also 
sets the store apart from other toy retailers 
fao schwarz operates two big stores one in new york and the 
other in san francisco the store on manhattans fifth avenue is a 
major tourist attraction much smaller branches are located in 
urban settings including boston chicago and palm beach fla as 
well as in suburban malls a new store opened recently in beverly 
hills calif and openings are planned for later this year in 
denver and short hills nj 
harris said fao schwarz soon will announce plans for a much 
larger store in chicago on a scale with the flagships in new york 
and san francisco he said the company is in lease negotiations for 
a bigger store in boston as well 
kbb has more than a dozen department store chains including one 
that specializes in elaborate toys like those sold by fao schwarz 
that chain the bijenkorf chain is at the luxury end of its 
operations selling exclusive fashions cosmetics and furniture as 
well as toys 
its flagship store is a landmark in the center of amsterdam 
right across the street from the citys royal palace 
in recent years the bijenkorf beehive in dutch has 
diversified into fancy foods and established one of the 
netherlands largest specialty cosmetics departments 
kbb also owns the lowpriced hema chain known for its 
serviceable household goods and clothing on the model of an 
american variety store 
all together the holdings of the 22 billion retailer in its 
home country and elsewhere in europe included 1200 stores at the 
end of last year

newmarketonfergus ireland ap the worlds leading 
agriculture ministers tuesday expressed reservations about a 
surprise european proposal to cut farm aid worldwide but said it 
was a step forward 
the european communitys agriculture commissioner ray macsharry 
of ireland on monday proposed cutting world farm aid by 30 percent 
over a decade intensifying the debate over europes huge farm 
subsidies 
the dispute over europes support for its farmers will not as 
feared block the successful conclusion in december of current 
global trade liberalization talks the senior officials said 
macsharry and the agriculture ministers of the united states 
japan canada and australia made their comments at a news 
conference at the conclusion of a twoday private meeting 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said the proposal is 
only a start in the negotiating process 
much of the rest of the world is in my judgment prepared to go 
much further down the road of agricultural trade reform than what 
is implied by mr macsharrys proposal he said we have a lot 
of negotiating ahead to bridge those gaps 
canadas agriculture minister donald mazankowski said its 
certainly a welcome step but he added it is very difficult to 
determine in fact whether export subsidies will be cut under the 
proposal at all 
trade negotiations are being held in geneva under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
the united states and 14 other farm exporting countries want the 
12nation ec to end its export credits system and cut direct 
subsidies for farmers which the critics say distort trade 
macsharry said his proposal was serious and balanced but 
conceded that we have a number of important differences these 
remain to be resolved 
mazankowski told reporters earlier that the united states and 
canada already may have implemented cuts such as those proposed 
macsharrys proposed 30 percent cut in farm support extends from 
1986 to 1996 it includes already implemented ec reductions of 10 
percent in support for crops and 15 percent for livestock 
a final proposal is to be presented in september to the european 
community which must approve the plan before it could be tabled at 
gatt 
gatt negotiators are to meet again in geneva in late august

procter amp gamble co said tuesday it had 
sued a southeast kansas couple for allegedly spreading rumors 
which it has denied for years that the company was associated 
with satanism 
the suit filed late monday in us district court alleges that 
james and linda newton of parsons have made libelous and malicious 
statements about procter amp gamble by saying it supports the 
church of satan 
the couple also allegedly urged people to boycott procter amp 
gamble products 
a company news release said the newtons are distributors of 
household items for rival amway home products as were several 
individuals who previously admitted spreading these lies 
it appears they are trying to enhance their own business 
said topeka attorney edwin smith representing procter amp gamble 
the company is seeking more than 50000 in damages and is 
asking the court to order the newtons to stop circulating the 
stories 
mrs newton reached at her home declined to comment 
the suit is one of a number the cincinnatibased company has 
filed over the years in an attempt to fight persistent rumors that 
its moon and stars trademark is a satanic symbol 
the 108yearold trademark features a maninthemoon figure a 
popular design of the 1800s overlooking a field of 13 stars the 
company says are to honor the original american colonies 
were very proud of our company trademark symbolizing procter 
amp gamble quality and excellence edwin l artzt chairman and 
chief executive officer said in a news release 
these lies have persisted now for 10 years and we will file 
further suits if necessary he said 
the suit alleges that in a circular the newtons said the moon 
and stars trademark is a satanic symbol they said the symbol is 
actually a tiny rams horn with three sets of stars placed in 
such a way that if the stars in each set are joined they form the 
number 666 known as the devils number 
christians should always remember that if they buy any product 
with this symbol they will be taking part in the support of the 
church of satan according to the flyer which was included in 
the suit as an exhibit 
the suit also alleges the newtons have falsely told people that 
senior procter amp gamble officials have appeared on nationally 
televised talk shows acknowledging the companys ties to satanism 
over the past three months the company has received 300 to 350 
calls a day asking about the allegations primarily from 
southeastern united states company officials said 
procter amp gamble products include pampers disposable diapers 
crest toothpaste scope mouthwash ivory soap tide laundry 
detergent folgers coffee and head and shoulders shampoo 
in 1985 the company filed lawsuits in lynchburg va scranton 
pa and wichita kan against people it accused of spreading 
similar rumors associated the company with satan 
procter amp gamble also at the time began phasing out the use of 
the trademark on company products hired private investigators to 
probe the spread of the rumors and established a national tollfree 
telephone line to handle inquiries

acrosstheboard selling that took the dow jones average to its low 
of the day

streets plunge of last oct 13 which had been sparked by the 
failure of an earlier ual buyout plan but the market recovered 
tuesday and did not even approach the dow jones averages

congress could avoid voting on a 100 billion 
savings and loan bailout for 1991 until next year by passing a 
stopgap bill for no more than 10 billion a bush administration 
official said monday 
the proposal which would postpone action on the larger 
appropriation until after the november election was raised by 
treasury undersecretary robert r glauber 
he told the house banking committee that 5 billion to 10 
billion would keep the bailout going through january or february 
he stopped short of endorsing the idea 
the apparent trial balloon was floated as committee members 
noted angry voters are pressuring them to oppose more bailout 
funding 
perception is reality and its the perception on the part 
of the american people give me a break im not paying said 
rep mary rose oakar dohio 
in another development lobbyist robert j thompson said he 
would refuse to honor a subpoena from sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio for testimony before the senate judiciary antitrust 
committee on tuesday about his role in arranging the purchase of a 
failed sampl by arizona insurance executive james m fail 
thompson a former aide to thenvice president george bush said 
in an interview with the washington post he arranged meetings for 
fail with washington officials and was paid his regular fee won 
arrangement of a 150000 loan and was promised 2 percent of the 
profits on the deal 
fails sampl now the bluebonnet bank of dallas stands to receive 
18 billion in federal subsidies fail put up only 1000 of his 
own money 
according to the interview report in tuesday editions of the 
newspaper fail said metzenbaums committee was exceeding its 
jurisdiction 
rep toby roth rwis predicted congress would refuse to go 
along with more money for the sampl bailout 
the administration is not disputing regulators estimates that 
as much as 100 billion in new bailout money is needed for all of 
1991 
glauber said that under the stopgap plan congress and the 
administration would have to agree to exploit an error in last 
years bailout bill that would allow 188 billion more in bailout 
borrowing than congress originally intended 
the sampl bailout is an important issue in budget summit talks 
between the white house and congressional leaders who are trying 
to fashion a package before congress leaves washington in october 
to campaign 
the stopgap plan would let congress and the administration 
postpone until next year longterm funding for the resolution trust 
corp rtc a yearold agency created to close and sell failed 
thrifts along with a proposal to reform the deposit insurance 
system 
glauber also repeated two previous alternatives giving the 
administration unlimited authority to spend whatever is needed to 
finish the bailout or providing what is needed for 1991 
rtc chairman l william seidman told the panel his agency would 
need to spend 80 billion to 100 billion in fiscal year 1991 
including 30 billion to 40 billion from taxpayers to cover sampl 
losses thats in addition to the 50 billion authorized in the 
1989 bailout bill 
the trust corporation would need to borrow another 50 billion 
to 60 billion which would be repaid as the government sells real 
estate and other assets inherited from failed thrifts 
another installment on the bailout will be needed in 1992 
seidman said 
eighteen months from now we will have a good hold on the 
overall look of things but this is a moving target he said 
by the end of september the rtc will have spent 97 billion 
37 billion to cover losses and the rest to pay for sampl assets 
which will be sold he said the agency will need more money early 
in the octoberdecember quarter he said 
glauber in response to a question from rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas the committee chairman refused to say how much the 
administration wanted appropriated for sampls in 1991 
he warned that failure to act could erode depositor confidence 
and push up the ultimate cost of the bailout by keeping 
moneylosing institutions open 
weve got to press this to the end and its going to cost what 
it will cost he said 
on another subject seidman said weak real estate markets once 
a problem only in certain regions such as the southwest and new 
england have spread to almost every area of the country 
he said the fund insuring commercial bank deposits was under 
stress but he added i do not think its appropriate to say 
there is another sampl debacle ahead for banks 
seidman said the federal deposit insurance corp he also heads 
will decide in the reasonably near future whether to sue neil 
bush and other officers of silverado banking savings and loan 
association in denver 
bush one of president bushs sons and other silverado officers 
could be found liable for a portion of the 1 billion loss 
taxpayers suffered in the institutions december 1988 collapse

more money this quarter than we did in the second quarter of 1989 
iacocca and analysts said the companys costcutting program 
designed to carve 15 billion out of 26 billion in annual costs 
by the end of this year contributed to the companys profits 
chrysler said it earned 180 million or 81 cents a share 
during the quarter this year compared with 341 million or 146 
a share during the same period last year 
revenues fell to 88 billion from 99 billion 
chrysler declined to say precisely what its incentive costs 
were but spokesman tom houston said they were more than 1000 per 
vehicle during the second quarter 
auto analyst douglas laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new york 
estimated that chrysler spent about 1400 on incentives per 
vehicle thats up sharply from his estimate of about 800 per 
vehicle during the same period last year 
analysts have said and chrysler has acknowledged that the 
company may show a loss in the third quarter as it stops production 
at its two minivan plants for retooling for the 1991 model year 
minivans are among chryslers most profitable products 
laughlin said chrysler will increase its cost savings by putting 
more efficient manufacturing methods into operation for the 91 
models 
ford vice president and treasurer david mccammon said last week 
that his company spent about 1050 on incentives for each car and 
truck sold during the period gm like chrysler declines to say 
how much it spends on incentives 
ford said it made 7707 million in the second quarter down 45 
percent from last year while gm reported secondquarter earnings 
fell 40 percent to 9001 million 
gm and ford also blamed economic instability in brazil for 
cutting their profits and ford added that lingering effects of 
strikes in the united kingdom and belgium further dented earnings 
the auto industry has been in a slump since the fourth quarter 
of last year when vehicle sales took a dive and inventories of 
unsold vehicles rose sharply 
to get rid of the inventory automakers boosted their incentive 
programs during the first quarter the tactic worked but the 
companies are finding it tough to wean consumers from the cashback 
or lowinterest financing deals 
for the first half of the year chrysler said earnings were down 
637 percent to 251 million fords firsthalf earnings were down 
567 percent to 14 billion and gms were off 465 percent to 16 
billion 
combined the big three earned 31 billion in the first six 
months down 535 percent from last year

the house voted tuesday to let the government 
go 322 billion deeper into debt next year while white house and 
congressional negotiators all but agreed to wait until after the 
august congressional recess to finalize a deficitcutting deal 
the extension of the governments authority to borrow money 
which should see it through the next year came on a 221205 vote 
if adopted by the senate and signed into law the provision would 
allow total federal red ink to swell to 344 trillion by sept 30 
1991 
sweetening the measure was an overwhelmingly popular amendment 
to stop using the social security systems huge surpluses to make 
the annual federal deficit look smaller 
that provision approved 41315 would take effect in 1992 
when the program that provides benefits to the elderly and disabled 
is expected to run an 88 billion surplus 
it would not affect next years federal deficit now projected 
to reach 169 billion not including the costs of the federal 
bailout of the savings and loan industry if not for the expected 
76 billion surplus social security should amass next year the 
1991 budget shortfall would be 245 billion 
the social security measures sponsor rep byron dorgan 
dnd said the provision would force lawmakers to make awful 
choices wrenching choices to confront the governments mounting 
deficits 
i understand that he said but the choice weve always 
made in the last decade is to do nothing 
opponents said the provision would merely complicate the work of 
budget summit negotators 
house minority leader robert michel rill said it dismisses 
the budget talks a sideshow something to circumvent a farce 
there is pressure for congress to approve the debt limit 
extension before leaving town for the august recess because the 
administration says the government would otherwise run out of cash 
by aug 15 but the measures fate in the senate is uncertain 
because several controversial amendments are lurking there 
one is a proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny to 
cut the 62 percent payroll tax paid by employees by 1 percentage 
point the measure is popular with many democrats but opposed by 
many congressional leaders because it would increase the deficit 
should the legislation bog down in the senate congressional 
leaders are prepared to introduce a shortterm borrowing measure 
that would tide the government over until congress returns in 
september 
meanwhile congressional leaders and white house officials said 
they were working toward a schedule to complete a budget pact after 
congress monthlong august recess 
sen wyche fowler dga said they were working toward a 
mutually agreedupon timetable an administration official 
speaking on the condition of anonymity said the two sides could 
agree by weeks end to a postrecess schedule for votes on a budget 
pact 
fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 budget talks which began 12 weeks 
ago will continue intermittently during the august break 
democrats have said 
as the ouse debated the debt limit measure house and senate 
leaders met again with president bush to discuss their stalled 
budget talks 
when the session ended the two sides remained divided in their 
search for 50 billion in tax increases and spending cuts for next 
year and 500 billion over five years 
democrats said they remained willing to begin the august recess 
without advancing a deficitreduction proposal republicans renewed 
their demand that democrats produce a budget offer but house 
speaker thomas s foley said bush made no threats 
the mood of these talks is candid open very civilized 
said foley dwash there are no threatening angry denunciations 
on either side 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said everyone is 
frustrated over democratic refusal to quickly produce a plan 
elements of a bush administration proposal surfaced last week 
including higher alcohol taxes and cuts in the deductibility of 
state and local income taxes republicans themselves have 
criticized those ideas 
it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate with people 
suffering from budgetary schizophrenia said the no 3 house 
democrat rep william gray of pennsylvania

federal investigators spread blame widely for 
the exxon valdez oil spill tuesday faulting exxon corp for not 
providing a fit master and a rested and sufficient crew and 
also blaming the captain his third mate the coast guard and local 
authorities 
the national transportation safety board voted 40 in 
determining a fivepart probable cause for the nations worst oil 
spill the dumping of 11 million gallons of crude oil into alaskas 
prince william sound by the grounding of the tanker exxon valdez on 
march 24 1989 
the board said the third mate failed to properly maneuver the 
vessel the alcoholimpaired captain failed to give proper 
supervision exxon failed to provide a crew up to its task the 
coast guard failed in marine traffic control and the state of 
alaska failed to provide adequate piloting rules 
the board concluding a 16month investigation criticized exxon 
valdez capt joseph hazelwood for leaving his third mate gregory 
cousins at the helm before the ship ran aground 
it also said witnesses medical tests and an unusual study of 
hazelwoods speech indicated he was drunk when the ship ran 
aground even though an alaska jury acquitted the captain of being 
intoxicated and the coast guard dropped a drunkenness charge 
hazelwoods attorney thomas russo who attended the board 
meeting said the board members acted like they dropped off the 
moon in accusing hazelwood of being drunk twentyone witnesses 
testified at his trial that he was sober russo said and 
authorities botched blood tests taken more than 10 hours after the 
accident that showed the presence of alcohol 
their conclusions are not founded in the evidence russo 
said 
hazelwood was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of negligent 
discharge of oil he was fined 50000 and ordered to spend 1000 
hours cleaning alaskan beaches he has appealed 
last week the coast guard dismissed charges of drunkenness and 
misconduct against hazelwood but suspended his license as a ships 
master for nine months after he pleaded no contest to breaking 
coast guard rules 
the violations included drinking within four hours before taking 
command of the vessel and leaving the bridge to the other officer 
while the tanker was headed for jagged bligh reef where it split 
open 
board chairman james kolstad said the board hopes its report 
which included 36 safety recommendations will help prevent future 
spills its analysis carries no force of law and by statute 
cannot be used in court cases 
this is the largest and costliest accident the safety board 
has ever investigated said kolstad in opening the meeting he 
said 2 billion had been spent cleaning up the spill 
the boards conclusions included 
the decision by hazelwood to leave his third mate in charge as 
the boat was being maneuvered around a massive ice floe was 
improper and against exxon policies and coast guard rules 
the third mate was impaired by fatigue which contributed to 
his failure to guide the 987foot vessel around the ice 
similar conditions of deck officers with inadequate rest exist 
on other exxon tankers due to a company policy of operating with 
reduced crews 
exxon offers incentives for crews who work long hours and has 
manipulated shipboard reporting of overtime and workload 
the coast guard has been unduly narrow in perspective in 
allowing exxon ships to operate with inadequate crews failing to 
consider the amount of work required in loading the ships before 
they go out to sea 
exxon has no program for dealing with drug and alcohol abuse 
the coast guard is not prepared to take tests for drug and 
alcohol use after accidents 
the transportation departments postaccident testing policies 
are inadequate 
the coast guard should have access to national driving records 
to help it assess the fitness of ships officers to hold federal 
licenses hazelwood had at least two prior convictions for drunken 
driving 
the coast guard should more closely monitor ships and ice 
conditions in prince william sound where its traffic service 
remains ineffective 
limited supervision of the coast guards vessel traffic system 
contributed to the services lack of knowledge that ice was forcing 
ships to move near the reef where the exxon valdez hung up 
two months after the exxon valdez ran aground the board held a 
weeklong public hearing in alaska interviewing 27 witnesses and 
collecting 115 exhibits 
since the spill the tanker has been repaired and renamed the 
exxon mediterranean and has been undergoing tests for service on 
routes in the mediterranean sea or the middle east

a federal regulator said tuesday he would not 
have recommended the taxpayersubsidized sale of 15 texas savings 
and loan associations to an arizona businessman had he known of the 
buyers guilty plea to a fraud charge 
i would have objected george m barclay president of the 
federal home loan bank of dallas told a senate judiciary 
subcommittee having no knowledge of the guilty plea by james fail 
barclay said i was very comfortable with a decision not to 
object to fails purchase of what now is known as bluebonnet 
savings bank 
the sale of the failing sampls is under investigation by the 
business rights subcommittee on three grounds 
evidence that fail put up only 1000 cash for the 15 banks and 
was promised at least 185 billion in federal subsidies sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio chairman of the subcommittee said 3 
billion is a better estimate and called the deal scandalous 
fails plea bargain on one fraud count which resulted in 
dismissal of the indictment and his guilty plea on behalf of his 
united security holding co to another felony charge 
suspicions by metzenbaum that a former aide to thenvice 
president bush improperly intervened with federal officials on 
fails behalf 
that aide robert j thompson refused to testify before the 
subcommittee tuesday because his attorney said the panel has no 
jurisdiction over the banking industry and has systematically 
handed over thompsons private documents to reporters 
the new york times said in wednesday editions that documents 
made available by the committee showed thompson was able to review 
and suggest modifications to government documents affecting his 
clients interests in particular helping officials of the federal 
home loan bank board prepare a response to an inspector generals 
report that found that fail should have been precluded from buying 
the 15 sampls 
metzenbaum said the subcommittee will ask the judiciary 
committee to compel thompson to comply with a subpoena 
my own view is that we should proceed forthwith with the 
strongest means of enforcement of the subpoena said sen arlen 
specter rpa 
stanley m brand thompsons lawyer told the subcommittee 
during the bluebonnet transactions my client simply and 
forthrightly represented his client and scrupulously followed the 
rules and regulations established by duly authorized federal 
regulatory agencies 
thompson said in an interview in the washington post on tuesday 
that in exchange for helping fail he was paid a lobbying fee 
given a 150000 loan and promised 2 percent of profits from 
bluebonnet 
thompson told the post he acted as a project manager helping 
fail work with regulators in washington dallas atlanta and new 
york 
m danny wall former chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board which approved the bluebonnet sale said his records show he 
met only three times with thompson never to discuss the takeover 
stuart d root who at the time of the sale headed the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp said he would not know thompson 
if he walked into the room 
barclay said when the sale was approved in december 1988 he was 
aware that fail and signed a plea bargain that resulted in the 
dropping of a 1976 alabama indictment for securities fraud since 
that offense had occurred more than 10 years in the past it was 
not considered a bar to the sampl purchase 
however barclay added i do not recall having been told 
that an affiliate company of mr fails had pleaded guilty to a 
felony which would have been a presumptive disqualifier 
against fail 
wall rejected allegations that regulators in selling the sampls 
to fail turned down a bid that would have been 97 million better 
for taxpayers 
thats not true at all wall said if the two bids were 
compared on the same basis fails would have been at least equal 
and probably better than the other he said
