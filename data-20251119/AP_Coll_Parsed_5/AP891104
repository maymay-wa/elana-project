a federal judge rejected exxon valdez 
skipper joseph hazelwoods request to block the state from 
prosecuting him on charges stemming from the nations worst oil 
spill 
us district judge andrew kleinfeld said friday it would be 
inappropriate for him to determine the scope of a federal immunity 
provision under which hazelwood sought to have his case dismissed 
kleinfeld said a state judge should rule on the question of 
immunity first 
hazlewood claims that because he reported the spill he is 
immune from state felony and misdemeanor charges of recklessness 
negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated 
defense attorney richard friedman said virtually every piece of 
states evidence came as a result of a call hazelwood made to the 
coast guard and thus shouldnt be used against hazelwood 
they knew nothing about the spill until he called friedman 
said 
but the judge said it seems like a real possibility someone 
might have noticed an oil spill the size of rhode island whether or 
not it was called in 
hazelwood spoke quietly to one of his attorneys during the 
proceeding but didnt address the court the 43yearold mariner 
from huntington ny came to fairbanks because of the possibility 
his participation would be needed said dick madson one of his 
attorneys 
exxon fired hazelwood from his captains job soon after the 
valdez struck a reef in prince william sound on march 24 and 
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
hazelwood has filed the same claim of immunity in state court 
where a hearing is scheduled nov 29

president bushs support of a pay raise for 
top government officials and members of congress returns it to the 
forefront just eight months after lawmakers were scorched by public 
backlash on the issue 
house leaders have been busy behind the scenes trying to arrange 
a pay increase coupled with ethics reforms hoping to get it 
accomplished this year before lawmakers become too wary with 
reelection concerns 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday that the 
president would support any reasonable proposal 
one congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the latest version included an 8 percent costofliving 
raise in january for members of congress and senior officials in 
the other two government branches 
salaries would jump another 25 percent in january 1991 just 
after next years elections matching the amount bush asked for 
earlier this year for judges and the executive branch 
at that point congressional pay would reach about 121000 and 
the ethics package would ban lawmakers from earning any money from 
speaking fees 
fitzwater said bush wants any pay raise tied to ethical 
standards that would prohibit lawmakers from accepting honoraria 
senate and house members currently earn 89500 in the house 
members are allowed to keep speaking fees totalling 30 percent of 
their salaries senators may keep 40 percent 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash has said the presidents 
endorsement was critical to any payraise effort foley and house 
minority leader robert michel rill met with bush on wednesday 
to press the issue 
the president wanted to make absolutely sure that on the 
ethics side that our package was pretty consistent with what he 
had proposed and i think it is michel said 
but michel said that hardly made a pay increase certain 
house members arent all that far away from where the 
executive branch might be michel said our problem area is 
with the senate quite frankly 
if the president endorses it and the democratic and 
republican leadership go forward holding hands then maybe they can 
do something said rep tim penny dminn an outspoken opponent 
of the defeated 51 percent pay hike president ronald reagan 
proposed as he departed office 
but even then its a tough sell he said 
im not sure that its going to go anywhere said rep leon 
panetta dcalif chairman of the budget committee 
congress doesnt deserve it said rep thomas tauke riowa 
pay raises are meant to reward a job well done and thats hardly 
a boast this congress can make 
a house bipartisan task force has proposed a 35 percent salary 
boost over two years the plan would also include changes in 
congress ethics rules including new restrictions on speaking fees 
and other changes such as preventing members from pocketing 
leftover campaign money when they retire from office 
the large pay raise before congress earlier this year collapsed 
under a barrage of public criticism

nicaraguan rebels said friday that 
they would not attend a meeting with sandinista officials at the 
united nations next week and proposed it be postponed a week 
president daniel ortega asked for a shorter delay and that honduran 
officials take part 
honduras late friday reiterated its refusal and said the rebels 
were nicaraguas problem honduras will not attend any event of 
that nature foreign minister carlos lopez contreras said from 
tegucigalpa the honduran capital 
ortega had requested the talks for monday and tuesday after 
ending a 19month truce with the usbacked contras fighters 
the contras instead decided not to attend next week wilfredo 
montalvan a director of the nicaraguan resistance said friday by 
telephone 
the date proposed by ortega is a strategy of his political 
party to take us offguard montalvan said that is he 
proposed that date for his convenience therefore we propose that 
it be nov 13 to be able to prepare ourselves 
and if ortega thinks the only thing that is going to be 
discussed there is the unconditional surrender of our troops he 
should forget that since he is very wrong he added our 
demobilization is voluntary and will occur when you can observe 
that nicaragua is taking true steps toward the route of democracy 
nicaragua called the meeting which would be the first direct 
talks between the two groups in more than a year to discuss 
disbanding of the contras 
an aug 7 peace agreement signed by ortega and four other 
central american presidents calls for the voluntary demobilization 
and relocation of rebels from honduran camps by dec 5 the contras 
were not a party to the agreement and have not agreed to disband 
the honduran government said wednesday that existing peace 
accords are sufficient and declined to send representatives to 
ortegas proposed meeting 
but the nicaraguan president held out hope friday for honduran 
participation 
i hope that the government of honduras with its indispensable 
and valuable participation contributes to obtaining positive 
results in favor of the peace process he said 
given that the presence of the honduran government at that 
meeting has not been able to be confirmed today i propose that it 
be held nov 9 and 10 at the same place for the purpose of 
discussing demobilization of the counterrevolutionary forces camped 
in honduras ortega said in a letter to those invited to the 
meeting 
ortega asked if the only topic would be demobilization 
responded depending on how the demobilization agreement 
progresses we will be willing to reconsider the ceasefire 
nicaragua launched an offensive against the contras this week 
after ortega ended the truce he said he took the action because 
the contras had begun returning to nicaragua from base camps to 
which they retreated in 1988 
montalvan said any meeting also would take up a general amnesty 
freedom for political prisoners and work out the disbanding process 
he said he was no longer certain of adolfo caleros 
particiaption in the meeting but gave no reasons montalvan had 
said earlier that calero who lives in miami would attend as a 
political leader with enrique bermudez the military leader 
roberto ferrey another member of the rebel directorate 
confirmed bermudez and four other rebel military chiefs would 
attend 
officials from the organization of the american states and 
united nations are to mediate the meeting un spoeksman francois 
giuliani said friday 
roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo of nicaragua also 
has agreed to attend

boeing co plans to enter a plea to criminal 
charges in connection with illegal trafficking in secret pentagon 
documents according to federal court records in alexandria va 
the records show that richard lee fowler a former boeing 
company official indicted for crimes involving illegal dealing in 
classified documents named the company as a coconspirator 
the company is scheduled to enter a plea to an undisclosed 
charge nov 13 in us district court in alexandria va no charges 
have been filed 
by entering the preindictment plea boeing will avoid 
indictment by the same federal grand jury that charged fowler 
according to the morning news tribune of tacoma which broke the 
story on friday 
fowler a senior marketing analyst for boeing aerospace in 
arlington va until he was fired in 1986 was indicted in august 
on 39 felony counts of conspiracy mail fraud and other crimes 
involving illegal dealing in classified documents 
he has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on trial dec 4 
during the internal boeing investigation that led to his firing 
fowler told boeing attorneys the reason he was hired by the 
aerospace company was to obtain such documents 
he is charged with obtaining documents such as the pentagons 
fiveyear budget plan the main defensespending guide used by top 
officials the document could help a contractor plan bidding 
schedules 
other papers he allegedly took include those related to the 
strategic defense initiative for which boeing has millions of 
dollars worth of contracts 
fowler was a civilian budget analyst for the air force before he 
was hired by boeing in 1978 
randy bellows the federal prosecutor on the fowler case 
declined comment thursday when asked by the morning news tribune 
about boeings role as a coconspirator 
boeing spokesmen paul binder in seattle declined to comment on 
the case when contacted by the associated press saying boeings 
policy is not to comment on the investigation 
court documents in alexandria named the company as a 
coconspirator from 1979 through 1985 
if boeing pleads guilty to a criminal charge the seattlebased 
aerospace giant would be the second major defense contractor 
convicted in the federal probe of how defense contractors obtain 
classified documents giving them an advance look into the 
pentagons future needs 
gte avoided indictment by pleading guilty in 1985 to conspiring 
to obtain classified defense documents illegally two gte employees 
and a consultant were indicted on similar charges 
at the time defense officials said the guilty plea was likely 
to prevent any major actions by the pentagon to suspend or bar gte 
from future contracts 
it was the gte case that apparently triggered the investigation 
of boeing and fowler the morning news tribune reported 
boeing and a number of other major defense contractors were 
named during a 1986 court hearing in the case of the gte 
consultant bernie zettl who said trafficking in classified 
pentagon documents is widespread in the defense industry zettls 
case has not gone to trial

veterans secretary edward j derwinski will 
have to decide without the guidance he was looking for from an 
advisory panel whether to award benefits to some vietnam veterans 
exposed to agent orange 
derwinski is expected to make the decision around thanksgiving 
as the result of courtordered regulations for determining the 
relationship between exposure to the herbicide exposure and cancer 
nearly 12000 disability claims once denied by the va are now 
pending as a result of a court order issued in may by us district 
judge thelton e henderson in san francisco 
derwinski was looking for the environmental hazards advisory 
committee made up largely of scientists to clear up some of the 
arguments over agent orange 
but the panel in its first ruling on agent orange acknowledged 
friday that it couldnt come up with a definite conclusion the 
committee said it does not find the evidence sufficient at the 
present time to conclude that there is a significant statistical 
association between exposure to agent orange and nonhodgkins 
lymphoma 
they added they cannot rule out such an association 
veterans groups blame agent orange for cancers that have turned 
up years later in former soldiers who were exposed when the united 
states used it to clear jungle area in vietnam during the war 
veterans say their nonhodgkins lymphoma soft tissue sarcoma 
and other forms of cancer were caused by the defoliant 
the government has long said that cancers cannot be definitively 
linked to agent orange no studies have been undertaken looking at 
veterans who were exposed to the chemical because government 
scientists contend they cannot create such a sample 
in his ruling in may henderson said the va had used criteria 
more stringent than congress intended in a 1984 law that ordered 
benefits to veterans exposed to the herbicide 
the va has said the new regulations give derwinski the freedom 
to give veterans the benefit of the doubt absent any strong 
recommendation by the committee made up largely of scientists 
the committee will meet in late january to address studies 
covering agent orange exposure and soft tissue sarcomas as well as 
porphyria cutanea tarda an ailment that produces chronic skin 
lesions those are the other two ailments addressed in hendersons 
court ruling 
several of derwinskis actions have been interpreted as signs 
that he wants to take action if only limited in favor of 
veterans those include his decision not to appeal the may ruling 
his appointment of retired adm elmo r zumwalt jr as a special 
adviser and his statements that he will give veterans the benefit 
of the doubt 
zumwalt ordered spraying of agent orange during the war and a 
son who served in vietnam died of a cancer believed linked to 
exposure 
the american legion which has accused the panel of bias 
criticized fridays statement 
they spent entirely too much time on crossing the ts and 
dotting the is said richard s christian a deputy director of 
the american legion 
the main suspect in agent orange is the contaminant dioxin a 
byproduct of industrial processes known to be an extremely potent 
carcinogen in laboratory animals its effects on humans are less 
well documented 
of the roughly 230000 veterans who have told va they were 
exposed to agent orange 635 have documented cases of nonhodgkins 
lymphoma the va says 
there are 35000 veterans seeking benefits for problems linked 
to agent orange exposure

the federal judge who has presided over two 
trials in the espionage case of former fbi agent richard w miller 
disqualified himself friday from a third trial ordered by an 
appellate court 
us district judge david v kenyon said in a written ruling 
that if he continued to preside over the case there was a good 
chance the proceeding will become a trial not of the defendants 
innocence or guilt but of the objectivity of this court 
miller was charged in 1984 with selling secret documents to a 
soviet agent with whom he became sexually involved 
the jury deadlocked in the first trial and kenyon declared a 
mistrial miller was convicted in the second trial and kenyon 
sentenced the exfbi agent to two life terms plus 50 years in 
prison 
but the ninth us circuit court of appeals reversed millers 
conviction and recently overturned kenyons order that miller be 
held without bail pending a third trial set for april 3 
were very pleased said joel levine one of millers 
defense attorneys we think the judge did the correct thing and 
we think he did it in a very courageous and judicious manner 
levine said the defense had been preparing a legal motion 
requesting kenyon to disqualify himself although he declined to 
discuss the grounds for his motion

the united states still hopes to seize and 
bring to trial in the united states the terrorists who killed 270 
people with a bomb aboard pan am flight 103 according to remarks 
of cia director william webster in a published interview 
but at this point the government is unable to issue arrest 
warrants or seek indictments against anyone for the dec 21 bombing 
of the boeing 747 over lockerbie scotland according to the 
interview report in saturday editions of the washington post 
the investigation has been hampered by too much discussion 
in the press about the work of intelligence services in several 
countries webster said 
it makes it very difficult to lay traps that is keep watch 
on and find new evidence when people start reading about 
themselves webster was quoted as saying 
and it make countries and security services defensive 
the assumption is if it turns out to have been on board in my 
country we will be accused of not having prevented it webster 
said 
there have been several reports that the plane was destroyed by 
a bomb placed aboard at frankfurt with recent reports putting the 
origin of the bomb in malta before the plane proceeded to london 
the bombing according to webster led the justice department to 
focus on the legal issues involved in capturing suspects and 
bringing them to the united states a recent administration 
directive reversing previous policy permits the fbi to make such 
captures without informing the country where they take place 
other points in the interview 
the united states might be faced with rescuing some but not all 
of its eight hostages in lebanon if it had information rare to 
come by on where only some are being kept they are not kept 
together webster said 
the new understanding between the administration and the 
congressional intelligence committees permitting cia agents to help 
coup attempts in which the death of the opposing leader is not a 
goal does not extend to accidental killings 
it will take two years for the soviet economy to make major 
shifts away from military production and another two years for 
consumers to see results according to cia estimates opposition to 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev is shrinking and gorbachev 
has running room webster said 
a power struggle is under way in the central military 
commission of chinas communist party between deng xiaoping the 
85yearold chairman whose chairmanship is only remaining official 
post and yang shangkun 82 vice chairman and president of china 
despite the provision of 300 million a month in military 
supplies to the puppet najibullah government in kabul afghan 
guerrillas are still winning the civil war there both the soviets 
and the cia were surprised that najibullah survived the rebel 
assault after the soviet troop pullout in february

christian leader michel aoun dissolved 
parliament on saturday charging it had violated the constitution 
by approving an arab peace plan for warplagued lebanon without his 
consent 
the 54yearold general summoned reporters to his bunker command 
post in suburban baabda east of beirut before dawn and read a 
decree from his interim military government dissolving the 
legislature 
his move appeared aimed at preventing parliament from holding a 
scheduled meeting later saturday to ratify the peace accord and 
elect a new house speaker and a president for lebanon 
the issue of aouns authority to dissolve parliament is as 
uncertain as any political question in a nation with two 
governments two armies and countless armed factions that has 
suffered 14 years of sectarian civil war 
we do not recognize him aoun as a legitimate head of 
government so any decree he issues is illegitimate leftist 
christian deputy najah wakim told reporters in beirut after the 
announcement he will not be able to prevent us from electing a 
president 
aouns decree called for a threestage general elections for a 
new parliament in beirut jan 7 in north lebanon on jan 14 and 
in east and south lebanon on jan 21 
but there is little likelihood that new elections would be held 
in response to aouns decree with syrian troops controlling more 
than 70 percent of lebanons territory 
on friday bombs exploded at the homes of three christian 
legislators friday and police reported one woman wounded in in the 
bombings 
the rival army commands christians led by aoun and moslems by 
brig gen sami khatib placed their troops on alert canceling 
all leave military sources reported 
arab league envoy lakhdar ibrahimi and hussein husseini a 
shiite moslem serving as parliament speaker conferred with 
politicians about the session scheduled for saturday to ratify the 
accord reached at taif saudi arabia 
villa mansour the parliament building in the nomans land 
between beiruts moslem and christian sectors is no longer a 
suitable venue for tomorrows session ibrahimi said 
he did not elaborate but villa mansour is within range of 
aouns artillery in the christian heartland east of the capital 
the woman was wounded by the first bomb at the home of deputy 
elias khazen in jounieh north of beirut police said they said 
bombs outside the homes of deputies auguste bakhos and salem abdel 
nour in christian east beirut caused minor damage 
all three men are in paris along with 25 other christian 
deputies they refused to return home from taif after aoun called 
them traitors for endorsing the agreement last month 
no one claimed responsibility for the bombings which occurred 
after a 90minute news conference by aoun in his bunker below the 
shattered presidential palace in baabda a christian suburb 
i ask the legislators not to commit the final and major 
mistake aoun had said before announcing his decision to dissolve 
parliament i ask them not to take part in the parliamentary 
session let them take their time let them come here and lets 
discuss the document 
parliament will be dissolved before the meeting gets under way 
if they tried to pass the document without discussing what they 
have done with me 
sixtythree legislators of parliaments 73 surviving members 
approved the peace document after 23 days of discussion in taif 
parliament originally had 99 members but no elections have been 
held since 1972 because of the war 
one of aouns main objections to the peace agreement is its lack 
of a timetable for withdrawal of the 40000 syrian soldiers 
stationed in lebanon with whom his forces fought a fierce 
artillery war for six months until a ceasefire in september 
he calls the syrians who are in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league an occupation army and 
declared a war of liberation to drive them out 
when asked friday whether he has the constitutional power to 
dismiss the lawmakers aoun said i am the guardian of the 
constitution i received my powers by a decree signed by a 
president under oath i plan to safeguard the constitution 
only a president can dissolve parliament under the lebanese 
constitution and political experts have said aoun as head of a 
caretaker cabinet has no such power 
former president amin gemayel appointed him to head an interim 
cabinet minutes before gemayels term expired on sept 22 1988 
with no successor chosen by parliament 
salim hoss a sunni moslem who was prime minister under gemayel 
leads a rival moslem government 
aoun said friday the peace accord gives away our homeland to 
the syrians 
the taif document increases the authority of the prime 
minister who is based in a syriancontrolled area he said i 
do not object to the projected increase in the prime ministers 
powers but this should be done after a syrian pullout 
the proposed reforms transfer some power from the president 
traditionally a christian to the prime minister and parliament 
speaker both moslems

a house subcommittee chairman wants federal 
reserve board chairman alan greenspan to consider making stock 
traders use more of their own money when they deal in stock index 
futures 
in a letter to greenspan released friday rep edward markey 
chairman of the house subcommittee that oversees the financial 
markets asked greenspan to review immediately the need to vest 
marginsetting authority for stock index futures in the federal 
reserve 
stock index futures are securities that combine aspects of 
futures contracts and stock trading with investors buying a 
contract tied to the performance of a group of stocks such as the 
standard and poors index of 500 stocks 
margins are the amount of money or collateral an investor must 
put down to buy a security or futures contract in the stock 
market the margin is 50 percent of the stocks price futures 
margins are usually much less with the stock index futures margin 
usually at about 7 percent 
markey chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
on finance also asked greenspan to raise stock index futures 
margin levels comparable to stock margin levels 
currently the securities exchanges set margin levels themselves 
noting greenspans previous opposition to such a move markey 
wrote our financial markets are in crisis and swift action by 
the federal reserve to steady our markets and preserve our capital 
formation process is needed 
there was no answer at the fed when a reporter telephoned for 
comment friday evening 
markey said the oct 13 market drop when the dow jones 
industrial average fell more than 190 points and lesser swings in 
the markets since then have reignited substantial and sustained 
fears regarding the fundamental stability and utility of our 
capital markets 
markey also asked greenspan to investigate whether risk 
arbitrageurs speculators on the price gaps between stocks and 
their index futures are not always subject to the same margin 
levels as other individual investors the congressman also asked 
the fed to look into whether such market participants contributed 
to the recent volatility of the markets 
markey asked greenspan to comment on the issues at a hearing 
before markeys subcommittee will conduct next thursday on 
computerdriven program trading

president bush is hoping his late 
appearances in virginia and new jersey boost the republican partys 
uphill candidacies for governor and urge more gop voters to the 
polls next tuesday 
bush was on the stump trying to pump up republican activists 
but he stayed clear of the volatile abortion issue that has been 
prominent in both governors races 
prochoice activists waving signs and chanting prochoice 
prochoice showed up at bushs outdoor rallies in both richmond 
va and bloomfield nj on friday 
bushs new jersey stop was for a rally aimed at boosting turnout 
for the critical state legislative races and helping rep james 
courter in his faltering governors race against democratic rep 
james florio 
noting the slim 4139 republican majority in new jerseys 
legislature bush said we cannot go back to a 
democraticcontrolled government we must not go back we have 
got to keep new jersey proud we have got to keep new jersey 
republican 
he said new jersey under eight years of leadership by 
republican gov thomas kean has a new feeling of pride because 
of its improving economy environment and education 
bush and courter did not mention abortion nor did gop 
gubernatorial candidate j marshall coleman in virginia where bush 
campaigned earlier friday 
democrats in both states have hammered at the issue in this 
years campaigns attacking the republicans for opposing womens 
choice on abortion 
in virginia abortion has been the most emotional issue of the 
campaign democrat douglas wilder ran a tv ad attacking coleman 
who opposes abortion except when the mothers life is endangered 
a poll by the washington post released today showed wilder with 
a 5241 percent over coleman in the week before the election 
colemans aides dispute the polls results which showed the 
democrat with a larger lead than other recent surveys 
antiabortion activists have heckled wilder at recent rallies 
and have passed out fliers which were also distributed at the 
coleman rally friday calling him a baby killer 
bushs visit came a day after an antiabortion group accused 
four tv stations of refusing to air its procoleman ads 
in new jersey florio is prochoice while courter says he is 
against abortion personally and supports abortion only in cases of 
rape incest and to protect the life of the mother he also has 
said however he would not try to dismantle the states tough 
prochoice law 
abortion has long been a prickly issue in bushs political 
career political heat over the issue was raised by this years 
supreme court ruling giving states greater powers to regulate 
abortion 
asked why bush did not raise the issue of during his campaign 
stops white house press secretary marlin fitzwater replied we 
dont do whydidntyas 
he said bushs position is well known 
bush once backed the 1973 roe vs wade decision upholding 
abortion he now supports abortion only in cases of rape incest 
and where the mothers life is threatened but he does not favor 
federal funding of abortions for poor women 
in new jersey florio supporters carried signs with slogans such 
as florio equals choice and bush keep paws off womens 
bodies 
bush discounted late october polls that showed courter trailing 
florio by 15 to 19 percentage points 
youre looking at a guy who doesnt believe in these polls 
he said recalling surveys in his 1988 presidential race that 
showed him well behind the summer before the election 
white house political director jim wray said the white house 
wanted to do what we can in the final kick to help jim courter 
but he added that equally important is what we can do to help the 
whole ticket 
a lot can happen in four days in politics he said 
shrugging off the polls 
gop spokesmen said the trip was important to get out republican 
voters for state legislative candidates because the legislatures 
will control 1991 redistricting of political district boundaries 
controlling the reapportionment process is of great importance to 
both republicans and democrats

cuddling her 2yearold daughter at 
a shelter for east german refugees kerstin hanne said she cannot 
imagine returning to her homeland despite promises of reform by 
the communist leadership 
if we were in east germany now wed certainly leave said 
mrs hanne who arrived here with her husband and child in late 
september 
the exodus of tens of thousands of east germans to the west has 
set the stage for dramatic new developments back home including 
pledges of greater freedom to travel and more open discussion of 
social problems in the press and on the streets 
but instead of ebbing the flood of east germans is reaching 
ever greater levels reflecting deeply ingrained doubt about the 
chances for lasting change 
we have hope mrs hanne 25 said of the prospects for her 
homeland but i cant imagine farreaching changes in the system 
and i cant imagine the communist party not being in control 
thousands of east germans who jammed into the west german 
embassy in prague have just been given permission to emigrate many 
also are fleeing through hungary with bavarian border officials 
reporting hundreds of new arrivals from that route each day 
the refugees say they are lured here by the possibility of good 
jobs stores filled with modern consumer goods the freedom to 
speak ones mind and a more promising future for their children 
silke kleinhans of leipzig another refugee among the 80 or so 
at the remagen shelter said she felt somewhat mistrustful of 
the new promises in east germany we want to see more deeds 
said the 24yearold mother of two 
another refugee said that for many of those leaving east 
germany the first consideration is their children 
you have to think about what it would mean for the children to 
remain in east germany their future is more secure here said 
the woman who would only give her last name schwolow 
refugees interviewed at the shelter in remagen about 12 miles 
south of bonn said they like their new lives in west germany 
despite its trials like missing their relatives and trying to 
find permanent housing 
the kleinhans and hanne families have been looking for 
apartments since their arrival at the end of september 
the schwolows who arrived oct 10 also still are looking for 
an apartment 
but its not very difficult finding a job here said mrs 
schwolows husband who also declined to give his full name i 
had 15 different offers for work before i took my job as a 
mechanic 
schwolow said his gross monthly salary is about 1639 more 
than twice what he would be making in east germany 
east german refugees are given automatic citizenship in west 
germany and receive help from the government in starting their new 
lives 
mrs schwolow said that until east germany puts its economy in 
order and makes better consumer goods available at affordable 
prices the exodus to the west will likely continue 
huge economic reforms are needed people know whats available 
in the west and that creates problems she said 
the east german government has promised amnesty to refugees who 
return but none of the refugees interviewed at the shelter said 
they would go back 
the refugees said they do not feel any special pride for their 
part in an exodus that helped prod east german leaders into calling 
for social reform 
what we do feel is sadness that such a decision to leave 
east germany had to be taken we gave up everything we had we 
left behind friends relatives and siblings it is sad that 
leaving was our only choice said schwolow

evan tsao was just one of 112 casualties 
of united flight 232 but his death at age 23 months might lead to 
dramatic changes in the way young children are seated on airplanes 
the federal aviation administration is considering new rules 
that would end parents moneysaving but dangerous practice of 
carrying infants on their laps during plane flights 
the agency isnt committed to requiring separate seats for young 
children but that is among a range of options being studied for a 
new child safety policy the faa will recommend to the 
transportation department by the end of the year an official 
testified friday 
donnell pollard the faas cabin safety specialist was among 
the witnesses at a national transportation safety board hearing on 
the crash of the united dc10 that crashed july 19 at sioux citys 
airport there were 184 survivors 
current faa guidelines allow children less than 24 months old to 
ride aboard an adults lap although the agency recommends that 
infants ride in a separate seat strapped in a child safety seat 
were considering a lot of factors ms pollard testified 
we have indications from the public that they like the option of 
not having to purchase a seat for children under the age of 2 
friday was the fourth and final day of the ntsb hearing on the 
crash the board is expected to issue a ruling on the probable 
cause next summer 
experts believe a faulty rear engine fan disk split in two 
during flight severing hydraulic lines that are essential for 
controlling the plane 
evan was one of five unrestrained children aboard flight 232 
according to united spokesman robert doughty 
ntsb records show his mother sylvia tsao 30 was uninjured but 
that evan was killed when she lost her grip on him as the plane 
split apart and burst into flames 
suddenly the world seemed to end and i saw for an instant my 
sons body floating and flying at a very high rate of speed down 
the right aisle towards the back of the plane his head first his 
face away from me ms tsao told federal investigators who 
interviewed her after the crash 
infants toddlers young childrens safety should no longer be 
ignored as if they do not count she added if these kids need 
aircraft seats then parents must be warned that they should put 
kids in them 
questioning ms pollard on friday fidel gonzales of the 
association of flight attendants union pressed for a commitment 
that the faa toughen its standards for infant seating 
isnt this a form of discrimination against those least able 
to protect themselves he asked 
we dont consider that discrimination ms pollard 
responded there is the option of purchasing a seat and coming on 
board with an infant child restraint system 
most airlines allow parents who decline to purchase tickets for 
infants to put the children in vacant seats if available however 
few of the airlines provide child restraint seats similar to those 
most states require in cars the faa issued an advisory in 1985 
that recommends use of child restraint seats in airplanes 
doughty told reporters that united offers discount seats for 
infants on flights that arent full and allows parents to bring 
child restraint seats aboard for use in vacant seats 
walt coleman vice president of operations for the air transport 
association an industry group representing major airlines 
testified friday that airlines have found many parents want to hold 
their infants in flight 
i think what weve done is transfer that responsibility to the 
passenger he said

a congressman says the food and drug 
administration may be allowing unsafe medical devices to remain on 
the market by failing to keep tabs on the industry 
rep henry waxman dcalif said two general accounting office 
reports show makers of products ranging from pacemakers to 
suntanning lamps routinely fail to notify the fda when they learn 
of problems with their products 
the reports show manufacturers who profit from the sale of 
these products often act without fda oversight in deciding whether 
to keep their devices on the market when problems begin to 
surface waxman chairman of the house energy and commerce health 
subcommittee said friday he requested the gao studies 
the gao said in one report that nearly half the recalls from 
fiscal 1985 to fiscal 1988 in which the product posed a high risk 
were initiated by the companies without notifying the government 
overall 78 percent of the 1245 medical device recalls during 
that period were made without alerting regulators the report said 
waxman whose panel is to hold hearings on the subject next 
week said the fda was bending over backward to accommodate the 
interests of the industry rather than doing its job of protecting 
the public 
fda spokesman bill grigg said officials had not seen the report 
but he said the agency believes the product recall system works 
well within the resources and legal authority given us by 
congress 
grigg said the agency acts promptly and aggressively when it 
has information about a problem product 
he said when a company has a problem with a product on the 
market we would not want them to delay recalling we want 
industry to initiate recalls as soon as a problem is discovered 
companies have been required since december 1984 to report to 
the fda when they learn their product may have caused or 
contributed to a serious injury or death or has malfunctioned 
during the fouryear period studied which began about three 
months before the regulation went into effect 31 products in the 
highrisk category were recalled and no report was made in 48 
percent of the cases the gao said 
in addition 792 recalls were made for medical devices whose 
problems posed a lower risk and in 72 percent of the cases the 
company did not alert the fda according to the report 
for the lowest risk products 422 recalls were made and no 
report was made in 92 percent of the cases 
cardiovascular and anesthesiology devices accounted for more 
than a quarter of all the recalls

the state department says it is not 
satisfied with syrias response to discussions of possible 
terrorist connection to the bombing of pan am flight 103 
spokesman richard boucher disclosed the talks friday saying the 
united states urged syria to take action against the popular 
front for the liberation of palestine general command and other 
terrorist groups 
boucher said the talks with syria about links to terrorist 
groups began before the pan am bombing on dec 21 1988 that killed 
270 people 
the pflgc has been named in news reports as a prime suspect in 
the bombing but boucher did not confirm whether any specific group 
was suspected of the bombing 
several terrorist groups operate with syrias support in the 
country as well as in areas of neighboring lebanon under syrian 
control boucher said 
the united states is not satisfied with the syrian response to 
date the spokesman said we will continue to press our 
concerns 
a sevenmember presidential commission decided on thursday to 
look into pan ams allegation that 36 hours before the explosion 
over lockerbie scotland the israeli intelligence agency warned 
us authorities of a possible terrorist attack 
the commission also agreed to investigate pan ams contention 
that west german authorities had reported suspicious activities 
at the frankfurt airport within 90 minutes of the flight 
besides syria boucher said discussions were held with other 
countries which may have information about terrorist groups he 
did not name the countries 
he said the united states has repeatedly expressed concern 
both publicly and privately about terrorist groups supported by 
syria including the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command on numerous occasions we have asked 
syria to take action against these groups both inside syria and in 
syriacontrolled areas of lebanon 
meanwhile the spokesman for a lebaneseamerican organization 
said nearly 15000 acres of the bekaa valley which is under syrian 
control are being used to produce heroin 
they are doing this with the full knowledge of the us 
government said joseph l boohaker spokesman for the national 
alliance of lebanese americans 
he said syria and colombia were cooperating in drug trafficking 
he showed television film of what he said was a meeting between a 
syrian representative and pablo escobar an alleged colombian drug 
smuggler wanted by the united states outside a hotel in larnaca 
cyprus 
the state department said friday night we have no knowledge 
of links between syria and the colombian medellin cartel 
also friday rep james traficant dohio said an insurance 
investigators report convinced him the cia had been tipped in 
advance that terrorists might attempt to blow up pan ams plane 
but remained silent he asserted the report which he did not 
release concludes the cia was covering up a drug run 
protecting the terrorists frankfurttonew york heroin route in 
exchange for contacts that might lead to the release of american

the cia immediately denied traficants charges and labeled the

with two shining stalwarts leo nucci as 
rigoletto and luciano pavarotti as the duke june anderson made her 
metropolitan opera debut as gilda in a new production of 
rigoletto 
the evening was a triumph for all of them 
miss anderson a boston native who grew up in connecticut is 
new to the met but not to her costars the three of them have made 
a soontobereleased recording of rigoletto 
her voice is clear and secure lovely and fresh the coloratura 
grows out of her full voice she puts personality into both the 
lyrical singing and the coloratura it isnt just a profusion of 
rapid high glinting notes 
pavarotti was in top vocal form friday night he moved easily 
enough that one didnt think of his sciatica until he chose a 
careful pose before singing la donna e mobile he held final 
notes excitingly but never too long 
nucci was splendid his voice sounding like a heroic 
personality even when his acting showed rigoletto to be bitter 
defeated or poisonously vindictive the music is meant to be sung 
this well and nucci makes rigoletto a character to understand and 
sympathize with 
marcello panni of rome in his debut season at the met 
conducted with fast tempos in act 1 he maintained the operas 
musical tension excellently 
the new production is better than the one it replaced though it 
would have been better still if it had been more brightly lighted 
some of the four sets looked like paintings by old masters and some 
just looked gloomy 
usually there was a spotlight on principals in the scene where 
rigoletto is with other men and blindfolded there wasnt a 
spotlight and one couldnt always find him 
the dukes palace is stone with stone staircases rickety worn 
stairways lead to rigolettos house and to the final acts 
riverside inn 
the production by otto schenk tries to tell the story 
logically now one person climbs a ladder goes down inside stairs 
and opens the gate to the rest instead of everybody climbing the 
ladder and one carrying gilda down the ladder 
and it showcases the stars better than the previous production 
now when the duke is worrying about gildas kidnapping he is 
alone on stage instead of in the middle of his milling court 
all the voices blended and ensembles were as enjoyable as the 
famous arias

a congressman says hell release an insurance 
investigators report which he claims documents connections between 
the cia and terrorists responsible for the bombing of pan am flight 
103 
the report shows the cia was tipped in advance there might be a 
bomb aboard the flight rep james traficant dohio told a news 
conference friday 
he said the report concludes the cia was covering up a drug 
run in exchange for contacts that might lead to the release of 
american hostages in the middle east and the terrorists put the 
bomb where a package of heroin was supposed to be 
the cia immediately denied traficants charges we have not 
seen the report rep traficant has described said cia spokesman 
mark mansfield the allegations it makes however are nonsense 
the congressman said he had not checked the report with the cia 
before his meeting with reporters 
traficant who once ran a shortlived campaign for president 
read from what he said was a report prepared by an investigator 
hired by pan ams insurance underwriter 
the report claims the cia had pinpointed the location of the 
eight americans held captive in lebanon and several of its agents 
were on flight 103 along with evidence that may have survived the 
explosion traficant said 
the plane exploded over lockerbie scotland last december and 
270 people died 
traficant said the report detailed a complicated web of plots 
and connections involving hostages spies bomb experts and 
drugrunners he refused to make copies of it available on the spot 
but called a monday news conference to distribute the document 
among the claims in the report is that west german intelligence 
agents told cia agents in frankfurt about an hour before flight 103 
departed that they suspected a bomb may have been enclosed in a 
specific suitcase traficant said 
the report says cia agents told their superiors in washington 
about the suspicion but got no response and the suitcase was 
allowed on the plane undisturbed traficant told a news conference 
whether or not they contacted cia here i dont know the 
report says they did traficant said the bottom line is i 
think the cia knew 
was it a cia rogue group i dont know he said my charge 
is the cia was covering up a drug run from frankfurt to new york 
trying to penetrate information on the hostages and that drug run 
uncovered by terrorist spies and intermediaries ended up using that 
drug run 
scotland yard had found specific bombproof types of luggage 
whose contents were intact traficant said the items in that 
luggage were turned over to the us government he said 
traficant said the report concluded the bombing was ordered by 
ahmed jibril leader of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine general command working through arms and drug smuggler 
monzer alkassar 
pan am has subpoenaed documents relating to alkassar who in 
1987 was linked to the secret operation that became known as the 
irancontra affair 
traficant said the report said alkassar had a relationship with 
a cia unit providing the cia with terrorist contacts in exchange 
for undisturbed transit of heroin into the united states 
i think jibril wanted to make a terrorist statement in 
response to the americandowned iranian commercial airliner 
traficant said he uncovered the insulated drug route frankfurt 
to new york he then decided to supplant and use a bomb instead of 
that drug route unbeknownst to even kassar 
the cia used a very weird means to a tragic ends traficant 
said reading from a report that he said included names addresses 
and bank account numbers in several countries

congressional staff members are working over 
the weekend to negotiate an end to the stalemate that has blocked 
passage of deficitreduction and debtceiling bills 
we anticipate being able to reach agreement and that we 
can announce it on monday majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine said friday 
republican leader bob dole of kansas said he could not say an 
agreement is near until we find what the staff is coming up with 
monday 
but mitchell said there are no hangups among house and 
senate leaders on what the agreement should contain 
president bush cleared away a major obstacle to passage of the 
legislation thursday when he and his senate allies said they will 
drop efforts to add a capital gains tax cut to the debt bill 
bushs concession apparently ended any real chance that the 
reduction which he promised during his 1988 election campaign 
would be passed this year 
at the same time bush demanded congress beef up the 
deficitreduction bills it is considering unless the final bill 
produces at least a 14 billion reduction he said he will let 
stand 16 billion of automatic acrosstheboard spending cuts that 
were triggered on oct 16 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee estimated the budget outline agreed to by congress and 
the administration last spring requires no more than 10 billion in 
deficit reduction this is not time to add additional issues 
to that agreement he said 
the next important deadline facing congress falls thursday the 
government will default on its debts on that day unless lawmakers 
agree on raising federal borrowing authority above the present 28 
trillion limit 
congressional leaders are deciding whether to add to the 
debtlimit bill popular amendments scaling back catastrophic 
medical insurance for retirees and repealing a law requiring that 
employerfinanced health insurance not discriminate against 
lowerpaid workers

nobody appears to want to take credit for the 
medicare catastrophic healthcare program that was enacted with 
fanfare last year not now that its been rebuffed by angry senior 
citizens 
sen david pryor dark on friday blasted the republican 
national committee for sending out a fundraising letter that 
includes this description for the genesis of the catastrophic 
package 
before president bush was elected the democrats in congress 
passed legislation and placed a tax on senior citizens to pay 
for catastrophic health insurance 
pryor chairman of the senate special committee on aging said 
the letter from gop chairman lee atwater was at best misleading 
and at worst downright deceitful 
republican national committee spokesman bj cooper said the 
letter was written by a independent vendor who neglected gop 
instructions to delete the section on the catastrophic law cooper 
said it was deleted after the first mailing 
when the catastrophic package was signed into law 
thenpresident reagan hailed its innovative financing mechanisms 
which include the surtax that has generated all the senior 
opposition 
the house last month voted to scrap the program and the senate 
to preserve only limited benefits and cancel the surtax the two 
chambers have yet to take final action to roll back all or part of 
the program

a federal appeals court has given the 
government the goahead to prosecute three people implicated in the 
bombing of the us capitol and other government buildings 
the court acting friday reversed an april 11 decision by us 
district court judge harold greene who said the same evidence is 
being used in successive trials on different charges against susan 
rosenberg timothy blunk and alan berkman such a procedure 
violates the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment said 
greene but the appeals court disagreed 
we find no support for the use of a same actual evidence 
test in assessing whether successive prosecutions violate the 
double jeopardy clause said appeals court judge abner mikva 
rosenberg blunk and berkman were convicted in separate trials 
in pennsylvania and new jersey of conspiracy to possess 
unregistered firearms explosives and false identification 
they were then indicted in washington dc for the actual 
bombings and were listed as unindicted coconspirators in an 
alleged scheme involving four other people to carry out the 
bombings 
seven people are accused of bombing the us capitol the 
national war college building at fort mcnair the computer center

marjorie mason always wanted to go to 
hawaii but fear of burdening her family led the 79yearold widow 
to pinch her pennies 
dreading the financial drain of a future illness she kept a 
tight budget paying to have the lawn mowed in front of the house 
shes owned for 34 years was about as close as she came to a frill 
but thanks to an experimental federal program that allows her to 
get a monthly check from the equity in her house the trip to 
hawaii is in the offing 
mrs mason on wednesday became the first beneficiary of the 
reverse mortgage program sponsored by the department of housing 
and urban development 
im not going go hog wild mrs mason said friday ill 
still budget my money i always have 
but ive never been able to go on trips and ive always 
wanted to go to hawaii ive got one friend who keeps pestering me 
to go there and ive been using all kinds of excuses now i think 
im going to say yes 
her loan is funded by a 100 million pilot program offered 
through the federal national mortgage association that is offering 
mortgages to homeowners 62 and older 
in a reverse mortgage elderly people who own their property 
outright or have only a minimal mortgage debt can take out a new 
mortgage instead of receiving a lump sum they either draw on a 
line of credit or get monthly payments when they die or move the 
loan is repaid by selling the home 
the program is designed for older people who have equity in 
their home but need additional money for monthly living expenses 
property taxes or serious illnesses 
for mrs mason the program is ideal 
your biggest asset is your home and its just sitting 
there she said you cant do anything with it as long as 
youre alive and when youre dead its too late 
the threebedroom house that she and her husband bought new in 
1955 has been paid off for 20 years 
she has been a widow since 1970 and has never worked her only 
son died last year her daughterinlaw remarried and her two 
grandsons are both grown 
she gets her income from social security a small pension from 
the company where her husband was an engineer and a few stocks and 
certificates of deposit she said 
the problem is my income doesnt go up with inflation she 
said 
mrs mason refused to discuss her income the value of her house 
or the amount she is getting from the reverse mortgage 
more than anything she feared making her family pay if she 
contracted a long illness 
if you have cancer or something it can really deplete 
savings and then you become such a burden on other people she 
said i just didnt want that 
she also wanted to stay in her home in this quiet kansas city 
mo suburb where she enjoys working in the yard cleaning her 
house and occasional forays to a restaurant or the movies with 
friends 
i can use this to spend on nursing care in my own home if i 
ever get sick she said 
mrs mason was one of about 300 people who made inquiries about 
the program to the kansas city hud office said coral eberly 
spokesman for james b nutter amp co the local lender for the 
program fifty names finally were pulled out of a hat containing 
150 eligible homeowners 
the mortgages are insured by the federal housing administration 
an arm of the department of housing and urban development and 
purchased by the federal national mortgage association from local 
lenders who originate the loans 
a total of 2500 reverse mortgages are being made available 
through local hud offices through sept 30 1991 
mrs mason said friends suggested the program to her after 
reading about it in a financial magazine but she originally balked 
all you had to do was mention the word hud and i thought of 
welfare and lowincome housing and i didnt want any part of 
that she said but when they convinced me it wasnt welfare i 
decided to try it

attend 
the sandinista government reported renewed fighting in eight 
provinces especially near the honduran border a rebel source said 
hundreds of rebels were retreating back to honduras where they are 
based 
the proposed talks at un headquarters in new york would be the 
first between the government and the rebels in more than a year on 
friday un officials said the meeting was set for monday and 
tuesday 
the rebels however said they wouldnt attend because of 
logistical problems and proposed a weeks postponement until nov 
13 
a rebel spokesman also said the contras will not disband until 
they are satisfied nicaragua has moved far enough toward democracy 
president daniel ortega who proposed the meeting when he 
announced the end of a 19monthold ceasefire this week said he 
wanted a delay but only until thursday and friday ortega is 
calling for disbanding the rebels and he has insisted that 
honduras take part in the meeting 
honduras which had declined the invitation wednesday refused 
again on friday 
the problem of the antisandinista rebels is nicaraguas 
honduran foreign minister carlos lopez contreras said late friday 
it is a conflict among nicaraguans 
in nicaragua sovietmade helicopters airlifted sandinista 
troops into remote mountains and jungles for strikes against the 
rebels defense ministry sources reported fighting in eight 
provinces especially in the north near the honduran border a 
ministry source said there were about 3000 rebels in the area 
a rebel source in costa rica said hundreds of rebel fighters 
were retreating back to camps in honduras 
our soldiers scarcely have any ammunition and cant confront 
an army as powerful as the sandinistas that is using all of its 
force to annihilate us the source said on condition of anonymity 
he said fighters remaining in nicaragua had been ordered to take 
cover 
however nicaraguan army col manuel salvatierra commander of 
troops in the northern provinces of jinotega and matagalpa said 
the rebels have all they need to fight 
the contras are not so stupid as to infiltrate the country 
without weapons and without ammunition salvatierra said in 
matagalpa 
he said rebels had kept weapons sent before the united states 
cut off shipments in february 1988 nonlethal aid such as boots 
and uniforms continues 
a hospital official in jinotega 100 miles northeast of managua 
said 14 soldiers had been treated there for battle wounds this week 
reporters saw soldiers with wounds from grenade shrapnel and 
mortars fired by retreating rebels 
ortega announcing wednesday that the government was ending its 
unilateral ceasefire said 1100 guerrillas had infiltrated 
nicaragua over the past three weeks 
he asked for the meeting to discuss demobilizing the contras 
under an aug 7 regional peace plan that plan sets a dec 5 
deadline for the rebels to disband 
the rebels had agreed in principle to attend the meeting but in 
a letter friday to a commission sponsored by the united nations and 
the organization of american states they said they could not attend 
next week because they did not have enough time to make the 
logistic arrangements 
the letter to the international commission for verification and 
support was released in honduras 
the contras also proposed a threepoint agenda a ceasefire by 
both sides with verification an amnesty by the sandinista 
government and rebel visits to nicaragua to verify steps to allow 
their return 
the date proposed by ortega is a strategy of his political 
party to take us off guard wilfredo montalvan a contra rebel 
director said in san jose costa rica 
and if ortega thinks the only thing that is going to be 
discussed there is the unconditional surrender of our troops he 
should forget that since he is very wrong he added our 
demobilization is voluntary and will occur when you can observe 
that nicaragua is taking true steps toward the route of democracy 
ortega asked if the only topic of the talks would be 
demobilization responded depending on how the demobilization 
agreement progresses we will be willing to reconsider the 
ceasefire 
officials from the organization of american states and the 
united nations are to mediate the meeting un spokesman francois

seventeen months ago the state supreme 
court ordered the release of a mental hospital inmate who had been 
held for 31 years on a mistaken diagnosis after allegedly raping 
and murdering a 5yearold girl 
since then authorities have stopped feeding bernt murphy the 
powerful tranquilizers that hastened his transformation from a 
strapping youth to a stooped palsied man who looks older than his 
51 years but they are reluctant to free murphy saying he is 
illequipped to deal with life on the outside 
murphy was 19 when he was arrested in 1957 on the rape and 
murder charges he was ruled incompetent to stand trial diagnosed 
a psychotic and committed to the state hospital at provo 40 miles 
south of salt lake 
doctors at the hospital said in 1972 that he had been cured of 
his insanity but the supreme court ruled last june that he had 
been misdiagnosed to begin with and must be freed 
but the step off the hospital grounds remains a giant one for 
murphy 
in its ruling the supreme court did not establish how murphys 
release should be handled 
murphy has never had a job has been prone in the past to 
violent rages and has the mental capacity of an 8yearold 
according to his attorney brooke wells 
a 12member committee has been assembled to coordinate efforts 
to rehabilitate murphy it includes vocational counselors state 
social services officials hospital personnel and attorneys and 
state officials 
the man hired to accompany murphy to his dishwashing job at a 
local cafe is just one of the expenses the state has incurred in 
the case 
during his confinement murphy occasionally burst into rages and 
attacked other patients and george brinkerhoff a hospital social 
worker appointed to oversee murphys transition isnt yet ready to 
turn him loose 
i think under the right set of circumstances he still could be 
dangerous brinkerhoff said but he is less dangerous than he 
was last year 
the public has right to be concerned but bernt has a right to 
adjust to society with dignity said john anderson murphys case 
worker at the department of social services 
brinkerhoff and wells said they hoped he could be freed by the 
end of the year 
in february officials permitted murphy to move into a group 
care house on the hospital grounds and allowed him to begin his 
job as long as he wore an electronic ankle bracelet while outside 
the hospital 
three months ago 3rd district judge pat brian allowed murphy to 
remove the bracelet 
wells has been murphys attorney for eight years and was the 
first to realize he was retarded and challenged state hospital 
reports portraying him as a danger to himself and others 
she said murphys original confessions were invalid and that he 
was no more than a convenient suspect in the murder of the girl 
and another crime to which he was linked the 1955 slaying of a 
23yearold woman 
public defender lisa marcy said murphy understands that he 
doesnt belong at the state hospital and was beginning to overcome 
feelings that no one could help him 
you treat someone like an animal and they are going to act 
like an animal marcy said to see people have faith in him and 
treat him with more dignity and respect is really wonderful 
hes no less human wells said and he wants the same 
things and quality of life like anyone else he understands now 
what is out there

the virginia governors race could make 
history if l douglas wilder becomes the nations first elected 
black governor but the contest already has set records for 
spending 
campaign reports filed by the candidates last week showed 
wilder the democratic lieutenant governor has raised 646 
million republican j marshall coleman a former attorney general 
has gathered 805 million 
added to the 73 million spent by the two losers in the june 
gop primary total spending for the election should top 22 million 
that would make the race the most expensive in virginia history 
exceeded nationally only by past races in texas 331 million 
florida 24 million and california 225 million all are at 
least twice as populous as virginia which has more than 5 million 
people 
its quite expensive considering the size of virginia said 
herbert e alexander a university of southern california professor 
who directs the citizen research foundation which studies campaign 
financing 
but its also an important race in term of some issues such as 
abortion said alexander adding i dont think 20 million is a 
lot in a race that could bring the first black governor and set a 
national precedent on the abortion issue 
wilder who has been leading in the polls last month released 
campaign ads stating his support for legalized abortion a position 
that many candidates in past years had been reluctant to take a 
strong stand on 
coleman opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother 
this years races for governor in virginia and new jersey are 
the first since the us supreme court last summer gave the states 
broad leeway to restrict abortion 
the new jersey race has drawn less national interest because 
democratic rep james j florio has a huge lead over republican 
rep james courter the new jersey candidates are limited by law 
from spending more than 5 million each 
spending on virginia races for governor started to accelerate in 
1981 when coleman lost to democrat charles s robb said john 
mcglennon an associate professor of government at the college of 
william and mary 
robb the soninlaw of former president lyndon b johnson and 
coleman were able to attract large contributors to the race in 
which spending topped 4 million 
four years later democrat gerald l baliles and republican 
wyatt durrette spent 83 million in the governors race won by 
baliles 
some of the largest contributions to coleman and wilder have 
come from developers in rapidly growing northern virginia just 
outside washington dc 
these people are not just opening the door theyre buying the 
door to the governors office said larry sabato a university of 
virginia government professor i cant for the life of me 
understand why people arent outraged about this

the citys buses will stop running 
entirely unless voters approve a sales tax tuesday backers of the 
levy campaign said 
about 60000 people a day use the buses operated by the central 
ohio transit authority which serves a municipal area where 13 
million people live 
a study last year by the midohio regional planning commission 
said the bus system was the sole means of transportation for about 
45 percent of the riders surveyed while 27 percent said they used 
it to save money 
if the 10year 025 percent sales levy is defeated the system 
will shut down nov 19 susan scherer campaign chairwoman for the 
committee to keep franklin county moving said this week 
the system with 308 buses serves franklin county which 
includes columbus and portions of three surrounding counties 
delaware licking and fairfield 
the levy would generate 22 million in the first year and would 
cost the average family about 64 cents a week according to 
scherers committee 
the transit authority previously received sales tax support 
through a levy that was approved by voters in june 1980 the 
authority of the levy ended in 1985 but the sales tax it generated 
provided enough funds to run the bus system for three years longer 
than expected 
this year however the system was forced to eliminate some 
routes cut the number of buses running other routes and curtail 
its weekend and evening runs transit authority spokeswoman joan 
florence said 
we did that in attempt to stretch the dollar to get to 
november to get back to the voters ms florence 
we definitely need a public transit system in central ohio 
and we would be in dire straits without one said jonathon l 
york president of the columbus chamber of commerce which donated 
about 250000 to the levy campaign 
local 208 of the united transport workers representing the 400 
bus drivers and 187 maintenance and support workers is in a labor 
dispute with the company but union members are campaigning for the 
measure said local president hubert snead

the french government honored some 
forgotten heroes of two world wars the oklahoma indians who 
confused german codebreakers by speaking over military 
communications in their native languages 
chief hollis roberts of the of the choctaw nation and kenneth 
saupitty chairman of the comanche nation received the knight of 
the national order of merit medals friday on behalf of the indian 
codetalkers 
each also received much to the merriment of the mostly indian 
audience the traditional kiss on each cheek from pierre messmer 
former prime minister of france under president charles de gaulle 
we and our people knew what we did said charles j 
chibitty listed on the program as one of three surviving 
codetalkers from world war ii we didnt need to talk about it 
comanches dont talk about what they do 
but roberts made it clear he thought it was high time that the 
codetalkers contribution were recognized 
this is something that you wont read in the history books 
but history was made today he said several hundred people 
attended the ceremony including democratic sen david boren and 
gov henry bellmon 
the codetalkers got their start in world war i when an officer 
heard several choctaws talking they were quickly put onto the 
communications lines to relay orders and information 
choctaw according to the concise columbia encyclopedia is a 
muskogean language of the hokansiouan group something not even 
the besteducated german picks up in high school comanche is a 
shoshonean language of the aztectanoan stock 
several hundred people attended the openair ceremony including 
democratic sen david boren and gov henry bellmon 
the military recruited comanche codetalkers in world war ii but 
a former soldier named schlicht billy said he and about a

president corazon aquino left today 
on a north american trip aimed at projecting a stable philippines 
hours after troops drove off thousands of supporters of the late 
ferdinand marcos with tear gas and water cannons 
about 15000 marcos loyalists massed late friday at camp crame 
headquarters of the philippine constabulary or military national 
police earlier in the day more than 25000 had rallied to protest 
mrs aquinos refusal to allow marcos to be buried in his homeland 
it was the largest protest by marcos supporters in the capital 
since 1986 soon after he was ousted in a popular uprising and 
forced into exile in hawaii marcos president for 20 years died 
sept 28 in honolulu at the age of 72 
by the time troops moved in soon after dawn the crowd had 
dwindled to a few thousand three news photographers and three 
soldiers were slightly injured by stones thrown by the loyalists 
police said about half a dozen loyalists were arrested and later 
released 
i depart as always with confidence that the safety of the 
government is assured in the care of the people mrs aquino 
said shortly before taking off on a philippine airlines flight to 
vancouver canada 
mrs aquino who has survived six armed coup attempts was also 
to visit toronto and ottawa and then go on new york washington 
dallas and los angeles 
aides say she will try to convince north american business 
groups that the philippines is a stable country for investment 
troops went on full alert tuesday and will remain in heightened 
readiness until she returns nov 13 no coups have been attempted 
during mrs aquinos frequent trips abroad 
police gave permission for the friday rally to be held at a 
traffic circle in suburban quezon city but refused to let 
protesters march to military garrisons 
the protesters however defied the order and headed toward camp 
crame across a major highway from armed forces headquarters and 
the defense department 
they shoved aside about 200 police and swarmed around the camp 
gates brig gen rodolfo biazon chief of the manila regional 
defense command agreed to let them stay there until midnight 
vice president salvador laurel and leaders of the new society 
movement marcos political party later negotiated a formal 
agreement to let protesters stay until 530 am instead of 
dispersing the remaining loyalists locked arms and jeered when 
military officers reminded them of the agreement and shouted go 
home go home 
two water cannons emerged from the main gate at about 6 am and 
sprayed the loyalists who responded with volleys of stones before 
police chased them away 
the military successfully launched its harassment against 
us said salvador panelo a protest leader id like to 
strongly protest this inhuman action of the government against the 
protesters 
oliver lozano another promarcos leader said the loyalists 
stalled on leaving the camp because not enough transport was 
available 
camp crame was the scene last week of protests by national 
police troopers angered by government plans to abolish the 
organization and create a civilian force 
maj gen ramon montano commander of the philippine 
constabulary claimed opposition groups were recruiting troopers 
for a new coup attempt against mrs aquino 
fridays protest capped a 250mile march by marcos supporters 
from ilocos norte his native province that took 11 days 
mrs aquino cited national security in refusing to allow marcos 
body and members of his family return protests by his followers 
had been small and peaceful until friday however

researchers who have shot some 700 cats in 
the head to study brain injuries said they temporarily suspended 
the armyfunded project that drew protests from animalrights 
activists 
the six to eightweek suspension of the research at the 
louisiana state university medical center had nothing to do with 
protests said dr perry rigby chancellor of the medical center 
the value of doing the research is not in question perry 
said questions have been raised however some of which pertain 
to the technical aspects of the research and some of which pertain 
to the granting agency 
the general accounting office the auditing arm of congress is 
investigating the project at the request of rep bob livingston 
rla and its report is expected in december at the earliest 
perry said 
a panel of lsu scientists will conduct an internal review of the 
research in order to respond to the gao findings said dr robert 
daniels dean of the school of medicine at lsunew orleans 
in the experiment a cat is anesthetized part of the front of 
its skull is removed and it is locked into a vise a heliumpowered 
gun then fires a small steel sphere into the cats brain from 31 
inches away 
the object is to determine the best treatment for brainwounded 
soldiers project director dr michael carey has said previously 
cary wasnt at the news conference called friday to announce the 
suspension 
describing his findings in may cary said the experiment has 
shown that a bullet wound to the brain stops respiration but if 
respiration is supported artificially the animal will begin 
breathing again on its own 
animal rights groups across the nation have called for a stop to 
the research paid for by the army 
the physicians comittee for responsible medicine has asked 
defense secretary richard cheney to stop the project claiming it 
is superfluous 
the project has brought an estimated 2 million to lsu medical 
center over the past six years rigby and daniels said they 
estimated that 700 cats had been subjected to the experiments but 
neither would discuss medical conclusions

aids has become the eighth leading killer of 
women of childbearing age according to study by the centers for 
disease control 
the study released friday found that 1430 women between the 
ages of 15 and 44 died of aids last year compared to 813 in 1986 
a 75 percent increase 
the statistics put acquired immune deficiency syndrome ahead of 
diabetes influenza and pneumonia as a killer of women of 
childbearing age according to the study 
what happened to men with aids in 1984 and 1985 is happening 
to women now said dr susan chu a cdc epidemiologist and 
its getting worse 
although deaths of men from aids are still more common the 
death rate among men rose just 42 percent over the past three 
years the study shows 
it found that the rise in the number of women victims could lead 
to a big increase in aids among children 
cdc figures show that 1013 children ages 12 and younger had 
died of aids as of sept 30 
the trends in children tend to parallel the trends in women 
because women can infect their children said dr james buehler 
another cdc epidemiologist 
the numbers on women give us a lot of warning buehler said 
and we should use it to bring research and newly developed 
therapies to bear on pediatric aids 
chu said black women are nine times more likely to die of aids 
than white women she said aids was the fifthleading cause of 
deaths among black women in 1987 
about half of the women who acquired aids through june of this 
year did so by using infected needles she said while another 20 
percent were stricken with aids after having sexual intercourse 
with an iv drug user 
as of the end of september 1989 the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta had recorded a cumulative total of 109167 cases 
of aids in the united states with 64849 deaths

the united states and japan have started a new 
round of economic meetings marked by us advice to the japanese to 
accompany their buying up of america with more opportunity for 
americans to invest in japan officials said 
the two countries semiannual subcabinetlevel economic talks 
which began friday also aired questions about continuing massive 
japanese trade surpluses and us budget deficits said officials 
of both countries who talked to reporters on condition they not be 
named 
the sources said the japanese side asked why americans were so 
concerned about such investments as sony corporations acquisition 
of columbia pictures or mitsubishi real estates purchase of 
rockefeller center since as a debtor nation america needs the 
capital inflow 
our attitude was that we welcome foreign investment but it is 
becoming increasingly difficult to defend it in the us against 
the perception that americans do not have the same opportunity in 
japan the us informant said 
even though japan has a powerful economy second only to 
americas it does not even appear on the list of the 15 leading 
nations that host foreign investment the japanese were told us 
businessmen have complained of waiting for years to get japanese 
approval of investment proposals 
mccormacks delegation also warned the japanese that political 
alarms could sound in congress if recent reports are borne out 
that the japanese trade surplus will resume growing next year and 
that excess capacity will prompt japan to turn from domestic demand 
back to exports for economic growth 
the reply was that japan would continue to stimulate domestic 
demand and boost imports from the united states especially 
highticket capital goods the sources said 
the two countries agreed on broad cooperation in the forthcoming 
round of global trade talks sources said 
richard mccormack us undersecretary of state for economic 
affairs presided over the talks which were attended by 
representatives of a half dozen departments of the two countries 
governments deputy foreign minister koji watanabe headed the 
japanese delegation 
most of the same officials return monday and tuesday for the 
second session of the structural impediment initiative talks begun 
two months ago in tokyo on nontrade causes contributing to the 50

we consulted a physician as to how long the boy could go 
without any food or liquid said dan turner a police spokesman 
the doctor said after 15 hours the boy would be in critical 
condition so we took action

knew what was going on we had already secured the little boy his 
safety was our top priority

knife and checked the baby for wounds said police spokesman al 
baker

pair of scissors or by diving into a bayou before she was tackled 
by police and taken for psychiatric evaluation baker said

a usowned drilling ship with 97 
people on board including seven americans capsized early today 
when a typhoon with 100 mph winds hit the gulf of thailand all 
aboard were missing 
rescue workers searched a 600 squaremile area without finding 
any trace of the seacrests crewmen said richard keller a vice 
president of unocal thailand the oil company called off todays 
search because of darkness 
thai navy divers planned to continue into the night with the 
assistance of lights and remotely operated underwater vehicles 
unocal spokeswoman carol scott said the company planned to resume 
its search sunday 
at dusk a searchandrescue team was dropped by helicopter atop 
the upsidedown hull of the 351foot vessel but the rescuers did 
not find any crewmen scott said 
they tapped on the part of the hull that is above water 
listening for a signal back but got no response said scott a 
spokeswoman in bangkok for the los angelesbased company that owns 
the stricken ship 
another unocal spokesman barry lane said rescue efforts were 
hampered by 6foot waves and 15 mph winds he said six thai 
fishermen from another boat were rescued late friday after the 
helicopter dropped them a life raft in the seas about 270 miles 
south of bangkok 
staterun radio thailand today quoted meteorological officials 
as saying typhoon gay was the worst to hit thailand in 35 years 
the typhoon struck friday and developed quickly giving the crew 
of the seacrest little time to prepare lane said 
this actually was a small storm a squall and it escalated 
very quickly into a tropical storm and then a typhoon he said 
local news reports said at least 12 fishing boats and two cargo 
vessels also had capsized in the storm which was expected to hit 
the mainland later today thirtysix crew members were missing from 
the two vessels a vietnamese cargo ship and a thai freighter 
officials said unocal lost contact with the 
panamanianregistered seacrest about 12 hours after the storm hit 
carol scott a spokeswoman for unical said in bangkok that 64 
of the missing on seacrest were thai 
the rest were seven americans five britons four australians 
three filipinos three singaporeans two canadians two danes two 
malaysians two indonesians one new zealander one norwegian and 
one west german she said 
the names and hometowns of those on board were not immediately 
available 
lane said the seacrest is owned by a unocal subsidiary and 
operated by great eastern drilling and engineering co of singapore 
he said most of those on board were great eastern employees 
the unocal subsidiary unocal thailand ltd had aircraft and 
ships searching the area they were joined by units of the thai 
navy and air force 
lane said the seacrest had been operating in the platong natural 
gas field and the crew had been preparing to run casing into a 
recently drilled gas well the vessel drills for both oil and gas 
he said a 60foothigh drilling rig was mounted on the seacrest 
which also carried other drilling equipment lane said the ship may 
have been too topheavy to weather such a storm 
ms scott said the capsized vessel was found about five miles 
from the platong oil processing platform 
officials said other unocal facilities in the gulf suffered only 
minor damage and there were no reported injuries unocal had more 
than 1100 workers offshore on 46 platforms and 18 vessels at the 
time of the storm 
the company operates five natural gas fields in the gulf of 
thailand that normally produce about 540 million cubic feet of 
natural gas daily company officials said the seacrest first went 
into service in 1978

christian leader gen michel aoun said 
today he had dissolved parliament because it endorsed an arab peace 
plan without his consent but lawmakers vowed to defy him by 
meeting to elect a new president 
aoun 54 summoned reporters to his bunker command post under 
the presidential palace in suburban baabda east of beirut before 
dawn and read a decree issued by his threeman military cabinet 
aoun whose cabinet is vying for power with a rival moslem 
government said he was dissolving the legislature because it 
violated the constitution last month when it approved without his 
consent an arab leaguebrokered accord to end the 14yearold civil 
war 
the accord was endorsed by 59 of the 63 lawmakers who attended a 
special parliamentary session called by the league in the saudi 
resort of taif 
aouns move was aimed at preventing the legislature from holding 
a scheduled meeting in beirut today to ratify the peace accord and 
elect a new president 
but legislators gathered at a northern lebanon airbase kleiat 
and said they would hold a special parliamentary session today or 
sunday to elect a new president to form a government of national 
reconciliation the session must attract at least 50 of the 73 
parliament members to form a quorum 
sources said parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite 
moslem was flying to paris to bring about 28 deputies most of 
them christians from the french capital to attend the session 
aoun has branded them as traitors and threatened to punish them 
twentyfour moslem deputies today drove from west beirut to 
kleiat where they were joined by leftist christian deputy najah 
wajim 
the parliament session was originally called for 10 am 3 am 
est at villa mansour the wartime parliament headquarters in the 
nomans land along the green line dividing beirut into moslem and 
christian sectors 
aouns supporters today called a general strike that paralyzed 
the christian enclave north of beirut thousands of angry christian 
youngsters took to the streets in east beirut and the port of 
jounieh burning tires and shouting slogans against parliament 
members 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem who heads the 
syrianbacked cabinet that rivals aouns rejected aouns decree 
this is an unconstitutional illegitimate act its null and 
void hoss said in a statement a president must be elected to 
save the country 
under lebanons constitution only the president can dissolve 
parliament but lebanon has had no head of state since sept 22 
1988 when president amin gemayels 6year term expired with 
parliament unable to elect a successor because of a christian 
boycott 
gemayel a maronite catholic like aoun named the general to 
head an interim cabinet until a new president could be elected 
aoun has contended he has the powers of a head of state as long 
as the presidency is vacant 
rightwing christian deputies in paris denounced aoun and 
charged in a statement that his lust for power could plunge 
lebanon in a new whirlpool of destruction 
the only way to reunite the government is to elect a new 
president who will form a national reconciliation cabinet said 
moslem legislator jamil kubbe thats what were going to do 
today 
wajim told reporters that none of the deputies in kleiat 
recognize aoun as a legitimate head of government 
so any decree he issues is illegitimate he will not be able 
to prevent us from electing a president wajim said 
aouns decree said approval of the taif accord was a breach of 
the constitution that warrants the dissolution of parliament 
he called for threestage general elections for a new parliament 
in beirut and its environs jan 7 in north lebanon jan 14 and in 
east and south lebanon jan 21 
the current parliament the longestserving in the world was 
elected in 1972 for a fouryear term but the civil war broke out 
in 1975 and prevented new elections the house has since been 
extending its mandate every two years 
there is little likelihood that new elections would be held in 
response to aouns decree because syrian troops control more than 
70 percent of lebanon syria backs the moslems 
observers in beirut believe that a new president if elected 
would dismiss aoun from all his political and military posts 
aoun claims the syrians who entered lebanon under an arab 
league peacekeeping mandate in 1976 are an occupying force 
the general who fought the syrians for six months until an arab 
leaguebrokered ceasefire took hold sept 22 rejected the peace 
plan because it failed to provide a definite timetable for a syrian 
withrawal

backers of legalized casino gambling asked 
citizens to ante up with votes today and one poll puts the odds at 
21 in favor of the plan to let gamblers bail out this financially 
strapped steel town 
activists got in lastminute campaigning as the polls opened at 
6 am in the citys first saturday election 
most of our workers are out and in place rodney 
sommerville office manager at the procasino headquarters said 
this morning we just sent six vans to the senior citizens 
highrises to help them get to the polls everything is falling in 
place and all we can do is hope for good results 
the nonbinding referendum a product of months of emotional 
campaigning would urge the state legislature to legalize gambling 
in gary although rejection by voters could doom the casino effort 
even a strong yes vote might be insufficient to overcome opposition 
in state government 
casino advocates led by mayor thomas v barnes say gambling 
resorts could provide 25000 jobs and at least 40 million annually 
in property taxes for a city staggering under 12 percent 
unemployment and the loss of 55000 residents since the 1970s 
the opposition led by a baptist minister the rev william 
booth says those figures are unreliable 
karen williams barnes press secretary said the heaviest 
turnout was expected after 10 am the mayors office was 
tabulating early returns as they came in through electronic voting 
machines at the citys 18 polling places 
opponents point to atlantic city nj where gambling 
proponents promised an economic rebirth but where local residents 
got comparatively few jobs in the gleaming casinos built along the 
boardwalk after gambling was legalized there in 1976 
atlantic city residents complain the arrival of the casinos 
pushed up property taxes driving away small businesses and the 
poor 
garys economy has been drained by cuts in a steel industry 
battered by cheap foreign competition employment suffered further 
as the steelmakers in an effort to become more competitive 
installed modern equipment that requires fewer workers to operate 
barnes said gary has learned from atlantic citys mistakes and 
vows city residents will get first crack at jobs 
property tax pressures will be eased because the prime casino 
site is more than a mile from homes and businesses on usx corp 
lakefront property he said unlike in atlantic city where casinos 
moved in next to existing businesses 
booth predicts casinos would bring more street crime and even 
organized crime to a city that cant quickly beef up a police force 
already cut in half because of declining revenues 
in an opinion poll of potential gary voters conducted earlier 
this week by the fort wayne television station wpta 68 percent 
said they would vote in favor of the gambling measure and 32 
percent said they would vote against it wpta said the random 
telephone survey of 355 voters had a margin of error of 54 percent 
if voters approve casinos procasino forces will try to 
persuade reluctant legislators to pass the necessary laws if the 
casino vote fails to win at least a majority the effort to win 
legislative support would become even more difficult 
gov evan bayh whose signature would be needed on any casino 
measure was an early and consistent opponent he said indiana 
gaming laws which permit only a stateoperated lottery should be 
left unchanged 
senate majority leader robert garton said he senses strong 
opposition among his constituents and sees little hope for casinos 
if the governor strongly opposes the idea indiana gambling 
interests may have moved too fast in pushing for casinos 
parimutuel betting and dog racing less than one year after voters 
struck down a state constitutional provision prohibiting gambling 
he added 
the legislature balked at a gary casino proposal earlier this 
year and the referendum was born of a compromise to keep the issue 
alive

hundreds of thousands of people chanting 
freedom freedom rallied in east berlin today to protest 
repression and demand reforms from communist party chief egon 
krenz who promised a highlevel government shakeup 
as many as 1 million people spread over several sections of the 
city police and prodemocracy activists said in the largest 
demonstration in east german history 
the remarkable rally came as hundreds of east germans continued 
to emigrate to the west through czechslovakia where about 5000 
had packed the west german embassy in prague in recent days to seek 
asylum 
west german diplomats announced late friday that east berlin had 
agreed to let east germans leave czechoslovakia legally by any 
means they liked west german border guards said they expected at 
least 6000 arrivals today 
yet the tolerance of dissent and the promise of reforms by the 
new krenz government which replaced the hardline regime of erich 
honecker last month has failed to assauge the simmering public 
resentment of east germanys rigidly controlled society 
the prodemocracy action began as a peaceful officially 
tolerated march by tens of thousands through east berlin late 
morning and swelled by hundreds of thousands by midday for the 
rally at the citys huge alexanderplatz square 
opposition leaders were cheered and party officials booed and 
whistled as they addressed the huge crowd from a platform mounted 
on a truck 
one of the biggest cheers went up when a noncommunist 
politician repeated his demand for the resignation of the entire 
east german leadership 
many in the crowd filling the vast square held up opposition new 
forum banners the crowd often chanted freiheit freiheit 
german for freedom 
other speakers called for free trade unions and one demanded 
compensation for victims of the stalinist terror 
one hungarian student was cheered when he called for a union of 
democratic movements throughout eastern europe another speaker 
received long applause when he offered apologies to czechoslovakia 
for the warsaw pact invasion that crushed the prague spring in 
1968 
east german radio and television carried live coverage of the 
protests noting that hundreds of thousands were taking part 
east germanys official adn news agency said the milelong 
procession that began at 930 am included banners and placards 
that were both supportive and derisive of recent official gestures 
toward reform 
the eyes of the people are on you one banner warned the 
leadership adn said we want glasnost not sugarcoating 
demanded another pressing for an end to state media controls 
other banners challenged the leading role of the communist party 
and demanded life without secret police terror 
scores of apartment dwellers draped prodemocracy banners from 
their balconies along the march route and applauded the protesters 
several elderly east berliners were seen weeping as the marchers 
passed by 
at alexanderplatz the main square in downtown east berlin 
prominent artists and entertainers called for changes in the 
nations constitution to guarantee free assembly and to abolish the 
communist partys monoply on power 
in a televised speech friday krenz announced the removal of 
five more politburo members and pledged other political changes he 
urged citizens to be patient and wait for reforms to take hold 
trust our policy of renewal your place dear fellow citizens 
is here we need you said krenz who replaced honecker on oct 
18 
although he did not mention it krenzs speech coincided with 
the announcement that east germans in czechoslovakia would be 
allowed to go to the west with their own travel documents 
many already in czechoslovakia including about 5000 in the 
west german embassy began departing early today 
as krenz spoke friday about 85000 people demonstrated for more 
democracy in at least four cities around the country adn said 
in his 22minute address krenz also announced new laws to allow 
draft resisters to serve in the civil service the formation of a 
constitutional court to protect citizens rights and plans to 
abolish special privileges of highranking party functionaries 
he said that independent noncommunist groups would have a big 
say in forging reforms but he did not say if opposition groups 
would be legalized 
he also did not mention free elections one of the major demands 
of prodemocracy demonstators in their protests over the past two 
months 
more than 70000 east germans have left their country in recent 
months dissatisfied with how the communist party has been running 
the nation for four decades 
krenzs speech means that more than a third of the 21member 
politburo will have been ousted from the body since he came to 
power 
the five elderly politburo members who lost their posts were 
erich mielke kurt hager hermann axen erich mueckenberger and 
alfred neumann 
mielke 82 had headed the countrys feared security apparatus 
since 1957 hager 77 was the ideology chief while the 
73yearold axen had been responsible for foreign relations 
mueckenberger and neumann both 79 held no specific functions in 
recent years 
all had been closely associated with honecker including 
honecker eight old guard party officials have now been removed 
from the politburo 
krenz said the five latest members had asked the party 
leadership to be relieved of their duties so that place can be 
made for younger forces 
he did not announce any immediate appointments to replace the 
ousted men 
krenz said the five would be formally released at a meeting of 
the partys central committee that is scheduled to begin wednesday 
the meeting could also produce new appointments in the politburo

authorities opened the former us embassy 
to the public and paraded seven alleged cia spies before television 
cameras today as iran marked the 10year anniversary of the 
embassys dramatic seizure 
iranians chanting death to america celebrated with great 
rallies throughout the country according to the staterun tehran 
radio 
but despite efforts by radicals to use the anniversary to stir 
antiamerican passions turnout at a rally near the embassy in 
tehran was relatively pooronly 10000 to 15000 people gathered at 
the embassy previous rallies had drawn hundreds of thousands of 
people 
western and third world diplomats believe the radicals want to 
use the anniversary of the embassy seizure nov 4 1979 to stir 
antiamerican sentiment to challenge efforts by president hashemi 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists to improve 
tehrans links with the west 
the main speaker was to be former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi rafsanjanis leading rival among the hardliners who 
fear boosting relations with the west will undermine the islamic 
revolution 
the government earlier apparently had been trying to keep 
ceremonies marking the anniversary as lowkey as possible 
the official islamic republic news agency reported that 
rafsanjani met with officials in charge of rebuilding the southern 
city of khorramshahr badly damaged in the 8year war with iraq 
and told them iranians energy must be used for reconstruction 
among the most effective ways of combatting arrogance 
arrogance is a revolutionary euphemism for the united states 
officials presented the seven alleged spies at a televised news 
conference in a corrugated iron hut next to the main building that 
once housed the us embassy 
it was the first time foreigners have been allowed into the 
sprawling compound since it was stormed by militant students 
who held 52 diplomats and other embassy personnel hostage for 444 
days a crisis that helped topple the administration of president 
jimmy carter 
all seven men said they had been recruited by the central 
intelligence agency while they were abroad rafsanjani disclosed in 
april that a spy network including senior military officials had 
been rounded up 
one of the alleged agents bahman aqaei said he was recruited 
while he was working at the iranian embassy in new delhi india as 
a second secretary in charge of economic affairs 
aqaei the groups spokesman said they had been trained in 
espionage techniques and promised as much as 1200 a month a 
small fortune in economically troubled iran but never received any 
money 
others said they were recruited in west germany and turkey and 
underwent commando training at a secret base 
correspondents were allowed to film and take photographs during 
the news conference but were not permitted to photograph the 
buildings in the compound 
bearded young men cradling ak47 rifles in their arms shepherded 
the media group into the compound 
teenage revolutionary guards could be seen through the windows 
of the main building attending classes others played volleyball in 
a field in the center of the compound 
the complex was also opened to the public for the first time 
iranians were allowed to enter a forecourt in front of the main 
building where posters and copies of documents seized during the 
takeover allegedly proving the embassys involvement in spying 
activities were on display 
large signs on either side of the main iron gate to the compound 
on taleghani avenue proclaimed in big blue letters death to 
america in english and persian 
the high brick wall around the compound was festooned with 
banners bearing antiamercian slogans and quotations from speeches 
by irans late revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
he died june 3

thousands of refugees fleeing 
an uncertain future in east germany began streaming into this 
border town today cheering their new freedom and saying theyd 
lost hope of change back home 
the first of a caravan of special trains evacuating more than 
5000 east germans from prague czechoslovakia pulled into the 
crowded train station here early this morning 
i waited four years for permission to leave legally but then 
i decided i couldnt pass up the opportunity said 27yearold 
olaf acksteiner of cottbus 
his arrival followed the stunning decision of east berlin 
authorities to let czechoslovakia open its border with west germany 
to any east germans fleeing their communist homeland 
while the authorized escape channel is unprecedented in east 
germanys 40year history communist party leader egon krenz 
appealed to his countrymen to stay and help build a better east 
germany 
the first arrivals here were greeted on a cold and damp bavarian 
day with two dozen baby carriages hot tea blankets and food 
a hearty welcome to you the train station loudspeaker 
boomed to the new arrivals the federal border police and the 
mayor of marktredwitz welcome you to the federal republic of 
germany 
among the crowd of about 400 wellwishers one held up a sign 
advertising a job im looking for a butchers apprentice 
west german diplomats announced late friday that east berlin had 
agreed to let east germans leave czechoslovakia legally by any 
means they liked simply by showing their east german identity 
documents 
that effectively removed east german barriers on travel to west 
germany for the first time in years east germans need no special 
permission to travel to czechoslovakia 
it was not clear how long the new arrangement would last it 
also was not immediately clear how many east germans would decide 
to take advantage of the opportunity 
west german border guards said they expected at least 6000 
arrivals today but some east germans told reporters in 
czechoslovakia that tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of 
thousands might take advantage of the chance to flee 
krenz in power only two weeks has been under pressure to boost 
the communist partys sagging authority on friday he announced a 
sweeping program of reform and the resignation of five old guard 
politburo members 
but he made no mention of the decision to allow east germans to 
head west from czechoslovakia appealing instead to his compatriots 
to stay home and urging them to apply for legal emigration if they 
feel they must leave 
trust our policy of renewal krenz said in a televised 
address your place dear fellow citizens is here we need you 
since august more than 70000 east germans have headed to west 
germany through hungary and bonns embassies in prague and warsaw 
since august at least another 101000 have emigrated legally to 
west germany this year from the communist land of 17 million 
krenzs predecessor erich honecker banned travel to 
czechoslovakia oct 3 in an effort to halt the exodus of mostly 
young skilled workers 
but krenz lifted the ban tuesday and thousands of east germans 
began pouring into czechoslovakia many heading for the prague 
embassy 
fridays announcement was the third time in six weeks that east 
germany had been forced to permit a huge exodus from the embassy in 
prague two waves of about 15000 east germans left from the 
embassy last month their future had been uncertain however until 
special arrangements were made 
the thousands who arrived later after east germany lifted a 
monthold ban on trips to czechoslovakia did not face such 
uncertainty because of a new east german procedure allowing them to 
renounce their citizenship 
but that process took days and only about 100 people were 
receiving approval daily to go to west germany 
the delays would have led to mass overcrowding at the embassy 
a situation that both east and west germany and czechoslovakia 
apparently wanted to avoid 
east germans who have visas for hungary have been able to go 
freely to west germany via austria since sept 10 when hungary 
opened its western border more than 49000 east germans have used 
that route to enter the west according to austrian officials 
others fled before sept 10 across hungarys defortified border 
with austria and thousands managed to leave by entering the west 
german embassies here and in warsaw

three times a day observant jews pray for the 
restoration speedily in our days of the jewish temple that was 
destroyed by the romans in ad 70 
the 35acre site has long been occupied by some of islams most 
sacred houses of worship and most israelis have reconciled 
themselves to waiting 
extremists however are actively trying to realize the dream of 
rebuilding the jewish temple and their actions have heightened 
tensions that could have repercussions throughout the arab world 
skirmishes broke out in jerusalem recently when stonethrowing 
arabs protested the first attempt by israeli jews to rebuild 
about 80 jewish militants of the temple mount faithful tried to 
bring in a threeton cornerstone for a temple near the sacred 
western wall in jerusalems old city the last remnant of the 
temple torn down by the romans 
police prevented the cornerstone ceremony but the attempt 
ignited riots by palestinian students in a school just outside the 
walls of the old city five policemen were injured by stones and 14 
palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets 
we need to end the arab occupation of israel in jerusalem and 
especially on the temple mount which is very holy for us said 
gershon salomon 
salomon who founded the temple mount faithful shortly after 
israel captured the temple mount in the 1967 sixday war vowed in 
an interview to continue his efforts to lay the cornerstone and 
start rebuilding 
another sign of increased movement toward realizing plans for a 
new temple was the holding of the first conference on temple 
research it brought about 350 enthusiasts to the headquarters of 
the chief rabbinate where the two top israeli rabbis of the 
ashkenazi and sephardi branches of judaism are based 
if we do not prepare and show god that we want a temple then 
god wont give it to us said zev golan spokesman for the temple 
institute which sponsored the conference 
the institute is using a computer to draw up blueprints for 
rebuilding the temple as an exact replica of the one destroyed by 
the romans 
for the past two years it has also been making replicas of 
temple vessels and priestly garments although golan said his 
organization has no timetable or no plans to oust the moslems 
at least one yeshiva seminary is training clergy for priestly 
rituals in the temple which was first built by king solomon and 
destroyed by the babylonians in 587 bc it was rebuilt by king 
herod and torn down again by the romans 
orthodox jews pray daily for a third temple may it be thy 
will lord god god of our fathers that the temple be rebuilt 
speedily in our days 
the problem for builders is that the site of the temple has been 
occupied for more than 1300 years by the golden capped dome of the 
rock a shrine marking the spot where moslems believe the prophet 
mohammed ascended to heaven 
nearby is the al aqsa mosque where mohammed arrived on his 
journey from mecca it is the holiest islamic site after mecca and 
medina 
the temple was built on the ground of the dome of the rock 
there is almost no debate said menahem ben yashar a professor 
of old testament studies at bar ilan university near tel aviv 
why did the moslems build it there because that was the place 
where the temple was maybe thats legitimate that every conqueror 
builds his place he said 
palestinian leaders say any israeli move to alter the status 
quo under which jews are forbidden to even pray on the temple 
mount is certain to provoke bloodshed 
sari nusseibeh who teaches islamic philosophy at bir zeit 
university in the west bank said islam regards the dome of the 
rock as the fulfillment of the biblical prophecy that a house of 
god will rise on that spot 
if this basic belief is challenged through for example the 
setting up of another temple in fulfillment of that same prophecy 
this would constitute an affront to the basic foundations of 
islamic belief nusseibeh said 
such an affront would i think be a cause for a major 
explosion 
most israelis are aware of moslem sensitivities and there is no 
mass movement supporting a rebuilding effort 
but extremist jewish groups trying to clear the way for the 
reconstruction have plotted or attempted to blow up the mosques on 
the temple mount at least five times since 1967 
a christian australian later judged insane and deported set 
fire to al aqsa in 1969 causing severe damage to the altar an 
american jew who shot and killed two arabs on the temple mount in 
1982 is serving a life sentence

the government says its policy in northern ireland 
has not changed but a top official has shaken the province by 
thinking out loud about talking to the irish republican army 
while the iras political wing quickly welcomed the overture 
the military wings next move was to try to blow up a police 
station 
peter brooke in interviews marking his 100th day as secretary 
of state for northern ireland said no military solution was 
possible and that a british government might one day talk to sinn 
fein the iras political wing that could only happen brooke 
specified if the ira abandoned its campaign of violence 
what i thought mr brooke was saying was ordinary common 
sense john hume said saturday hume is leader of the social 
democratic and labor party the provinces largest roman catholic 
party 
however there were calls for brookes resignation and the 
headline in the tabloid star on saturday shrieked surrender to 
the ira 
some complained of the timing just a day after many newspapers 
in britain had frontpage pictures of the small flagdraped coffin 
of ruthi islania a 6monthold girl shot to death along with her 
soldier father by an ira unit in west germany 
sinn fein president gerry adams welcomed brookes conciliatory 
tone but rejected any conditions for beginning talks 
the ira carried on its war parking a stolen van packed with 
1600 pounds of explosives outside a police station in londonderry 
about 20 pounds of the homemade explosives detonated friday 
night while army experts worked to defuse the bomb according to 
the royal ulster constabulary no one was injured but there was 
damage to nearby cars and homes 
on saturday the constabulary said two policemen and two 
civilian women were hurt when a rocket was fired at an armored 
police vehicle in west belfast an ira stronghold 
james molyneux leader of the ulster unionist party said 
brookes statement would encourage sinn fein to believe they can 
bomb their way to the conference table 
the rev ian paisley leader of the smaller democratic unionist 
party said negotiations would be unacceptable to unionists and 
an insult to ulsters honored dead 
prime minister margaret thatcher has said nothing about brookes 
remarks 
however brooke was lambasted from both sides of the house of 
commons 
i think its giving comfort to our enemies and he has told 
his own troops that they cannot win i think its unforgivable 
said ivor stanbrook a rightwinger in mrs thatchers conservative 
party who is usually among the first to react to any political 
development 
another conservative lawmaker ian gow said saturday that 
brooke had added to the uncertainty and confusion in the province 
kevin mcnamara the opposition labor partys spokesman on 
northern ireland said brookes comments can only assist the one 
last push mentality of the paramilitaries on both sides later 
however mcnamara called brookes statement incomplete but 
welcome and a restatement of the position of all the 
political parties in the united kingdom 
sinn fein the unionist parties and the social democratic and 
labor party may agree only on their unhappiness with the status quo 
in northern ireland where more than 2700 people have died in more 
than 20 years of violence 
the british government has twice tried direct talks with sinn 
fein in 1972 under edward heaths conservative government and 
again in 197475 under labor prime minister harold wilson 
brooke hinted that his intention was to promote debate within 
the sinn feinira ranks about whether their armed struggle was 
working 
there has to be a possibility at some stage of a debate 
opening up within the terrorist community as to whether they are 
actually securing any return brooke said in a television 
interview 
seamus mallon a social democrat of the house of commons said 
sinn feins reaction was less important than that of its 
supporters who are about onethird of the catholic minority 
i would love to see a response a positive response from that 
nationalist community that i represent saying lets give this 
a chance lets give hope a chance lets give political 
development a chance mallon said

swearing devotion to the hindu god ram 
and a willingness to die for their beliefs hundreds of young men 
set out saturday with sanctified bricks on a mission that has 
spurred hindumoslem riots and caused at least 280 deaths 
their destination is ayodhya 325 miles to the southeast where 
plans for a new hindu temple have propelled religious strife to the 
forefront of prime minister rajiv gandhis battle for reelection 
from the width and depth of india convoys of trucks and buses 
are heading to ayodhya in the heart of uttar pradesh indias most 
populous state and a bellwether in elections in their wake 
moslems and hindus have shot stabbed and burned each other to 
death 
to put up the bricks for the hindus this is important said 
rajesh kumar a 19yearold english student who joined the 
procession of seven buses and at least four trucks that left new 
delhi on saturday 
the name of the god ram is enough to defend ourselves he 
said then patted a holster containing a brass trident with sharp 
spears the blade is less than 4 inches so its legally 
permitted he said with a grin this is just a symbol not a 
weapon 
some of the young men carried sabers and hockey sticks which 
older organizers hastened to describe as religious symbols or 
evidence of youthful sportsmanship 
on thursday ardent hindus plan to lay the foundation for a new 
temple to lord ram in ayodhya next to a disputed shrine claimed by 
both moslems and hindus 
vishwa hindu parishad the fundamentalist group behind the 
temple drive says it has gathered bricks from more than 375000 
cities and towns throughout india and from hindus in canada the 
united states and western europe after being blessed by hindu holy 
men the bricks are borne by believers and festooned with bright 
red and orange satin and chiffon tied up with tinsel and garlanded 
with marigolds 
this joyous celebration of religious right has left a trail of 
death in villages where hindus and moslems have lived side by side 
for centuries 
hindumoslem clashes are particularly worrisome now 
with national elections barely three weeks away both gandhi and 
opposition leader vishwanath pratap singh have been urging 
religious harmony while at the same time trying not to alienate the 
hindu fundamentalist vote or the potentially pivotal vote of 
moslems who make up 11 percent of the population hindus account 
for 82 percent 
gandhi officially launched his campaign friday in faizabad four 
miles down the road from ayodhya with an accusation that unnamed 
opposition parties were fanning communal feelings for their 
vested political interests 
communalism is the catchword indian politicians and news 
media use for religious strife in an effort to avoid singling out 
specific faiths or being perceived as taking sides 
back in new delhi singh of the opposition national front 
coalition was accusing gandhis congress party of trying to turn 
ayodhya into a flashpoint of communal violence 
many participants in saturdays sendoff of the convoy said they 
would vote for the bharatiya janata party this rightwing hindu 
party is not a member of the national front but has been making 
deals with the front for a share of the parliament seats to be 
determined in the elections being conducted nov 22 24 and 26 
the young men making the trip as well as older ones encouraging 
them vowed that the journey would be peaceful unless the 
mohammedans started something or the government failed to 
maintain order 
in late october similar ram shila or ram brick 
processions precipitated several days of hindumoslem clashes in 
bihar state at least 201 people died by official count which does 
not specify the victims religions 
indian newspapers have given indications that many perhaps 
most of the victims were moslems when the dead and wounded have 
been identified the names have usually been islamic 
in addition to the october deaths about 80 other people have 
been killed in bihar and four other states since august when plans 
were announced to build the temple at ayodhya revered by hindus as 
rams birthplace 
the new delhi convoy of trucks and buses with their load of 
5045 bricks and about 300 men is to pass through towns with 
sizeable moslem populations 
what can we say about trouble asked rk mathur a 
40yearold music teacher attired in blue denim jeans and jacket 
we are going on our mission 
manesh gupta a 19yearold photographer added if we die it 
is no problem 100 percent no problem

one year after president bush defeated michael dukakis in an 
election that sometimes resembled a national referendum on willie 
horton prison furloughs are alive and well and keeping a low 
profile 
in last years presidential campaign bush ridiculed the 
massachusetts governor for allowing convicted murderer horton out 
on a furlough horton raped a woman while free 
we dont let murderers out on vacation to terrorize innocent 
people bush said 
true to his word bush has asked the federal bureau of prisons 
to further restrict the types of federal prisoners who can qualify 
for a furlough but few state prison systems have changed their 
furlough policies and prison officials are almost unanimous in 
their insistence that furloughs make good sense many states limit 
them to lessviolent criminals however 
its a nonissue said jeffrey washington a spokesman for 
the american correctional association they worked for years and 
theyll continue to work and the only reason they came up in 1988 
was because of the election 
in most states furloughs are limited to minimumsecurity 
inmates nearing the end of their terms they usually have a twofold 
purpose to allow inmates to reestablish ties with their families 
and to allow them to hunt for jobs 
most states also allow inmates out for family emergencies 
mainly funerals but violent felons are typically accompanied by 
guards and sometimes have to attend funerals in handcuffs 
few states have furlough programs similar to the one 
massachusetts adopted under a dukakis predecessor that allowed 
horton who was serving life without parole to leave prison on a 
weekend pass in 1986 horton fled and didnt resurface until he 
was arrested for assault and rape the next year in maryland 
as a result of the horton case dukakis agreed to stop giving 
furloughs to inmates serving life sentences but that didnt stop 
bush from seizing on the case as a campaign issue 
for months bush used the issue to paint dukakis as soft on 
crime and made it the theme of a controversial television 
commercial that showed inmates parading through a revolving prison 
gate 
during the campaign dukakis pointed out that the reagan 
administration had furloughed thousands of federal prisoners that 
has continued under bush 
however the federal bureau of prisons has a policy of generally 
denying furloughs to anyone convicted of a violent crime and 
bureau spokesman greg bogdan said bush has ordered that policy 
extended to include anyone convicted of drug distribution or 
illegal firearms charges 
when the new policy goes into effect possibly by the end of 
this year it should have a significant impact on the number of 
federal furloughs bogdan said 
furloughs have remained an issue in a few states although not 
necessarily because of the presidential campaign 
in indiana for instance furloughs became a major issue earlier 
this year when an inmate on furlough was arrested for beating his 
former wife to death alan l matheney was serving an eightyear 
term for beating lisa m bianco two years after their divorce and 
had expressed continued hostility toward her authorities said 
bianco wasnt even warned that her former husband was getting an 
eighthour pass 
in the wake of that killing the indiana furlough program was 
suspended for about a month and then reinstated with more stringent 
guidelines cutting the number of participants by nearly twothirds 
in maryland furlough and workrelease programs at the patuxent 
institution a psychiatric center were suspended after a triple 
murderer was furloughed and a convicted rapist was charged with 
rape while on work release the work release program was later 
resumed after each participant was reevaluated a similar review 
of the furlough program is under way 
the horton case did have reverberations in texas where the 
furlough policy was similar to massachusetts the states criminal 
justice board voted last month to stop furloughs for inmates 
convicted of homicides in crimes of passion 
but in most states the uproar over furloughs died with the 
dukakis campaign and in one state north dakota the furlough 
program was actually expanded 
north dakotas new temporary meritorious leave program was 
instituted last november while the presidential campaign was still 
fresh in voters minds under it inmates in the nations smallest 
prison system are being furloughed at twice the previous rate 
every single one has been successful warden tom powers 
said we feel pretty good about that program and we feel pretty 
good that we had the courage to do that when politically maybe 
that wasnt the most astute thinking

hundreds of thousands of greeks left the 
capital for their hometowns to vote sunday in the second national 
elections in five months polls indicated no party would win a 
majority 
the leader in opinion polls the conservative new democracy 
party was hoping for its first clearcut parliamentary victory 
since it lost to the socialists led by former premier andreas 
papandreou in 1981 
but the socialists and another party the communistled 
coalition of the left and progress were expected to get a sizeable 
share of the vote and possibly deny new democracy a majority 
in such a case difficult negotiations would open among the 
three main parties which have widely differing political views 
some feared the country could face several more months of political 
gridlock 
the day before the election greeks followed the tradition of 
returning to the towns where they grew up to vote police said 
about 500000 people had left the capital of nearly 4 million 
people by noon and that 22 people had died in traffic accidents 
nationwide 
extra airline flights were scheduled and ships ferried voters to 
the islands voting is compulsory 
campaigning ended friday night to allow voters the usual day 
of reflection before balloting 
in the last national elections in june new democracy finished 
first but failed to gain a majority of the 300 seats in the 
onechamber parliament 
the conservatives formed an unprecedented alliance with the 
communistled coalition to end papandreous 8yearold government 
the alliance assigned itself a mandate of investigating charges 
of corruption in the former government and it resigned in early 
october after indicting the charismatic papandreou and five former 
ministers 
papandreou 70 was indicted on charges of authorizing 
widespread telephone wiretaps while in office and of complicity in 
the embezzling of 210 million from a private bank 
the leftright alliance did not address foreign policy issues 
and left many other major governmental issues on the back burner 
where they might stay for several more months if sundays elections 
produce no clear winner 
the communistled coalition has said it will not work again with 
the conservatives and will only form a coalition with papandreous 
panhellenic socialist movement if papandreou resigns as head of the 
party he created 
papandreou who became famous for his criticism of the united 
states and support for third world causes has said he will not 
resign the former premier still enjoys considerable support for 
the leftist domestic programs he introduced 
the respected eurodim polling firm released results friday 
showing a slight increase in support for new democracy and 
papandreous party known as pasok since the june elections 
the poll indicated new democracy would get 46 percent of the 
vote and pasok about 40 percent with the rest going to the 
coalition smaller parties and independents 
it showed the coalition dropping slightly from the 13 percent it 
gained in june 
the simple proportional voting system makes it difficult for 
large parties to gain an overall majority but helps small parties 
enter parliament 
the indications that new democracy might fall just short of its 
target raised the possibility of yet another set of elections 
but the partys leader constantine mitsotakis told the flash 
commercial radio station friday he would try to form a government 
even if deprived of a majority he did not indicate whose support 
he would draw on 
mitsotakis 71 advocates closer ties with the west and a 
smaller government role in the economy

as the political fever over abortion rises 
the head of the federal department most affected is staying out of 
sight 
louis sullivan the secretary of the department of health and 
human services who stumbled into washington politics over the 
issue has kept a low public profile in the abortion debate 
last week sullivan quietly signed off on his chief health 
officials recommendation to extend indefinitely a ban on federally 
funded research using fetal tissue from intentional abortions 
earlier in the debate over liberalized rules for medicaid 
abortions approved by congress but vetoed by president bush 
sullivans only involvement was to write members of congress 
outlining the administrations opposition according to his staff 
he flexed his muscle recently to win assurances from the white 
house that an abortion litmus test would not be applied to 
candidates for top medical jobs in the department and passed that 
word to the medical community in a speech last weekend 
some say sullivan is better off steering clear of the abortion 
issue 
if he winds up letting the white house take the lead in 
forming consistent prolife positions he will largely escape 
the controversy and be able to focus on his own issues said kate 
obeirne deputy director of domestic policy studies at the 
heritage foundation a conservative think tank 
others say his low profile may be evidence that his early 
waffling on abortion has not been forgotten and that he is being 
watched closely by righttolife conservatives 
the question is how hobbled he will be by the far right 
said a lobbyist who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
a physician and the only black in bushs cabinet sullivan has 
concentrated on improving the health of pregnant women infants and 
minorities he often says the challenge of bushs pledge for a 
kinder gentler nation will be met by his department 
hes making slow steady progress but i dont see any 
indication that hes found his feet said stuart butler director 
of domestic policy studies at the heritage foundation 
theres still no sign of a clear agenda butler said adding 
that unless sullivan finds his stride within the next six months 
he will lose an opportunity to carve out his own policy strategy 
there are pressures developing that will set the agenda for him 
if he doesnt do it himself 
some analysts say sullivan has done little more than tinker 
around the edges of a massive health care problem medical costs 
are skyrocketing and soaking up more and more of the federal 
budget while access to medical services for the poor is being 
curtailed to cover the shortfalls meanwhile an estimated 35 
million americans lack any kind of health insurance 
hampering any administration efforts in this area many say is 
that 10 months into the bush administration still no one has been 
nominated to head the health care finance administration which 
oversees medicare and medicaid 
sullivan was a political novice when he came to washington from 
a small predominantly black medical college in atlanta that he 
served as founding president 
stuart rothenberg a political analyst with the conservative 
free congress foundation said he came in as an outsider and 
hes still an outsider and hell only be effective when he makes 
that jump 
at a closeddoor breakfast meeting with about 20 republican 
house members and staffers last summer sullivan read verbatim from 
a prepared text giving an overview of the health care problems in 
the country 
we wanted real nitty gritty stuff rep jack buechner 
rmo complained later we didnt want the rotary club speech 
some say sullivan is spreading himself too thin by spending so 
much time as many as 10 days in one month on official business 
outside washington 
youre not going to change national policy in butte montana 
or for that matter at the illinois medical association meeting 
buechner said 
sullivan declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this 
article 
asked about the criticisms hhs spokeswoman kay james said 
sullivan sees his job as one of taking the health messages out to 
the grass roots 
hes carving out a place for himself hes exerting himself in 
policy debates inside the administration and on capitol hill and 
he is being listened to she said 
late in the debate over medicare catastrophic illness benefits 
with the program threatened with repeal sullivan broke from the 
handsoff approach of the white house to declare support for a 
proposal that would keep the core benefits intact 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
the action substantially strengthened sullivans credibility on 
capitol hill it takes a while but hes learning and hes being 
educated in the process 
as for abortion it is not an issue with which sullivan is 
entirely comfortable and the administration does not want to 
reopen any wounds said michael schwartz a resident fellow in 
social policy at the free congress foundation 
while there is some dispute on how visible a cabinet secretary 
should be on as controversial an issue as abortion henry aaron a 
senior fellow at the liberal brookings institution and a former 
official in the department of health education and welfare during 
the carter years said its hard to see that its not a central 
policy concern for the person who is hhs secretary 
shortly after he was chosen for the job by longtime friend 
george bush sullivan got into trouble with the political right by 
telling an atlanta newspaper he favored a womens right to 
abortion soon afterward he told a senator he favored the supreme 
courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
though he quickly retreated both times the result was the 
appointment of some solidly antiabortion top aides to work 
alongside him 
among the first of the hhs appointees were constance horner as 
undersecretary a loyal conservative from the reagan 
administration james a former public affairs official for the 
national right to life committee as assistant secretary for public 
affairs and james mason former head of the centers for disease 
control in atlanta whose antiabortion stance was well known as 
assistant secretary for health mason oversees the public health 
service which includes the cdc the national institutes for health 
and the food and drug administration 
sullivans choices to head the departments welfare agency and 
the health care financing administration both ran into conservative 
opposition and both candidates eventually withdrew their names 
some say the lack of assistant secretaries at those agencies and 
others is hampering sullivans ability to set a policy agenda 
you get a sense of a real vacuum in the welfare area said 
bob greenstein of the center on budget and policy priorities 
some lay the blame for the slow pace of appointments at bushs 
doorstep but others say it also suggests sullivans lack of clout 
with the white house and his inexperience in washington politics 
its a different kind of politics raising money for a medical 
school than trying to build a policy agenda and fight for it within 
an administration that like other administrations is torn 20 
different ways with competing interests said political analyst 
rothenberg 
sullivan has been talking to experts and analysts outside the 
government about potential initiatives several analysts said and 
they said he is positioning himself to propose some major new 
programs 
we have not seen his agenda but i think we are going to

institute for public policy research

the united states has more expresidents now 
than at any time since 1861 and with the expanding human life 
span this abundance of former chief executives is likely to 
persist 
yet no mechanism or institution exists to tap the collective 
resource of these retired officials most of whom return to private 
life at a relatively young age and with a wealth of experience of 
which few can boast 
ronald reagan is back from a lucrative visit to japan richard 
nixon just conducted his sixth nostalgia pilgrimage to china jimmy 
carter is busy reconciling rebels and governments and gerald ford 
divides his time between the golf course and boardrooms of several 
large companies 
the united states is one of few western democracies where former 
leaders are relegated to such retirement 
its symptomatic of american culture said barbara 
kellerman a political science professor and dean of graduate 
studies at fairleigh dickinson university 
when someones star has descended we tend to lose interest in 
them she said but its an inordinate waste that such 
collective experience is lost 
in parliamentary systems former prime ministers generally 
resume their seats in the legislature and continue to play a role 
in their countries political scenes 
in britain theres the house of lords which serves as an 
advisory chamber to the house of commons where legislation is 
enacted the upper house whose doors were once open only to 
hereditary peers has evolved into a chamber of meritorious service 
which also accords membership to distinguished actors writers and 
other professionals 
there have been several proposals to establish a similar 
advisory body in the united states sort of a council of elders 
which would make use of the talents of expresidents and other 
elected officials a suggestion was even floated to make former 
presidents nonvoting members of the senate 
but none of these ideas ever left the rarified air of academe 
the four expresidents have never acted in unison and the only 
visible joint action taken by carter ford and nixon was their 1981 
trip to cairo for the funeral of the assassinated egyptian 
president anwar sadat 
carter and ford have teamed up on several projects including 
formulation of a list of recommendations to president bush on 
reducing the countrys budget deficit and other top national 
priorities 
the two former leaders also traveled to panama to monitor the 
may 7 elections which were widely believed to have been rigged by 
panamanian gen manuel noriega but ford left before the balloting 
citing a previous commitment 
earlier former presidents seem to have been more prominent in 
public life after retirement 
dwight eisenhowers advice was sought often by two of his 
successors john f kennedy and lyndon johnson eisenhower received 
regular intelligence briefings from the cia 
herbert hoover who left the presidency in 1933 with a dismal 
image from his handling of the economic depression was honorably 
reinstated into public life in the late 1940s by thenpresident 
harry truman hoover headed two commissions on reforming the 
structure of the federal government and conducted trumans postwar 
food relief operations 
carter also left office in defeat with an image of weakness and 
indecisiveness over the handling of the american hostages held by 
iranian extremists in tehran 
yet in recent years carter has undertaken numerous domestic and 
foreign policy projects leading many scholars to say carter 
performed better as an expresident than when he lived at the white 
house 
carter appears to have has fared better under bush than under 
reagan who had defeated carters bid for reelection carters 
recent mediation of peace talks between eritrean rebels and the 
ethiopian government earned him plaudits from the administration 
carter kept the state department closely informed of the progress 
officials said 
the reagan administration was impatient with carter over his 
views on nicaragua and panama which were far more liberal than 
the conservative reagan ideology said daniel franklin a political 
scientist at colgate university 
reagan reportedly ordered the cia to stop the regular briefings 
for carter and denied him access to other official events franklin 
said 
reagan did confer privately with nixon whose ideology was more 
palatable to him than carters but generally kept him at a 
distance to avoid being linked with the president who was forced to 
resign by the watergate scandal nixons books on foreign policy 
were required reading at reagans national security council 
bush has rarely conferred with reagan despite pronouncements 
after his election that he owed everything to his predecessor 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan had reported to 
bush by telephone this week about his trip to japan 
bush also barely paid any attention to the carterford 
recommendations said ford adding that he was somewhat 
disappointed in the lack of response 
but ford in a recent speech to schoolchildren rejected the 
idea of a formal structure to make use of expresidents let 
expresidents decide what interest to pursue what contributions to 
make on their own 
carter is returning to washington this weekend for a reunion 
sunday with his vice president walter mondale and dozens of other 
officials from his administration on monday carter will 
participate in a forum on resolving conflicts around the world

despite 20 years of prodding the pentagon 
still buys too few commercially available products and ends up 
paying more than necessary for everything from food to automotive 
parts a congressional study says 
the department of defense too often orders products exclusively 
for military use instead of purchasing them off the shelf said the 
report by the senate governmental affairs subcommittee on oversight 
of government management chaired by sen carl levin dmich 
the process of designing a unique product from scratch can be 
extremely expensive particularly when the product is purchased in 
limited quantities the report said 
moreover the pentagons quality standards justifiably 
stringent for weapons systems and other items developed solely for 
the military are often unnecessary for products already in common 
use the report said 
as a result there are numerous examples of extraordinary 
prices charged to the government for ordinary products from the 
640 toilet seat to the 7622 coffee maker it said 
pentagon spokesman david thomas said friday night he was not 
familiar with the report and could not comment 
levin sponsored a provision in the pending 1990 defense 
appropriations bill to streamline requirements for private sector 
contractors wishing to sell to the pentagon he said the 
subcommittees probe showed the pentagon had not done enough to 
implement a 1986 congressional requirement to remove impediments to 
greater use of commercial products 
implementing the reports proposals he said would go a long 
way to streamline the federal procurement system and save taxpayer 
dollars levin said 
a commission in 1972 first urged the pentagon to make greater 
use of commercial products a recommendation echoed by numerous 
subsequent studies thenpresident reagan issued an executive order 
to that effect in 1982 
in its 1986 report on defense management the packard commission 
said the pentagon should develop custommade products only when 
those commercially available are clearly inadequate to meet 
military requirements 
the pentagon habitually overstates requirements for products it 
uses and does so in such exacting detail that many contractors 
dont even submit bids the report said 
for example the military demanded that 5cent oring seals for 
common brake parts be packaged in an airtight box worth 2 said 
robert rossow of midland brake inc based in owosso mich 
gregory saunders the pentagons assistant for commercial 
acquisition testified at a june 1 hearing that detailed 
specifications are intended to weed out shoddy products and 
flybynight operators 
the report makes 16 recommendations to the pentagon some of 
which would be required under the provision levin inserted into the 
defense appropriations bill a joint conference committee approved 
the bill last week it still faces house and seante floor votes 
and if passed it goes to president bush for his signature 
among the recommendations 
before signing a contract to develop a new product conduct a 
cost analysis and make sure no suitable commercial product is 
available 
change regulations that make unnecessary demands on contractors 
and otherwise discourage use of acceptable commercial products 
use alternative approaches to quality assurance such as 
commercial warranties and rewarding contractors with a proven 
record of quality performance 
establish a training program to help military procurement 
officials identify worthy commercial products

supporters of a plan to salvage vestiges of 
medicares catastrophic illness plan say theyre gaining ground as 
congress weighs competing proposals to repeal the program or scale 
it back dramatically 
the verdict is anxiously awaited by 33 million elderly and 
disabled americans whose medicare costs and coverage for next year 
remain undecided with less than two months left in 1989 
pushed into retreat by a firestorm of protests from senior 
citizens who said the catastrophic programs costs outweighed its 
benefits the house in early october voted to scrap the program 
and the senate to preserve only limited benefits 
since then work toward a compromise acceptable to both chambers 
has been sidetracked by the protracted debate over deficit 
reduction legislation and efforts to reduce the capital gains tax 
legislators hope to break the logjam this week and attach a 
catastrophic compromise to a crucial debtlimit extension requiring 
swift approval 
the medicare catastrophic coverage act enacted last year 
offers elderly and disabled americans expanded coverage against the 
high costs of prolonged illness with the benefits being phased in 
over several years 
the program is paid for by higher medicare premiums on all but 
the poorest beneficiaries and a surtax that affects the 40 percent 
of elderly americans who pay more than 150 a year in income tax 
the surtax which is capped at 800 a person for the wealthiest 
seniors this year has been the focal point of senior citizen 
protests 
sen john mccain rariz has major senior citizen groups 
backing his senatepassed plan to wipe out the surtax cancel new 
drug and doctor benefits and preserve expanded hospitalization 
coverage and a few other benefits 
mccain said there is a good chance congress will preserve 
vestiges of the program while eliminating the obvious object of 
the anger the surtax he said there is growing support among 
house members for the senates proposal 
one of the key advocates of repeal in the house rep bill 
archer rtexas has indicated he could accept a compromise that 
continues some benefits so long as the surtax is eliminated 
but another sponsor of the repeal plan rep brian donnelly 
dmass still believes congress should go back to square one and 
begin again said spokesman gary galanis 
john rother legislative director for the american association 
of retired persons which fought unsuccessfully to retain the full 
catastrophic program expressed hope that as people get a little 
more rational and a little less emotional they will chose the 
scaleddown program over outright repeal 
the national association of retired federal employees a major 
critic of the surtax is supporting the mccain plan but there 
wont be any great sorrow among its members if the whole package 
is repealed said spokesman denis harrington 
the uncertainty over the future of the program has left the 
government and private insurers unable to gear up for whatever 
benefits and premiums they will be administering in just a few 
months 
what weve had to do is continue to operate under the current 
law until and if any change takes place said spokesman dennis 
siebert at the health care financing administration which 
administers medicare 
linda jenckes of the health insurance association of america 
told a house subcommittee last week that with 1990 just two 
months away companies are anxiously awaiting a final outcome 
so they can adjust benefits and rates on medigap policies that 
supplement medicare coverage 
jenckes said medigap prices were likely to rise 712 percent in 
1990 due to rising health costs even if the catastrophic package 
was untouched but the increases can be expected to average 1520 
percent if the mccain plan passes and 2025 percent if congress 
repeals the whole program 
some advocates for the elderly have expressed concern that 
medigap rates will rise even more sharply and that companies will 
use the repeal of catastrophic benefits as an excuse to boost 
prices more than is justified

when a robber shot a pregnant suburban woman to 
death and wounded her husband as they went home from a childbirth 
class the horror of the crime riveted residents lawmakers and 
activists 
but is boston becoming more dangerous the statistics and local 
officials say no 
boston is one of the safest cities in the country said city 
councilor david scondras the reality is that we are a 
classsegregated society that focuses on the middle and 
uppermiddle class 
carol stuart 30 a lawyer who was seven months pregnant was 
shot in the head by a man who held up the couple in their car oct 
23 near a hospital in the roxbury section 
the drama of rescuers attempts to find the couple 
taperecorded by the emergency phone system drew national 
attention stuarts husband called police on his car telephone and 
desperately tried to tell them where he was during the lengthy 
exchange stuart watched his wifes life ebb away 
shes still gurgling he said theres a busy street up 
ahead ahh man i cant see where i am but later as rescuers 
frantically tried to find them stuart said oh man it hurts 
and my wife has stopped gurgling shes stopped breathing 
police were able to finally locate the couple from the sound of 
police sirens coming through the open cellular telephone after 
stuart blacked out 
mrs stuart died after the couples son was delivered by 
caesarean section her husband and son survived stuart was listed 
in stable condition saturday at boston city hospital brigham and 
womens hospital would not disclose the babys condition 
police have no suspect in the shooting officials said 
with this case theres kind of an awakening that says oh 
dear its real said scondras 
it is especially real in the inner city in boston as a whole 
the homicide rate is actually down for the year but in the 
roxbury mattapan and dorchester sections of the city crime is up 
there have been close to 200 shootings in two months there up 33 
percent the shootings are a byproduct of an increase in gang 
activity police say 
the stuart killing brought the spotlight back to an area that 
last made major headlines when a child tiffany moore was killed 
last year by an errant shot from a gang member while she was 
sitting on a mailbox outside her mothers home 
georgette watson a roxbury community activist who started the 
dropadime program to get people to report crimes said boston 
as a whole is ok the bulk of the crime is just here 
youngsters in those areas are especially fearful 
jennifer everette an eighthgrader from dorchester wrote in a 
recent writing exercise after the stuart shooting dear god i 
wish my neighborhood was a beautiful place where i could walk the 
street without being scared of being caught in a crossfire 
black activists say it took the killing of a white suburbanite 
to draw some attention to the situation 
i was surprised that it made the national news said wornie 
reed director of the william monroe trotter institute a think 
tank at the university of massachusetts in boston where black 
scholars examine black issues i think if that had been a black 
woman who lived in the area it wouldnt have brought that much 
attention 
statistics show the number of shootings and murders overall in 
boston has remained almost the same this year from january through 
sept 30 there were 782 shootings last year during the same 
period there were 781 homicides totaled 82 so far this year 
compared with 84 murders by this time last year 
in all of 1988 boston had 95 homicides out of a population of 
620000 which put it at 19th among major cities in the rate of 
homicide by comparison st louis with a population of 425000 
had 140 homicides according to fbi statistics newark nj with 
a population of 319000 had 115 homicides 
but police say more attention is being paid to crimes this year 
last year the media didnt care about every shooting now they 
do said boston police spokeswoman jill reilly 
nonetheless some crimes get more attention than others 
james moody a 29yearold black man shot to death in boston 
just three hours after carol stuart made the news only to 
illustrate the relative anonymity of routine deaths among 
minorities here 
watson said that she and other roxbury leaders conducted a 
survey to find out if people knew about both the moody and stuart 
murders almost everyone had detailed knowledge of the stuart case 
but few knew anything about moody who was coming home from work at 
the time he was fatally shot in the head

a former judge who was uncovered as a 
crooked lawyer after he disappeared from home and lived for months 
under an assumed name was once again a fugitive saturday this time 
from prison 
the minimumsecurity federal prison camp at eglin air force base 
in florida declared paul w ottinger 74 an escapee late friday 
said john oury associate warden 
ottinger had just completed the federal prison time he was 
required to serve out of a 5year sentence he received oct 21 
1987 in us district court in baltimore on charges of bank and 
mail fraud 
but he failed to report as scheduled to be turned over to 
maryland authorities so he could be taken to serve the rest of a 
concurrent 8year state sentence 
prisoners at the unfenced eglin prison camp near fort walton 
beach fla on the gulf of mexico live in unlocked dormitories 
ottinger who was a county circuit judge in hagerstown from 1971 
to 1977 was last seen at the prison camp at 6 am wearing gray 
sweat clothes and tennis shoes oury said he was still missing as 
of saturday morning officials said 
ottinger confessed in federal and state courts to bilking 
several clients of his law practice out of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars of insurance settlements and funds from estates 
ottinger was depicted in court as a heavy drinker and compulsive 
gambler a psychological study indicated ottingers problems 
stemmed from a compulsive nature he acquired to help him rise above 
his poor rural tennessee background 
the fraud case surfaced in january 1987 when he mysteriously 
disappeared from his hagerstown home 
fbi agents arrested ottinger three months later near york pa 
where he was living under the name of h edwin robinson who died 
in 1921 at the age of 7 ottinger had dyed his hair to disguise his 
identity and was trying to pass himself off as a retired ohio 
schoolteacher

forgery in somerset county circuit court judge lloyd l simpkins 
ordered him to pay 320000 in restitution to legal clients he 
defrauded 
larry nathans an assistant federal public defender said friday 
he had been doing some legal work on ottingers behalf and talked 
with him regularly 
i hope hes ok nathans said adding he did not know 
anything about the escape asked by the baltimore sun if ottinger 
had ever talked about not wanting to serve his state sentence 
nathans replied i cant imagine he was looking forward to coming 
back who wants to go into a state prison

when youths exposed to a lifestyle of innercity 
crime chronicle their feelings they say things like i never 
know when i step out of my house what is going to happen 
every night i hear gunshots around my way im surrounded by 
gangs said johanna graves a high school senior i go out if i 
need something but not just to hang out said jerome white 15 
these are the kids living the everyday life of innocents in the 
citys hub of violence 
their stories came pouring out when teachers at the mission 
church high school in bostons roxbury section encouraged students 
to write and talk about their fears of increasing violence in the 
inner city 
after the recent killing of a pregnant suburban woman in their 
neighborhood stirred national headlines more than 70 students 
wrote prayers and letters to senators and local newspaper editors 
appealing for an end to the violence 
dear senator i live in roxbury and there is violence 
everyday with guns wrote silletta davis an 11thgrader i 
dont feel safe anymore because i never know when i step out of 
my house what is going to happen 
the 240 students at the school consisting of grades seven 
through 12 were read davis letter last wednesday at an assembly 
to give them a chance to talk about what their neighborhoods have 
become said andre ravenelle assistant principal at the parochial 
school 
i just found out yesterday that someone deals drugs on my 
corner said robert alexander a 17yearold senior from 
dorchester i saw it some woman drove up and she gave this guy 
some money he gave her something and the sad thing is there were 
three kids in the car said alexander who calls his community 
drugchester 
the idea to get students to express themselves about crime came 
from the violence prevention project based at boston city hospital 
said sister patrice garrity the schools principal the project 
was incorporated into a christian lifestyle curriculum which helps 
students learn to handle anger when relating to one another she 
said 
most students live in mattapan dorchester jamaica plain and 
roxbury sections in which nearly 200 shootings have been reported 
since sept 1 
but some of the students said they believe the good side of the 
neighborhoods and its people is never mentioned and the violence 
has led every black youth to be considered a criminal 
the police see you as a bad guy because you live in orchard 
park a housing project in roxbury said james hendrick a senior 
who wants to become a police officer the police harass me 
everyday theyre supposed to serve and protect but instead they 
stop and harass it doesnt pay to be a positive black male 
hendrick 18 who wrote to his senator asking for tougher gun 
control laws said positive youths like his classmates should get 
more attention to counter the violence

iran marked the 10th anniversary of the 
seizure of the us embassy on saturday by opening the compound to 
the public and displaying seven alleged cia spies most iranians 
ignored the event 
the apparent disinterest was a blow to radicals who hoped to use 
the occasion to stir up antiamerican passion it was a victory for 
president hashemi rafsanjani who wants to improve irans relations 
with the west and end his countrys isolation 
about 10000 to 15000 people gathered outside the onetime us 
embassy in tehran which was stormed by militant students nov 
4 1979 for 444 days 52 american diplomats and embassy personnel 
were held hostage there 
even routine friday prayer gatherings attract more people than 
the rally crowds at previous antius rallies have been estimated 
at more than 1 million 
the main speaker was former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi rafsanjanis main rival it was his first public 
appearance since he was dropped by rafsanjani when he formed his 
new cabinet in august 
mohtashemi repeatedly referred to the animosity the late founder 
of the islamic republic ayatollah ruhollah khomeini harbored 
toward the united states khomeini died on june 3 
ten years ago today when the students following the imams 
khomeinis line seized the den of spies the whole world marveled 
that the face of america was pushed in the mud mohtashemi said 
he noted that khomeini was against any rapprochement with the 
bloodsucker government of the united states 
the crowd often interrupted to shout death to america and 
death to israel 
they waved lifesize portraits of khomeini and his successor as 
supreme leader of the islamic republic ayatollah ali khamenei 
during a march to the embassy from tehran university a mile 
away some students burned an effigy of uncle sam and about 160 
us flags some with skulls in place of stars 
banners vowing to fight the us until the last drop of our 
blood hung from maple trees surrounding the compound which now 
is used as a training base for young revolutionary guards 
the fashionable talegani avenue in front of the embassy was 
festooned with slogans saying no relations with the united 
states and america is the top enemy of the worlds oppressed 
and deprived people 
the government apparently had been trying to keep anniversary 
ceremonies as low key as possible 
the official islamic republic news agency reported that 
rafsanjani met officials involved in rebuilding the southern city 
of khorramshahr damaged in the eightyear war with iraq and told 
them iranians energy must be used for reconstruction among 
the most effective ways of combatting arrogance an iranian 
euphemisim for the united states 
the embassy takeover led to the cutting of usiranian ties and 
the freezing of billions of dollars in iranian assets in the united 
states 
the hostages were finally released jan 20 1981 the day jimmy 
carter left office and ronald reagan was sworn in as president the 
crisis was resolved when the united states pledged not to interfere 
in irans internal affairs and the countries established a 
framework for settling billions of dollars in claims against each 
other 
iran has since demanded the unfreezing of its assets in return 
for its help in freeing 18 westerners including eight americans 
held hostage mostly by proiranian groups in lebanon 
the seven alleged cia spies appeared at a news conference in a 
corrugated iron hut next to the main embassy building 
they said they were recruited by the central intelligence agency 
while abroad 
one of the alleged agents bahman aqaei said he was recruited 
while working at the iranian embassy in new delhi india 
aqaei the groups spokesman said they had been trained in 
espionage techniques and promised as much as 1200 a month a 
small fortune in economically troubled iran but never received any 
money 
he claimed he was recruited by an american embassy official who 
put him in contact with a dissident iranian group which he did not 
identify others said they were recruited in west germany and 
turkey 
bearded young men cradling ak47 automatic rifles in their arms 
steered the media into the compound 
young revolutionary guards could be seen through the windows of 
the main building attending classes others played volleyball in a 
field in the center of the compound 
it was the first time the complex had been opened to the public 
among several displays was a grisly reproduction of the shooting 
down of an iran air passenger jet by the us missile cruiser 
vincennes on july 3 1988 all 290 people aboard died 
us officials say the cruiser which was in action against 
iranian gunboats in the persian gulf mistook the airliner for an 
attacking jet fighter 
photographs of crash victims were scattered among a pile of 
debris of broken aircraft parts wax figures in bloody clothes 
representing the victims were spread around some were missing 
heads or limbs

the novelty of a mayoral campaign between two 
black candidates is being overshadowed by something more familiar 
to cleveland voters rough tough hardball politics 
city council president george forbes and state sen michael 
white have pulled no punches in a campaign filled with allegations 
of wife beating strongarm tactics and name calling former mayor 
dennis kucinich says thats what clevelanders expect 
cleveland politics is not high tea said kucinich who 
narrowly survived a recall attempt during his own tumultuous term 
as mayor in the 1970s its a rock em sock em knockemout 
type of politics in the finest tradition of america and if it was 
anything different people here would be bored and wouldnt vote 
forbes president of city council since 1973 wants voters to 
recognize his role in the citys recovery from its december 1978 
default on 14 million in loans to six banks the default the 
first by a major american city since the great depression wreaked 
havoc on the citys credit rating and its image 
white a city councilman at the time of the default and a state 
senator since 1984 has said he can unify the city which has 
almost equal numbers of black and white residents 
those messages however have been clouded at times by 
allegations that white is a slumlord who beat his two previous 
wives and that forbes is an oldstyle city boss who has used public 
office for personal gain 
the two democrats emerged from a field of five candidates the 
other three of them white in an oct 3 nonpartisan primary 
forbes placed first with 37 percent of the vote white was second 
with 25 percent 
since then a poll by clevelands major newspaper the plain 
dealer showed white leading forbes by 46 percent to 27 percent 
the poll of 802 registered voters was conducted oct 1619 and had 
a margin of sampling error of 35 percentage points 
the winner of tuesdays general election will become clevelands 
first black mayor since carl stokes now a municipal judge won the 
office and served as the first black mayor of a large american city 
from 196771 
mayor george voinovich a popular lowkey republican is 
leaving office after three terms to seek the gop nomination for 
governor 
forbes a 59yearold lawyer is keenly aware of the 
significance of two black candidates seeking the citys top job 
this city has moved forward by leaps and bounds he said in 
a recent televised debate no one could have even imagined that 
two black men could be running for mayor in a city that is almost 
divided equally between black and white 
white 38 holder of a masters degree in public administration 
has played down the racial significance he has stressed his 
commitment to unifying the citys primarily black east side and 
white west side and has depicted the election as a battle between 
two competing philosophies 
one philosophy has sought to lead by divide and conquer by 
pitting east against west and black against white the other 
philosophy is that it is time for us to come together as a city 
forbes stresses his close ties with voinovich over the past 10 
years but voters also remember less flattering highlights of that 
decade forbes cursing at a reporter who questioned him about a 
delinquent water bill or throwing a chair at a city councilman 
i have said there have been things i have done that i wish i 
had not done there have been some things i have said that i wish i 
had not said i apologize about that he said 
forbes also has refused to make his income tax filings public 
despite reports linking his law firm to business deals with the 
city while he was city council president he has denied using his 
position for private gain 
white who has been married three times has had to answer 
accusations that he beat his first two wives one report was based 
on court documents and the other on remarks by his second wife 
divorce is not a very pretty thing white said there have 
been quite frankly times where there have been heated exchanges 
i am neither an abuser nor a beater of women i never beat my 
exwives 
forbes has called white a slumlord alleging that city housing 
inspection records show that white owns seven properties that 
together have some 200 code violations white has said inspections 
of the properties during the mayoral campaign were politically 
motivated

the education minister said saturday he will ask a 
constitutional panel to decide whether moslem schoolgirls can wear 
their traditional head coverings to class 
a nationwide debate has raged since three girls at a school in 
creil 40 miles north of paris decided in october to wear the 
traditional hijab that covers hair ears and neck the 
principal did not allow them to attend class 
critics of the headdresses say they violate the traditional 
separation of church and state 
education minister lionel jospin said he would ask frances 
council of state on monday to rule on the issue its opinion would 
be advisory and jospin said it would form the basis for a 
wideranging national discussion of the issue 
in a statement jospin recalled that he had announced his 
position oct 26 in the national assembly that school authorities 
should try to discuss the issue with parents and students to try to 
persuade them to respect the secularity of the school by taking 
the headscarves off 
but he said that if persuasion failed the girls must be allowed 
to stay in class even with the scarves 
the council of state makes final rulings on constitutional 
issues in france but also oversees the operations of government 
agencies and can be asked for advice on any topic the government 
chooses 
the issue of wearing religious symbols in school has been 
emotionally charged since the 19th century when advocates of a 
secular school system free from influence of the dominant roman 
catholic church won a bitter fight 
islam is now the secondlargest religion in france with more 
than 3 million moslems in a population of 55 million 
as the dispute swelled in recent weeks president francois 
mitterrands wife danielle came out in favor of allowing the 
students to wear scarves 
a poll by the ipsos public opinion firm made public saturday by 
the newsmagazine le point found only 26 percent of those questioned 
agreed with mrs mitterrand and 63 percent were opposed the rest 
had no opinion or declined to answer 
in nice about 1500 people attended a march called saturday by 
the extremeright national front to protest what it calls the 
islamization of france shouting such slogans as out with the 
chador and scarves in the closet

president wojciech jaruzelskis daughter 
says she posed for magazine photos in a nightgown and on a bearskin 
rug in an attempt to humanize her fathers image but now the 
experience has left her bitter 
even as reform and a new openness sweep poland the pictures in 
paris match of monika jaruzelska as the feminine form of the 
surname is spelled and a text suggesting she would rather live in 
italy have left her on the defensive 
shes 26 years old she rides a horse frequents hip clubs 
dreams of living in italy starts the fourpage article in the 
oct 26 edition of the news and picture weekly magazine under the 
headline miss poland no mademoiselle jaruzelska 
there are six photographs the main one a doublepage spread 
showing her in a nightgown reading in bed with a tray holding a 
coffee cup and a pitcher 
in others she is smoking a cigar sitting on a bearskin rug in 
front of a fireplace wearing a dark wig and a sheer polkadot 
blouse and putting on lipstick while wearing a fur and sitting at 
the wheel of a fourwheeldrive vehicle 
like other young people monika would like to have a 4x4 like 
the one shes posing in here the text reads this happy young 
woman loves to change personality and look i have a few wigs i 
wore the black one in a video made in the west 
its her way to live pluralism a la polonaise the article 
concludes 
but back in poland ms jaruzelska told a warsaw newspaper that 
her venture into the freewheeling western media has turned into 
a new and bitter experience in life 
the recent warsaw university graduate now working on a film for 
a swiss director said she had hoped the pictures would contribute 
to a new image of her father 
i always considered as unjust and harmful the attacks of the 
western press on the allegedly gloomy man in dark glasses she 
told the zycie warszawy newspaper 
little has been known about the private life of jaruzelski the 
ramrod straight military officer who imposed martial law in 1981 
to crack down on the solidarity movement 
but in a year of historic political and economic change 
including the east blocs first noncommunist government a 
television special showed jaruzelski at home and other bits of his 
personal views have reached print 
when a photographer approached her through a friend in 
september ms jaruzelska said she agreed to pose for two reasons 
first i wanted to contribute to shaping a new image of my 
father adding to the whole story a certain human accent 
secondly i assumed that artistic photography is in the sphere of 
my interests and film plans she told zycie warszawy 
she said she accepted no money for the photos and denied reports 
that she plans to marry the photographer 
among the photographs he took there is none that would abuse 
my dignity or decencies she told the newspaper but obviously 
the way of cutting the frame and mainly the spiteful commentary can 
change the meaning of the photographs 
she denies saying she would rather live in italy a touchy 
subject for the daughter of the president of a country where 
economic crisis has driven many talented young people to emigrate 
i said something completely different i spoke about my deep 
ties with polish culture however i said that i have been 
interested for a long time in italian culture especially in the 
great films of this country 
paris match describes ms jaruzelska as asserting her 
independence and quotes her saying everyone has a right to 
choose where to live work feel good about himself 
but she emphasizes that her roots are in poland the 
magazine says 
and it reports that she lunches daily with her dog mounchia at 
her parents house where she finds the generalpresident the man 
in dark glasses without mystery for her both of us we love 
literature good food and cycling its the only state secret she 
is willing to give

the state department accused the christian 
leader of lebanon on saturday of undermining the constitutional 
structure of the middle eastern country by dissolving parliament 
he does a disservice to the state and the people he claims to 
defend spokeswoman nancy beck said in a statement that sharply 
criticized gen michel aoun the christian army commander who took 
the action in the absence of a lebanese president 
the parliament was to meet to ratify an agreement negotiated by 
the legislators last month in taif saudi arabia under arab league 
auspices it would strengthen the role of moslems in the lebanese 
government without providing a timetable for the withdrawal of 
syrian forces from their occupation of much of lebanon 
the state department backs the agreement as a unique 
opportunity to end fighting between christian and moslem 
factions but joseph a boohaker spokesman for the national 
alliance of lebanese americans said friday you are going to have 
a mirror image of syria in lebanon 
boohaker a birmingham ala lawyer said the accord calls for 
negotiations with syria beginning in 1991 for a withdrawal only 
from the beirut area that it does not provide a timetable for a 
pullout from the bekaa valley 
there has to be a link between reforms and withdrawal 
boohaker said 
the state department on friday reiterated its general call for a 
withdrawal of all forces from lebanon and said it had asked syria 
to take action against terrorist groups based there and in 
syria 
the accord was endorsed by 59 of the 63 lawmakers who attended a 
special parliamentary session called by the arab league in taif 
apart from aouns objections the leader of amal nabih berri 
opposed the taif agreement because he felt it did not sufficiently 
increase his groups representation 
state department spokeswoman beck on saturday said aouns 
dissolution of the parliament was an obvious attempt to block 
implementation of the taif agreement and to subvert the efforts of 
the arab league to promote a lasting peace in lebanon it 
jeopardizes lebanons chances of ending 14 years of war and we 
deplore it 
she added gen aouns action undermines one of lebanons last 
remaining institutions with constitutional legitimacy he does a 
disservice to the state and people he claims to defend 
the us official said the parliament has the right to meet in 
lebanon to continue the process of national reconciliation

thousands of east germans 
poured into this border town saturday after czechoslovakia opened 
the floodgates for refugees who have abandoned hope of a better 
life in their communist homeland 
the break came late friday when it was announced that east 
german officials had agreed to let allied czechoslovakia open its 
western frontier to people pouring in from east germany 
the people back there have just given up hope olaf 
acksteiner a 27yearold from cottbus told reporters after 
arriving on the first train carrying refugees from prague the

capital east berlin on saturday to demand more freedom many 
carried signs deriding krenz and the communist party voicing 
distrust and despair 
neither czechoslovak nor east german officials have indicated 
how long the escape route will remain open 
the refugees arriving here speculated that tens of thousands or 
more would take advantage of the unprecedented opening to a new 
life 
one new arrival michael wilke 27 said he guessed that 2 
million of his countrymen would leave through czechoslovakia by the 
end of the year 
the communist party is just going to hold onto power wilke 
said after 40 years of power its not just going to give up 
right now 
joachim doerig a west german border police official said he 
expected about 8000 east german refugees to reach west germany 
over the weekend 
about 70000 other east germans have fled west through hungary 
poland and czechoslovakia since august when the reformminded 
hungarian government began dismantling its border barriers with the

lifted travel restrictions that had prevented citizens from 
traveling freely to czechoslovakia honecker had imposed the 
restrictions in october to stop an earlier exodus 
east germans immediately headed for the west german embassy in 
prague until friday night they had to go through a lengthy 
process before getting permission to go west it included being 
ferried to the east german embassy to renounce their citizenship 
then going back to the western embassy to await permission to leave 
east germany was processing only about 100 people a day and by 
late friday abut 5000 people were crushed into the west german 
embassy compound 
cheers erupted when word came that the procedure had been 
changed and they could leave czechoslovakia simply by showing their 
east german identity documents 
refugees continued to arrive at the west german embassy on 
saturday many skeptical or unaware of the new freedom to travel 
west 
i cant believe it said one longhaired teenager after an 
embassy employee told him he then asked several west german 
journalists is it true is it really true 
a large group of east germans hung their apartment keys on a 
rope and dangled it from an embassy window before leaving 
there are still empty apartments in east germany yelled one 
of them alluding to the shortage of homes in his country 
five special trains began evacuating the refugees from 
czechoslovakia early saturday and thousands of others were 
believed to be headed from east germany to the czechoslovakwest 
german border in private cars 
the first trainload from prague arrived at 315 pm in a cold 
drizzle 
about 400 people met the refugees with two dozen baby carriages 
hot tea blankets and food 
a hearty welcome to you the train station loudspeaker 
boomed to the new arrivals the federal border police and the 
mayor of marktredwitz welcome you to the federal republic of 
germany

she broke off her nursing studies to flee to the west with her 
fiance rene ulehm 21 also from erfurt 
my parents drove us to prague and left us outside the 
embassy ms loeffelholz said then we just had to say goodbye 
i hope they can come out later 
martina bauer who arrived with her husband detlef and two 
young sons had tears in her eyes were just thrilled that it 
finally worked her husband said 
hundreds of other east german refugees streamed across the 
border in planes trains and automobiles 
an east berlin woman told reporters in czechoslovakia that she 
and her husband were simply waved through the east 
germanczechoslovak border 
we were never before treated so nicely at the border the 
woman said we were waved through with a friendly auf 
wiedersehen 
a spokesman for the west german railroad system luther 
chostiani said special trains from prague would be arriving in 
west germany hourly until demand in the czechoslovak capital 
subsided 
in a speech televised nationally over east germanys staterun 
network krenz on friday night appealed to his people to stay and 
rebuild east germany

the social democratic party one of 
many parties challenging the ruling socialists in national 
elections next year split into two factions saturday because of 
policy disagreements 
the social democratic party is one of nearly two dozen new or 
reformed parties preparing for the contested elections which will 
be the first since the communists consolidated power in 1948 
leaders of the new faction calling itself the independent 
social democratic party accused their rivals of bourgeois 
tendencies the accusations came on the second day of a congress 
called to plan election strategies 
spokeswoman anna petrasovits of the mainstream faction 
criticized the breakaway group saying it seeks alliances with 
the east european left 
we represent the west european left she told hungarian 
television 
one of the issues that split the social democratic party was 
whether or not to cooperate with the socialist party which 
replaced the communist party when it was disbanded last month 
the socialist party professed democratic ideals but is still 
headed by leaders of the defunct communist party

when he announced his familys plans to sell 
rockefeller center david rockefeller said the deal preserves the 
abiding commitment to new york city his father made 50 years ago 
and which generations of the family continue to feel 
but the sale to one of japans largest real estate companies 
underscored a change in the relationship between the rockefellers 
and new york and offered a reminder that the city will have to 
face the next century with relatively little assistance from a 
family that helped it through this one 
new york has had many rich and powerful families such as the 
delanceys the astors and the vanderbilts but none shaped the city 
like the rockefellers 
the familys accumulated works range from the stone towers of 
the cloisters a museum in the shape of a monastery in northern 
manhattan to the gleaming steel ones of the world trade center 
downtown 
in between there is lincoln center the museum of modern art 
the museum of the city of new york rockefeller university 
memorial sloankettering cancer center the asia society chase 
manhattan plaza 
where else asks historian henry hope reed can we find so 
large a contribution by one family and a contribution so diverse 
not japan apparently last weekend at a conference on 
philanthropy at the rockefeller estate in pocantico hills japanese 
experts explained that the japanese do not have the philanthropic 
tradition that the rockefellers epitomize they traditionally look 
to government for such services 
japans mitsubishi estate co said monday it would pay 846 
million to buy a 51 percent stake in rockefeller group inc 
rockefeller groups most famous asset is the 22acre rockefeller 
center in midtown manhattan with its skating rink annual 
christmas tree radio city music hall and office buildings the 
associated press building the news services world headquarters 
is located in the center 
news of the purchase was accompanied by assurances the center 
will be maintained with the attention for which the rockefellers 
are renowned 
but new york knows what a difference an individual can make in 
the life of a city because of the examples of john d rockefeller 
jr the man who built rockefeller center during the depression 
he began life as the son of the nations richest man who was 
notorious for ruthlessly eliminating competition to monopolize the 
us oilrefining industry at the turn of the century 
as peter collier and david horowitz note in their book the 
rockefellers the son created a philanthropic empire as 
impressive as the fathers business one for junior giving was a 
profession a vocation in which he helped his father spend 500 
million and then gave away another 500 million himself 
although his gifts were widespread he preserved thousands of 
acres of western wilderness and restored colonial williamsburg va 
new york city was his focus 
the city was his passion making it a better place said 
paul gunther of the municipal art society the physical evidence 
is everywhere those things would not have been built without him 
he built the cloisters and the riverside church a recreation 
of a french gothic cathedral he contributed 1 million to union 
theological seminary and built international house for foreign 
students 
in december 1946 hours before the united nations was set to 
establish its headquarters outside new york city rockefeller 
agreed to pay 85 million for a site on the east river which he 
gave to the world body 
why pa thats most generous his son nelson later to 
become governor of new york and then vice president told him 
rockefellers children followed his lead playing dominant or 
vital roles in the creation of lincoln center the world trade 
center and numerous other projects 
today there still is a vast rockefeller commitment to 
philanthropy but john d jrs two surviving sons are in their 
70s and three years ago fortune magazine concluded that the family 
is retreating from a tradition of massive giving 
the familys fourth generation the 22 men and women who call 
themselves the cousins range in age from 22 to 61 by some 
accounts they give away as much as 40 million a year but the 
original family of eight that lived under one roof has multiplied 
and scattered across the nation and their charitable concerns 
have too 
few of the cousins live in new york now and the city is not a

the chief of the kgb acknowledged saturday that 
the secret police played a role in the cruelty and repression of 
the stalin regime and vowed that such brutality would never happen 
again 
we bow our heads in memory of the innocent victims vladimir 
a kryuchkov said on national television this is a moral 
purification for us all and a guarantee that it will never happen 
again never 
kryuchkov made the admission in a speech at a kremlin gathering 
in advance of tuesdays anniversary celebrations marking the 1917 
bolshevik revolution 
the speech was another step in the push by kryuchkov who became 
kgb chief a year ago to partially lift the tight veil of secrecy 
over the feared secret police 
dictator josef stalins cult of personality distorted the 
institutions of soviet power and law enforcement bodies including 
state security organs were turned into a weapon of stalins 
arbitrary rule kryuchkov said 
there is no justification for the mass repression and cruelty 
often inflicted on behalf of the revolution the party and the 
people the kgb chief said 
the stalin period of 19241953 now is widely criticized in the 
soviet union for the murder and imprisonment of millions of 
innocent citizens the kgb has been among the last to acknowledge 
its part in the terror much less on nationwide television during a 
celebration of the founding of the soviet state 
since becoming head of the kgb on oct 1 1988 kryuchkov has 
pushed cooperation with foreign secret services on international 
terrorism and drug trafficking granted interviews to soviet and 
foreign press and even allowed a government news agency to make a 
movie about his organization on thursday five kgb officers 
answered questions on a nationwide tv callin program 
in a sign of his standing in the kremlin the kgb chief was made 
a full member of the ruling communist party politburo in september 
kryuchkov rejected arguments that the stalinist terror was a 
logical outcome of the revolution that brought the bolsheviks to 
power in 1917 
speaking before a rostrum that included president mikhail s 
gorbachev and the rest of the politburo and government leaders 
kryuchkov sounded a conciliatory note as he discussed social and 
economic problems piling up in the country 
the kgb chief called for constructive dialogue to prevent 
strikes from further hampering the economy officials have warned 
that strikes last summer cut into the supply of coal set aside for 
winter heating and generation of electricity 
despite a ban on many strikes passed by the supreme soviet 
legislature last month many coal miners in the arctic area of 
vorkuta have walked off their jobs again in the past week 
in many cases they are caused by difficult labor and social 
conditions and often demands of strikes are justified though may 
not be immediately feasible he said 
the party also deserves criticism he said 
some criticism goes beyond the limits of objectiveness of 
reason and even of decency kryuchkov said however we cannot 
ignore the fact that many criticial remarks addressed to the party 
are justified the party will have to part with 
administrativecommand methods to gradually correct mistakes to 
work out a new strategy and do its best to regain peoples trust in 
it 
but echoing gorbachev the kgb chief stressed that soviets must 
learn to work harder he told the nation that americans are twice 
as productive at work as soviets and that well live better only 
on condition that everyone starts to work better

a plan to scare pigeons from the 
statehouse steps by using inflatable owls was strictly for the 
birds 
it was a total failure said administration secretary chuck 
polan maybe not a total failure but it didnt work 
the pigeons are a nuisance at the capitol because they eat grass 
seed and splatter the porches with their droppings some parts of 
the capitol accumulate up to 1 inch of droppings every two days 
said bob plantz director of general services for state government 
its getting worse than asbestos plantz zaid i may see 
if it can be declared a health hazard 
plantzs office purchased about a halfdozen of the inflatable 
owls at 695 each at a discount store in september hoping they 
would frighten away the flocks of pigeons that make the capitol 
complex their homes 
theoretically pigeons would mistake the plastic owls for 
predators and flee in terror the owls apparently flustered some 
pigeons but not enough to make a difference plantz said 
the state will continue to look at other options to keep the 
pigeons under control polan said but he conceded hes running out 
of ideas

it was part convention part circus as 600 conventioneers 
chuckled and guffawed their way through such weekend seminars as 
humor and healthcare and discovering the humor creativity 
and magic within us 
some spouted statistics laughing 100 times per day is 
equivalent to 10 minutes of exercise on a rowing machine and 
audience members learned while they laughed about such things as 
how humor can benefit sick people and help organizations run more 
smoothly 
im not here to turn you into standup comedians humor 
specialist joel goodman told the group 
still his speech was laced with oneliners the secret of 
managing is to keep the five guys who hate you away from the four 
who are undecided and there are reports of vandals who stole all

the bush administration renewed its pledge to 
keep the united states open to japanese investment as a semiannual 
economic meeting between the two nations ended saturday without any 
major breakthroughs on contentious trade issues 
the administrations team of subcabinet officials again pressed 
japan to open its markets to a greater variety of american goods 
including supercomputers and forest products and made clear the 
administration favors an open investment policy on both sides of 
the pacific said chief us negotiator richard t mccormack 
mccormack undersecretary of state for economic affairs sought 
to calm the anxiety of his japanese counterparts about the alarm 
expressed by some members of congress and others over recent 
purchases of us companies and other properties by investors in 
japan examples include the sony corps acquisition of columbia 
pictures and mitsubishi real estates purchase of rockefeller 
center in new york city 
the administration believes that as a debtor nation the united 
states should welcome the influx of capital from abroad we think 
the united states benefits from foreign investments but an 
important part of that is encouraging other countries to open their 
own investment climates said mccormack 
deputy foreign minister koji watanabe who led the japanese team 
during the twoday round of talks said theres a perception that 
the japanese market is closed to us investors actually 
there are very very few restrictions imposed by the government on 
incoming investments 
watanabe acknowledged however that current exchange rates and 
japanese stock prices viewed as artificially high by americans 
serve to discourage us investors 
though no specific progress was reported by either side 
concerning us demands that japan relax its curbs against certain 
american products each team expressed optimism for future 
agreements we managed in the past to resolve the tobacco 
question the telecommunications question said watanabe we 
can manage to resolve the others because the pain of not doing so 
will be greater than the pain of doing so 
both teams pointed to recent improvements in the huge us trade 
deficit which declined 22 percent last year and according to 
mccormack is down a further 7 percent so far this year american 
exports to japan said watanabe are up by 188 percent or an 
increase of 10 billion compared to last year 
watanabe said also that 10 firms from the us construction 
industry which has long complained about being virtually shut out 
from japan have landed contracts worth 400 million in recent 
months 
the japanese official noting estimates that a cut of 1 in the 
federal deficit produces a 50cent reduction in the trade deficit 
said he is very encouraged by the commitment of the united 
states to control deficit spending 
most of the same negotiators return monday and tuesday for a 
separate round of talks known as the structural impediment 
initiative to focus on nontrade issues affecting the united 
states 50 billion trade deficit with japan

the internal revenue service is sending shockwaves 
through the ranks of criminal defense attorneys with a letter 
demanding they reveal whether any of their clients paid large 
lawyer bills with cash 
miami attorney neal sonnett president of the national 
association of criminal lawyers said upset lawyers from around the 
country are calling him to complain that the new tactic violates 
the fundamental right of attorneyclient privilege 
they are very disturbed about this said sonnett there 
are a lot of lawyers who believe this is a major crisis and 
confrontation 
the letter signed by christopher j lezovich an irs official 
in detroit was sent to attorneys around the country giving them 30 
days to identify clients who paid them more than 10000 in cash 
the letter includes irs form 8300 which among other things 
requests filers to give the amount paid in 100 bills 
the form also asks for the clients names addresses social 
security numbers place of business source of income and other 
information 
and the letter includes a warning from the irs as well 
failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could 
result in summons enforcement action being initiated lezovich 
writes 
the criminal justice arm of the american bar association was 
meeting in washington on saturday to discuss the irs action 
tax collectors are acting under a disclosure law passed by 
congress in 1985 over the objections of the aba and initially 
widely ignored the law was aimed at exposing tax evaders 
including major drug dealers who often transact business in cash 
the original penalties for failure to disclose were only 
misdemeanors but a year ago congress reclassified violations as 
felonies punishable by up to 10 years in prison and the irs at 
least in detroit is now cracking down 
the law goes directly against the rules of many state bar 
associations including floridas leaving attorneys in an ethical 
dilemma 
it has said flatly the lawyer may not provide the information 
without an express waiver from the client sonnett said 
the bar associations have said that exposing client affairs to 
the government or anyone else is a clear violation of 
attorneyclient privilege 
we could lose our license or be subject to contempt 
proceedings complained miami lawyer janice sharpstein whose 
firm received one of the irs communications 
jose quinon president of the florida criminal lawyers 
association said the law in effect is forcing defense attorneys to 
become the reluctant allies of prosecutors he said the information 
provided to the government could then be used to help win 
convictions or obtain indictments 
some attorneys previously had cooperated in part listing the 
cash they received but excluding any details that would identify 
the client until the recent letter the irs had been lenient in 
its interpretation 
irs officials have acknowledged the letter was sent but refused 
to comment further 
sonnett suggested that the detroit office may have acted on its 
own 
were fairly well satisfied its not national policy by the 
treasury department or the justice department he said we are 
told the matter is under review

he and his family received national attention four years ago 
when he was barred from western middle school near kokomo by 
officials who feared he could spread aids to other students 
a judge later ruled that ryan should be allowed to attend 
school because acquired immune deficiency syndrome is not spread 
through casual contact 
the controversy split the community and ryans family moved 20 
miles away to cicero a town of about 3200 people where school 
officials and other students welcomed ryan 
i like it here so much better just feeling like everybody

programming it is being distributed by the federal centers for 
disease control to help teach about aids he also had a bit part in 
a television drama about his case playing an older aids patient

east german refugees many 
refusing to believe their government agreed to let them emigrate 
freely to the west continued to swarm the west german embassy here 
saturday to request asylum 
the last of more than 5000 east germans who had been holed up 
in the embassy left for west germany on saturday one day after the 
communist government in east berlin said it would not stop them 
from crossing the border 
but crowds of skeptical or uninformed east germans continued to 
gather in front of the embassys iron gate seeking entry in the 
mistaken belief that they had to force their way west the same way 
their predecessors did by seeking sanctuary at a western embassy 
some needed little convincing when told they could now go 
directly over the border to west germany they cheered and grinned 
widely before jumping into their cars for the trip to freedom 
others remained distrustful 
i cant believe it said one longhaired teenager after an 
embassy employee told him the latest developments he then walked 
up to several west german journalists asking each separately is 
it true is it really true 
the decision to open czechoslovakias borders to east germans 
seeking to settle in west germany followed a nationally televised 
speech by east german communist leader egon krenz who pledged 
reform and urged an end to the exodus of his countrymen 
tens of thousands of east germans have left for the west from 
soviet bloc countries since august some after seeking sanctuary 
in west german embassies in prague and warsaw most have used 
hungary as a springboard after it threw open its border to austria 
on sept 10 for east german citizens 
a young man who fled through hungary six weeks ago was among 
those in front of the embassy saturday afternoon but he wasnt 
seeking entry 
now a west german citizen he had come to prague to look for his 
wife and baby the trio were reunited with the help of embassy 
personnel 
a larger group of east germans hung their apartment keys on a 
rope and dangled it from an embassy window before leaving 
there are still empty apartments in east germany yelled one 
of them alluding to the housing shortage in west germany 
several east germans told reporters that czechoslovak taxi 
drivers had demanded up to 100 for the trip between the main train 
station and the embassy instead of the normal fare of 4

as many as 1 million east germans chanting 
freedom freedom filled the streets of the capital saturday 
for an emotional prodemocracy rally that was the largest in the 
communist nations 40year history 
the crowd jeered communist party leaders and cheered opposition 
speakers scores of people draped prodemocracy banners from their 
apartment balconies and several elderly east berliners wept with 
emotion as demonstrators marched past 
the threehour rally sanctioned by authorities came a day 
after communist leader egon krenz announced the dismissal of five 
politburo members promised broad political and economic reforms 
and urged east germans to be patient and stay in their homeland 
but thousands of disillusioned east germans ignored his pleas 
and continued to pour into neighboring czechoslovakia which threw 
open its western frontier to refugees seeking new lives in west 
germany 
for many of those who stayed behind the focus was on the rally 
in east berlins sprawling alexanderplatz and on smaller rallies in 
several other east german cities 
people from all over east germany flocked to the capital which 
has a population of 12 million to urge democratic changes 
the staterun news agency adn said 500000 demonstrators jammed 
the vast downtown square and surrounding streets witnesses 
organizers and even east berlin police estimated the crowd at 
closer to 1 million 
after four decades we have found our voices again said 
stefan heym a prominent east german writer 
we are demonstrating for freedom for a better life said an 
east berlin woman who came to the protest with her young son 
many carried signs deriding krenz and the communist party 
expressing distrust and despair that have mounted through four 
decades of rigid rule 
the eyes of the people are on you one banner warned the 
leadership we want glasnost not sugarcoating demanded 
another 
other banners challenged the leading role of the communist party 
and demanded life without secret police terror many held up 
banners of the new forum opposition group the crowd often chanted 
freiheit freiheit freedom freedom 
placards calling for an end to communist rule were pasted on the 
walls of several government buildings including parliament 
east german statecontrolled radio and television carried live 
coverage of the rally indicating the medias greater openness 
under krenzs leadership 
speakers addressing the crowd included members of opposition 
groups church officials party functionaries and prominent artists 
they demanded an end to the communists monopoly on power free 
trade unions an end to censorship release of political prisoners 
and free elections 
opposition leaders were cheered and party officials booed and 
whistled at as they spoke from a platform mounted on a truck 
one of the biggest cheers went up when a noncommunist 
politician repeated his demand for the resignation of the entire 
leadership 
the call was made by manfred gerlach leader of the liberal 
democratic party the party has led the drive for more independence 
by the four small parties that until now had been closely 
affiliated with the communists 
the communists unpopularity was made evident when east berlin 
party chief and politburo member guenter schabowski took the stand 
schabowski who was instrumental in allowing saturdays 
demonstration was repeatedly interupted by boos and whistles until 
an organizer stepped in and urged people to let him speak 
schabowskis reassertion of east germanys steadfast 
alliance with the soviet union drew loud jeers 
jens reich a new forum leader received loud applause when he 
called for free elections he said opposition groups should be 
fully recognized and not just tolerated by communist 
authorities 
markus wolf who headed the countrys espionage agency for 
nearly 30 years before stepping down in 1987 drew cheers and 
applause wolf has emerged as a chief supporter of reforms and 
there has been growing speculation he could assume a top leadership 
role 
speaking of violent police attacks against prodemocracy 
demonstrators in early october wolf said we must never allow 
those times to return 
one hungarian student was cheered when he called for a union of 
democratic movements throughout eastern europe another speaker 
received long applause when he offered apologies to czechoslovakia 
for the warsaw pact invasion that crushed the prague spring 
reform movement in 1968 
hundreds of thousands of east germans have demonstrated in 
recent weeks across the country for democratic reforms but 
saturdays rally surpassed by far any gathering seen to date 
adn said that on saturday 40000 people also demonstrated in 
magdeburg 12000 in altenburg and several thousand in both 
potsdam and arnstadt later adn said 30000 demonstrated in 
rostock 25000 in plauen and 20000 in suhl several thousand 
people also took part in protests in three small towns in northern 
east germany 
the tolerance of dissent and the promise of reforms by the new 
krenz government which replaced the hardline regime of erich 
honecker last month has failed to stop the exodus to the west 
more than 70000 east germans have fled their country in recent 
months dissatisfied with communist party rule thousands more 
joined them over the weekend 
trust our policy of renewal your place dear fellow citizens 
is here we need you krenz said in his friday night address

a jury has cleared three chemical 
manufacturers in a lawsuit brought by textile workers who tried to 
prove that their exposure to a toxic chemical gave them a crippling 
lung disease 
a cecil county circuit court jury decided after four hours of 
deliberations friday that the manufacturers were not liable for the 
conditions of 25 maryland and delaware residents who worked at wl 
gore amp associates plants 
the workers said their health and their lives were ruined by a 
chemical used in making goretex a waterproof fabric widely used 
in athletic clothing and parkas 
they sought about 20 million collectively for the loss of 
wages health costs and pensions they also asked for an 
unspecified amount for pain and suffering 
as the jury walked out of the courtroom after a nineweek trial 
that began in june some of the workers sobbed in a nearby hallway 
i was shocked said rick palmer 29 who has worked at gore 
since he was 18 if the chemical companies arent at fault who 
is at fault 
wendy fleischman one of the workers attorneys promised to 
appeal 
the workers tried to prove that mobay corp wr grace amp co 
and ei du pont de nemours amp co failed to give gore amp associates 
information on how to handle the chemical safely under maryland 
law the workers could not sue gore itself 
the workers say they inhaled toluene diisocyanate known as tdi 
at unsafe levels until gore temporarily closed its cherry hill 
plant production line near elkton in may 1986 after workers became 
ill 
the three chemical companies argued that they sent gore 
productsafety information including a warning that when 
possible tdi should be used in a closed system that keeps workers 
from being exposed said david c allen an attorney for wr grace 
and du pont 
plaintiffs have said they cannot work because of inflammatory 
lung disease that restricts their breathing their families are 
financially and emotionally shaken and some have developed a 
hypersensitivity to various products ranging from perfumes to 
floor cleaners 
the chemical companies argued that many of the workers were 
heavy smokers which could have caused their lung problems and 
that some of their complaints such as chemical hypersensitivity 
have not been proved to be linked to tdi 
it was not medically possible to say that tdi caused their 
problems allen said 
when the problem started charles dean 44 said i dont 
think a lot of us knew what was happening to us we started getting 
sick but no one associated the chemical exposure to the illness 
finally gore began investigating why workers were getting ill 
and discovered that monitoring equipment in the plant was 
underestimating how much tdi was in the air said robert j 
weltchek a lawyer for the workers 
the workers argued that mobay knew that the airmonitoring was 
not adequate and had discovered a more accurate technique but 
failed to inform gore weltchek said 
several of the workers said they do not feel ill will toward 
gore the company investigated the problem they said and has 
adapted the equipment in the cherry hill plant to make it safer 
palmer said the company has kept him on its payroll even though he 
is often sick 
they have been behind me 100 percent they lived the 
nightmare with us palmer said

the 10th anniversary of the seizure of 
the us embassy in tehran brings bitter memories to joseph subic 
the only military hostage rejected for a decoration after 444 days 
in captivity 
the army says the former noncommissioned officer appeared in a 
film criticizing the us role in iran and when tortured 
disclosed facts about other hostages 
subic 33 now a law enforcement officer for floridas 
department of agriculture strongly disagrees with the armys 
reasoning in not awarding him the defense meritorious service medal 
he said he told his captors only what they already knew by 
perusing the numerous undestroyed files left in the embassy all he 
did he says is confirm his signature on specific documents and 
he notes he received an honorable discharge 
if im bitter or not is immaterial iran is in the past i 
live for the present he said in an interview in saturdays 
sunsentinel of fort lauderdale you never forget those 444 days 
but you accept them 
subic thinks he was a scapegoat he does not turn away from what 
he did because he thinks there is no need to he said he simply 
obeyed the iranian radicals who took him prisoner 
i read whatever they asked me to i have no idea what it 
said said subic 
he did it he said because death was always there so was the 
isolation 
on nov 4 1979 six months after he arrived in iran and armed 
with a shotgun and a 9mm pistol subic was informed the chancellery 
of the embassy had been breached he was the first military person 
to have armed contact with the iranians 
i would have shot but it was a question of whether deadly 
force was necessary they led with women in front of them to shoot 
unarmed people was wrong we had standards to maintain 
we thought wed be kept 20 or 30 minutes and the government 
would come and retake the embassy 
they were wrong after destroying many sensitive documents they 
surrendered were handcuffed and were lined up against a window 
they then put guns to the back of our heads and we heard a 
metallic click he recalled 
but subic said he was unafraid 
on the day of the takeover i had no fear of dying because i 
was defending the embassy and doing my job after that i began to 
wonder what am i going to die for 
the sergeant at 23 he was already a sixyear army veteran 
believed in his country and in its president 
when he returned to this country in 1980 he still did but it 
had been a long 444 days 
i dont know if i lost faith but i wondered where is my 
country i was not disillusioned by america i was disillusioned 
that we didnt receive the proper training that they didnt 
understand the magnitude of the situation he said 
during those days subic read the bible because there was 
nothing else to read he says he read it completely through 
several times he read high school textbooks he found out the shah 
of iran was dead by reading the sporting news he found out about 
yellow ribbons that way too 
we couldnt understand yellow ribbons 
without bitterness he says what were yellow ribbons going to 
do for us we wanted to see b52s 
he tried escaping once 
at least then i would know what would happen i tied sheets 
together and went i made it 200 yards i got beat up i sucked a 
45 they tied me up with electrical wire and kept me awake for 
days 
but i dont really equate the physical torture so much when 
compared to the mental torture theyd come in with hoods over 
their heads theyd handcuff you put you against a wall and put a 
gun to your head your knees would buckle and theyd laugh 
still the young man from redford township mich says it was 
his job and he did it 
he knows some of the other 51 hostages the ones with whom he 
briefly shared an entire world inside a single room today they 
exchange christmas cards 
i have my new life to live subic said 
he does not question what the military decided to do about his 
medal he says that life is too short that he is no loser that he 
has proved that and that in the future others will realize that 
someday ill be able to hold up my medal i havent done 
anything wrong

arab reporters said rumors spread through the city that either 
israeli soldiers or jewish settlers had thrown a bomb into the

its natural for them to start spreading these rumors but the 
fact is there were no army forces in the area at the time of the 
explosion said a military spokesman 
a police commander in the area told the associated press 
investigators believed the explosion was caused by someone in the 
house

someone was playing with a hand grenade or some other explosive 
device he said 
staterun israel radio reported police were considering the 
possiblity that someone was preparing a homemade bomb and it 
exploded 
doctors at hebrons alia hospital said mansur hadi stpihs legs

know what happened all i heard was the children crying and then 
i saw blood on my face i forgot everything else he said 
hebron is the site of frequent clashes between the citys 50000 
palestinians and some 5000 jewish settlers who live in the city 
center and in the nearby kiryat arba settlelment

mohammad sulieman 36 whose body was found in a gaza city street 
hospitals officials said sulieman a resident of the nuseriat 
refugee camp was killed by ax blows to the neck and head 
his death raised to 141 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs for suspected collaboration with israeli authorities 
since the uprising against the israeli occupation of the gaza strip 
and west bank began in december 1987 
at least 609 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the uprising and 40 israelis have perished in the

i felt very proud of this country in the way that they didnt 
abandon us he said 
royer called it a day of reflection

statement as a former hostage in iran i fervently appeal to 
those who hold hostage our eight countrymen and others in beirut 
today and to those who can influence them to restore these men to 
freedom and their families 
their continued incarceration can serve no ones purpose and 
is a tragic offense to human rights he said

a presidential candidate whose 
predecessor was killed by drug traffickers canceled two campaign 
stops after a bomb was found on a bridge hours before he was to 
cross it a campaign official said saturday 
the candidate cesar gaviria was in charge of the campaign of 
sen luis carlos galan until drug traffickers assassinated the 
senator at an aug 18 political rally gaviria then decided to run 
for the presidency 
meanwhile a colombian businessman under cocaine indictments in 
florida california and illinois was handed over to us 
authorities in bogota and flown saturday to talahassee fla 
guillermo bueno delgado 54 a hotel owner and investor in 
colombia was arrested sept 14 and the us justice department 
asked for his extradition to face charges beginning with a florida 
indictment 
bueno is the sixth colombian turned over to us authorities and 
extradited since august when galans assassination prompted 
president virgilio barco to declare war on drug traffickers and end 
a ban on extraditions to the united states 
on friday federal agents assigned to protect gaviria discovered 
a dynamite bomb under a bridge on the road between cienaga and 
fundacion two towns on colombias northern coast the gaviria 
campaign coordinator told the associated press in bogota 
gaviria one of three leading presidential contenders was to 
travel the road just hours after the bomb was found the 
coordinator said speaking on the condition he not be named 
the campaign official said no group claimed responsibility for 
the bomb which caused gaviria to cancel campaign stops at cienaga 
and fundacion he said there was no indication it was intended for 
the candidate 
gavirias political organizer for the state juan carlos vives 
said in a news conference that leftist guerrillas were responsible 
his comments were broadcast saturday by the national radio chain 
rcn 
the national coordinator however denied that anyone in the 
campaign had received any information implicating guerrillas 
it is unclear who is responsible for the attack he said 
it could have been any one of a number of groups including drug 
traffickers and guerrillas 
gaviria remained in the port city of santa marta on saturday 
while his staff considered alternative appearances 
we are determined to continue the campaign the coordinator 
said 
the candidate has portrayed himself as galans political heir 
and has adopted many of the slain senators positions including 
his strong opposition to drug traffickers 
the campaign official said gaviria had received several death 
threats from anonymous callers in recent weeks 
in a speech last week gaviria reiterated his support of the 
governments extradition of drug traffickers 
since barco declared war on traffickers and enacted emergency 
extradition measures traffickers have retaliated with a wave of 
bombings and assassinations of public officials including two 
federal judges and a leading leftist politician 
judges and court workers went on strike nationwide on friday to 
demand more protection 
presidential candidates did not appear in public for two weeks 
after galans death because of the threat of another assassination 
attempt by traffickers 
in recent weeks candidates have increased the number of 
appearances at political rallies and other functions but only 
under the strictest security measures the intense security is 
likely to continue until the presidential elections may 27 
gavirias coordinator said at least 300 security troops guarded 
the candidate at every campaign stop 
galan had a 63member security contigent when he was killed the 
candidate was wearing a bulletproof vest and was surrounded by nine 
body guards carrying submachine guns automatic rifles and pistols 
when assassins shot and killed him 
the head of the intellegence police miguel maza marquez last 
week said an official investigation into the killing of galan 
proved that leaders of the powerful medellin cocaine cartel ordered 
it

president bush says he intends to keep vice 
president dan quayle on the ticket in 1992 because quayle is doing 
an outstanding job and because his heart is in it 
bushs endorsement of the vice president marked his first 
explicit statement that he would retain quayle if he seeks 
reelection 
quayles press secretary david beckwith said the vice 
president would have no comment on bushs remarks 
hes doing a very good job an outstanding job bush said in 
an interview with the dallas morning news adding that quayle is 
doing exactly what i want him to do and doing it because his 
heart is in it 
bush discussed a broad range of domestic and foreign issues 
from taxes to us relations with china and the soviet union in 
thursdays interview which was published in sunday editions 
the president who campaigned on a pledge of no new taxes would 
not speculate whether he would look for new sources of revenue next 
year 
i said certainly were going to try to get by this year and 
we are were going to succeed in that and then we take on next 
year 
he strongly defended his proposal to cut capital gains taxes 
against criticism that it would mainly help the wealthy 
i heard that all during the campaign he snapped so 
please dont come in here after the election debated this fully 
and give me the liberal democratic line on this 
the president also said he is very eager to talk with former 
president nixon who is meeting with leaders in china bush said 
nixon has an almost unique standing with the chinese leadership 
and yet i know he shares with me the concerns that all of us 
felt about the putdown in tiananmen square so it will be 
interesting to see what he does say the president said 
bush also said he anticipates a better economic relationship 
with the soviet union 
as you know some of thats been tied to the political changes 
that have been taking place he said but who would have 
predicted a year and a half ago that we would have been been 
signing an mfn most favored nation treaty changing the mfn 
treatment of hungary 
and so i can foresee a lot of things that i cant say will 
happen with finality 
bush was harshly critical of nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
when ortega announced a suspension of a ceasefire in his countrys 
civil war but the president would not say if aid would resume to 
the contra rebels 
what i dont want to do is give him ortega any excuse 
whatever to abort the free elections bush said so i dont 
want to conduct myself in some way to take that public opinion 
thats going against him in his own country and in other 
democracies and in the united states and inadvertently turn it 
around to benefit him

christian leader gen michel aoun said 
saturday he had dissolved parliament for backing a plan to end 
lebanons 14yearold civil war but lawmakers questioned his 
authority and said they would meet anyway 
the legislators said they would try to gather sunday at this 
northern lebanon air base to elect a new president to form a 
government of national reconciliation 
aoun whose cabinet is vying for power with a rival moslem 
government accused parliament of violating the constitution by 
approving an arab leaguebrokered accord to end the civil war 
without his consent 
the general who fought the syrians for six months until a 
ceasefire took hold sept 22 rejected the peace plan because it 
failed to guarantee a withdrawal of 40000 syrians military 
personnel from lebanon 
constitutionally only the president can dissolve parliament 
but lebanon has had no head of state since sept 22 1988 when 
president amin gemayels sixyear term expired with parliament 
unable to decide on a successor 
gemayel a maronite like aoun named the 54yearold general to 
head an interim cabinet until a new president could be elected 
aoun says he has the powers of a head of state as long as the 
presidency is vacant and thus has the right to dissolve parliament 
deputies rejected his claim of authority 
i can dissolve the american congress if i want to and it 
would have the same legitimacy said pierre helou a maronite 
christian member of parliament we are recognized by 160 
countries give me the name of a country that recognizes general 
aoun 
helou and more than two dozen other legislators have been in 
paris since drafting the peace accord last month in saudi arabia 
aoun has called the deputies traitors and threatened to punish them 
in paris the legislators declared late saturday that they will 
return home sunday and prepare to elect a president parliament 
speaker hussein husseini did not disclose precisely where in 
lebanon the lawmakers would travel to or what time they would 
arrive 
the deputies will fix a site for the parliamentary election on 
lebanese soil after returning to lebanon and conferring with 
about 40 of their colleagues husseini told reporters 
the parliament must attract at least 50 of the bodys 73 members 
to form a quorum and elect a president 
the saudi peace accord was endorsed by 59 of the 63 lawmakers 
who attended a special parliamentary session called by the arab 
league 
it would strip the president traditionally a maronite 
christian of some power to give the prime minister and parliament 
speaker both moslems a wider share in decision making 
aouns decree dissolving parliament was aimed at preventing a 
parliamentary election 
twentyfour moslem deputies drove from west beirut to kleiat in 
an area policed by syrian troops where they were joined by leftist 
christian deputy najah wajim wajim said deputies do not recognize 
aouns authority so any decree he issues is illegitimate 
aouns supporters waged a general strike that paralyzed the 
christian enclave north of beirut angry christian youngsters 
burned tires and shouted slogans against parliament members 
about 50000 people waving lebanese flags and posters of aoun 
demonstrated outside the shellwrecked presidential palace in 
support of the ustrained general 
we sacrifice our blood for aoun down with the deputies 
they chanted 
you are the decision makers aoun dressed in combat 
fatigues told them the deputies do not represent you 
pope john paul ii in a message sent to the lebanese people and 
read by papal nuncio pablo puente to reporters in beirut declared 
that the country faced the threat of partition chaos and renewed 
war 
stressing that the vatican cannot remain neutral the roman 
catholic leader said it is time for sacrifices for the sake 
of peace 
in what appeared to be an appeal to aoun to back down the 
message added one should sometimes choose the less painful 
options 
in washington the state department accused aoun of undermining 
the constitutional structure of lebanon by dissolving parliament 
he does a disservice to the state and the people he claims to 
defend spokeswoman nancy beck said

she held a 6to8inch hunting knife near brandons throat 
during the standoff and appeared to be hallucinating police said 
she made no demands and did not give any explanation of her actions

after being locked inside a vehicle for so long 
police threw a percussion grenade in front of the car to 
distract the woman and a team of officers stormed the car and 
broke the windows one officer grabbed the child and bolted to a 
waiting ambulance 
by the time the mother knew what was going on we had already 
secured the little boy police spokesman dan turner said his 
safety was our top priority 
the incident began about 3 pm friday when ms levis mother 
barbara levis apparently was trying to take her daughter to a 
psychiatric hospital the two women got into an argument and 
barbara levis fled from the car police said 
i thought it was an accident said keith lampton who saw 
the commotion and called police i looked over and i saw her face 
was all painted up like halloween she was yelling at her mother 
and waving a knife toward her 
the woman was on some type of medication and told police 
negotiators she was hearing strange voices police said 
at times ms levis nuzzled her curlyheaded son bouncing him 
on her knees patting and kissing him one time she came close to 
nicking the child with the blade then immediately drew back the 
knife and checked the baby for wounds police spokesman al baker 
said

south africas foreign minister said 
saturday he had no evidence of a military threat in namibia from 
nationalist guerrillas and he expected the territorys independence 
election to proceed smoothly 
the remarks by pik botha came three days after he said south 
africa might delay the election because of infiltration by 
guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples organization swapo 
voting begins tuesday and will continue through saturday 
i am leaving windhoek with the firm impression that there will 
be peaceful elections next week in namibia and that the elections 
will be open free and fair botha told a news conference 
saturday night 
botha met saturday with swapo leader sam nujoma martti 
ahtisaari the head of the united nations contingent in namibia 
and angolan foreign minister pedro de castro van dunem 
botha said nujoma assured him no guerrillas had infiltrated into 
namibia also known as southwest africa and none was in southern 
angola near namibias northern border 
in the absence of any further evidence i have no choice but 
to accept mr nujomas assurances botha said 
south africa which has ruled namibia for 74 years has agreed 
to grant the territory independence under un supervision 
ahtisaari in a television address said that if the voting went 
smoothly he would be prepared to certify the elections free and 
fair even before all the ballots were counted 
the elections had appeared headed for a possible delay when 
botha said wednesday that members of the un monitoring force 
reported in internal radio traffic the infiltration of 600 
guerrillas 
but the united nations said the messages were fake botha 
acknowledged on friday he didnt know who sent the messages but 
said they were transmitted on a frequency allocated to the world 
body 
as matters now stand there is no evidence as far as i am 
concerned that the un was responsible for the transmissions 
who did it remains unclear botha said 
meanwhile namibias 10 political parties sought to bolster 
their support with weekend rallies before the balloting 
nujoma speaking saturday in the southern town of keetmanshoop 
told a cheering crowd of 6000 blacks that a government by his 
organization would create state farms and cooperatives for landless 
blacks 
but we want to make it clear that we will not evict every 
white from the land nujoma said we will only be dealing with 
those white foreigners from south africa and other parts of the 
world who continue to own vast tracts of land while residing in a 
different country 
nujomas leftleaning group which waged a 23year war against 
south african rule is the heavy favorite in the polls 
its main opponent is the democratic turnhalle alliance a 
multiracial coalition that was part of namibias transitional 
government and favors a capitalist economy

state lawmakers saturday approved a 
quarterpercent increase in californias sales tax to raise 800 
million for earthquake relief in northern california 
meeting in a special session the assembly voted 5617 and the 
senate 342 to approve the proposal over the opposition of some 
republicans who said the money should come from the states 
emergency reserve instead of new taxes 
republican gov george deukmejian said he would sign the bill 
early next week 
supporters of the 13month tax proposed by deukmejian said it 
was a compassionate humane method of financing earthquake 
rebuilding 
but william baker the gop leader of the assemblys fiscal 
committee said the increase would make this tragedy worse by 
going out and reaching into the pockets of the people of the state 
of california 
in the upper house republican sen don rogers called the tax 
plan premature now is not the time to deal with this he said 
adding the money should come instead from the states 
billiondollar emergency reserve 
other quakerelated bills under consideration would earmark 
money to strengthen roads and bridges give immediate aid to people 
displaced by the quake and provide tax breaks for owners of 
quakedamaged property 
the sales tax increase was intended to finance only a small part 
of the costs of rebuilding from the 71 magnitude quake that struck 
northern california on oct 17 killing 66 people and injuring more 
than 3000 
state authorities have estimated damages at more than 7 
billion including about 17 billion to state and county roads 
the federal government has approved a 345 billion quakeaid 
package 
republican opponents of the tax rate increase contended that the 
funds could be obtained by cutting other programs and using money 
from the states billiondollar emergency reserve under 
deukmejians plan the tax would be imposed for 13 months beginning 
dec 1 thus capturing revenues from the heavy christmas shopping 
season this year and next 
some democrats also opposed the plan describing it as 
inadequate and calling instead for a halfcent or a full penny per 
dollar the quarterpercent increase would raise the 6 percent 
sales tax to 625 percent 
representatives of the california retailers association said 
businesses would have trouble reprogramming cash registers to 
comply with an increase on such short notice 
politicking in both parties intensified as scores of bills many 
of them only marginally related to the quake were introduced 
during the special session which was ordered by the governor to 
consider only earthquakerelated measures 
one los angelesarea lawmaker democratic assemblywoman maxine 
waters proposed restoring cuts deukmejian made earlier in the year 
to the family planning program and lobbied fellow democrats to 
include her plan in quake legislation 
there is some feeling right now that there are so many ideas 
floating around that the train may be off the track said ken 
maddy the republican leader in the state senate 
in other developments 
emergency shelters throughout the san francisco bay area 
continued scaling back operations as many of those left homeless 
found new homes and jobs 
this is a sign of success that people are getting out of here 
on their own and starting new lives said lisa summersell red 
cross spokeswoman in san francisco 
geologists said an earthquake that struck the hayward fault at 
1116 pm friday with a magnitude estimated at 36 on the richter 
scale was unrelated to the oct 17 quake and more than 100 
aftershocks on the san andreas fault the separate quake was 
centered about four miles north of san leandro said pat jorgenson 
a spokeswoman for the us geological survey 
it was the first significant tremor on the hayward fault since 
a 47 in 1984 she said 
police in oakland san francisco and other communities said 
there were no reports of damage or injuries 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65

tidal waves were generated the meteorological agency official said 
there have been a series of quakes in the same general area 
during the past several weeks the largest one struck thursday and 
registered 73 on the richter scale 
more than 6000 people were temporarily evacuated from coastal 
towns because of fear of tidal waves from thursday quakes but 
there were no casualties or major damage

and measured on seismographs each increase of one number means the 
ground motion is 10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in a populated 
area one registering 7 is capable of causing widespread and heavy 
damage

three human rights groups in a 
report released saturday denounced what they called slavelike 
working conditions of haitian sugarcane cutters in the dominican 
republic 
although slavery in the dominican republic was formally 
abolished over a century ago haitians in that country continue to 
be delivered at gunpoint to work on government plantations said 
the report prepared in new york by americas watch the national 
coalition of haitian refugees and caribbean rights 
at least 500000 haitians live in the dominican republic which 
shares the island of hispaniola with haiti 
many haitians unable to find work in their impoverished 
country cross the border to harvest the sugar cane in the 
dominican republic most dominicans refuse to do the work because 
of the low pay 
haitian workers are compelled to labor under appalling 
conditions for abysmal pay cutting cane on staterun sugar 
plantations during the harvest season from november to may each 
year the report said 
it said workers are lured from haiti with promises of good pay 
and those already in the dominican republic are rounded up at 
gunpoint and trucked to plantations 
uniformed armed men patrol the plantations both the 
sugarcane fields and areas where the haitians live to prevent 
escape the report said 
the 70page report claims the us state departments annual 
human rights report systematically underestimated the coercive 
practices against sugarcane workers 
americas watch spokesman kenneth roth told the associated press 
that the report was based on two factfinding missions to the 
dominican republic in april and june

foreign minister moshe arens on saturday 
praised the decision by ethiopia to restore ties with israel and 
called it an opportunity to reunite ethiopian jewry with thousands 
of members who emigrated to israel 
arens also expressed hope that ethiopias step announced 
friday would lead the way for the resumption of ties with other 
leftist african nations such as angola mozambique and zambia 
as you know the arab world is doing everything it can to keep 
african countries from resuming their diplomatic relations with 
israel arens told israel radio ethiopia nevertheless 
decided to renew their relations with us 
twentyeight african nations broke ties after israels 1973 war 
with egypt in response to a call for sanctions by the organization 
of african unity ethiopia is the 10th african nation to restore 
relations with the jewish state since 1982 
a spokesman for ethiopias ministry of foreign affairs said the 
compelling reasons which dictated ethiopias severance of 
diplomatic relations with israel no longer exist 
the spokesman cited israels evacuation of egyptian territory 
occupied in the war and the restoration of ties between egypt and 
israel 
for israels 16500member ethiopian community the resumption 
of ties between the two countries has raised the hope of reuniting 
them with family members that want to join them 
the chairman of the public council for ethiopian jews rahamim 
elazar estimated 18000 jews wish to flee the african nation 
which has suffered from drought and civil war 
speaking on israel radio elazar said he has been promised 
immigration would receve top priority in israels new relations 
with addis ababa 
this month marks the fifth anniversary of the usassisted 
operation moses airlift that brought an estimated 8000 
ethiopian jews to israel where they joined earlier emigres 
the operation was halted after news of it leaked out 
embarrassing the marxist government in addis ababa which had 
traditionally been allied with israels enemies 
i certainly think diplomatic relations will facilitate the 
ability to deal directly with the government of ethiopia to bring 
out the remainder of ethiopian jewry to israel arens said 
however five years after their dramatic exodus almost 30 
percent of those ethiopians in israel still live together in 
crowded dormitorystyle government housing centers 
according to the national council for ethiopian jews 
unemployment among ethiopian immigrants above age 35 is about 45 
percent

the heavy beat of rap music is resounding in 
two neighborhoods near a powerful radio transmitter with songs 
like wild thing following some residents even into the bathroom 
you can walk in my yard when it rains and hear the rap rap 
rap music on the chain link fence said tanya busko a 27year 
resident of the affluent hillside community of silver lake about 
10 miles north of downtown los angeles 
its awful its unbelievable at night its unbearable she 
said 
residents of silver lake and adjacent echo park grumble that 
kdayam is too loud and even brags about the potency of its 
50000watt signal they cite promotional ads boasting that the 
stations rap music is everywhere in cars at the beach in 
living rooms even in the shower 
kday president edward j kerby said his station has broadcast 
from its 3acre site for 24 years focusing its signal toward 
downtown with a narrow beam that keeps it from interfering with 
other broadcasters 
as a result kdays rap music the format since 1982 can 
sometimes be heard as far away as hawaii and japan 
ms busko says no room in her house is free from the signal 
in the bathroom you can hear it coming through the toilet 
plumbing she said i can go in my bedroom which has no 
appliances or radio and hear the rap music coming from the wiring 
in the walls 
kerby said inexpensive lowquality household electronics 
equipment act as makeshift radio receivers in residents homes he 
said the volume of complaints roughly 250 a year prompted the 
station to hire a technician to help mute unwanted signal reception 
over in the artsy silver lake area every time somebody puts 
in a new home recording studio i can count on losing my guy for two 
or three days kerby said 
katherine deaton an official at the federal communications 
commissions long beach office said kday has been checked for 
illegal power boosting but none was found 
kday is one of the best in terms of cooperation she said 
still pacific bell officials said they are fielding increasing 
complaints about rap music interference from telephone customers in 
the two neighborhoods 
on one of my phones you cant hear the person youre talking 
to because of it maria noriegapetti said on the other i can 
put my hand on the phone and hear the music

l douglas wilder stumped the 
mountain towns of southwest virginia on saturday for the votes to 
become the nations first elected black governor while his 
republican opponent stepped up attacks questioning wilders honesty 
j marshall coleman who has trailed his democratic opponent by 
4 to 11 percentage points in recent polls urged a black newspaper 
to release a taped interview in which he claimed wilder 
contradicted his public support for the death penalty 
coleman also repeated his charge that wilder pledged privately 
to the united mine workers union to sabotage the states 
righttowork law by allowing unions to assess dues on nonunion 
workers covered by union contracts and then denied making the 
promise 
i think the question we need to ask today is what other secret

showing him 9 percent ahead of coleman wilder shared his delight 
at an abingdon rally over the findings of the richmond 
timesdispatch poll because the newspaper is one of the few in the 
state that endorsed the gop ticket 
the poll in sundays editions showed wilder was favored by 45 
percent coleman had 36 percent and 19 percent had no preference 
the survey was based on interviews of 853 likely voters between 
oct 27 and nov 1 and had a margin of error of 3 percentage

at a rally outside the montgomery county courthouse in 
christianburg housewife marie moran told wilder she was going to 
vote for coleman until three days ago she told reporters she had 
supported coleman because of his antiabortion stance but was 
turned off by the republicans suggestion that wilder has received 
favored treatment from the media because he is black 
its time for virginia to have a black governor mrs moran 
said 
wilder made a point of mentioning mrs moran as he spoke at 
rallies throughout the region 
wilder was joined by his democratic running mates donald s 
beyer jr who is seeking to become lieutenant governor and 
attorney general mary sue terry who is running for reelection 
coleman campaigned in the shenandoah valley of northern virginia

coleman was joined by us sen john w warner who held up 
newspapers with frontpage stories about president bushs campaign 
swing friday with coleman warner repeated what bush told audiences 
in richmond and norfolk its important to have a friend in the 
white house 
flanked by warner and hud secretary jack kemp at a later 
appearance at dulles international airport in the washington dc 
suburb of chantilly coleman reiterated that the race all comes 
down to a question of trust 
state gop chairman donald w huffman said the richmond 
afroamerican newspaper published a story in january quoting wilder 
as saying he opposed the death penalty wilder later denied making 
the statement but huffman said the newspaper refused to release 
its reporters tape of the interview 
its a further act of desperation wilder said of the 
republicans call for release of the tape 
he reiterated his support of the states death penalty law and 
added that he did not recall the interview being tape recorded 
roxanne wilkins interim editor of the newspaper said the 
interview was recorded but she did not expect to release the tape

armenian nationalists who spent much of 
the year in jail won a political victory saturday when their 
republics communist party chief offered to work with a new 
political movement they organized 
its now high time for us to reunite armenian communist 
party chief suren arutyunyan said to the cheers of 1000 activists 
who attended the founding conference of the armenian allnational 
movement 
the conference to create an organization similar to the peoples 
front movements across the country was organized primarily by the 
karabakh committee the 11 committee members were arrested in 
december and held without trial for up to six months for organizing 
demonstrations and a general strike to support demands for transfer 
of the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh from neighboring 
azerbaijan to armenia 
the committee has since been legalized and saturday it was 
permitted use of yerevans palace of congresses to found a 
coalition for about 10 prodemocracy organizations 
it formally will adopt its program sunday 
attitudes toward grassroots political movements within the 
soviet union have varied widely in the past year party leader in 
the baltic republics are working closely with their peoples 
fronts but officials in the ukraine waged a media campaign against 
them 
karabakh committee member ambartsum galstyan said the armenian 
allnational movement planned to work within the parliamentary 
framework for democracy 
we are following the hungarian example he said referring 
to the soviet ally that has legalized opposition parties and seen 
its communist party dissolve itself and reform as a social 
democratic party 
galstyan said groups seeking armenian independence were not 
included in the new organization because the republic is not 
really ready for total independence the economy is that of a 
colonial country 
the new group wants to gain armenian control over 
nagornokarabakh a largely christian armenian enclave in primarily 
moslem azerbaijan where they claim decades of discrimination the 
territorial dispute has been the focus of 21 months of ethnic 
violence in which about 120 people have been killed 
the armenian allnational movements draft program also calls 
for a new treaty with the soviet union greater freedom of religion 
for the armenian orthodox church restoration of armenian holidays 
and the right of farmers to hold their own land and pass it on to 
their children 
it said only laws ratified by the armenian legislature should be 
valid in armenia

voters endorsed legalized gambling in 
hotelcasino resorts in balloting saturday in this economically 
depressed steel town 
voters supported gambling by 13309 votes or 604 percent to 
8733 votes or 396 percent against only 323 percent of the 
registered voters cast ballots on the nonbinding referendum 
despite the results gov evan bayh said late saturday that he 
will not support gambling in gary 
the results of the referendum are of course important but 
with such a low turnout i dont find them to be compelling bayh 
said in indianapolis 
mayor thomas v barnes a casino supporter said he believes the 
vote is the beginning of an economic resurgence in the town beset 
by high unemployment 
i sincerely believe you have said yes to gary indiana yes to 
our confidence in ourselves yes to our courage in facing the 
future and certainly yes to your confidence in your officials 
said barnes 
state legislators from gary had promised to bring the issue to 
the 1990 session of the general assembly if the referendum passed 
rep earline rogers of gary said the results send a clear 
message to the legislature today is not the end of a campaign 
today is the beginning of a campaign said rogers 
barnes and other casino advocates argue that gambling could turn 
around the fortunes of gary which fell on hard times after massive 
layoffs in the steel industry in the early 1980s 
opponents contend that casinos would bring more street crime and 
prostitution attract organized crime and disrupt neighborhoods 
im not convinced casino gambling is the magic wand i think 
most of the job opportunites wont go to gary residents said 
bayh 
barnes and casino opponents said the unusual voting date the 
first saturday ballot in city history and a reduction in polling 
places to 18 from the normal 159 had hurt the turnout 
but barnes maintained that a majority vote no matter what the 
turnout should be viewed as a clear endorsement of casino gambling 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the general assembly ordered the referendum as a compromise 
after legislators narrowly defeated a measure to approve casinos 
outright in gary 
a legislative study committee made up principally of garyarea 
legislators held hearings this summer and recommended that the 
assembly approve casino gambling if gary citizens endorse the idea 
casino industry officials told the committee that gary located 
within a halfhour of chicago and within a days drive of 30 
million people could support five hotelcasinos 
the industry estimates 10000 construction jobs and 27500 
casinorelated jobs could be created in a city where the 
unemployment rate in recent years has been twice the state and 
national averages 
the city has lost 30000 steel industry jobs since 1979 the 
committee was told and the population of gary has fallen from 
151000 in 1980 to 136000 basic city services became erratic and 
the police and fire departments were cut from 400 members each to 
200 
but casino opponents including ministers of several 
predominantly black churches in the city argued gary could wind up 
like atlantic city nj where a lot of casino jobs went to 
outsiders and unemployment remained high 
other opponents urged the city to pursue more traditional 
development such as trying to win a third major chicagoarea 
airport for the city and building a lakefront marina

fiorello la guardias granddaughter stood up at 
an italianamerican political breakfast one day last week and named 
her choice her whole familys choice she said for mayor 
it was not rudolph giuliani 
for giuliani who has styled himself as la guardias political 
progeny the psychic blow had to be enormous republican 
political strategist jay severin iii said later 
katherine la guardias choice was democrat david dinkins the 
longtime frontrunner she said giuliani a republican had made 
improper comparisons between himself and her grandfather a 
republican mayor from 193445 
her pick severin halfjoked capped a series of prophecies 
against giulianis campaign last summer president bush failed to 
pronounce his name correctly last month a dinner program listed 
him as randolph giuliani at a campaign stop thursday a 
seagull insulted his suit 
if these were lightly called omens opinion polls provided a 
more ominous message for giuliani with new york poised to elect 
its next mayor tuesday the pale exprosecutor has yet to strike a 
spark with most voters 
giuliani has made some fundamental strategic mistakes said 
john mollenkopf political science professor at the graduate center 
of the city university of new york he should have projected a 
more positive image 
instead giuliani 45 in his first run for elective office 
conducted what mollenkopf called a cutandslash campaign 
attacking dinkins competence and character in increasingly 
strident tones 
giuliani kept up the attack saturday night alleging in a debate 
that dinkins was involved in a coverup by not releasing details 
of a stock sale to his son and criticizing the democrat for failing 
to pay his taxes on time for four years 20 years ago 
people usually dont run for mayor in the city of new york who 
didnt pay their taxes for four years giuliani said 
dinkins countered by saying the former us attorney had no 
experience in government and had reversed himself by first opposing 
and then supporting public funding for abortion 
what we need is not a prosecutor but a mayor dinkins said 
the flaw in giulianis strategy analysts said has been his 
failure to establish himself as an alternative when dinkins 
support slid amid questions about his finances two weeks ago it 
moved to the undecided column rather than to giulianis 
rudy gave people a lot of reasons to vote against dinkins 
said severin who has not played a role in the campaign but in 
the end there wasnt enough time or money to give them reasons to 
vote for giuliani 
dinkins 62 has recovered solidly from a dive in the polls he 
successfully defended the stock sale to his son at a news 
conference admitted a pair of faulty votes and cut ties with two 
campaign aides accused of antisemitism 
a poll released saturday showed dinkins leading giuliani among 
likely voters 54 percent to 38 percent the poll conducted for 
wabctv and the daily news had a margin of error of 5 percentage 
points 
above all dinkins has drawn the election as a choice of 
political parties castigating republicaninspired cuts in urban 
programs while recruiting prominent democrats to campaign or 
advertise for him 
with democrats outnumbering republicans by 5to1 converting 
the contest between david dinkins and rudy giuliani to a contest 
between the democratic party and the republican party may have 
succeeded said raymond harding a chief giuliani adviser the 
hegemony of the democratic party is so great 
dinkins has other artillery and chief among it is the support 
of most city unions the central labor council of the aflcio says 
it will have 6700 volunteers on the street tuesday urging dinkins 
voters to the polls 
they have a veritable army conceded harding our side 
cannot compete with that he said the union pull could be worth 2 
or 3 percentage points for dinkins others say more 
one hope for giuliani is the lying factor harding said 
the possibility that some white voters may have been untruthful 
when the told pollsters they will vote for dinkins who is seeking 
to become the citys first black mayor he also said a good showing 
in weekend debates finally scheduled at the last minute after 
weeks of wrangling over details could provide a boost 
dinkins has focused on more specific goals concentrating in 
large part on shoring up his support among jewish voters some jews 
are wary of his friendship with jesse jackson who supports 
palestinian selfdetermination 
still mollenkopf a specialist in city voting patterns said it 
would be an overstatement to single out jews as a swing group 
because dinkins could lose half the jewish vote and still win the 
election handily

drug agents discovered an estimated 5 tons of 
cocaine buried beneath a toxic chemical inside hundreds of 
10gallon drums marked poison authorities said saturday 
the find which followed a threemonth investigation occurred 
at about 9 pm friday in a twostory warehouse in the borough of 
queens said capt james rogers of the city fire departments 
hazardous materials division 
there were no arrests made as of early saturday afternoon 
authorities said 
drug enforcement administration regional head robert stutman in 
a saturday news conference at the warehouse said the massive 
seizure indicated just how much cocaine is being shipped into the 
country his agency along with us customs was involved in the 
raid 
you dont have to be a brain surgeon to figure out that were 
being flooded with cocaine said stutman certainly in new 
york we have not seen any lessening of availability 
authorities estimate there were 11000 pounds of cocaine or 5 
tons when 214 tons of cocaine was seized in september in los 
angeles authorities there gave its street value at up to 1 
billion per ton however dea spokeswoman mary cooper said each ton 
of cocaine has a street value of 160 million 
as of late saturday 8800 pounds of cocaine had been retrieved 
from about twothirds of the barrels 
an anonymous tip led the dea and customs to investigate whether 
the warehouse was being used by a ring associated with the cali 
cartel in colombia customs agent richard mercier said 
the cocaine had been shipped from panama to philadelphia about a 
week ago and then was trucked to the warehouse mercier told the 
new york times 
the drug agents called fire department hazardous waste 
specialists when they discovered the drums also contained sodium 
hydroxide a caustic powder which can burn skin and damage lungs 
rogers said the cocaine was in plasticwrapped bricks and the 
caustic substance was then poured in around it 
firefighters opening drums at random found cocaine inside each 
one and the warehouse held 252 drums each container held about 15 
kilos roughly 33 pounds of cocaine rogers said 
they figure nobodys going to look inside chemicals because 
when you open the drums you expose yourself to toxic effects 
said rogers its like breathing ammonia 
carol boyd hallett who was sworn in as us customs 
commissioner just hours before fridays seizure said the new york 
cache combined with raids which netted more than 36 tons of 
cocaine last month show the drug war can be won 
there should be no doubt that our combined efforts are paying 
off said a statement issued by hallett in washington we are 
hurting the drug barons and were not going to let up 
in addition to the seizure in los angeles authorities last 
month seized 9 tons from a home in harlingen texas and 6 tons 
from a ship in the gulf of mexico

president bush is hoping his late 
appearances in virginia and new jersey boost the republican partys 
uphill candidacies for governor and urge more gop voters to the 
polls next tuesday 
bush was on the stump trying to pump up republican activists 
but he stayed clear of the volatile abortion issue that has been 
prominent in both governors races 
prochoice activists waving signs and chanting prochoice 
prochoice showed up at bushs outdoor rallies in both richmond 
va and bloomfield nj on friday 
bushs new jersey stop was for a rally aimed at boosting turnout 
for the critical state legislative races and helping rep james 
courter in his faltering governors race against democratic rep 
james florio 
bush and and courter did not mention abortion nor did gop 
gubernatorial candidate j marshall coleman in virginia where bush 
campaigned earlier friday

the virginia governors race could make 
history if l douglas wilder becomes the nations first elected 
black governor but the contest already has set records for 
spending 
campaign reports filed by the candidates last week showed 
wilder the democratic lieutenant governor has raised 646 
million republican j marshall coleman a former attorney general 
has gathered 805 million 
added to the 73 million spent by the two losers in the june 
gop primary total spending for the election should top 22 million 
that would make the race the most expensive in virginia history 
exceeded nationally only by past races in texas 331 million 
florida 24 million and california 225 million all are at 
least twice as populous as virginia which has more than 5 million

president bushs support of a pay raise for 
top government officials and members of congress returns it to the 
forefront just eight months after lawmakers were scorched by public 
backlash on the issue 
house leaders have been busy behind the scenes trying to arrange 
a pay increase coupled with ethics reforms hoping to get it 
accomplished this year before lawmakers become too wary with 
reelection concerns 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday that the 
president would support any reasonable proposal 
one congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the latest version included an 8 percent costofliving 
raise in january for members of congress and senior officials in

veterans secretary edward j derwinski will 
have to decide without the guidance he was looking for from an 
advisory panel whether to award benefits to some vietnam veterans 
exposed to agent orange 
derwinski is expected to make the decision around thanksgiving 
as the result of courtordered regulations for determining the 
relationship between exposure to the herbicide exposure and cancer 
nearly 12000 disability claims once denied by the va are now 
pending as a result of a court order issued in may by us district 
judge thelton e henderson in san francisco 
derwinski was looking for the environmental hazards advisory 
committee made up largely of scientists to clear up some of the 
arguments over agent orange but the panel in its first ruling on 
agent orange acknowledged friday that it couldnt come up with a 
definite conclusion

a shipment of frozen pork bellies may lack the golden symbolism 
of a boatload of wheat but thats of little concern to the hungry 
eastern european nations that have suddenly become hot markets for 
the cold commodity 
us pork bellies are headed for poland and yugoslavia and the 
soviet union has also signaled interest in the meat which is the 
part of a hog from which bacon is made 
the surge of foreign demand stems from a shortage of pork in 
europe and is a welcome surprise to us pork producers who 
watched porkbelly prices plunge to 18year lows earlier this year 
as supplies approached record highs 
the market reversed its downward course in august prices soared 
to new highs for the year this past week 
frozen pork bellies for delivery in february settled friday at 
5960 cents a pound compared to 5185 cents a week earlier and 
3830 cents on aug 9 when the price slide ended 
pork bellies have rarely been exported in the past and the 
international demand has given the market a whole new 
dimension said charles levitt an analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc in chicago 
the climb back from the august lows began when the national pork 
producers council and the american meat institute started lobbying 
the bush administration to include pork bellies in a planned 
package of us food aid to the newly democratized polish 
government according to charles harness a spokesman for the des 
moines iowabased pork group 
early in september the polish government put in a request for 
50000 metric tons of us bellies the ensuing negotiations led to 
the signing friday of an agreement to include up to 10000 tons of 
bellies in the polish food aid package 
separately a yugoslavianowned exporting company in new york 
impex overseas corp confirmed this past week that it recently 
bought nearly 150000 tons of pork bellies to be shipped to 
yugoslavia this month 
traditionally pork has always been bought from european 
countries said sanjin fabris traffic manager for impex but 
at the moment theres a big shortage of this product and any pork 
product in europe 
the yugoslavians may buy more us bellies if they are satisfied 
with the first shipment and prices retreat from this weeks high 
levels he said 
on thursday came news that soviet trade officials had approached 
the united states wanting to buy pork bellies and other meats 
but experts say it could take several months to remove trade 
barriers and allow the soviets to buy us bellies 
the surge in porkbelly prices helped lift hog futures prices on 
the chicago merc cattle futures were little changed in the past 
week

the japanese will own 51 percent of the 
christmas tree in rockefeller center this winter 51 percent of 
radio city music hall and 51 percent of the art deco skyscraper 
where tom brokaw and david letterman work 
the 846 million investment in rockefeller group inc this past 
week by mitsubishi estate co provoked a fresh spate of headlines 
about how foreigners japanese in particular were buying up 
america 
the headlines were understandable the deal involved the first 
family of american capitalism as well as a major tourist and media 
center it came a month after sony corps agreement to buy another 
cultural symbol columbia pictures entertainment inc 
what was often missed though is that while the japanese are 
buying in the united states americans are buying overseas as well 
a case in point is ford motor cos agreement this past week to buy 
the british luxury automaker jaguar plc for 25 billion 
the japanese have more capacity to invest abroad because of 
their towering trade surpluses but the americans are making 
certain not to lose out in the global acquisition game 
most us overseas purchases scarcely make news few noticed 
this past week when totes inc of ohio bought a west german 
umbrella distributor and renamed it totes deutschland or when 
international business machines corp bought onefifth of a dutch 
software company delaware computing from its belgian parent 
but despite the lack of publicity back home americans were the 
biggest crossborder buyer of companies in europe in the first half 
of 1989 according to britishamerican deal review 
when americans fear that their landmark real estate and their 
top corporations are being consumed by foreign predators they must 
remember that at the very same time america is the largest acquirer 
in europe said mark dixon the reviews editor 
the truth is that companies in all the major industrialized 
nations are investing overseas hoping to establish beachheads in 
each others markets and transform themselves into global 
competitors 
ford for example already is much more entrenched in europe 
than nissan motor co ltd or toyota motor corp is in the united 
states ibm is so well planted in foreign markets that it is 
perceived as a local company 
this is not something that started today or this week or last 
week the most dynamic element of international economic 
transactions over the past decade or two decades has been foreign 
direct investment said peter hansen executive director of the 
united nations center on transnational corporations 
the foreign investment that some americans fear is a problem 
that most third world nations would love to have they cant get 
foreign money to build essential factories roads and bridges 
flows of direct foreign investment are concentrated in 
developed countries more than ever before the united nations 
center said in a report earlier this year 
as crossborder investment continues to grow in the 1990s 
nations will pay more attention to whether the investment they get 
is productive or unproductive unfortunately channeling foreign 
money to desirable recipients wont be easy 
it doesnt really work because companies even in sectors 
which are being welcomed and encouraged are frightened that the 
winds will change and theyll be put on the blacklist said 
dixon the editor of britishamerican deal review 
maybe so in any case the level of debate over crossborder 
investment is bound to get more sophisticated people will worry 
less about who owns christmas trees and music halls and more about 
what improves the national welfare 
in other business and economic news this past week 
senate republicans effectively abandoned efforts to win a 
capitalgains tax cut this year it was a victory for the democrats 
and a defeat for president bush who just weeks ago seemed on the 
verge of meeting a taxcut promise that had been part of his 
campaign for the presidency 
the new york stock exchange announced fresh limits on 
computerized program trading in response to a wave of complaints 
that the strategy contributes to wild swings in stock prices 
several major brokerage firms announced voluntary limits on the use 
of program trading for themselves and customers 
georgiapacific corp offered 33 billion for another paper 
company great northern nekoosa corp in the first major takeover 
offer since the collapse of a 675 billion bid for ual corp by 
employees and management separately an investment group led by 
coniston partners said it would attempt to take over the ual board 
of directors to force a sale or restructuring of the company

among its many other afflictions wall street 
lately has come down with a new and acute case of cyberphobia 
the term defined simply as the fear of computers was coined 
decades ago when scientists first began to experiment with 
electronic methods of handling information and conducting business 
now it is focusing on the computerdriven tactics such as 
multiple transactions involving stockindex futures and individual 
stocks that are collectively known as program trading and are 
feared to be threatening severe harm to the integrity of the 
markets 
the latest outcry began in last months friday the 13th 
massacre when the dow jones industrial average fell more than 190 
points 
the market was perceived to be at the mercy of mindless 
computergenerated transactions governed only by a few flimsy 
untested safeguards adopted since the crash of 1987 
this is insanity said raymond f devoe jr in a commentary 
for legg mason wood walker inc the stock exchange has become a 
casino for players with everyone else taking it on the chin 
or as jay donnaruma at first albany corp in albany ny put 
it some kind of compromise should be reached before there is 
nothing left but computers trading with other computers 
actually most critics of the new trading techniques protest 
that they arent cyberphobes at all its not the use of computers 
they object to they say but the abuse of new systems for purposes 
never intended in the markets 
and besides they say you dont call it a phobia when the 
danger you fear is real 
we are not waxing nostalgic for the good old days devoe 
declared but something is terribly wrong the capital and stock 
markets used by a small number of players are being ruined for 
everyone else 
while those issues were debated stock prices managed to cut 
their october losses a bit in the past week the dow jones average 
of 30 industrials closed friday at 262951 up 3279 from the week 
before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 168 to 18728 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
064 to 45297 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 178 at 37179 
average volume on the big board came to 14818 million shares a 
day against 17501 million the week before 
the question of whether computers ought to play some role in 
stock trading seems to have been settled for good without the 
capacity they provided to process all types of orders everybody 
agrees the markets would surely have been overwhelmed on black 
monday in 1987 or in this years selloff 
furthermore the idea of outlawing program trading is nowhere 
near as simple as say banning speeding on a highway or smoking in 
a restaurant 
stockindex arbitrage is a broad and flexible strategy that 
could at least in theory be carried out in a lot of other places 
in the world if it werent permitted in us markets if index 
futures were outlawed substitutes to serve the same purpose might 
quickly appear 
faced with such obstacles opponents of program trading have 
turned of late with some apparent success to political pressure 
and moral suasion 
money managers at a few investing institutions have withdrawn 
or threatened to withdraw their business from brokers that engage 
in program activity 
a few corporate executives have pressured officials in the 
markets where their stocks are traded to restrict the practice 
many brokerage firms have responded by vowing to swear off or at 
least cut down on program activity late last week the nyse 
announced a series of measures designed to restrain its impact 
meanwhile it was all too easy to imagine an innovator working 
somewhere on wall street on a new hightech trading system for the 
1990s that might settle the issue of program trading by rendering 
it obsolete
