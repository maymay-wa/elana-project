one of the abductors of scott heimdal the 
american gold miner who was kidnapped in ecuadors jungle on april 
28 and freed after 61 days in captivity has been arrested police 
said wednesday 
they identified him as a member of a colombian guerrilla group 
who lived in neighboring ecuador and said he was tied in with a 
colombian drug trafficker who was freed from prison by a guerrilla 
attack 
the police communique said according to our investigations 
the kidnappers of scott heimdal are roberto andres moreno and his 
brother ruben dario who are members of the peoples liberation 
army and luis pablo tobar a drug trafficker freed from the prison 
of tena 
in his hometown of peoria ill heimdal said he had no way of 
knowing if those arrested were responsible for his kidnapping and 
questioned whether they would ever be found 
those names mean nothing to me heimdal said in a telephone 
interview wednesday night i suppose its possible but not very 
the jungles a very very big place the only way i would know if 
it were them is if i saw a photograph 
heimdal said the name of the group that kidnapped him is the 
popular liberation army not the peoples liberation army named in 
the police report 
the police report said the brothers are from ecuador and that 
tobar is colombian only roberto andres moreno has been arrested

the peoples liberation army operates along the colombiaecuador 
border on the western edge of the amazon rain forest

tobar when tobar was imprisoned in tena a village in ecuadors 
eastern jungle 
colombian guerrillas attacked the prison in august 1988 and 
freed tobar and other four colombian drug traffickers according to 
officials reports two police officers were killed 
heimdals captors asked for ransom money to press their fight 
against the colombian government 
heimdal 28 was released june 29 after his family paid a ransom 
of 60000 most of the money came from donations from his hometown 
heimdals parents came to ecuador to secure his release 
following secret negotiations they all left quito for peoria on 
july 2 
last april 28 a band of men wearing camouflage uniforms and 
carrying assault rifles seized heimdal when he was in a canoe 
heimdal was traveling on the bermeja river the kidnapping took 
place in the jungle about five miles from the colombian border and 
100 miles northeast of quito 
heimdal had been working with iminco a gold mining company 
since october he operated electronic equipment to locate gold 
deposits on the river bottom and also oversaw construction of a 
large dredge

a penny apiece 
the newspaper quoting police sources said that in one incident 
a red army soldier reported having been approached last month by a 
hungarian man and a woman who said they wanted to buy his ak47 
assault rifle 
soviet military authorities alerted hungarian police who found 
out that the wouldbe buyers were a hungarian bricklayer and a 
prostitute the two were detained and then released since they 
could not be charged with any crime the newspaper said

as saying two hungarian soldiers were caught recently with duffel 
bags filled with automatic pistol parts that they said they bought 
from soviet soldiers

an african national congress 
leader who returned from exile under a government grant of immunity 
has reportedly been detained by police for questioning in an 
investigation of guerrilla activities an anc spokesman said 
thursday 
chief anc spokesman ahmed kathrada said he received information 
from a reliable source wednesday night about the detention of mac 
maharaj a fellow member of the ancs 35person national executive 
committee 
maharaj who is affiliated with the south african communist 
party was among the first of the exiled anc leaders to return to 
south africa this spring after the whiteminority government 
legalized the black nationalist movement he had worked at the 
ancs exile headquarters in lusaka zambia 
president fw de klerk granted temporary immunity from 
prosecution to members of the ancs executive committee to allow 
them to return to the country for negotiations the immunity 
covered past offenses but not activities considered illegal since 
the exiles return 
kathrada would not reveal the source for his information about 
maharajs detention but described it as reliable 
dozens of anc guerrillas who recently infiltrated the country 
have been arrested according to south african press reports 
police say they have seized weapons including grenade launchers 
mines and combat rifles 
many of those arrested are being held under the internal 
security act which allows indefinite detention without trial 
kathrada said the anc will discuss the recent wave of arrests 
with the government and reiterated his organizations objections to 
the internal security act 
police spokesmen were unable early thursday to confirm the 
report of maharajs arrest they have not named any of the others 
detained for questioning in the investigation of anc guerrilla 
activities 
the ancs internal chairman walter sisulu has said that 150 anc 
members have been arrested recently and that the detentions go 
against the spirit of the talks held between the anc and the 
government in may 
the anc has confirmed that its guerrillas continue to infiltrate 
south africa but denies police and media reports of an anc plot to 
seize power if political negotiations fail 
 
the anc supports a guerrilla campaign against the whiteled 
government but it has not carried out any major attacks this year 
 
the anc the countrys leading black opposition group says it 
will not suspend or call off its ineffective armed struggle until a 
formal treaty is negotiated with the government 
 
de klerk has rejected demands by conservative whites that he 
break off talks with the anc because of the reported guerrilla 
activities 
de klerk says he will meet aug 6 with nelson mandela and other 
top anc leaders to try and clear the way for negotiations on 
sharing political power with the black majority 
 
the anc says that before formal constitutional negotiations can 
begin the government must allow 20000 anc exiles to return without 
fear of arrest and release some 3000 people convicted of 
politically motivated crimes on wednesday night mandela praised 
thousands of armed men and boys for defending their neighborhoods 
in a township where at least 21 people died this week in fighting 
between black factions 
you have the support of the anc in everything that you do 
the leader of the african national congress told the crowd of 
2000 who waved spears axes sticks and chairlegs and chanted 
anc in the township of sebokeng 
mandela pleaded for sebokeng to return to normal after three 
days of fighting arson street blockades work and school boycotts 
residents and police say at least 21 people died sunday after 
members of the zulubased inkatha party headed by mangosuthu 
buthelezi staged a rally in sebokeng south of johannesburg 
armed inkatha members left the rally and clashed with township 
residents who were warned for days by anc leaders that inkatha 
planned to attack them fighting continued sporadically tuesday 
night and spread to neighboring evaton 
mandela deputy president of the anc said sebokeng was an anc 
stronghold and blamed the violence on inkatha we are happy to 
note that you made a stand against the thugs and killers who came 
from outside in order to kill our people he told the angry crowd 
of young blacks 
the inkatha vs anc violence has killed 5000 people in natal 
province the past five years the sebokeng battle was the worst 
outbreak of the feud outside natal 
both the anc and inkatha oppose apartheid but differ on ways to 
fight racial segregation in south africa

tropical storm arthur with heavy rains and wind up 
to 70 mph strengthened wednesday and forecasters warned that it 
could turn into a hurricane threatening parts of puerto rico and 
the dominican republic 
the dominican republic issued a tropical storm watch for the 
south coast of the island after arthur pushed across the windward 
islands and into the caribbean sea a similar watch was in effect 
for the south coast of puerto rico 
forecasters said a hurricane watch could be issued for parts of 
those areas late wednesday 
arthur was expected to remain very near to hurricane 
intensity through early thursday without reaching sustained winds 
of 74 mph that would classify it as a hurricane said mark zimmer 
hurricane specialist at the national hurricane center in suburban 
coral gables 
we think that there is more than a 5050 percent chance that 
it wont become a hurricane he said but there is certainly 
the chance that in the next 12 to 18 hours it could go ahead and 
reach hurricane intensity 
at 10 pm edt arthur was centered near latitude 142 north and 
longitude 655 west or about 420 miles southeast of santo domingo 
dominican republic it was moving northwest at about 15 mph and was 
expected to continue that motion through the next day or two said 
bob sheets director of the hurricane center 
arthur the 1990 atlantic hurricane seasons first named storm

the two koreas signed a historic 
agreement thursday setting up the first meetings between prime 
ministers of the hostile states since the korean peninsula was 
divided more than 40 years ago 
the 19point agreement calls for meetings in seoul from sept 
47 to discuss the easing of political and military confrontations 
multilateral exchanges and cooperation on the divided peninsula 
a second meeting is to be held in the communist north korean 
capital of pyongyang from oct 1619 
this precious fruit will open a decisive chapter in a road to 
ending national division and achieving peaceful unification said 
song hanho the chief south korean delegate 
we can no longer shun the changing international situation 
he said we should rather actively respond to this and use it as 
an opportunity to pursue national prosperity and forging a new 
history 
representatives of both countries signed the agreement in the 
truce village of panmunjom inside the 2milewide demilitarized 
zone separating the two koreas 
later thursday five north koreans arrived on the northern side 
of the border presumably in preparation to cross into south korea 
a delay in their arrival however was first blamed on bad 
weather and later on lastminute meetings south korean officials 
finally said there were indications the crossing might be called 
off but they did not elaborate 
the north koreans would be the first to cross the border with 
the approval of both governments since 1985 when dozens of 
separated family members were allowed brief reunions 
the north koreans were scheduled to take part in a twoday 
conference with south korean opposition activists to discuss plans 
for an unprecedented joint rally calling for unification of their 
divided peninsula both nations desire unification but on their own 
terms 
three south korean dissidents were allowed into the border 
security area to wait for the north koreans while dozens of others 
prepared to welcome them a few miles away 
lets become one nation and tear down the iron wall of 
division read placards at the welcome site about 100 radical 
students sang solidarity songs while awaiting the north koreans 
twelve riot police buses were parked in the area but police 
remained out of sight 
south korean dissidents said the unification rally was expected 
to be held in panmunjom on aug 15 a sentimental holiday on both 
sides of the border celebrating the 1945 liberation of korea after 
35 years of japanese colonial rule 
the rally would mark the first contact between civilian 
organizations of the two koreas in the past south korean 
authorities have blocked such contacts out of fear they could turn 
into radical antigovernment protests 
the planned prime ministers meetings and the unification rally 
could serve as indicators of the future course of relations between 
communist north korea and prowestern south korea bitter enemies 
for more than four decades 
the korean peninsula was divided after world war ii and two 
separate governments were formed in 1948 north and south korea 
fought a threeyear war that ended in 1953 no peace treaty has 
been signed and they are still technically at war 
by signing the accord for a prime ministers meeting north korea 
grants tacit recognition to the legitimacy of the seoul government 
a recognition denied since 1948 
prime ministers kang younghoon of south korea and yon hyung muk 
of north korea are considered figureheads in their respective 
governments with limited policymaking roles 
but their meeting is symbolically significant because it would 
be the highestlevel contacts ever between the two rival states 
the most powerful figures in the two countries are president roh 
taewoo of south korea and kim il sung the north korean president 
and communist leader 
despite sporadic talks on exchanges and easing tension there 
has been little real progress in improving relations between the 
koreas 
the korean border is one of the most heavily fortified in the 
world more than 15 million troops are deployed on both sides 
there is no mail travel or other communication between the two 
sides 
last week roh proposed that the border be opened for five days 
in midaugust on a trial basis allowing people on both sides free 
travel 
north korea rejected rohs proposal but has said it is willing 
to open the border on a limited basis on aug 15 to koreans 
desiring unification the north also demanded that seoul scrap its 
anticommunist national security laws and release prisoners jailed 
for promoting unification

the new summertime movie thriller 
arachnophobia is bugging dr michael h robinson a spider 
expert who accuses hollywood of spinning a web of deceit about his 
favorite creepycrawly 
its a pity to give spiders a bad name says robinson 
director of the national zoo and former director of the american 
arachnological society its very sad that we should be so 
irrational about them and see movies that reinforce all those 
ancient primitive fears about spiders 
robinson an englishborn biologist spent 20 years studying 
spiders in panama papua new guinea and more than a dozen other 
tropical countries he was outraged when he saw a newspaper 
advertisement for the steven spielbergfrank marshall movie about a 
monstrous vampire spider that terrorizes a california family 
eight legs two fangs and an attitude the ad reads its 
jaws with legs warns one film critic 
arachnophobia which means fear of spiders is about a 
huge venezuelan spider that hitchhikes in a coffin to a small town 
in california besides breeding an army of deadly offspring it 
leaps to sink its fangs into human victims paralyzing them in 
seconds with a lethal neurotoxin and sucking their bodies dry 
robinson immediately summoned a reporter to issue a protest 
this bloody movie is making horrific allegations about 
spiders and they are so important to the ecology of the world and 
so incredibly beneficial to mankind that i decided they need some 
good press he said 
robinson hailed spiders as natures pest exterminator ridding 
the earth of billions and billions of houseflies roaches 
mosquitoes and other insects every year 
without spiders he said human beings would be overwhelmed by 
winged creatures that would destroy crops and threaten to leave the 
planet virtually uninhabitable 
ordinary spiders are perfectly harmless and they are marvelous 
friends to have around the house robinson said 
if they give you a severe case of the shudders he said simply 
cover them with a water glass slide a sheet of paper underneath 
and carry them safely outside the house dont stomp on them or 
flush them down the toilet he pleaded 
not only are spiders great for gobbling pests robinson said 
but they are wonderful objects of scientific study 
the sex life of spiders is absolutely bizarre he said 
a lot of the details cant be published in a family newspaper 
but robinson speaks in awed tones of the antennalike things on a 
male spiders forehead that suck up sperm deposits like 
oldfashioned fountain pens 
in his elaborate courtship ritual he said the male spins a 
silk mating thread and serenades his female friend by strumming 
it like a guitar and during their nuptial embrace he said 
every hair stands on end its quite exciting to see 
of the thousands of spider species in the world robinson said 
only three are poisonous to humans the black widow the brown 
recluse and the dreaded australian funnel web spider or atrax 
robustus which is very aggressive and whose repeated bites 
will kill a person within a few hours 
the tarantulas used in filming arachnophobia actually are 
pretty innocuous robinson said their main weapon is not their 
venom which is no more dangerous than a bee sting but their 
ability to launch clouds of barbed hairs that produce an irritating 
skin rash 
the american association of poison control centers says it has 
reports of only two human fatalities from spider bites in the 
united states in a recent threeyear period both involved elderly 
people with medical complications a spokeswoman said 
even little miss muffett had nothing to fear from spiders 
robinson said the nursery rhyme heroine was a reallife little 
girl named patience muffett who not only shared her seat with 
spiders but apparently ate them too 
her father was dr thomas muffett a 16th century english 
physician who frequently prescribed pills containing spiders to 
treat his patients including patience

david souters start in upholding the law 
came at concord high school where classmates pegged the popular 
member of the hall traffic squad as destined for bigger and better 
things 
their prediction has proven true souter is a senate 
confirmation away from one of the nations highest honors a seat 
on the supreme court 
yet it appears his meteoric rise in the legal community has done 
little to change the man whom classmate john prowse remembers from 
his traffic squad days 
i guess that was the first enforcement duty that he had and 
let me tell you he was good at it prowse said in an interview 
tuesday 
soutie as souters classmates called him still lives in 
the same house he grew up in a modest clapboard and shingled 
building tucked away on a tiny dirt road in weare a town of 4500 
people a dozen miles from concord 
and judging from the praise being heaped on him from fellow 
lawyers and judges he is viewed no differently now than 33 years 
ago when concords class of 57 voted him most sophisticated most 
literary and most likely to succeed 
the life of the 50yearold bachelor now is most likely to be 
dissected as the senate prepares for confirmation hearings and 
interest groups involved in the abortion debate and other 
contentious issues scour souters record for hints of how he might 
vote as a supreme court justice 
friends and associates say people will find that souter the man 
is much like souter the boy modest considerate frugal 
studious humorous and anything but controversial he has a small 
circle of friends choosing instead to spent much of his time 
alone studying and interpreting the law his breaks for recreation 
are spent hiking the hills and mountains of new hampshire his home 
since age 11 
im very happy to go off alone souter once said 
prowse remembers his boyhood friend as one of the rare people 
who transcended all the cliques in high school we called them the 
jocks and the brains back then everyone thought very highly of 
him 
he was an honor student student council member and yearbook 
staffer beginning his lifelong hobbies of collecting books and 
stamps while gaining a reputation as an intellectual 
friends say souter balances his bookwormish image with a biting 
sense of humor 
on one of his few notsogood days at high school a teacher 
returned a paper to souter with the admonition it was so bad he 
should take it home and wrap the garbage with it prowse says 
im not in the habit of wrapping my garbage in bond paper 
was souters quick retort according to prowse who said his friend 
meant no disrespect but often used his dry wit to break up school 
monotony 
prowse laughs today at a yearbook reference that souter enjoyed 
giving and attending scandalous parties 
this was the 1950s when scandalous meant that the parents 
werent home prowse said pot then was something you put on 
the stove and grass was something that you mowed and most of us 
didnt have our first beer until we were in the military or 
sophomores in college 
friends now say souter rarely stays long at social functions 
generally saying he needs to go home to work thats where the 
white house found him sunday tucked away in the house that could 
easily be mistaken for vacant its mailbox listing to the left its 
paint chipping and a doghouse out back all but overrun with high 
grass 
his love of the outdoors is easily understandable the roads 
leading to the house offer a stunning view of the states rolling 
hills the nighttime sky is breathtaking 
souters dedication to his work friends say can be traced to 
his youth when he often lingered so long at new hampshire 
historical society exhibits that he had to be asked to leave 
he exhibited similar commitment during stints as an overseer of 
dartmouth medical school and as a board member and president of 
concord hospital colleagues say 
i never worked so hard in my life than when he was here 
said the hospitals current president richard warner but while 
serving as master of ceremonies for a retirement party souter 
displayed the most fantastic dry sense of humor that you can 
imagine 
souter lived with his mother most of his life but she now 
resides in nearby concord in a retirement home now 82 she takes 
his confirmation for granted and says she will miss his frequent 
visits 
the nomination has brought a gush of pride to new hampshire 
at cinders country store a few miles from souters home an 
outdoor sign promoting the pizza was rearranged tuesday so a new 
message could be added in the middle good luck david souter

he haunts the forbidding jungles of 
south india with his band of thieves slaughtering elephants for 
their ivory and smuggling tons of fragrant sandalwood police want 
him for the murders of 20 policemen and forest officers 
residents in this poor village of ironred earth worship him as 
a robin hood and priest hes built them temples stocked a 
reservoir with fish and attends wedding ceremonies incognito 
presenting newlyweds with gifts 
he appears to have friends in high places and once escaped 
police custody reportedly by paying a 17000 bribe 
his only name is veerappan the 38yearold outlaw is indias 
most wanted man and hes managed to elude a dragnet of hundreds of 
officers 
in april after the killings of four police officers two 
southern states of karnataka and tamil nadu formed a task force of 
more than 800 officers to catch him the manhunt operation snap 
is the biggest in indias 43 years as an independent country 
the investigation in karnataka is led by ku shetty a 
51yearold inspector general of police who has vowed to capture 
the outlaw alive 
in addition to hundreds of officers shetty is using two 
helicopters night vision devices jeeps automatic weapons and 
hightech communications equipment the operation recently took 
over veerappans hometown of gopinatham turning the local 
elementary school into its headquarters 
in tamil nadu superintendent of police krishnaswami 
gopalakrishnan wants veerappan dead gopalakrishnan a 36yearold 
former karate instructor with a penchant for gold chains has 
formed a band of 14 highly trained men dubbed the liquidators 
for the task 
i dont need all that fancy stuff like helicopters he said 
in an interview several days after emerging from a threeweek hunt 
in the jungle were just going to blow him away 
gopalakrishnans men recently gave him a brass statue of sir 
lancelot the legendary british knight to motivate me to slay 
this dragon he said with a loud laugh 
so far veerappan remains on the lam in the forests often 
sleeping in two places during the night 
known for his thick black mustache and protruding adams apple 
veerappan had a jungle wedding in january to a shepherds teenage 
daughter 
soon afterward veerappan allegedly killed again in his 
hometown while more than 250 officers slept in barracks 50 feet 
away someone crept into the house of an alleged police informant 
at 315 am and shot him as he slept 
police call veerappan a oneman ecological disaster in his two 
decades in the jungle they say he has killed 500 elephants for 
their tusks and smuggled out thousands of tons of sandalwood which 
is used for oils soap and furniture it is sent mostly to the 
middle east 
the main problem in catching veerappan is that few villagers are 
willing to help police say 
when they do horrible things happen 
in january 1989 veerappan invited five men whom he suspected 
were police informers to a village feast as they washed their 
hands before the meal police say veerappan stood behind them with 
an elephant gun and fired his men later chopped the bodies into 
pieces and floated them down the nearby cauvery river in gunny 
sacks 
i will say nothing about veerappan except that hes a good man 
and pays well said kumar gounder an elderly villager in 
gopinatham who cuts sandalwood for the fugitive when my child 
was sick he gave me medicine 
numerous news reports say veerappan and his smuggling ring are 
linked to officials in karnataka state who profit from his schemes 
in november 1986 a forest service officer captured veerappan 
while he was shopping for weapons in a gun store in bangalore 
karnatakas capital he turned veerappan over to police a few days 
later veerappan escaped 
police at the time said he oiled his hands and slipped off his 
handcuffs subsequent news reports said veerappan paid thousands of 
dollars to gain his freedom 
veerappan started his career as an apprentice to a legendary 
elephant poacher who abandoned crime 10 years ago after his son 
became a judge 
veerappans parents were farmers tilling the poor earth around 
the kollegal forest just a few generations earlier his people 
lived in the jungle as members of the nomadic padiachi gounder 
tribe 
a lack of opportunity in gopinatham turned veerappan and his two 
brothers to crime police have already jailed his brothers on 
murder and robbery charges 
only when authorities linked veerappan and his men to the deaths 
of police officers did the manhunt begin in earnest 
but there has been criticism of the operation to hunt down 
veerappan karnatakas state assembly recently debated a proposal 
to disband the task force because it was making little progress 
gopalakrishnan also has voiced concern that his colleagues on 
the other side of the state border are not aggressive enough 
what do you mean they arrested them he said after learning 
of the recent capture of two alleged gang members the job is to 
liquidate them

cuba may tout itself as a bastion of communism in 
the western hemisphere but theres evidence of creeping 
capitalism fidel castro is an enthusiastic advocate of bigger 
paychecks for workers in key areas of the economy 
the cuban president and revolutionary leader faced with cuts in 
soviet aid that will force his country to sink or swim has come a 
long way from the view that workers could be induced by moral 
suasion to increase their output 
in a recent speech castro railed against what he called 
technocrats who had the crazy idea that farm workers would 
exert themselves while earning 80 pesos a month less than 70 
he expressed admiration for the way in which the most developed 
capitalist countries such as japan have been able to maintain 
high production by subsidizing farm income 
he said farmers should be paid whatever is required for them to 
produce more in the past castro has resisted using increased pay 
to boost production arguing that other alternatives must be 
explored 
cuba also is experimenting with a new system under which workers 
in key sectors such as tourist hotel construction can earn more 
than doctors and other professionals 
cuban officials now believe the surest path out of the current 
economic crisis is through increased tourism from countries with 
convertible currencies canada west germany spain and italy 
to speed construction at some tourism projects workers get not 
only premium pay but also easier access to prized appliances such 
as color televisions 
they are not asked to perform offhours volunteer work a 
common practice in cuba and they get to live in quarters far more 
comfortable than the average cuban officials say 
the work is arduous the laborers live away from their families 
but the material rewards are substantial 
a cuban journalist said the perquisites offered to these workers 
are such that there have been angry clashes with less privileged 
workers 
but castro apparently feels that a bit of class warfare is a 
small price to pay if it means that cuba will be able to reverse 
its steady economic decline 
the need for dollars has become more acute now that cuba 
because of uncertainty over future economic dealings with the 
soviet union may need hard cash to meet its oil needs 
under an economic cooperation agreement the soviets provide 
cuba with about 90 million barrels of oil annually 
even in inflated dollars the tourism income is only a fraction 
of what it was during the last year before castro came to power 
1958 the government is hoping for an increase of almost fivefold 
in the number of tourists between now and 1995 
castros reforms could boost production but they also carry the 
risk of bringing to cuba some of the ills of capitalist society 
for example laggard workers on some priority projects are 
subject to dismissal a penalty once unheard of 
there also is a campaign to make companies selffinancing and to 
put an end to inflated payrolls an ailment that castro says has 
afflicted cuba for all 31 years of the revolution 
reform of this type has meant an increase in unemployment the 
government has long since dropped the claim that every cuban in the 
labor force has a job throngs of people can be seen each day at 
the governmentrun employment office 
an added element in the reform campaign is that people are being 
encouraged as never before to speak their minds about the 
revolutions shortcomings 
while constructive criticism is welcome nowadays there is a low 
tolerance threshold for cubans who cross the line of criticism into 
opposition for these cubans the price often is imprisonment

president bushs first appointment to the 
supreme court and the speed of the announcement are helping him 
score points with conservatives and moderates while temporarily 
defusing the emotional abortion argument 
moderates generally seem comfortable with the fact that david h 
souter although billed as a conservative has left no paper trail 
yet as a federal appeals court judge particularly on the abortion 
issue 
and conservatives seem to be rejoicing in the mere fact that 
souter came with a strong recommendation from white house chief of 
staff john sununu 
since sununu is the republican right wings unofficial liaison 
with the white house his seal of approval must mean that souters 
conservative credentials are impeccable the reasoning goes 
and while bush has sought to minimize sununus role in souters 
selection senior white house officials suggest privately that the 
former new hampshire governors role was one of direct advocacy for 
the man he placed on his state supreme court in 1983 
bushs quick naming of souter caught abortion rights activists 
and opponents off guard cutting off any efforts on their part to 
mount massive prenomination lobbying campaigns 
but at the same time some white house officials privately have 
voiced concern that the presidents rapid naming of souter mainly 
with only sununu vouching for him has shortcircuited the system 
of elaborate background checks 
although his background was routinely checked when he was 
nominated earlier this year to the federal appeals court in boston 
he as yet has not received the degree of scrutiny to which other 
highlevel appointees have been subject 
and while souters lifestyle seems spartan and his judicial 
views seem strict constructionist some administration 
conservatives suggest there is a high potential for surprise once 
souter is on the bench 
bush for the time being seems to be having it both ways with the 
appointment not alienating either conservatives or moderates and 
it isnt the first time his administration has been able to gloss 
over a controversial subject and appease rival wings of the party 
at the same time 
for instance vice president dan quayle often seem at odds with 
bush on issues involving relations with the soviet union taking a 
harderline stand 
when that happens spokesmen for both bush and quayle quickly 
insist the two leaders are on the same wavelength when in fact 
quayles words have been mainly designed for conservative audiences 
sununu has been known to practice the same verbal 
sleightofhand 
for instance shortly after bush entered budget negotiations 
pledging there were no preconditions sununu was putting out 
the word that the president likely would reject any tax proposal 
made by democrats 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater disavowed sununus 
comments saying they didnt reflect the views of the president 
but was sununu in the doghouse not on your life his words were 
designed to provide a reassuring signal to conservatives that the 
president wasnt about to abandon his opposition to new taxes 
of course that was before bush specifically revoked his no 
new taxes pledge 
on the abortion issue bush has managed to soften some of the 
edges of his position even as he asserts that hes strongly 
antiabortion 
bush says he opposes government funding for any abortions other 
than those to save the life of the mother but he also says that if 
there isnt government money involved supports a womans right to 
abortion in cases of rape or incest 
earlier in his career bush voiced support for the roe vs wade 
supreme court ruling that he now says he would like to see 
overturned 
there has always been a perception among some womens groups 
that first lady barbara bush does not share her presidents 
antiabortion views 
she declines to address the issue but her silence only 
reinforces that perception and further blurs the edges of bushs 
stance 
this may have helped bush escape some of the vitriol that 
prochoice activists have directed at other political leaders 
including former president reagan who oppose abortion rights 
in the same way sununus role in the selection of souter for 
the supreme court is enabling bush to escape criticism from 
antiabortion activists who would have preferred a candidate with a 
proven judicial antiabortion record 
meanwhile bush has said his position has not changed on 
abortion at least since the last time he changed it 
but his record for standing by a position no longer has much 
credibility even with republican audiences since his aboutface 
on no new taxes 
a gop audience in philadelphia laughed on tuesday when he said 
he was going to leave before the broccoli was served but it howled 
and applauded when he added im going to stay with my position 
you know i never change my position on anything

a move to impose energy taxes as a way of 
trimming the federal budget deficit would severely hurt farmers and 
smalltown people says the national rural electric cooperative 
association 
rural electric systems operate at cost and are owned by their 
customers said bob bergland executive vice president of the 
association any price increase caused by energy taxes would be 
paid by consumers 
rural consumers cant escape bergland said tuesday they 
are the equity owners of the electric systems which provide 
electricity to them 
bergland who was secretary of agriculture in the carter 
administration joined natural gas and electric utility leaders to 
protest any move by the bush administration to raise money by 
imposing new energy taxes 
one type of tax that has been suggested would base the tax on 
the amount of carbon in the fuel coal petroleum and natural gas 
would be taxed but nuclear hydroelectric and solar energy would 
not because they contain no carbon an air pollutant 
still another plan would base the tax on the amount of energy 
measured in british thermal units or btus that a fuel contains 
the btu tax would apply to all fuels 
bergland whose member coops serve more than 25 million people 
said the rural economy has taken severe shocks the last decade 
through droughts floods falling commodity prices plummeting land 
price and a sharp decline in federal funding for rural areas 
energy taxes will unfairly penalize rural areas which already 
have higher electricity rates either by driving up the price of 
fuel used to generate electricity or by taxing the selling price of 
electricity he said 
a joint statement protesting the use of energy taxes was signed 
by bergland george lawrence president of the american gas 
association tom kuhn president of the edison electric institute 
and larry hobart executive director of the american public power 
association 
the burden of broadbased energy taxes will fall unevenly 
across consumers and income classes among industries and across 
regions of the country the statement said this is unfair and 
inequitable taxation 
btu and carboncontent taxes were described as inherently 
regressive such taxes were said capable of raising at least 14 
billion a year 
heating lighting cooking and water heating are not luxuries 
but essentials the statement said lowerincome families 
already pay three to four times more of their income for energy 
than the average american family

it was a night of anomaly at the mostly mozart 
festival 
a cambridgeeducated musician conducted haydns oxford 
symphony a mozart piano concerto was played with cadenzas nearly 
200 years older than it a clarinetist of remarkable talent showed 
himself to be his own worst enemy 
the concert tuesday also raised an important issue how a 
performers interpretation can cross the border into arrogance 
the conductor was mark elder and he was joined by belfastborn 
pianist barry douglas in the piano concerto no 22 in eflat k 
482 and richard stoltzman in mozarts a major clarinet concerto 
k 622 
stoltzman 48 a fixture at mostly mozart for more than a 
decade has joined that rare species a windplaying superstar 
like jeanpierre rampal heinz holliger or james galway in demand 
with concertbookers and a guaranteed sellout 
he is unquestionably one of the great clarinet players known 
for his ability to play incredibly softly his smooth articulation 
his technique 
but many clarinetists dislike him intensely whether it be 
jealousy distaste at his crossover into jazz wide vibrato which 
is unusual for a clarinetist or highly personal interpretations 
in the mozart concerto tuesday his little additions of ornament 
were reasonably tasteful the large size of avery fisher hall 
smoothed over his vibrato his excessive tonguing of fast notes was 
acceptable though sometimes distracting 
but stoltzmans taffychewing distortion of rhythm in an attempt 
to be expressive was so severe that the music lost shape lines 
didnt unfurl they jerked back and forth obscured by the 
soloists shadow mozart lost even the orchestra seemed tentative 
at times 
but another anomaly stoltzman played the slow movement one of 
mozarts greatest with surpassing serenity he was simple to the 
point and communicated directly with the audience 
but stoltzman again trying to be different broke the spell 
with an ungainly inappropriate sounding cadenza instead of the one 
mozart wrote for his clarinet quintet also in a major which is 
traditionally played here 
cadenzas also figured prominently in the piano concerto they 
were by benjamin britten and had elements of rachmaninoff and 
debussy despite the clash of periods they are wonderful and 
somehow fitting and the 29yearold douglas seemed to play them 
with particular affinity 
douglas arrived after winning the 1986 tchaikovsky competition 
in moscow as the first nonrussian since van cliburn and also is 
given to unusual interpretations he played the concerto with a 
good deal of romance inflecting phrases in a personal but not 
excessive way 
the conductor kept the orchestra in extremely close ensemble 
with soloist elder director of the english national opera 
appropriately let the winds sing out a good course in a concerto 
which is really chamber music for piano strings and winds 
unlike stoltzman douglas seemed weaker in the soulful slow 
movement his melodies having a toodreamy almost formless 
quality there was some particularly fine interplay with the 
orchestra in the final rondo douglas seemed really to be 
listening in all it was a highlevel if not superlative 
performance 
in the succeeding symphony no 92 in g major nicknamed the 
oxford elder brought out a larger range of colors than is 
usually heard in haydn and better balanced the orchestras 
sections

are his arms tired dutch aviator eppo harbrink numan isnt kidding 
when he says it 
numan 49 claims to be the first person to cross the atlantic 
in an ultralight aircraft 
my arms were getting tired in the end he said tuesday at an 
airport in suburban st hubert where he landed sunday from 
northern quebec 
unlike a conventional airplane the motorized ultralight is 
maneuvered using a horizontal bar like a hang glider 
numan said he began his journey 11 weeks ago leaving the 
netherlands for northern scotland then skipping to iceland and 
greenland before arriving on baffin island thursday 
the aviator said the trip was to call attention to the 
environment 
he has campaigned for five years to get the united nations to 
establish international legislation to restore and protect the 
environment in march he sold his cafe to help pay the 30000 
us cost to make the flight 
numan said bad weather kept him on the ground repeatedly 
the sevenhour flight over greenland was the most spectacular 
part of his flight numan said and the toughest occurred in quebec 
numan says the 4hour trip from kuujjuaq in arctic quebec to 
schefferville quebec included the worst turbulence of his journey

miner john dilla takes a swig of 
cheap local gin chews on betel nut then covers his mouth with a 
thin surgical mask before burrowing into a crevice in the rubble of 
the once swank hyatt hotel 
dilla is among 200 volunteer gold miners still searching for 
bodies and possibly survivors buried beneath twisted steel and 
tons of concrete after the july 16 earthquake devastated nearly 30 
buildings in this mountain resort 
the miners are the real heroes of this operation said dave 
kemp a member of the british international rescue corps the job 
they have done is simply excellent and very professional 
kemp a fireman from norfolk england said filipino miners had 
done about 70 percent of the work of finding people beneath the 
ruins in this city 130 miles north of manila 
most foreign rescuers left last weekend after deciding there 
were probably no more survivors in the ruins now the miners 
along with a few daring civilians and philippine military academy 
cadets are left with the job 
they have committed to continue the search to the last body 
said rogelio singson a spokesman of presidential relief 
coordination center for baguio 
dilla said the miners need the gin to numb their sense of smell 
as the stench of death grows stronger in the remains betel nuts 
satisfy hunger pangs 
he said the linen masks did little to lessen the stench of 
decaying bodies but he and others wear them all the same because 
they are the only facial covering available 
you will need a gas mask with an oxygen supply before you can 
really work inside those tunnels otherwise you will pass out 
before you can reach deep inside dilla said but since we lack 
the equipment were using the best available resources 
fellow miner orlando bayos said they came to baguio after 
hearing reports about damage in the once swank resort the miners 
volunteered although their own camp at the philex mining corp was 
also damaged 
twentyone of their fellow miners and their families were killed 
there 
we proceeded to baguio as soon as we heard the news that we 
did not even have the time to check the condition of our 
families bayos said there was a greater need for us in 
baguio 
bayos said most of the volunteer miners walked from their camp 
about 20 miles to reach baguio most have stayed since and have 
been working for stretches of up to 48 hours to find people trapped 
in the debris 
working side by side with the miners are the 1000 cadets of the 
philippine military academy whose campus is in baguio eight cadet 
companies formed the first organized search and rescue group in the 
resort 
we knew there was a lot of damage and there was nobody on deck 
but us said cadet 3rd class keith cardones we had to decide 
fast 
we were not prepared for a disaster but with just guts and our 
bare hands we started the rescue attempt cadet 2nd class jun de 
vela said we only realized the dangers of what were were doing 
after experiencing being inside tunnels during the aftershocks 
singson said he had received reports of how cadets took turns 
entering a 12inchhigh space between a collapsed floor of the 
hotel nevada to talk to a woman who was pinned down by a concrete 
beam 
he said that when an aftershock lowered the void even more the 
thinner cadets who could still enter the space took over the woman 
was saved 
in another incident the cadets joined several drinking straws 
in a makeshift tube to allow another survivor to take in liquids 
from a bottle several yards away singson said 
but de vela also spoke of the frustrations of not being able to 
save people they knew were still alive for hours after the 
earthquake 
he said many cadets worked overtime after hearing the cries of 
5yearold michelle reyes who was trapped on the fourth floor of 
the hyatt 
he said that for two days the cadets were trying to talk with 
the girl who was crying from beneath the rubble but after several 
aftershocks the crying stopped reyess body was recovered days 
later 
it really hurt but we did the best we could said de vela

prime minister margaret thatcher has refused to 
intervene in the row over a decision to ban a film that portrays 
the death of author salman rushdie 
the independent british board of film classification has banned 
the pakistani film international guerrillas on the grounds it 
is criminally libelous of rushdie 
british moslem groups have denounced the ban on the film and 
accused the board of hypocrisy because rushdies book the 
satanic verses which they say blasphemes islam was not banned 
the board is an entirely independent body mrs thatcher 
said tuesday if the distributors wish to appeal against the 
decision of the board they may make application to the video 
appeals committee in the usual way 
the prime minister was responding in the house of commons to an 
opposition lawmaker who accused her of double standards 
the distributor of the punjabiurdu language film mohammed 
fayyaz of london made an appeal to the video appeals committee on 
monday to allow the film to be distributed 
rushdie born to a moslem family in india and now a british 
citizen has been in hiding since feb 1989 when the late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini of iran called for the authors death for 
blaspheming islam in the satanic verses 
the author said through his defense committee on monday that he 
would not initiate a libel action against the film and supports the 
right of the film to be shown 
the 3hour film depicts rushdie as the agent of an 
international conspiracy against islam and shows him torturing and 
killing moslems until he himself is killed by a bolt of lightning

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
seeking to reassure jittery financial markets says the central 
bank wont fritter away the gains made in the last few years in 
the fight against inflation 
greenspan told lawmakers tuesday that the fed has not abandoned 
its inflation battle as part of some deal with the bush 
administration to trim the federal budget deficit 
he insisted that any move to lower interest rates to ward off 
the adverse impacts of budget cuts and tax increases needed to 
reduce the deficit would be made only in the context of not 
inducing inflationary pressures 
private economists saw greenspans comments as an effort to calm 
fears in financial markets that the fed is buckling to 
electionyear pressures by the administration to abandon its 
inflation battle 
elliott platt director of economic research at donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette said greenspans comments should help to ease 
market anxieties 
it took away from any negatives he created when he seemed to 
be wavering last week platt said 
those fears were raised when greenspan said the fed stood ready 
to lower interest rates to support a credible deficit reduction 
package if such assistance was needed to keep the country out of a 
recession 
at a hearing tuesday by the house banking subcommittee on 
domestic monetary policy rep stephen neal dnc told greenspan 
that he believed mondays steep drop in the stock market was caused 
by general worries that the fed was wavering in its 
inflationfighting resolve 
the dow jones industrial average finished down 5644 points on 
monday after a topsyturvy day that saw the indicator down by more 
than 100 points in early trading on tuesday stocks rebounded with 
the dow industrials finishing up by 1782 points 
in his testimony greenspan repeated his support for legislation 
sponsored by neal that would commit the fed to pursuing policies to 
achieve zero inflation he said he believed such a goal was 
within reach because of policies over the past three years that 
have slowed the growth of the nations money supply 
the feds goal is to provide enough money to the banking system 
to keep the economy growing while guarding against supplying so 
much that it results in renewed inflation over the past three 
years the money supply has grown at a slow pace not seen in three 
decades greenspan said 
if we dont fritter away the benefits of the last 2 to three 
years and i can assure you we dont intend to do that then i see 
no reason to expect other than the achievement of general price 
stability over the next several years greenspan told neal 
greenspan said the actual response of the fed to any 
deficitcutting agreement would depend very much on how financial 
markets viewed the package 
he predicted that a credible and enforceable budget deficit 
agreement would spark a significant drop in interest rates on 
financial markets and he said the fed would not act to accelerate 
the move to lower rates unless such action could be taken without 
risking the central banks overriding goal of reducing inflation 
greenspan testified that the recent report showing that consumer 
prices jumped 05 percent in june had added a note of caution 
to the inflation outlook 
but he said the june increase and other bad inflation figures 
reflected past history and not recent gains the fed has made by 
slowing the growth of the money supply

us warships and aircraft are conducting a 
joint exercise in the persian gulf with forces of the united arab 
emirates amid rising tensions between kuwait and iraq over oil 
production and pricing 
the pentagon announced tuesday that six us warships and three 
aircraft were participating in a shortnotice exercise with uae 
forces but the administration gave conflicting signals on the 
alert status of the us forces 
the uae has been an implicit target of iraqs recent complaints 
that some of its arab neighbors have been undercutting oil prices 
by exceeding their oilproduction quotas as established by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
concern for kuwaits security has grown since iraqi president 
saddam hussein last friday accused his tiny neighbor of stealing 
24 billion worth of oil from iraqi wells and of trying to wreck 
the iraqi economy by conspiring to push down world oil prices 
baghdad renewed its verbal assault on kuwait on tuesday the 
iraqi government newspaper aljoumhouriya accused kuwait of 
coordinating its moves with the united states to clear the way 
for foreign powers to intervene in the area 
meanwhile navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii said in 
congressional testimony that american ships were put on alert in 
the gulf on monday but he offered no details 
later pete williams spokesman for defense secretary dick 
cheney said he could not confirm that the ships were on alert 
williams told reporters that two us vessels had left early from 
their port in bahrain midway in the gulf to join the exercise 
with uae forces he said that did not mean they were on alert 
williams said the exercise codenamed ivory justice began 
monday he said it was mainly an airrefueling mission with uae 
aircraft 
participating in the exercise were two us air force kc135 
refueling tanker planes and one us c141 cargo plane plus six 
american warships already patrolling in the gulf the us aircraft 
flew to the gulf from an air base in west germany williams said 
williams said he could not comment on whether the joint exercise 
in the gulf was in response to the iraqkuwait tensions 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said 
both iraq and kuwait had built up their forces and us officials 
were very concerned 
iraq and others know there is no place for coercion in a 
civilized world she said all disputes should be handled 
through peaceful means 
when asked whether the united states would come to kuwaits 
defense if attacked by iraq williams said he could not comment 
beyond restating us policy on the gulf 
our continuing efforts there are not directed against any 
single country but are to ensure that we have an adequate 
capability together with our friends should the need arise he 
said

when a judge began releasing demonstrators 
who had trespassed at the seabrook nuclear power plant in 1977 
thenattorney general david souter jumped into his car sped to the 
court and insisted the protesters be jailed 
when state workers struck illegally in 1983 thensuperior court 
judge souter agreed to a midnight hearing and issued a predawn 
ruling threatening stiff fines if the workers didnt end their 
sickout 
when a lawyer stole money from a client judge souter wanted him 
to go to jail not just repay the money 
throughout his career as prosecutor and judge in new hampshire 
souter 50 has taken his role seriously and dealt firmly with 
those who didnt hold the law in as high a regard as he 
the opinions he authored as a state supreme court justice reveal 
a writer who sticks to the facts and avoids rhetorical flourishes 
there are no broad pronouncements on issues such as abortion or 
affirmative action that he certainly would confront if he wins 
confirmation to the us supreme court 
souter was attorney general when the state police arrested 1414 
demonstrators who defied authorities marched onto the seabrook 
nuclear plant construction site and camped overnight 
the protesters were locked in national guard armories for two 
weeks when a local judge released a demonstrator on a suspended 
sentence and small fine souter was incensed 
he played a very significant role said seabrook foe robert 
cushing one of those arrested in the may 1977 protest 
cushing said that when souter found out about the suspended 
sentence he left from concord drove down to district court and 
argued that there should be a jail sentence imposed 
the judge resentenced the demonstrator cushing said 
the state employees association felt souters sting during a 
sickout in june 1983 at midnight thengov john sununu called 
souter and asked him to hold a hearing which he did at 345 am 
souter ordered everyone back to work and threatened to fine the 
union 5000 a day and its leadership 500 a day 
he came down heavy said the union director denis parker 
theres no question about it 
manchester lawyer jack middleton remembers a case in which a 
lawyer had stolen money from a client both sides had decided to 
drop the matter if the lawyer repaid the money he said but souter 
wouldnt buy it 
that just sounded like a bank transaction to him middleton 
said and he didnt view that as a loan 
in addition to showing that souter was tough middleton said the 
episode showed that souter was going to take a hard look at the 
facts and make up his own mind and not just take the word of 
the prosecution or the defense lawyer 
souter served seven years on the new hampshire supreme court 
in a 1988 decision criticized by womens rights groups souter 
ordered a new trial for a man who was convicted of sexual assault 
the defendant said his lawyers improperly were prevented from 
offering evidence the woman publicly flirted with other men on the 
day of the alleged attack 
souter said such evidence was essential to the mans defense 
that the woman had consented to having sex with him 
souter often sides with positions advanced by state government 
officials especially in criminal cases but there have been 
notable exceptions 
in 1988 souter led the state court in declaring 
unconstitutional a state law that barred a nonprofit group from 
providing legal services to some disabled people 
as state attorney general it fell to souter to defend the 
states prosecution of a couple who for religious purposes taped 
over the live free or die motto on their automobile license 
the supreme court ruled that the prosecution violated the couples 
religious freedom 
as a judge souter participated in just one known case dealing 
with abortion siding with the majority in a 1986 ruling that said 
physicians have a responsibility to test unborn children for birth 
defects and in the event defects are detected to counsel the 
pregnant woman about options including abortion

david h souter the reserved new hampshire 
judge picked by president bush for the supreme court is armed with 
white house advice as he sets out to press the flesh with the 
politicians who are key to his confirmation 
souter was attending getacquainted meeting with senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan and republican members of the senate 
judiciary committee this afternoon 
the committee will conduct souters confirmation hearing 
expected to begin in september the president said he hopes the 
full senate will confirm souter before the high courts next term 
begins oct 1 
souter was paying a similar courtesy call on senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine and possibly other democrats later 
in the day 
fred mcclure the white houses liaison with congress and sen 
warren rudman rnh an old friend are souters guides at the 
capitol and the nominee has been told by bush aides to expect a 
strong spotlight to be shined on his personal and professional life 
souter appearing more relaxed than he did when his intended 
nomination was announced by bush on monday told reporters tuesday 
he was getting used to his new celebrity 
the blood is circulating a little bit better than it was 
yesterday afternoon at five oclock he said i didnt think it 
was going to happen i was astonished 
many senators and special interest groups were surprised as 
well and the divisive rhetoric that immediately accompanied 
president reagans nomination of robert h bork in 1987 has not 
resurfaced 
bush lavished praise on souter at fundraising events tuesday in 
philadelphia and new york 
i look forward to the senate hearings of david souter i am 
sure they will find him to be tough but fair the president said 
hes a firstrate appellate judge an outstanding jurist and a 
great legal mind 
in my nomination of judge david souter for senate confirmation 
there was no single issue no litmus test or standard 
dominating my decision bush said and i will add there should 
be no litmus test in the process of confirmation 
conservative and liberal activists alike were taking a 
waitandsee attitude acknowledging that the presidents swift 
action in choosing souter had caught them a little off guard 
little is known about souters views on the vexing social issues 
abortion civil rights and churchstate relations he would 
confront if confirmed to replace justice william j brennan who 
retired friday because of poor health 
the union leader in manchester nh reported today that in a 
1976 college commencement speech souter then state attorney 
general attacked rigid federal affirmative action guidelines as 
affirmative discrimination and added there are some things 
government cannot do 
souter is clearly not like bork said elliot mincberg of 
people for the american way a liberal group he doesnt have 
much of a track record 
the united conservatives of america gave souter a cautious 
thumbsup richard a viguerie the groups chairman said 
most conservatives today have nervous smiles 
souter brushed aside reporters questions tuesday about his 
views on abortion one of the sure focal points of the confirmation 
hearings 
several senators said it would be inappropriate for the 
judiciary committee to obtain from souter his opinion on specific 
issues before the court but one committee member sen edward 
kennedy dmass suggested that general topics could be broached 
i think there is a desire to have full and complete hearings 
fair kennedy said 
souter spent several hours tuesday in the white house where 
presidential aides told him that his personal and professional life 
would come under exceedingly close scrutiny 
one participant who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
souter listened to the advice and indicated there was nothing in 
his past to cause him discomfort 
it appears that in 22 years of public service souter has rarely 
given a speech or written a law review article and never publicly 
criticized a supreme court ruling 
the only paper trail on him comes from his seven years on the 
new hampshire supreme court and it indicates he is a clear 
dispassionate writer of legal opinions 
a review of many of the nearly 200 opinions souter authored 
reveals he is most assuredly a judicial conservative a judge who 
believes in sticking to the case at hand and shies away from making 
sweeping statements about the law 
he often sides with positions advanced by state government 
officials especially in criminal cases but there have been 
notable exceptions 
in a 1988 decision souter led the state court in declaring 
unconstitutional a state law that barred a nonprofit group from 
providing legal services to some disabled people

a fired kgb official whos been waging a public 
relations campaign against his former employer is being 
investigated by government prosecutors looking for evidence he 
illegally leaked official secrets 
the government is investigating former counterintelligence chief 
oleg d kalugin under a law against divulging classified 
information the government newspaper izvestia reported tuesday 
kalugin who worked as an operative in the united states from 
1958 to 1970 in recent weeks has in recent weeks been speaking out 
against the kgb at demonstrations and in interviews with western 
and soviet reporters 
he has said the kgb still taps telephones infiltrates soviet 
life including the russian orthodox church and labor organizations 
and engages in dirty tricks 
in a recent article he said about 20 agents who have defected 
to the west in the past decade have caused the total collapse 
of many of soviet spy rings 
izvestia did not indicate which of kalugins remarks constitute 
state secrets 
in june and july 1990 the newspaper wrote mass media in 
the soviet union and other countries disseminated confidential 
information constituting state secrets citing former 
majorgeneral oleg kalugin of the state security force or on his 
behalf 
izvestia said the prosecutors office began criminal proceedings 
july 17 it did not explain why the action was not reported for a 
week 
kalugin has embraced the reform policies of the radical 
democratic platform alleging his superiors drummed him out of the 
agency because of his politics 
since he began speaking out he has been dismissed from the kgb 
and stripped of his rank as major general kgb chief vladimir a 
kryuchkov has criticized kalugin who was nominated as a candidate 
to the russian republics parliament from krasnodar 
in a newspaper article earlier this month kalugin denied 
allegations by his former superiors that he himself was responsible 
for leaks of information 
since 1960 until 1980 three kgb agents defected to the 
west kalugin wrote in komsomolskaya pravda and since 1980 
about 20 have already betrayed the motherland 
thus we can boldly speak not of an information leak but about 
a majority of soviet intelligences secrets sold to the west about 
the total collapse of a great number of intelligence networks he 
added

fears linger over the slaying a year 
ago of a 9yearold girl stabbed 34 times by a mental patient at a 
street fair but city officials say this years festival friday 
will be safe 
ill be looking around and ill probably be holding on to my 
kids very tightly not that i think it would have made any 
difference last year cindy morehouse said as she strolled 
downtown tuesday with her two young sons 
jessica shorts mother and several other people watched 
helplessly as the girl was killed on july 28 by david peterson a 
patient at connecticut valley hospital 
peterson left the minimumsecurity state mental hospital without 
permission took a bus three miles to downtown bought a hunting 
knife and pounced on jessica as she walked out of a woolworths 
store 
horrified witnesses and police pulled him off the girl in less 
than a minute after she was stabbed 34 times 
george russell manager of the woolworths store and a witness 
to the attack said the slaying sharply curtailed business for 
months now business has rebounded but russell said the attack 
took a personal toll 
i still relive the incident time is not a factor i have a 
picture in my head and i still get flashbacks its hard to deal 
with he said 
officials in this city of 45000 held a news conference tuesday 
to assure that the annual oneday festival will be safe 
middletown cant blame itself as a city for what happened 
things like this could have happened anywhere said mike blais 
the festival chairman 
as a measure of security a mobile crisis team of connecticut 
valley workers will attend the festival mayor paul gionfriddo 
said but he predicted the fair will be as uneventful as this 
years memorial day parade and july 4 celebration 
a booth will be set up at the festival to raise funds for two 
charities established in jessicas name 
peterson 37 when jessica was stabbed is a chronic paranoid 
schizophrenic with a history of mental illness and violence he has 
spent more than 15 years in mental institutions in 1971 and 1988 
he was found innocent by reason of insanity in stabbing attacks 
in march he also was found innocent by reason of insanity in 
jessicas slaying and ordered confined for 70 years and placed in 
connecticuts only maximumsecurity psychiatric hospital whiting 
forensic institute in middletown 
at petersons arraignment an angry crowd yelled kill him 
kill him 
some middletown residents are afraid other david petersons are 
waiting to strike connecticut valley patients with passes make 
regular trips downtown from the 468bed hospital and expatients 
live in halfway houses in the area 
many customers call the babys shoppe on main street before 
coming to the store so they can be met at their cars said laurel 
rosner a coowner she accompanies customers to their cars when 
they leave 
even merchants who say the effect of the stabbing on the 
community psyche has been overblown acknowledge it is still on the 
minds of many 
occasionally well still hear is it ok to bring my daughter 
downtown said vincent amato who owns a toy and hobby shop 
gionfriddo said connecticut valley has tightened restrictions 
since the stabbing the hospital cant take day passes away from 
patients entitled to them but it plans its own activities friday 
to encourage patients with passes to remain on hospital grounds 
gionfriddo said 
jessicas father ronald short may attend the festival but her 
mother catherine will not 
this is a very difficult time for me emotionally she said 
i dont feel there is any need for me to go

a consumer group says the same number of 
physicians were disciplined by state medical boards in 1988 as the 
year before reversing a trend toward more sanctions 
public citizen health research group said tuesday it arrived at 
the number of 1489 from an analysis of the most recent data 
compiled by the federation of state medical boards 
it counted license revocations or suspensions and probations 
in 1984 serious actions were taken against 745 physicians 
public citizen said that increased to 1089 in 1985 and 1277 in 
1986 
the group said none of the rates were high enough 
a physician could still operate drunk commit a gross act of 
negligence or sexually assault a patient and receive a mere slap 
on the wrist from his or her states medical board in most 
states the group said

the postal service may limit the number of 
packages it accept at one time to avoid being overloaded in case 
there is a strike at rival united parcel service 
if there is a work stoppage next week there is no way the 
postal service can absorb the operations of ups overnight into our 
system deputy postmaster general michael s coughlin said 
tuesday 
however he said any restrictions would affect only to volume 
shippers individuals sending four or fewer parcels at one time 
would not be impacted 
individuals or organizations needing to send five or more 
packages will be required to contact the postal service by 
telephone to make a reservation to bring their parcels to a postal 
handling center in the region of the intended delivery he said 
for example if a company in chicago wanted to send truck loads 
of parcels to customers in atlanta it would make a reservation to 
deliver the parcels to the postal facility in atlanta the company 
sending the packages would be responsible for getting them from 
chicago to atlanta and the postal service would then complete the 
delivery to homes

the discovery of a genetic defect that 
may cause most cases of alzheimers disease could someday lead to a 
treatment researchers say 
were anxiously following this and if its true it would be 
quite significant said creighton phelps vice president of 
medical and scientific affairs at the national alzheimers 
association in chicago 
on tuesday dr allen roses of the duke university medical 
school in durham nc said he found a genetic abnormality that 
may cause the most common form of alzheimers disease which 
afflicts about 4 million americans 
the finding surprised most researchers studying the diseases 
genetics they have been busily investigating a different 
abnormality 
were betting the output of our laboratory that the new 
abnormality is the cause of all but a rare form of alzheimers 
roses said 
in a presentation at the jackson laboratory in bar harbor roses 
said that based on his study of 32 families in which alzheimers is 
prevalent the disease appears to be linked to an abnormality on 
chromosome 19 one of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes 
previous studies found a defect on chromosome 21 linked to an 
earlyonset form of alzheimers in which memory loss and other 
symptoms begin to appear around age 40 that form of the disease 
has been found in only 10 or 20 families in the world roses said 
it could turn out that the earlyonset form of alzheimers is a 
different disease roses used his genetic samples to search for a 
defect on chromosome 21 in lateonset alzheimers disease and 
couldnt find it 
the idea that chromosome 21 is linked to the disease was so 
powerful that roses said he has had difficulty persuading others 
that chromosome 21 may not be the culprit in most cases he said he 
has been frustrated in efforts to publish his findings in a 
scientific journal 
other researchers are now rapidly trying to determine whether 
their genetic samples from alzheimers victims also reveal an 
abnormality on chromosome 19 said dr peter st georgehyslop of 
massachusetts general hospital in boston he is one of the 
discoverers of the defect on chromosome 21 
the followup studies need to be done st georgehyslop 
said this area of genetics of lateonset neurological disease is 
extremely difficult to do 
finding the genetic defect is a crucial first step toward 
figuring out precisely what goes wrong in alzheimers disease and 
perhaps how to fix it no cause or cure is known for the 
progressive neurological disorder 
one of the problems with doing research on alzheimers is that 
the disease normally appears in people in their 60s 70s or 80s 
many people who carry a genetic predisposition for the disease die 
of something else before they develop it roses said 
there are a lot of people in the field who have doubts about 
whether lateonset alzheimers can even be approached by genetic 
techniques roses said 
researchers differ in their view of the disease roses believes 
that virtually all people would develop alzheimers if they lived 
long enough some people merely have an abnormality that makes the 
disease show up in their 60s others might not get it unless they 
lived to be 120 he said 
in fact the condition normally thought of as senility in very 
old people is indistinguishable from alzheimers roses said 
the genetic research could ultimately lead to a way to delay the 
appearance of the disease if not cure it outright roses said 
if we can delay it from the age of 80 to 105 i think people 
would be satisfied he said

vincent van gogh cut off his ear and later killed 
himself because of a painful but undiagnosed innerear infection 
not madness a report published today suggests 
the artist who committed suicide 100 years ago sunday at age 
37 suffered from menieres disease an often misdiagnosed 
infection dr i kaufman arenberg said in the journal of the 
american medical association 
the disease which afflicts about 7 million americans is 
brought on by excess fluid and pressure in the ear and can cause 
severe bouts of vertigo and hallucinations 
van gogh who sold just one painting during his life but whose 
work now commands record prices described those symptoms in 
letters to family members arenberg and colleagues reported 
his voluminous correspondence should forever banish the notion 
that he was an epileptic or mad their report said 
other symptoms include vomiting painful pressure and persistent 
noise in the ear along with possible hearing loss attacks may 
last from several hours to several days and are often marked by 
long periods of no symptoms conditions described by van gogh 
the tragedy is that this disease was discovered about 30 years 
before van goghs death but information about it was slow to 
disseminate arenberg said 
it is unlikely van goghs doctors knew of menieres disease 
named after the french doctor who identified it in 1861 arenberg 
said he added that no treatment for the malady was available at 
the time 
researchers have guessed for decades about van goghs mental 
problems one doctor theorized that van gogh had a personality 
disorder stemming from epilepsy another scientist suggested he was 
addicted to absinthe 
arenberg and colleagues at the swedish medical center in 
englewood colo studied 796 letters that van gogh wrote to family 
and friends from 1884 to 1890 and those of the doctor who treated 
the artist 
after years of deterioriating health the dutchborn artist 
checked into a mental asylum in france where a dr peyron wrote 
it is my opinion that mr van gogh is subject to epileptic fits 
at very infrequent intervals 
in a letter dated sept 10 1889 to his brother theo the 
artist recounted his gloomy prognosis 
i must say that m peyron does not give me much hope for the 
future and i think this right he makes me realize that everything 
is doubtful that one can be sure of nothing beforehand he wrote 
peyron wrote that van gogh probably cut off his left ear in a 
fit of madness or instability in december 1888 but arenberg said 
the artist might have done so as a crude way of relieving the pain 
or intense buzzing or ringing 
doctors now treat menieres disease with drugs by removing the 
inner ear or by shunting blocked fluids from the area under 
pressure arenberg said treatment is effective in about 80 percent 
of all patients 
the biggest impact the disease had on him was fear arenberg 
said he had a tremendous fear that epilepsy would come and 
leave him incapacitated from painting permanently thats probably 
why he painted so much in the years before his death 
van goghs work is among the most prized in the art world in 
may his portrait of dr gachet drew the highest price ever 
paid at auction for a painting 825 million

archeologists in israel have discovered an 
ancient golden calf figurine a pagan idol frequently mentioned 
in the bible it was reported today 
the handsized mixedmetal figurine about 3500 years old is 
the first of its kind to be unearthed the new york times reported 
harvard university archeologists excavating canaanite ruins near 
the ancient port city of ashkelon found the figurine on june 26 
the times said 
the earliest legends of judaism feature warnings against 
worshiping golden calves revered by canaanites because their gods 
were believed to ride the sacred beasts 
it was a totally unexpected find said lawrence e stager 
the harvard professor who heads the israeli dig we were just 
cleaning down the side of the stone ramparts and the last thing we 
thought we would find was this temple we havent found any 
precedents for this 
the figurine was found in the rubble of a temple destroyed by 
egyptian conquerers in about 1550 bc during the bronze age the 
figurine dates from midway through the second millennium bc 
stager said 
the calf is about 4 inches tall and 4 inches long and weighs 
just less than 1 pound it was cast in parts and pieced together 
the body is made of bronze and markings show it likely was 
burnished to look golden the legs head and genitals are made of 
an asyet untested metal that appears to be silver one surviving 
horn and the tail were made from copper wire and the figure is 
filled with a heavy metal believed to be lead 
it was found near a small pottery shrine that had an opening 
with doors 
we believe it was displayed looking out emerging from this 
cowshed which was a shrine to the milk goddess stager said 
the largely intact figurine suffered mild corrosion giving the 
bronze and copper pieces a green tint and making the silver look 
gray 
in the bible golden calves are mentioned in the story of aaron 
the exodus tales of ancient jerusalems rivalry with the 
calfworshiping hebrew king jeroboam and in other old testament 
accounts 
the find is expected to help scientists study religious 
developments in the region that gave birth to judaism christianity 
and islam when testing and research is completed the calf likely 
will be turned over to the israel museum in jerusalem 
ashkelon one of the largest cities in the region during its 
heyday was about 2000 years old when egypt invaded and had a 
population of 15000 to 20000 people the dig site is located 
about 30 miles south of tel aviv

government troops have captured two 
towns just south of the rebelheld jaffna peninsula opening a 
major road into the tamil militants stronghold military officials 
said today 
at least 96 of the separatist rebels and 13 soldiers were killed 
in the threeday operation that gave the government control over 
paranthan and kilinochchi by dusk tuesday said the officials 
kilinochchi 3 miles south of paranthan is linked by a national 
highway to the town of jaffna headquarters of the rebel liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam 
the government troops also control the highway north of 
paranthan up to the town of elephant pass located just inside the 
peninsula officials said 
government paratroopers took paranthan on monday after fierce 
fighting the troops then moved to kilinochchi establishing 
control of the highway said the officials who cannot be 
identified under briefing rules 
having secured paranthan troops established a link between 
kilinochchi paranthan and elephant pass said a senior military 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the report could not be independently confirmed and there was no 
immediate comment from the rebels 
elephant pass is 30 miles southeast of jaffna and 185 miles 
north of the capital colombo it is at the northern end of the 
elephant pass causeway across the jaffna lagoon which links the 
mainland with the peninsula 
the rebels blew up the causeway last week but military 
officials said it was repaired over the weekend the causeway is 
the only viable route for largescale crossing onto the peninsula 
which hangs like a scorpions tail from the northern end of the 
island 
elephant pass has been under the tenuous control of government 
troops since fighting started june 11 the rebels now are pushed 
north of the town 
the rebels control most of the peninsula and some pockets in the 
east 
about 2900 combatants have been killed in the fighting in the 
two predominantlytamil districts where the rebels seek to 
establish a separate homeland 
on tuesday the militants raided a small sinhalese colony in the 
northeastern district of polonnaruwa and killed eight sinhalese as 
they slept military officials said the victims four men two 
women and two children were hacked and shot they said 
also tuesday the rebels raided a mosque and killed two moslems 
in the eastern town of sammanturai accusing them of being military 
informers said the officials 
tamil militants have been fighting for an independent homeland 
since 1983 saying they are victims of discrimination in jobs and 
education by the majority sinhalese 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people the 
sinhalese who control the government and the military comprise 75 
percent 
the latest round of fighting ended a 13month ceasefire called 
by both sides in may 1989 to help push peace talks at least 13900 
people have been killed in the 7yearold tamil insurrection

a nasa researcher analyzing 30000 images 
taken a decade ago by the voyager ii space probe discovered a 
hidden moon in saturns outermost ring 
it was actually in the first image i looked at said mark 
showalter a scientist at nasas ames research center in mountain 
view it was exactly where i expected it to be 
showalter on july 2 found a bright 12milediameter orb 
undetected by earthbased telescopes 
i remember i was so excited i worked through july fourth he 
said tuesday after the space agency announced the discovery of 
saturns 18th moon 
in 1986 national aeronautics and space administration 
researchers first theorized a moon was hidden within what is known 
as the enckes gap around saturn but showalter said he wasnt able 
to search for it until recently 
the honest truth is we just didnt work on this for a few 
years showalter said when you drop a research project its 
very hard to pick it back up 
his find confirmed what scientists had believed for several 
years that undiscovered moons could be hidden among saturns 
three major icy rings making them undulate and causing gaps in 
several minor rings 
theory has predicted this new moon for years said david 
morrison chief of ames space science division its very 
gratifying to find that the theory was correct its almost a 
textbook example of the scientific process 
showalter 32 found the moon by using a computer program he 
designed to sort through the 30000 saturn images sent back to 
earth by voyager in 1980 and 1981 
the moon saturns smallest orbits in enckes gap within the 
planets outermost major ring 
showalter and ames planetary ring expert jeff cuzzi theorized 
that a small moon was creating a 200mile wide gap with its orbit 
and was leaving a moonlet wake pattern similar to boat wakes 
the computer program was based on that hypothesis 
the trick was writing the computer program to tell me which 
images to look at showalter said after that it was actually a 
days work to find it 
during the next several days he found 11 images of the moon 
pete waller manager of public information for nasa said the 
moon is orbiting about 73600 kilometers from saturns cloud tops 
and weighs about 1 trillion tons its tentatively known as 1981s13 
the discovery was reported last week in a publication by the 
international astronomical union which now must certify the find 
and approve a name that could a year 
showalter has suggested pan the greek god of shepherds because 
the moon creates a socalled shepherding effect by pushing 
material away from its orbit to cause the ring gap 
showalter said he doesnt expect any more hidden moons to be 
found within that gap but scientists have theorized that 
undiscovered moons might be spotted in another major gap around 
saturn known as the cassini division

physicians with aids are unlikely to transmit the 
deadly virus to patients during surgery according to a study of 
2160 people operated on by a tennessee doctor who had the disease 
none of the patients whom dr harold dennison operated on 
between 1982 and his 1989 death are believed to have contracted 
aids during surgery a report in this weeks journal of the 
american medical association said 
only one patient an intravenous drug user who frequented 
prostitutes tested positive for the aids virus but the authors 
concluded that the patient had contracted aids through his 
highrisk activities and not from surgical contact with dennison 
who removed a lymph node from the man in 1984 
the results of this investigation support the concept that 
risks to patients operated on by surgeons infected with the aids 
virus are most likely quite low wrote the authors led by dr 
ban mishu of the centers for disease control in atlanta 
an accompanying editorial by dr frank rhame a university of 
minnesota aids expert estimates that hundreds of aidsinfected 
surgeons are practicing in the united states 
the cdc has no figures on the number of us surgeons and 
physicians infected with aids said spokeswoman gayle lloyd 
but of the 139765 aids cases reported in the united states 
since 1981 more than 5000 involved healthcare workers including 
doctors nurses lab technicians and other medical workers she 
said 
but rhame said there are no known surgeontopatient 
transmissions of the disease he estimated the risk of patients 
being infected by their surgeons at between one in 100000 and one 
in 1 million operations 
dennison 56 died jan 30 1989 just weeks after he tested 
positive for aids dennison believed he contracted aids while 
operating on a patient with the disease but he didnt know when he 
had been infected coauthor dr william schaffner of vanderbilt 
universitys school of medicine said in a telephone interview 
tuesday 
it was estimated that dennison had been infected no earlier than 
1982 so with the help from baptist hospital hca west side 
hospital and hca park view hospital the nashville facilities 
where he worked the authors learned the names and addresses of 
the 2160 patients he had operated on since then 
none of them had been reported to tennessees aids registry and 
264 had died none of the deaths were aidsrelated 
the authors mailed letters to the 1896 remaining patients 
seeking to have them tested for aids letters to 244 patients were 
returned marked address unknown 
of the 1652 who were contacted 615 were tested for aids 
although 1037 patients chose not to submit to tests those who 
were tested had undergone the most invasive operations or had been 
operated on most recently when dennison was the most contagious 
and thus faced the greatest risk of contracting the virus 
schaffner said 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples victims 
ability to fight infections it is passed through blood and other 
body fluids

rebels fighting the sovietbacked 
afghan government reacted angrily today to a us move to slash 
their military aid as part of efforts with moscow to work out a 
ceasefire plan 
the mujahedeen or moslem holy warriors have been bankrolled by 
the united states for more than a decade 
it will damage the good will between the mujahedeen and the 
united states said suleiman shah spokesman for a provisional 
rebel government even now many people in the resistance are 
skeptical of the true dependability of the united states 
on tuesday a us senate intelligence committee voted to slash 
aid to the mujahedeen claiming washington had achieved its purpose 
in afghanistan when soviet troops withdrew in february 1989 said 
sen frank murkowski ralaska a panel member 
shah claimed moscow still funds its kabul allies to the tune of 
about 300 million a month washington had been giving the 
guerrillas between 300 million and 500 million annually 
a us congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity 
in washington said about 100 million would be cut from covert aid 
to afghan rebels in 1991 
the russians despite economic problems inside the red empire 
and internal political upheaval have done nothing to stop aid to 
their puppets in kabul said shah 
its true that lots of signs of change have taken place inside 
and outside the russian empire but nothing has changed in 
afghanistan he said 
the us embassy in islamabad refused to comment on the proposed 
cuts rebel supporters in washington are hoping money would be 
restored at higher levels before the entire senate finishes work on 
the bill which includes 1991 money for covert action around the 
world 
washington and moscow have been trying to work out a political 
end to the 12yearold war that has claimed more than 1 million 
lives 
three million afghans live in squalid refugee camps throughout 
pakistans rugged border provinces two million live in iran 
most fled their homeland after 1979 when the soviet union sent 
about 115000 soldiers into afghanistan to help crush a burgeoning 
insurgency and install a friendly communist government in kabul 
a unbrokered accord provided for the soviet troop withdrawal 
the united nations has been trying to initiate a political 
settlement along with the two superpowers who claim to be close to 
an agreement 
next week in irkutsk siberia secretary of state james a baker 
iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze are to 
discuss a timetable for afghan president najibullah to step down 
said us officials in washington who spoke on condition of 
anonymity tuesday 
the stumbling block among the rebels has been najibullahs role 
in a postwar afghanistan washington has agreed najibullah could 
remain as president during elections but only if he gives up 
control of the military media and staterun secret police 
earlier this month najibullah seemed ready to go along with the 
plan but western diplomats feared he was not prepared to turn the 
power over to a neutral body there has been no reported progress 
on who would assume control of the key ministries during an 
election 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
were just waiting for the soviets to return with a reply weve 
gone as far as we can go and still get the mujahedeen to sign on 
the united states earlier refused to even accept najibullahs 
presence in kabul before or after elections 
but washington revised its bargaining position after guerrilla 
fighters who had been expected to overrun kabul shortly after the 
soviet troop withdrawal fought to a stalemate on the battlefield 
and were defeated in successive political battles 
the united states doesnt care about the people of 
afghanistan it was just looking for its own benefit in 
afghanistan said abdul haidi a spokesman for the vociferously 
antiwestern hezbeislami party of islam rebel group led by 
gulbuddin hekmatyar 
hekmatyars party has been linked to the narcotics trade which 
some senators cited as part of the rationale for reducing 
assistance hekmatyar has repeatedly denied the charges

new york has an official fruit and an 
official muffin but it wont have a state bottle so long as gov 
mario cuomo can help it 
cuomo vetoed a bill tuesday that would have designated the 
collectible container for empire spring mineral water as the 
states official bottle he said the naming of official state 
objects has gotten out of hand 
we have walked the line a number of times in recent years with 
these memorializations cuomo said this bill crosses it 
cuomo also said he didnt want to give a collectible an 
advantage in the marketplace the pintsized emeraldcolored 
bottles now fetch 4 or 5 apiece 
lawmakers pushing for official designation had hoped to draw 
tourists to the national bottle museum in ballston spa a 
northeastern new york town 
with the veto the bottle fails to join other state symbols that 
include the official fruit apple tree sugar maple insect 
lady bug and muffin apple

marlon brandos son was ordered to stand 
trial for murder in the fatal shooting of his halfsisters 
boyfriend at the family estate and bail was set at 10 million 
the rulings by muncipal court judge larry fidler on tuesday came 
after a twoday preliminary hearing in which christian brando was 
quoted as saying he accidentally killed dag drollet 26 in a fight 
over a gun 
brando 32 said a scuffle broke out because the victim was 
abusing his pregnant halfsister cheyenne brando 
death is too good for the guy brando was quoted as telling 
police shortly after the killing at his fathers hollywood hills 
mansion 
drollets body was found on a couch still holding a cigarette 
lighter and a television remote control and prosecutors say there 
was no sign of a struggle 
the judge decided that brando should stand trial for murder not 
the lesser charge of manslaughter his lawyer had wanted 
there has been a killing and the defendant pulled the 
trigger fidler said 
prosecutors argued that brando should be held without bail 
because his fathers fortune could meet any bail amount and allow 
him to flee the country 
if the court sets bail in this case christian brando will 
make it even if its 20 million said deputy district attorney 
steven barshop 
to support his argument barshop cited miss brandos recent 
departure for tahiti where she remains she is not expected to 
return for the trial 
defense attorney robert shapiro said christian would not jump 
bail because he would never betray his father known for his 
starring roles in such films as on the waterfront and the 
godfather 
this is a young man who has great and tremendous respect for 
his father shapiro said as the bulky whitehaired actor 
listened from a front row courtroom seat after the judges 
decision the elder brando was hurriedly led out a back door of the 
courtroom 
later shapiro said bail would be posted but declined to say 
when brandos release from jail was expected 
district attorney spokeswoman sandi gibbons said the 10 million 
bail is likely the highest ever set by a judge in los angeles 
county 
brando also will be tried on a weapons charge for allegedly 
possessing a machine gun if convicted he could face 25 years to 
life in prison arraignment in superior court arraignment was 
scheduled for aug 7 
during arguments the prosecutor quoted spontaneous comments 
brando made to the first police officer on the scene 
i did it because he hurt my sister my sister is pregnant 
he was laying on the couch he was fighting with my sister i said 
you leave my sister alone the policeman quoted brando as 
saying 
later in the statement brando conceded that he did not like 
drollet and declared man death is too good for the guy

amoco corp said it will appeal a federal court 
order to pay 155 million in damages and interest from a massive 
oil spill by the tanker cadiz off northern france in 1978 
we feel the claims were exaggerated amoco spokesman mike 
thompson said tuesday after the penalty was announced 
amocos decision to appeal the order issued by us district 
judge charles norgle promised to prolong the case a prospect 
lamented by plaintiffs 
we amocos victims in brittany pray that this great american 
company in its concern for justice and the environment will 
finally pay for the damage that it has caused us said 
jeanbaptiste henry spokesman for the local governments and 
businesses who sued amoco 
after 12 years and two judges we fail to see what amoco hopes 
to gain with an appeal henry said 
about 100 french towns have argued the spill adversely affected 
their commerce amoco was held liable for europes largest spill 
which fouled 100 miles of frances coastline 
norgle on tuesday formally endorsed an order he spelled out in 
june that order was based on damage recommendations from former 
us district judge frank mcgarr appointed the cases special 
master after retiring from the bench in january 1988 
the order was finalized after lawyers for amoco and the french 
parties suing the chicagobased company agreed upon interest 
payments on the damages 
norgle ordered amoco to pay about 690 million francs or about 
120 million split equally in damages and interest to the french 
government local governments and businesses 
amoco also was ordered to pay damages in british pounds to the 
shell oil company owner of the spilled oil in the rough 
equivalent of 35 million 
amoco tuedsay also said it will sue the ships builder 
astilleros espanoles sa of spain to recover damages 
the spanish shipbuilder has refused to participate in the us 
district court contending it lacks jurisdiction in a statement 
however it said the court found that amocos extensive 
negligence was the cause of the grounding and oil spill 
the tanker ran aground march 16 1978 two miles off the 
brittany coast and spilled 68 million gallons of light fuel oil 
the worlds worst spill until a spill in the gulf of mexico in 
1979 the exxon valdez last year spilled nearly 11 million gallons 
the amoco cadiz was under tow through the english channel when 
the towlines snapped in hurricaneforce winds and heavy seas 
impaling it on rocks

mohawk indians locked in an armed impasse 
over a plot of land are running low on food and could face criminal 
charges but other indians from across the nation are rallying to 
their support 
the assembly of first nations said tuesday it was organizing a 
peace and justice caravan that is expected in oka on sunday 
ovide mercredi manitoba regional chief of the indian assembly 
said as many as 10000 indians and nonindians from across canada 
would take part 
he said they would try to take food and essential supplies to 
the oka mohawks but do not plan to challenge police barricades 
police have opened several hundred criminal investigations which 
could lead to charges from quebecs justice minister against the 
mohawks provincial police constable andre blanchette said tuesday 
the investigations began after the death of cpl marcel lemay 
during a police assault on the mohawk barricades at the kanesatake 
reservation near oka about 20 miles west of montreal 
two of the investigations concern possible charges of murder and 
conspiracy to murder the 31yearold police officer though it has 
not yet been determined whether he was shot by an indian or a 
fellow officer 
other charges include possession of prohibited firearms 
discharging firearms theft of police vehicles blocking roads 
threatening to blow up a bridge firing submachineguns evicting

world alliance of reformed churches an international council of

secretary of state james a baker iii will try 
to clear the last roadblocks to a ceasefire in afghanistan during 
a fournation trip to asia that began today 
us officials said baker and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze will discuss a timetable for president najibullah to 
step down during their meeting next week in irkutsk soviet siberia 
the soviets hinted at a deal they havent fleshed it out 
an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said tuesday the thread of the deal is going to be pursued in 
irkutsk by baker 
members of congress also have been pushing for a settlement in 
the 12yearold civil war earlier this month members of the 
senate intelligence committee voted to cut aid to the afghan rebels 
sen frank murkowski ralaska a member of the committee said 
he did not attend the meeting where the vote was taken but the 
rationale was that the rebels had achieved their purpose 
a congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
he understood the panel reduced funding for the rebels by about 
100 million last fall congress reportedly appropriated about 
300 million for the rebels 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the intelligence 
committee would not talk about the action on afghanistan in the 
past however he has called for a reassessment of aid to the 
rebels 
a state department official said congress appropriates less than 
10 percent of what the soviets give their allies in afghanistan 
moscow reportedly spends about 300 million a month to maintain the 
najibullah government 
for weeks the bush administration has hoped for a breakthrough 
to end the war between afghan government forces armed by the soviet 
union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with americansupplied 
weapons funneled through pakistan 
the administration official disputed a report from moscow by abc 
news on tuesday that shevardnadze and baker already had cut a deal 
to end the civil war baker is scheduled to meet shevardnadze on 
aug 1 
the soviets have not yet conveyed to the united states how 
najibullah might be removed from power in kabul said the 
administration official 
the soviet union installed the najibullah government in 1979 
but the government in kabul has been unable to impose its will on 
the countryside the soviets withdrew their troops last year but 
continued to supply arms 
the soviets canceled plans this month to send a delegation to 
washington for talks on when najibullah should yield power both 
sides already have reached a tacit agreement that najibullah would 
play no role in the new government and would step down at some 
point before his successor take over 
administration officials did not criticize moscow for not 
sending the delegation they said they thought the kremlin was 
simply preoccupied with the 28th communist party congress at the 
time 
on his asia trip baker also will attend a meeting of the 
association of southeast asian nations in indonesia and will hold 
talks in singapore and visit outer mongolia

capt joseph hazelwood will try to 
hold on to his license as a ships master at a coast guard hearing 
to determine if he was guilty of negligence in the nations worst 
oil spill 
todays administrative law hearing comes just four months after 
the skipper of the exxon valdez was acquitted in alaska on similar 
charges 
the judge harry j gardner could elect to dismiss all charges 
revoke hazelwoods license or place him on probation according to 
the coast guard and hazelwoods lawyers no fine or prison term can 
be levied 
hazelwood was accused of breaking a coast guard rule by drinking 
alcohol within four hours of assuming command of his ship and 
leaving the ships bridge while the vessel was traveling through 
prince william sound 
he also was accused of leaving a crewman who did not have a 
required license in control of the bridge 
hazelwoods attorney michael chalos contended in a telephone 
interview tuesday that any drinking within four hours of sailing 
was unintentional because the ship left port an hour earlier than 
scheduled 
he argued the coast guard had waived its requirement that the 
person in control of the bridge have a pilotage license for prince 
william sound and said the coast guard did not adequately monitor 
the exxon valdez via radar 
the exxon valdez was en route from the alaskan port of valdez to 
long beach on march 24 1989 when it struck a charted reef gashed 
by jagged rocks the 987foot tanker spilled nearly 11 million 
gallons of alaska crude oil 
hazelwood was acquitted of being drunk and reckless but was 
convicted of one misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil 
he was ordered to pay 50000 restitution and spend 1000 hours 
cleaning beaches at prince william sound he is appealing the 
verdict

nasa detected a hydrogen leak during 
testing today of atlantis fuel tank which could mean a trip back 
to the hangar for the shuttle and further reduction of nasas 1990 
flight plans 
this mornings test was the third filling of atlantis external 
fuel tank in hopes of pinpointing the leaks source the shuttle 
had been scheduled to blast off on a classified pentagon flight in 
midjuly 
there was no immediate indication how much fuel escaped during 
todays testing but it appeared to exceed allowed amounts 
it is currently unclear where the leaks were originating 
from said nasa spokesman bruce buckingham we are analyzing 
the situation 
space agency workers had tightened bolts in atlantis porous 
fuel line but officials doubted that would be enough to correct 
the problem 
the space shuttle columbia also is crippled by a hydrogen leak 
and is being fixed if no leaks had occurred in atlantis today 
nasa would have tried to launch it in midaugust and columbia in 
september the possibility of launching both shuttles in the next 
two months was uncertain after the leak reappeared 
the national aeronautics and space administration today also 
planned to launch an atlas rocket bearing a government satellite 
designed to illuminate the earths usually invisible magnetic 
fields with brightly colored gas cloud displays 
atlantis leak was believed to be in a flange in a pipe that 
carries liquid hydrogen from the tank to the main engines 
plastic bags to isolate leaking gas and about 20 sensors were 
placed over the flange and elsewhere in the fuel line to help find 
the source of the leak 
atlantis leak was discovered during the first socalled tanking 
test on june 29 that prompted nasa to temporarily ground its 
threeshuttle fleet the leak also appeared during a more elaborate 
test two weeks later 
columbias leak believed to be larger and in a different place 
was detected during fueling for a may 30 launch attempt the leaky 
plumbing has been replaced with components from the new shuttle 
endeavour under construction in california 
if atlantis goes back to the hangar nasa could attach a new 
external tank and roll the shuttle back to the launch pad for a 
september liftoff or move columbia out to the pad for a september 
flight with the astro observatory 
nasa officials want to get at least one of the shuttles up 
before discoverys october mission with the sunprobing ulysses 
satellite discovery must lift off between oct 5 and oct 23 or 
the mission will be delayed 13 months when earth is in proper 
alignment again with the sun and jupiter

east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
convened his cabinet today but there were two empty chairs because 
one party pulled out of the government in a clash over united 
german elections 
the departure of the centrist liberal party and a threat by the 
leftleaning social democrats to follow suit has jeopardized the 
broad coalition chosen to steer the nation to unity with west 
germany 
the social democrats the nations secondbiggest party have 
said they will leave the government by friday unless their demands 
are met 
sabine bergmannpohl president of the parliament and a 
christian democrat pleaded for unity and told the liberals that 
they can return to the government 
the door to the coalition is not entirely shut she said of 
the dispute which could delay reunification if it worsens 
the social democrats and the liberals want east germany to 
dissolve itself on dec 1 and for single elections across german 
lands to be held on dec 2 
parties would need at least 5 percent of the vote from the 
entire combined electorate to be represented in a new united 
parliament 
de maiziere and several smaller parties including the former 
communists ousted last year want east germany to wait until just 
after the dec 2 elections before it ceases to be a nation 
the elections would be held separately in both german states 
how a party did in its own country would determine its 
representation in parliament under that scenario a party would 
have a far better chance of winning 5 percent of the vote in east 
germany than if the electorates were combined 
that proposal would increase the likelihood that smaller east 
german political parties would get seats in a new parliament 
west german chancellor helmut kohl like de maiziere a christian 
democrat wants smaller east german conservative parties to win 
seats so they can bolster a christian democrat coalition 
the social democrats believe they will be hurt by the separate 
elections because it would split the leftleaning vote among 
smaller leftist parties 
political analysts say the outcome of the feud could help 
determine whether kohl or the social democrats govern a united 
germany 
the liberals resigned from the government late tuesday and the 
two liberals in the cabinet regional affairs minister manfred 
preiss and construction minister axel viehwege stayed away from a 
cabinet meeting this morning 
the liberals hold 21 of the 400 seats in parliament and two of 
the 26 ministries 
if the social democrats also leave the government de maiziere 
could lose control of parliament where a twothirds majority is 
needed to enact unification 
however all major parties are committed to unification the 
strife if not settled would more likely slow the process rather 
than derail it 
in an interview with the west german newspaper bild today de 
maiziere was quoted as saying the liberals departure would not 
hinder my government and that the process of unifying germany 
would be completed 
de maiziere later flew to vienna for a meeting with austrian 
chancellor franz vranitzky the two were to discuss economic ties 
the east german leader also had reportedly planned to consult 
with kohl who is vacationing in austria on the government crisis 
but a de maiziere spokesman said no meeting was planned

nelson mandela said today the 
african national congress will halt its armed struggle as soon as 
the government meets its demands for political reforms and 
possibly sooner 
mandela indicated the anc might accept a government commitment 
to change rather than insisting on the reforms being implemented 
before armed action ceases 
the government must remove all the obstacles then we will 
suspend the armed struggle mandela said adding that the timing 
of the ceasefire was negotiable 
but mandela also said as long as apartheid is the case the 
armed struggle will go on 
the anc of which mandela is deputy president is demanding the 
government allow thousands of exiles to return home without fear of 
arrest free prisoners convicted of politically motivated crimes 
stop trials for politically motivated acts repeal laws restricting 
political freedom and lift the state of emergency in natal 
province 
until these changes are made the anc has said it will not 
participate in formal negotiations with the government on ending 
apartheid to give the black majority a say in national affairs 
the government wants the anc to formally end its military 
activities before negotiations begin 
mandela told a news conference the anc leadership was confident 
progress would be made on clearing away the obstacles at an aug 6 
meeting with government officials 
the anc national executive committee decided at a twoday 
meeting that it will definitely suspend all armed activites once 
the obstacles have been removed he said he added that anc 
guerrillas have not killed anyone since talks with the government 
began in may 
he acknowledged that the anc leadership was having difficulty 
getting word to members of its guerrilla wing spear of the nation 
about the plan to suspend armed activity 
the men who have been deployed in the country are still 
operating according to the old instructions and we have been trying 
to reach all of them mandela said 
the government and anc agreed to commit themselves to a peaceful 
resolution of the countrys problems during talks in may two 
months after president fw de klerk freed mandela from prison and 
legalized the anc after a 30year ban 
the government has granted amnesty to certain anc leaders and 
allowed them to enter the country to begin reforming the 
organization 
however it is still illegal for anc guerrillas to infiltrate 
and store weapons in addition de klerk has not lifted the state 
of emergency in natal province the site of black factional 
fighting 
mandela said no infiltrations of guerrillas had occurred since 
the may 24 peace talks 
he also denied local news reports of an alleged plot by 
communist members of the anc military wing to mount an 
insurrection i dont need to repudiate anybody because there is 
no such plot he said 
his comment about anc members not having killed anyone since may 
seemed to refer specifically to planned and directed activities by 
its armed wing 
in fighting between anc supporters and rival black groups 
hundreds of people have died in the past few months and anc 
opponents say guerrilla wing members have participated in the 
violence 
the fighting has pitted anc affiliates against the zulubased 
inkatha political party in natal province

the head of the arianespace rocket launching 
consortium is leaving for a new job now that the ariane program is 
back in business following a liftoff explosion in february 
an ariane rocket successfully lifted a double payload of french 
and german tv satellites into orbit tuesday night five months 
after a similar rocket exploded 
french transport minister paul quiles in attendance at the 
ariane launch center in french guiana announced that frederic 
dallest president of arianespace since its creation in 1980 
would be leaving shortly to become secondincommand at the french 
aerospace company matra 
dallest 50 said he had planned the move for several months 
but did not want to leave until arianespace overcame the february 
failure with a successful mission he is expected to be replaced by 
arianespaces director general charles bigot 
tuesdays flight put the fivechannel french television 
satellite tdf 2 and the 11channel dfs kopernikus 2 for west 
germanys deutsche bundespost telekom into geostationary orbit 
always staying above the same spot on the earths surface at an 
altitude of 22328 miles 
ariane flight 37 was the first launch of a european rocket since 
an ariane carrying two japanese communications satellites blew up 
less than two minutes after takeoff feb 22 launches were 
suspended after the accident 
februarys failure was the fifth in the ariane series and was 
particularly costly because arianespace had lobbied hard for the 
japanese contracts 
bigot who was present for tuesdays launch said the flight was 
doubly important 
it is putting into orbit two satellites of the countries who 
have given the most support to ariane politically technologically 
and industrially it is also the flight in which we pick up after 
the failure of flight 36 he said 
ariane rockets dominate the private aerospace industry carrying 
about half the worlds commercial payloads into space arianespace 
the commercial partner of the european space agency has contracts 
worth 28 billion to launch 37 more satellites 
the next mission is scheduled for aug 30 putting into orbit a 
telecommunications satellite for eutelsat and a british military 
satellite skynet4c 
arianespace is a consortium made up of aerospace electronics 
and banking companies from 11 countries belgium britain 
denmark france ireland italy netherlands spain switzerland 
sweden and west germany 
its rockets have sent into space 45 commercial satellites from 
canada france west germany britain india italy spain and the 
united states as well as international organizations such as 
intelsat and eutelsat 
ariane is facing increased competition however from american 
privatesector rockets including the titan4 made by martin 
marietta corp general dynamics atlascentaur and the delta built 
by mcdonnell douglas

one of rep doug barnards republican 
opponents announced his candidacy under a billboard showing a giant 
check for 20000 give the money back congressman barnard 
the text demands 
the pressure is on and so is the race by many politicians to 
get rid of campaign contributions linked to the savings and loan 
industry 
rising public outrage over the multibilliondollar thrift mess 
is making the return of sampl money an increasingly popular means of 
declaring independence from the troubled industry 
while barnard dga a senior member of the house banking 
committee deliberates over what to do with his sampl contributions 
some lawmakers are marking checks return to sender 
others are mailing the money to the us treasury often 
earmarking their checks for deficit reduction or the fight against 
sampl fraud one signed a 98950 check on monday and dispatched it 
to his home state 
i didnt want to have it go to build mx missiles said sen 
tim wirth dcolo explaining tuesday why he sent the money to the 
colorado treasury 
wirth a banking committee member who does not face reelection 
until 1992 said many of his colleagues are cornering him to ask 
questions about what he did 
theres a tremendous feeling of liberation he said i 
think youre going to see a lot of people doing it including 
leadership people 
aides to senate republican leader bob dole of kansas are poring 
over a decade of records to find contributors associated with 
troubled thrifts dole says hes prepared to return tainted 
contributions to the treasury 
heres what some others are doing 
sen donald riegle dmich chairman of the senate banking 
committee said he was sending the treasury 120000 all the 
money he has received from thrift interests and kept since 1983 in 
1988 riegle returned 78250 he had received from charles keating 
operator of the failed lincoln sampl of irvine calif 
sen carl levin dmich running for reelection this year 
plans to send the treasury contributions hes received from people 
or organizations that are under investigation for wrongdoing in 
connection with a thrift failure the money will be earmarked for 
the resolution trust corp the agency cleaning up the sampl mess 
rep hank brown rcolo a senate candidate is sending the 
rtc a check for 9000 all the money he has gotten from sampl 
interests since he first ran for congress in 1979 earlier this 
year he returned two contributions from board members of silverado 
banking savings and loan a failed denver thrift 
rep dan schaefer rcolo is searching for sampllinked 
contributions dating from 1983 when he joined congress the total 
expected to be nearly 7000 will be sent to the treasurys 
public fund for debt reduction 
rep lindsay thomas dga returned 1100 to a political 
action committee affiliated with great southern federal savings amp 
loan in savannah to avoid any possibility of criticism or 
misunderstanding his letter was dated june 27 five days after 
the sampl had been taken over by a georgia bank in a federally 
supervised proceeding 
the democratic national committee recently returned a 5000 
contribution from someone linked to the sampl scandal but it refused 
to identify the contributor 
dnc chairman ron brown said last week that the party would 
return contributions that are determined to be illegal or where 
the circumstances surrounding the contribution suggest illegality 
a colorado senate candidate democrat carlos lucero has 
demanded that the republican national committee give the treasury a 
100000 contribution that came from ken good after he had declared 
bankruptcy and defaulted on loans from silverado 
rnc spokeswoman leslie goodman said the party is reviewing its 
contribution records and will consider giving back money but 
she said it would be premature to discuss contributions from 
specific people or organizations 
we have to define our terms what is taint how do you define 
it ms goodman said were certainly not going to slur 
anybodys reputation with the implication of guilt and were not 
going to act capriciously 
ed rollins cochairman of the house republican campaign 
committee has recommended that candidates ship their sampl 
contributions to the treasury but the chairman of the committee 
rep guy vander jagt of michigan says hell do no such thing 
deciding what constitutes tainted money and sifting through 
reams of records to find it can be a complicated business some 
lawmakers have simplified matters by making a clean sweep of all 
sampl contributions 
we couldnt make a distinction between good sampls and bad 
sampls wirth said the result was his renunciation of nearly 
100000 
i was just crushed when i found out how much money it was 
wirth said only halfjoking but it was probably the best money 
decision i ever made in a campaign

prosyrian militiamen fought sporadic 
gunbattles with iranianbacked rival shiite moslems in a strategic 
hilltop village leaving at least five combatants dead and 12 
wounded police said today 
the fighting came a day after the two sides battled 
housetohouse in an inconclusive showdown for control of the 
village of jarjou 
the new casualties raised the overall death toll to 144 killed 
and 439 wounded since the fundamentalist hezbollah or party of 
god captured jarjou from the more secular amal militia in a 
surprise attack on july 16 hezbollahs seizure of the village was 
aimed at expanding its area of control as far as the mediterranean 
coast to open a badly needed supply line to iran 
amal and hezbollah have been fighting intermittently for more 
than three years for control of lebanons 12 million shiites the 
countrys largest sect almost 2000 people have been killed and 
over 4000 wounded in that struggle 
tens of thousands of people continue to flee the current 
fighting in the region of iqlim altufah or apple province where 
jarjou is located 
police said 50000 of the provinces 75000 people have left the 
area the independent annahar newspaper said tuesday that only 
five of jarjous original 5000 inhabitants remain in the town 
there is no more life in jarjou said khadijeh mukalled a 
56yearold refugee who fled 
every morning when i woke up i didnt believe i was still 
alive she told reporters in the southern port city of sidon 
my house was set ablaze by shellfire i tried to put off the fire 
but i couldnt 
at last i decided to escape the hell of jarjou she said 
police said no new attacks were mounted today and that the only 
fighting was sporadic exchanges of machine gun and rocketpropelled 
grenade fire around jarjou and the surrounding towns 
on tuesday about 1500 fighters of the prosyrian amal militia

a judge has dropped all but one 
charge of possessing child pornography against a former daycare 
center owner who allegedly had hundreds of photographs of nude 
children 
police had charged john shaver 56 with 29 counts of possessing 
child pornography after police said they found the photographs at 
his home across from his nowclosed rainbow learning center 
shaver faced up to seven years in prison if convicted on all 
counts one count would be punishable by up to 22 months 
broward circuit judge robert tyson jr dropped the charges 
tuesday after defense attorney j david bogenschutz cited a recent 
state appellate court ruling that defendants can only be charged 
with one count of pornography possession no matter how many 
photographs they own 
its boiled down to a case of some alleged dirty pictures 
bogenschutz said about a police investigation that had widened into 
whether children at the daycare center had been abused and 
these pictures arent even of any children in the daycare 
bogenschutz said the states case expected to go to trial in 
september has fallen apart but prosecutor brian trehy disagreed 
nobody ever said this was more than a case of child 
pornography trehy said somehow people got the impression that 
this was a case of sexual abuse and there was never any evidence of 
that 
trehy said police had interviewed children who attended the 
daycare center and their parents because it was prudent in light 
of the situation to at least inquire whether there had been any 
abuse

federal prosecutors are investigating 
allegations that south carolinas top fbi agent avoided a drunken 
driving arrest with the help of the states chief highway 
patrolman sources said 
justice department officials were expected to arrive here today 
to begin the investigation of fred verinder the fbis special 
agentincharge for the state government sources told the 
associated press speaking on condition of anonymity 
verinder was taken home march 23 rather than to jail by col 
jh red lanier the state highway departments director of law 
enforcement the source said the fbi agent was stopped north of 
columbia after state trooper john osborne saw a government car 
weaving and running off the road sources said 
verinder failing a field sobriety test according to sources who 
saw an affidavit from the trooper the failure included his 
inability to recite the alphabet 
the agent then scuffled with osborne who handcuffed him and put 
him in the patrol car where verinder convinced the trooper to 
phone lanier who came to the scene and took him home 
verinder was cited for alleged speeding but never was given a 
breath test for alcohol nor charged with drunken driving 
an official at the fbis columbia office who refused to give his 
name said he had been told to say verinder refused to comment on 
the incident the official would not connect a reporter with 
verinder 
lanier denied he did anything wrong saying the trooper never 
told him verinder failed the field sobriety test 
he had been drinking verinder told me that but he wasnt 
drunk lanier said verinder told me hed had several 
drinks 
lanier denied his actions had anything to do with a federal 
investigation of the highway department which oversees 
construction as well as law enforcement 
the fbi is one of several agencies investigating allegations 
that highway department employees took money from contractors 
thats ridiculous lanier said he cant control an 
investigation that the state law enforcement division the irs and 
the fbi that three agencies are doing 
sources said gov carroll campbell was notified of the incident 
about a month later the governor told the ap tuesday night that he 
ordered the case brought to the attention of us attorney bart 
daniel and top state prosecutors 
the fact that the statement had been made verbally that the 
head of the fbi in south carolina had been assisted by the head 
of the highway patrol could have compromised the investigation 
campbell said 
the governor met with highway department chief joseph g 
rideoutte and highway commission chairman charles e dalton tuesday 
about the allegations campbell refused to discuss laniers future 
rideoutte said he was investigating the incident but wasnt 
considering firing lanier

maybe in the great expanse beyond the 
washington beltway there was some other topic of conversation 
maybe somewhere people talked about the weather or george 
steinbrenner or the dow in washington the subject was david 
souter 
in law offices at the national organization for women in the 
rooms at the national right to life committee at the washington 
legal foundation in the offices of newspapers wire services 
television networks in senate offices at the justice department 
in the fbi and around the water coolers in dozens of offices around 
the city the great search was on for the life and times the 
opinions and ideological bent of david souter 
mead data central which supplies legal information with its 
computerized lexis service and news and business information with 
nexis said searches of files containing information about souter 
jumped 10 percent from monday to tuesday 
the increase from 4500 to 5000 searches was in cases of the 
new hampshire supreme court of the attorney generals office when 
souter was there and of the 1st circuit of the united states court 
of appeals 
souter as in suitor an overnight celebrity the man of the 
hour president bushs mystery nominee to be associate justice of 
the supreme court 
in an instant a research industry was born 
i had heard the name souter before yesterday said richard 
samp chief counsel of the washington legal foundation he had 
vaguely been mentioned in connection with the anthony kennedy 
nomination years ago 
thats as far as the knowledge about souter went when president 
bush presented him late monday in the white house press room even 
the president did not seem to know much about souters opinions 
in my view it would have been inappropriate to ask him his 
views on specific issues said bush more important are the 
broad concepts of excellence is the man qualified does he share a 
broad view that what he ought to do on the bench is interpret the 
constitution and not legislate and so thats all i need 
samp along with others trying to get a handle on souter turned 
to the great computerized legal data banks for information the 
nominee has been a federal appeals judge only since april and said 
samp he has had absolutely zero written opinions to date 
but souter also was on the new hampshire supreme court for seven 
years and an associate justice of the state superior court for five 
years before that a 12year paper trail the handy thing about 
judging judges part of their job is explaining their decisions 
we have gotten a printout of all his decisions we are talking 
about 700800 if we include every opinion of the new hampshire 
supreme court issued during the time he was on the bench said 
samp if we are looking at the ones he authored there will be 
100150 
five noted conservatives held a news conference tuesday 
afternoon to say how they stood on the nomination four stood on 
yes and one on no all five said they didnt know much about souter 
there remain too many unanswered questions about who he is and 
how this nomination came about said peter flaherty chairman of 
the conservative campaign fund former chairman of citizens for 
reagan and the one who said no this man has been on the planet 
for 50 years never given a speech written an article 
robert grant president of the american freedom coalition said 
all he knows about souter is what he read in the paper theres a 
dearth of real information he said a pig in a poke the big 
question is what do we have in this 50yearold man who lives alone 
on a farm in the mountains of new hampshire 
richard viguerie chairman of united conservatives of america 
said most conservatives are cautious supporters who approve with 
nervous smiles 
as for souter the subject of all this his first full day as a 
nominee was spent in the white house where presidential aides told 
him what he could expect at the senate confirmation hearings they 
told him everything he had ever written could be picked on that 
his personal life would be scrutinized 
according to reports the man who has the answers to all the 
questions didnt seem too concerned about the prospect

a search for drugs on a korean tanker 
revealed stuffed sea turtles belonging to an endangered species and 
about five tons of coral from protected philippine reefs 
this is unique weve never seen this amount of coral 
before said rick ellison chief of us customs inspectors for 
the san francisco waterfront 
importation of the items violates federal and international laws 
prohibiting transporting and possessing endangered or protected 
wildlife 
eight stuffed green sea turtles one over 3 feet long and 1100 
blooms of coral were seized last week from the ship the bum dong 
which has since left for korea no charges were filed 
crew members said the items were destined for korea authorities 
said 
there is an active market in endangered wildlife items in south 
korea because it is not party to an international treaty regulating 
trade in such species said ginette hemley with the world wildlife 
fund in washington dc 
the eight turtles were valued at between 3000 and 5000 with 
the coral estimated to be worth 30000 said scott pearson of the 
us fish and wildlife service 
customs had been tipped that the ship hauling coconut oil 
might be carrying drugs said ellison 
he said no drugs were found but the coral and turtles were 
found in the living areas of the 444foot ship

the 1986 contra supply plane crash that led to 
revelations of us involvement in the irancontra affair is at the 
center of a civil lawsuit that opened today against richard secord 
and a cialinked airline 
eugene hasenfus the sole survivor when sandinista forces shot 
down his c132 in nicaragua during a supply run has accused secord 
and southern air transport of misleading him and using planes that 
were wholly inadequate and dilapidated 
hasenfus who was captured by the government troops and held for 
three months is joined in the lawsuit by the family of wallace 
sawyer jr the copilot who died in the october 1986 crash 
jury selection began today with hasenfus expected to take the 
stand later in the day as the first witness secord also was 
present 
secord a retired air force major general pleaded guilty nov 8 
to lying to congressional investigators when he said he wasnt 
aware of any money that went to oliver norths benefit from the 
maze of companies he had used in the irancontra affair secord on 
jan 24 was sentenced to two years probation 
when the suit was filed in 1988 attorneys had estimated damages 
at 135 million but on tuesday the judge asked for more specific 
figures 
following the crash the reagan administration faced with 
evidence found in the plane acknowledged money was diverted from 
iran arms sales to the contra supply operation 
the suit says hasenfus was recruited in 1986 through the 
pennsylvania airline corporate air services and william cooper a 
southern air pilot 
cooper who also died in the crash led hasenfus to believe 
the contra resupply operation was being run right out of the 
back door of the white house by north secord and southern air 
the suit said 
hasenfus and the sawyer family claim secord misrepresented the 
nature of the flights and failed to take routine safety precautions 
such as providing parachutes 
southern air once owned by the cia has denied any association 
with the hasenfus flight even though the plane was registered to 
corporate air which had the same office address as southern air

orders to us factories for big ticket 
manufactured goods plunged 32 percent in june the government said 
today 
the commerce department said that demand for durable goods 
items expected to last three or more years suffered a maytojune 
decline of 414 billion to a seasonally adjusted 12469 billion 
last month 
the report caught analysts by surprise they had been expecting 
a healthy increase following on the heels of a 42 percent rise in 
may 
the decline the third in the past six months served to 
emphasize the problems besetting the us manufacturing sector 
in another economic report today a real estate trade group 
reported that sales of existing homes in june posted their first 
increase since last september 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes bolstered by falling mortgage rates rose a 
modest 12 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 334 
million units 
durable goods orders are considered a key signpost for the 
future since a drop in orders normally triggers cutbacks in 
production plans and job layoffs 
the 32 percent june decline was the weakest performance since a 
41 percent drop in april orders had fallen 105 percent in 
january the biggest drop on record 
for the first six months of the year orders totaled 7447 
billion 15 percent below the same period in 1989 indicating how 
sluggish demand has been this year in fact the monthly level of 
12469 billion in orders was 56 percent below the record level of 
orders reached more than two years ago 
the june weakness was widespread across all industry groups 
about half of the decline was attributed to a 207 percent drop in 
orders for military hardware the biggest setback in the defense 
category since a 336 percent drop in january 
the military sector tends to be extremely volatile depending on 
the timing of government contracts 
but even without the big defense decrease durable goods orders 
would have been down 17 percent 
orders in the key category of nondefense capital goods 
considered a good barometer of businesses plans to expand and 
modernize were up a small 03 percent after declines of 14 
percent in may and 106 percent in april 
the largest industry decline came in transportation down 48 
percent to 338 billion most of this decline came in aircraft 
orders 
electrical machinery was down 39 percent to 199 billion with 
electronic components accounting for most of the decrease 
the machinery category which includes computers fell 32 
percent to 217 billion 
orders for primary metals such as steel fell 49 percent to 
113 billion 
shipments of durable goods increased slightly in june up a 
modest 05 percent to 1273 billion for the first half of 1990 
shipments totaled 7409 billion 11 percent above the first half 
of 1989

police said today two men were 
being questioned about an ira bombing that killed three police 
officers and the first nun to die in northern irelands sectarian 
conflict 
the iras political wing said it regretted the deaths but blamed 
british policy in northern ireland 
the three officiers of the royal ulster constabulary police 
the force of the protestantdominated british province died 
instantly when an estimated halfton of explosives was detonated 
beneath their car on a rural highway just after 2 pm tuesday 
police said 
the nun sister catherine dunne who was in an oncoming car 
died at a hospital shortly after the blast a 25yearold social 
worker who was a passenger in the nuns car cathy mccann was 
injured she was reported in satisfactory condition this morning 
sinn fein the iras political wing said in a statement it 
deeply regrets all deaths which occur as a result of this 
conflict whether they be those of active participants in the 
conflict or innocent victims like sister catherine dunne 
but the statement issued by the republican press center in 
belfast said the conflict continues because of britains 
insistence on placing obstacles in the way of a genuine peace 
process 
police said two men were arrested at their homes not far from 
the scene of the explosion on the outskirts of armagh they were 
being questioned about serious terrorist crimes in the armagh 
area including the latest bombing said a police spokesman who 
under standing rules was not identified 
the explosion blasted a crater nearly 10 feet deep crushed the 
policemens car and flipped it over and knocked the nuns small 
car off the road 
an anonymous caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the 
mainly catholic ira which is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland 
protestant and catholic leaders joined in vigorous condemnation 
of the attack 
catholic bishop cahal daly said the death of sister catherine 
added a new dimension of poignancy and horror but he said 
there were no legitimate targets all four people murdered were 
innocent victims of a senseless and evil campaign 
two of the three police officers were married and they had a 
total of six young children 
irish prime minister charles haughey called the slayings 
utterly futile and irelands anglican primate the most rev 
robin eames expressed his absolute disgust at the brutal attack 
on policemen and civilians 
the irish news a belfast daily which serves the catholic 
community said in todays editions that an anonymous caller 
claimed responsibility on behalf of the ira 
the second battalion north armagh brigade claims 
responsibility for the military action at armagh today the 
caller said 
he did not give a recognized code word which often accompanies 
ira statements the newspaper said 
nor was there any apology such as the one the ira offered after 
killing two australian tourists in the netherlands on may 28 or the 
6monthold daughter of a british soldier in west germany on oct 
26 
police said the latest bomb apparently was triggered from a 
nearby bungalow while the occupants including young children were 
held hostage 
the three officers killed were identified as constable william 
james hanson 37 of armagh and reserve officers joshua cyril 
willis 35 of caledon and david sterritt 34 from markethill 
the ira killed four soldiers with a similar bomb beneath a road 
on april 9 attacks against police officers and soldiers are a 
trademark of the ira and smaller groups fighting british rule 
the ira wants to unite the province with the 95 percent catholic 
republic of ireland under socialist rule 
sister catherine a native of dublin and a member of the sisters 
of st louis was deputy director of st josephs training school 
a training center for young offenders in middletown 10 miles 
outside armagh 
at the middletown convent where sister catherine lived with 15 
other nuns she was remembered as a lovely young woman full of 
life and joy by sister fiona fullam regional superior of the st 
louis sisters 
she said the nuns funeral would be held friday at the convent 
the irish news said she was the first nun among the nearly 2800 
deaths attributed to sectarian and political violence since 1969 
two priests were killed in the early 1970s it said 
the 21year death toll includes 273 police officers and 
reservists 
armagh is the ecclesiastical capital of all ireland and the 
cathedrals of the catholic and anglican primates dominate its 
skyline 
according to tradition the city owes its prominence to st 
patrick who chose it as his seat

fiji adopted a constitution today that 
guarantees native fijians a majority in both houses of a new 
parliament 
the constitution calls for the native fijians to be allocated 37 
of the 70 seats in a house of representatives and 24 of the 34 
senate seats 
the guaranteed majority has been a demand of the military which 
overthrew a coalition dominated by ethnic indians in 1987 the 
military said the coup was necessary to protect the rights of 
indigenous fijians 
native fijians and ethnic indians each comprise slightly less 
than half of the 720000 people in fiji an island nation in the 
south pacific 
indians were a majority before the coup which was followed by a 
second military takeover in 1987 but emigration has since depleted 
their numbers 
president ratu sir penaia ganilau a native fijian promulgated 
the document following cabinet approval calling it an historic 
and solemn duty and asking for national reconciliation 
he said in a nationally broadcast radio speech that the 
constitution would immediately take effect as the supreme law of 
the land he added that he hoped elections would be held next 
year 
indian leaders have branded the constitution as racist 
feudalistic and undemocratic and said they would boycott the 
planned elections 
the constitution has not yet been released publicly 
ganilau said the coups were the result of a growing sense of 
insecurity among native fijians because indians dominated commerce 
finance and industry 
it seems only fair and just that the fijian position should be 
strengthened in some areas to compensate for its weaknesses in 
others 
he called on indians who were brought to fiji by the british as 
indentured sugarplantation workers to set aside that memory 
along with their sense of grievance about the past 
join with the fijians in sharing the nations resources and 
participating fully in national life ganilau said 
the proclamation comes 2 years after the country was declared a 
republic the 1970 postindependence constitution was revoked 
following the second coup 
in late may new delhi said it would launch an international 
campaign against fiji over the new constitution fiji ordered the 
indian embassy closed and expelled its diplomats in retaliation 
new zealand prime minister geoffrey palmer recently criticized 
the constitution saying it would not improve strained bilateral 
relations

three cubans who had sought refuge in the swiss 
embassy in havana have voluntarily left swiss officials said today 
the asylumseekers who managed to penetrate tight cuban 
security had entered the swiss compound on sunday they told 
diplomats they wanted to leave the country because of restrictions 
on free speech 
the departures reported by swiss officials in havana and bern 
left 18 cubans in the spanish embassy and four in the home of the 
italian ambassador 
the wave of asylumseeking at embassies in havana began two 
weeks ago not long after similar incidents were occurring at 
embassies in albania albania like cuba is a hardline communist 
state that has refused to follow the lead of other eastern european 
countries in adopting democratic reforms 
cuba has contended the asylumseekers are part of a 
usinspired western plot to destabilize its communist government 
a charge the united states and european countries have denied 
in bern the swiss foreign ministry said the departure of the 
three came after assurances by cuban authorities that there would 
be no reprisals against them ministry spokesman michel pache said 
the swiss ambassador to cuba markus kaiser planned to stay in 
contact with the men and monitor their situation 
the men had told swiss diplomats they were being followed by 
police although they gave no individual examples of persecution 
pache said 
although switzerland had granted the men temporary refuge in the 
embassy it did not recognize them as political refugees according 
to the foreign ministry 
pache said embassy staff drove two of the cubans to undisclosed 
locations on tuesday the third agreed to leave the embassy this 
morning 
nine of the cubans in the spanish embassy are threatening a 
hunger strike to protest what they say is poor food 
the spanish and italians have refused to turn over the 
asylumseekers which has strained both countries ties with cuba 
todays departures came one day after a senior cuban official 
demanded the unconditional and voluntary departure of the 
cubans now being sheltered at foreign embassies 
cubas vice foreign minister jose r viera said it is not 
admissible for a cuban wishing to emigrate to circumvent normal 
procedures by forcing his way into an embassy 
viera sought to portray the incidents at the embassies as 
unrepresentative of the overall situation in cuba there has been a 
substantial increase in security around many diplomatic missions of 
nato countries 
the vice foreign minister said the annual carnival celebration 
this week has been proceeding normally the highlight of the 
carnival celebration is a speech thursday by president fidel castro 
commemorating the 37th anniversary of his debut as a rebel fighter 
castro took power in cuba in 1959 
while cuba has called the asylumseekers scum and habitual 
vagrants and said it will never allow them to leave the island 
spain has said it will not expel the cubans and will try instead to 
negotiate their departure 
last week reflecting escalating tensions between the two 
countries spain suspended a 25 million aid program to cuba 
recalled its ambassador and sent four guards to bolster security at 
its embassy in havana 
spains foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez had said 
castro is afraid his hardline communist government will fall like 
those in eastern europe if he allows cubans to leave fernandez 
ordonez also urged a transition to democracy in cuba

an 81yearold man convicted of 
murdering his ailing wife in what he said was a mercy killing may 
be transferred to a more comfortable prison under a state review of 
a crackdown on prison security 
roswell gilbert who suffers from heart and lung diseases was 
moved from a mediumsecurity to a topsecurity prison earlier this 
month after gov bob martinez ordered all prisoners serving minimum 
mandatory sentences for violent offenses be taken out of 
lesssecure prisons 
that order came after donald dillbeck serving a mandatory life 
sentence in the murder of a policeman walked away from a 
workrelease program last month and was charged with killing a 
shopper outside a mall 
bob macmaster a spokesman for the state department of 
corrections said wednesday that the cases of gilbert and 46 other 
elderly ill and disabled inmates serving sentences for violent 
crimes will be reviewed by monday for possible transfer to less 
secure prisons where they would have more privileges 
fifty other inmates whose medical conditions are less serious 
also are likely candidates for transfers said paula tully a 
corrections department spokeswoman 
gilberts attorney brad stark praised the decision to 
reconsider the move 
the bottom line is that gilbert finds being in a 
maximumsecurity facility a big strain emotionally and 
physically stark said 
gilberts 73yearold wife emily was suffering from 
alzheimers disease when he shot and killed her on march 4 1985

an armed robber was shot to death after he 
burst into a motel room unaware that seven armed officers were 
inside setting up a drug sting authorities said 
the man was shot by one of the officers as an accomplice took 
their wallets authorities said 
the officers were in two adjoining rooms of a super 8 motel 
early tuesday when darnell madison 37 and jacqueline lynn 
simmons 21 came through the partly open door of one of the rooms 
officers said 
madison armed with a 38caliber revolver announced a robbery 
and quickly herded the seven officers together the officers part 
of the jefferson county drug task force carried several thousand 
dollars that they planned to use to buy drugs and film the deal 
when he came in i thought he was somebody connected with the 
drug deal coming early to rip us off officer robert knight said 
we figured out pretty quickly though that he had no idea we 
were there to make a drug deal much less that we were the police 
the gunman told everyone to get on the floor and simmons to 
collect the wallets sheriffs sgt billy james said 
madison repeatedly said he would kill the men if they tried 
anything police said 
we had guns in our holsters guns on shelves guns everywhere 
but we couldnt get to them knight said 
as the woman started collecting wallets madison was distracted 
by one officer and another eased his gun out of his holster and 
shot the robber five times police said 
a few seconds later she would have seen a badge and that 
would have been it knight said the officer who did the 
shooting literally saved our lives no doubt 
simmons was charged with robbery she was being held wednesday 
on 100000 bond 
officials said madison had a lengthy criminal record and was on 
parole for a robbery conviction when he broke into the hotel room 
police refused to disclose the identity of the deputy who shot 
madison lt linn moore said the officer is not being accused of 
any wrongdoing 
chief deputy frank rogers said he could not disclose who the 
undercover sting unit was targeting when it went to the motel but 
he said the attempted robbery brought the sting plans to a close 
and we dont know what happened to the drug suspects

helped establish an institute that will work to save the global 
environment 
the aspen institute on global change cosponsored by the amway 
corp of ada mich the united nations environment program and the 
national aeronautics and space administration will bring leading 
scientists together each summer in aspen colo to trade ideas 
this is not just another thinktank denver said at a news 
conference adding that saving the global environment is the most 
important task that faces the human race at this time 
denver said an education and outreach program would try to 
bridge the gap between researchers and people who want to be 
involved in local environmental action 
william nicholson amways chief operating officer said the 
direct marketing company has committed 500000 to the institute 
over the next five years 
rick chappell associate director of science at nasas marshall 
space flight center said nasa contributed 40000 
chappell said that a possible project would enlist large numbers 
of students and others in simple environmental tests at points on 
earth also being monitored from space as a way to check the 
accuracy of satellite measurements of earth conditions 
it would be the ultimate field trip for the kids chappell

the registerguard eugene ore on balancing the budget 
once again congress has rejected the chimera of a balanced 
budget amendment to the constitution 
the simple practical truth is that the problem was not created 
by a flaw in the rules governing the way budgets are put together 
nor can the trouble be eliminated by tinkering with those rules 
whether constitutional or merely statutory the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law is an example of the latter 
rather a continuing string of excessive deficits has resulted 
from political cowardice an unwillingness to either raise taxes 
to cover expenditures or cut spending to stay within revenues 
those are the only two ways to balance a federal budget 
spurred by ronald reagans election and his crusade against 
taxes the government in 1981 switched from a democratic policy the 
new president derided as tax and spend tax and spend to a new 
approach borrow and spend borrowing to cover the gaps between 
annual expenditures and revenues more than doubled the national 
debt in less than a decade and made interest payments on the debt 
the third largest item in the budget consuming 20 percent of 
current spending 
the ballooning cost of the savings and loan rescue measures 
among other things has frightened george bush into abandoning his 
dogmatic opposition to any tax increase that breakthrough may 
create opportunities for the kinds of compromise that will be 
essential if current budget negotiations are to achieve success

the repository canton ohio on the sampl bailout 
have you noticed that public anger over the cost of the sampl 
bailout has journeyed upward several notches 
and there has been a corresponding reaction in congress to take 
some steps to reassure the american people on these points 1 
that wrongdoers will be prosecuted 2 that illgotten gains will 
be confiscated and some of the money paid back to the institutions 
from which it was stolen 3 that legal barn doors are being 
closed to keep such a scandal from occurring again 
theres another point that deserves attention but is not 
getting it you hear no debate about why it is that all the states 
have to share in the bailout regardless of how much or how little 
of the crookedness occurred within the borders of individual 
states 
when the shape of new clean air legislation was being hammered 
out in meetings between the administration and senate leaders and 
then later in senate debate no one wanted to hear anything about 
the regionalism aspect of the legislation 
lawmakers from the west and new england were determined that the 
midwest states would pay more than anyone else because of the 
regions reliance on coalfired utilities 
this is why states in the midwest have a bigger beef about the 
sampl bailout than some others that are not happy about paying for 
outofcontrol wheeling and dealing particularly in texas and 
california its also why washington hasnt heard the last of this 
issue not by a long shot

savings and loan association in denver has been charged by thrift 
regulators with failing to mention his business relationship with

failed thrifts nationwide to the estimated tune of 500 billion 
the tab for silverado is estimated at 1 billion 
congressional democrats are also up to their necks in the sampl

congress and the justice department must put aside partisan zeal 
and fervently seek culpability and remedy for what is becoming 
the nations largest financial scandal even if mr bush gets mad

the names are not holdovers from the mccarthy era more than 
twothirds of them were put on it during the reagan and bush 
administrations some 4399 were added during the first three 
months of this year alone 
the widow of former chilean president salvador allende was 
denied permission to give a speech to an american organization that 
had invited her at various times our government bureaucrats have

chicago suntimes on radar detectors 
now that the trucking industry has called for a federal ban on 
radar detectors in interstate trucks the radar detector lobby once 
again drags out its longdiscredited constitutional argument 
against a ban 
the government cant limit a citizens use of a radar detector 
any more than it can limit the use of an amfm radio said an 
industry flack 
sorry friend but the government can and it does radar 
detector bans imposed by a few courageous states not just on 
trucks but on all vehicles have been upheld by the courts 
and not only can the government impose such bans it clearly 
ought to do it radar detectors are used only for one purpose to 
break the law and a survey found that between 33 percent and 52 
percent of individual semitrailer drivers checked in a sevenstate 
survey used the detectors 
the next time youre being tailgated by one of those hotshot 
jockeys you can rightly wonder about whose rights are being

green bay wis pressgazette on pete rose 
the pete rose story is both sad and instructive 
it is sad because roses sentencing on two felony tax 
charges is further hope it is the final humiliation for a 
sports legend 
roses major league baseball record earned him a long stint in 
the limelight but now banished from baseball and facing a 
fivemonth prison term he stands in the harsher light of public 
scrutiny 
it is instructive because the rose case proves again that the 
law applies to the famous as well as to those whose names never 
graced a boxscore or a record book 
by baseball standards rose is an oldtimer but at 49 he is 
young enough to pay his debt to society and get his life in order 
pete roses baseball records will last a long time so will the 
image of a man who put himself above the law and now must pay the 
price

the government today charged four people 
with plotting its overthrow it also released three lawyers who had 
been detained without charge in a crackdown on proponents of 
multiparty politics 
the us embassy welcomed the release of the three but it 
expressed hopes that other detainees would also soon be released 
we hope the cases of those remaining in custody can be resolved 
rapidly said an embassy spokesman 
kenyan law permits detention without charge or trial of 
individuals the government considers a threat to state security 
those charged were former detainees george anyona and ngotho 
kariuki rural ruling party official augustine kathangu and 
university lecturer edward oyugi 
the government accused them of taking part in a meeting whose 
participants had seditious intentions of overthrowing the kenyan 
government by unlawful means 
anyona a former parliamentarian and an economist and kathangu 
an official of the governing kenya african national union in embu 
were additionally charged with possessing seditious material 
the four had been held without charge since july 12 when they 
were arrested together at a nairobiarea pub 
those released were lawyers gitobu imanyara john khaminwa and 
mohamed ibrahim they could not be immediately reached for comment 
their detentions preceded a rally planned for july 7 in favor of 
a multiparty system police tried to block the rally which led to 
riots in nairobi and four other cities at least 28 people died and 
scores were injured 
human rights lawyer gibson kamau kuria was threatened with 
arrest during the crackdown but was sheltered by the us embassy 
which helped him safely leave kenya 
still in detention are former cabinet ministers charles rubia 
and kenneth matiba and raila odinga a businessman and the son of 
former vice president oginga odinga 
rubia and matiba were picked up by police july 4 and odinga was 
detained july 5 they are leading advocates of multiparty politics 
in kenya which is by law a oneparty state khaminwa represented 
rubia and matiba and was detained when he sought information about 
their whereabouts 
imanyara edited the nairobi law monthly magazine which served 
as a platform for the advocates of political pluralism in this east 
african nation 
ibrahim was a partner in a law firm that has represented 
individuals not in favor with the authorities 
rubia and matiba had been denied a state license to convene the 
planned july 7 rally but a crowd gathered anyway rioting began 
when police armed with wooden clubs and firing tear gas canisters 
dispersed the crowd 
president daniel arap moi and other kenyan leaders argue that 
more than one political party in the country would lead to tribal 
wars among the estimated 40 tribes 
the government gave no reason for the lawyers release however 
clergymen lawyers and foreign governments including the united 
states had severely criticized the detentions 
on thursday the international bar association switched the site 
of its biannual convention in september from nairobi to new york 
city and cited the recent detentions as one reason

finally the uproar over poor little bart simpson has died down 
wonder if it had anything to do with school officials and 
politicians checking the tv listings and noticing the huge number 
of programs which share the airwaves with bart simpson you know 
the ones which glorify violence make virtually any kind of 
promiscuous deviant sex seem normal and acceptable promote use of 
drugs ranging from nicotine and alcohol up to marijuana and 
cocaine and make reckless driving seem like a good idea 
or perhaps it had to do with looking around at hundreds of kinds 
of tshirts which do all the above and more 
all of a sudden bart simpson doesnt seem nearly the threat he 
did to the younger generation 
the bible has some advice for folks who get all worked up over 
little things like bart but miss the bigger problems it mentions 
something about straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel 
it does not we hasten to add caution people about having a cow

greensboro nc news amp record on unlv sanctions 
the basketball players of unlv the university of nevadalas 
vegas have been barred from defending their 1990 national 
championship in next years ncaa tournament because of recruiting 
violations in 1977 when most of them were about 7 
the ncaa sanction writes an end to a painful episode in 
college sports a story that spans a decade of great change and 
vigorous debate one would like to think that the rules violations 
committed by unlv coach jerry tarkanian 13 years ago are less 
likely today but who can be sure 
in fairness to the national collegiate athletic association the 
long delay in this case is largely the fault of tarkanian after 
establishing his rules violations the ncaa tried to suspend him 
from coaching for two years tarkanian sued in federal court to 
block the action and in 1988 won in the us supreme court 
the court ruled that the ncaa contract with member schools 
empowered it to punish the schools but only the schools had power 
to reprimand the coaches they employ it took 11 years to get that 
far 
fairness also means apportioning some blame to unlv which 
should have punished tarkanian should have done so years before 
he got to the supreme court but demurred to that extent the 
university is the cause of its own current troubles 
nevertheless ncaa sanctions this late in the game smack of 
revenge if tarkanian is out of reach then the ncaa will punish 
him by penalizing his players and his school which of course 
stands to lose millions in tournament profits 
were all for high ncaa standards and vigorous enforcement but 
by 1990 the unlv case had become a loser and should have been 
written off to experience

los angeles times on soviet coal miners 
the miners recent 24hour strike in the soviet union prompted 
some startlingly candid reporting about their plight by staterun 
television 
the average soviet coal miner can gloomily anticipate being dead 
at the age of 48 soviet men in less hazardous occupations can 
expect to live to 64 years the retirement age for miners is 55 
only 5 percent of them survive to that age 
it means standing a good chance of dying in a workrelated 
accident each year about 800 miners are killed on the job such 
appallingly high tolls are not of course unknown in american 
history happily they are a thing of the past in 1988 us 
coalmining accidents took 55 lives 
mikhail shchadov minister of the coal mining industry concedes 
that hundreds of miners have died because of something as simple as 
a lack of timber to properly shore up mine shafts this in a 
country rich in forests 
the united states has offered technical help in a number of 
areas to the soviets american miners mining unions and mining 
companies have learned the hard way what can be done to reduce 
hazards underground 
a offer to apply that expertise to improve working conditions in 
soviet mines would be a true humanitarian service

topeka kan capitaljournal on cambodia 
the united states finally came to its senses and abandoned a 
policy on cambodia that in essence supported the murderous khmer 
rouge 
it is difficult to believe that the united states with its 
professed interest in human rights would ever side with the likes 
of the khmer rouge 
their reign of genocidal terror on cambodia was the subject of 
the movie the killing fields the communist khmer rouge are 
held responsible for more than 1 million deaths during their 
threeyear rule that ended when vietnam invaded the country in 1978 
since then the us position has been staunchly antihanoi that 
american policy sided with the coalition that included the khmer 
rouge some of the things the united states has done in the 
interest of diplomacy are nothing to be proud of siding with the 
khmer rouge is one of the more unconscionable ones 
the policy change was prompted by recent intelligence reports 
that the khmer rouge were making military gains in cambodia faced 
with the possibility of their full return to power the united 
states finally did the right thing

the providence ri journalbulletin on cambodia 
two cheers for the bush administrations decision to change 
american policy towards cambodia and the fact that this was 
accomplished in consultation with soviet foreign minister 
shevardnadze suggests that asia might be one place where the united 
states and soviet union have more interests in common than either 
suspects 
we shall see in any case it is refreshing to learn that us 
policy in the region is now concentrated on preventing a recurrence 
of rule by the murderous khmer rouge and not just based on 
hostility to vietnam 
there is no reason why the united states cannot provide aid to 
the cambodian government as well as the two noncommunist 
guerrilla factions in order to prevent the worst possible 
alternative the real challenge for the bush administration will be 
to persuade congress to agree

a strong earthquake sharply jolted the 
city of ahvaz in western iran but caused no loss of life or 
property tehran radio reported wednesday 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said the quake struck 
ahvaz a city of 334000 at 930 pm tuesday and measured 55 on 
the richter scale 
a reading of 5 can cause considerable damage 
last month an earthquake measuring 73 on the richter scale hit 
northern iran leaving 40000 people dead injuring 60000 and 
rendering half a million people homeless 
more than 400 aftershocks have jolted the area since 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65

cumhuriyet istanbul turkey on cambodia 
the first positive result in asia from the ending of the cold 
war has been the us withdrawal of its support of the guerrilla 
coalition in cambodia which also included the khmer rouge and its 
decision to start talks with vietnam aimed at putting an end to the 
crisis 
the reasons the us administration has taken this decision 
include the strong possibility of the khmer rouge the countrys 
most effective guerrilla force coming to power again and the 
increasing reaction in congress against white house support of this 
ruthless horde of murderers 
the tragedy of cambodia is an example of what could befall small 
nations that happen to be located at the crossroads of big power 
interests 
the bush administration even if belately has finally realized 
the danger or has been forced to realize it as a result of 
pressures from within 
the us has committed the greatest crimes against cambodia at 
first the country has been bombed then the legitimate ruler has 
been removed with a coup and the scene has been prepared for the 
khmer rouge to reappear even after their defeat by vietnam the 
horde of murders of khmer rouge has been supported by 
washington 
the people of cambodia have suffered unbelievably since the coup 
detat the united states orchestrated in 1970 maybe this nation 
the sacrificial lamb of great power politics deserves peace more 
than any other

nrc handelsblad rotterdam netherlands on cambodia 
the battlefields on which the cold war has raged are being 
cleared up in europe the first work has been done the americans 
are concentrating on areas where the burden of the past is still 
weighing heavily upon the population 
one of these is cambodia once the side stage of the vietnam 
war then the bloody ideologic laboratory of marxists gone berserk 
now again threatened by the khmer rouge it has taken too long 
but the american government is currently willing to withdraw its 
indirect support of the gang of assassins and to talk with vietnam 
the longdistance protector of the hun senregime about the 
future of cambodia 
if the american swerve will eliminate the khmer rouge as a 
factor on short term is the question initially the swerve will 
especially have diplomatic consequences the coalition of three 
parties in which the khmer rouge has the lead may not count 
anymore on americas recognition 
the swerve in the american policy also offers a wider 
perspective normalization of the relations with hanoi although 
secretary of state james baker wouldnt hear of that yet that 
sort of development does seem to loom on the horizon 
americas rather embarrassing stance in the cambodian civil war 
had everything to do with the trauma of the vietnam war when hanoi 
ended the terror of the khmer rouge in 1978 the world took a 
relieved breath but the washington of successively jimmy carter 
and ronald reagan could only see the validity of the so called 
dominotheory in the vietnamese occupation of cambodia if saigon 
fell into communist hands then all of indochina and subsequently 
all of southeast asia would be lost 
the new american policy in regards to cambodia means less 
subtlety in contact with china the drastic changes in the 
europeanatlantic relations are starting to have an impact as far 
as the far east beijing shall have to take this into account

business times kuala lumpur malaysia on cambodia 
the decision by the us government to open a dialogue with 
vietnam to keep the khmer rouge from returning to power in cambodia 
as well as withdraw its recognition of the un seat held by the 
coalition government of democratic kampuchea cgdk can be the 
harbinger of a fresh ploy to break the deadlock in the 11yearold 
strife 
the main reason however is that washingtons aid to the cgdk 
has been attacked at home and abroad for helping the khmer rouge 
the strongest of the three component groups 
but the question still is will the us move really help 
hasten and complete the peace process 
asean the european community and so many other countries singly 
and collectively have tried over the past decade they succeeded 
only in getting the cambodian horses to the water but none has 
managed to get them to drink 
one reading of the us decision is that it may force the cgdk 
deeper into the arms of china which has reportedly promised to 
double the us assistance amounting to about 13 million a 
year should this be halted 
even if the dialogue leads to greater pressure by vietnam on hun 
sen to make more concessions for the success of the uns efforts 
it is difficult to see the khmer rouge agreeing to be a party to 
any settlement that ensues when it is frozen out of the process 
the us decision is clearly designed more to appease domestic 
opposition to its previous stand of full support for the cgdk 
which also implied backing for the khmer rouge the opening of the 
dialogue with vietnam is only a maneuver to dilute the consequences 
of the aboutturn in policy

the times london on the hostages in lebanon 
the taking of western hostages in lebanon is a game of cat and 
mouse part of the game is the regular perpetration of rumors of 
release the groups which take hostages and political allies who 
hope to profit from this practice have discovered how easy it is 
to manipulate the western media in order to sustain pressure for 
ransom and thus maintain the price 
a widely publicized report on july 7 led to speculation about 
the freeing of brian keenan the irishborn teacher kidnapped by 
islamic extremists more than four years ago there has never been 
any word from the kidnappers themselves 
the truth is that nobody but those controling the lives of the 
captives knows anything about their whereabouts state of health or 
prospects of freedom the only reliable reports about them have 
come from former captives the only way of countering this 
exploitation is for the west to do an uncharacteristic thing to 
ignore any and every rumor unsubstantiated by some reasonably 
reliable source 
the media should adopt a selfdenying ordinance not to report 
rumors gossip and unfounded leaks about hostages because to do so 
makes it the accomplice of the worlds number one enemy

straits times singapore on india 
while india has made impressive advance in science and 
technology over the past 43 years that progress has not been 
translated into the social consciousness without which democracy is 
a vicious mindless fraud perpetrated by every voter on every other 
there is no simple answer not army rule because the army soon 
starts taking after the corrupt politicians it replaces 
not revolution for revolutions succeed only when they can 
return countries to year zero which they cannot 
certainly not a resurrected religious state belonging to a 
mythical golden age of the kind being offered by reactionary 
parties to a confused majority community 
inasmuch as there is an answer it depends on a rebirth of 
nationalism a remembrance of the romantic but genuine national 
inclusiveness that marked independence but which was gradually 
subverted by increasingly powerful vested interests 
the problem with indian politics is not democracy but its 
degeneration 
the solution must then lie in putting meaning back into words 
the spirit into tortured form 
for indians that is no small challenge for others india is no 
small lesson

almost threequarters of all chinese who die are 
buried in graveyards that often occupy valuable farmland a 
newspaper reported wednesday 
despite an official policy favoring cremations about 45 
million of the 65 million chinese who die each year receive 
burials the englishlanguage china daily quoted sources in the 
ministry of civil affairs as saying 
the communist government has long urged the nations estimated 
11 billion people to abandon traditional elaborate funerals and 
burials it says burials are an extravagance for a country with 23 
percent of the worlds population but only 5 percent of its arable 
land 
although most city dwellers are cremated traditional rural 
areas have long resisted the practice in recent years newly 
affluent villagers have sought to honor the dead with large 
banquets buddhist ceremonies and ornate burial sites 
the problem of disposing of the dead even those who are 
cremated has become so severe that one central chinese city the 
scenic lake city of hangzhou has urged its residents to scatter 
the ashes of the dead in a local river

the house today sustained president bushs 
veto of a bill that would require employers to provide up to 12 
weeks off without pay to workers with new babies or family 
emergencies 
the vote was 232195 to override 53 short of the twothirds 
majority required to override 
the action kept president bushs veto record perfect he has 
vetoed 13 bills and congress has not overriden any 
bush vetoed the bill last month after it passed the house with 
bipartisan support and passed the senate on a voice vote 
the president who had voiced support for employee leave for new 
mothers during the 1988 presidential campaign said in his veto 
message that the government should not require employers to offer a 
certain kind of benefit 
supporters had acknowledged beforehand they lacked the votes to 
override the veto but sponsors pointed to polls showing widespread 
support for the concept and democrats hoped to use the issue 
against republicans in the fall election campaigns 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said before the vote that 
similar bills would be before congress in the future he said 
democrats would not try to pass weaker bills in a bid to win bushs 
signature 
were going to have this kind of legislation enacted if not 
this year in this session next year or the year after its 
inevitable foley said 
republicans who supported the bill criticized bushs veto during 
house debate 
rep marge roukema rnj said bush had not opposed bills that 
placed other types of requirements on employers such as are 
contained in cleanair disabilitiesrights and other bills 
its beyond my understanding why the president vetoed this 
said roukema the chief gop sponsor what compelling national 
interest prompted this veto 
wheres our heart said rep arthur ravenel rsc who 
called the bills requirement a minimum benefit and one that small 
businesses werent covered by 
but rep steve bartlett rtexas praised bush for his 
couragous veto he and other opponents charged the bill would 
have imposed a onesizefitsall benefit on all workers and 
employers regardless of whether they might prefer differing 
benefits 
bartlett said the unpaid leave was a yuppie benefit a benefit 
that can only be used by upper income workers while effectively 
denying other potential benefits to workers because of its added 
expense 
the mandate before us is cruel because it denies others a 
benefit that is not on the political agenda of those who sponsor 
this he said 
the bill would have required business and government employers 
to provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid and jobprotected 
medical leave or with leave for the care of a new child or an ill 
child parent or spouse 
businesses with fewer than 50 workers and workers who are among 
the highestpaid 10 percent within a company would have been 
exempted employers would have been required to continue health 
insurance benefits for those on leave and restore returning 
employees to their previous jobs or equivalent positions

ibm has canceled television commercials 
that were supposed to run during the professional golfers 
association championship because the host club has no black 
members a company spokeswoman says 
when we learned that this tournament was being played at a 
club that was exclusionary we decided it was not an appropriate 
vehicle for our advertising the spokeswoman gina chewholman 
said tuesday 
officials of the private club shoal creek said it does not 
have a policy against blacks and some blacks have been guests hall 
thompson the clubs founder said in june the club has jews 
lebanese italians and women among its members but no blacks 
supporting even indirectly activities which are exclusionary 
is against ibms practices and policies chewholman said 
toyota and anheuserbusch also are canceling their tv 
advertising with espn during the event the birmingham postherald 
reported today officials with the corporations and espn were not 
immediately available to comment on the report 
everything was running smoothly for the aug 912 pga 
championship also held at shoal creek in 1984 until thompson 
commented recently that the club would not be pressured into 
accepting black members he later apologized and said he was quoted 
out of context 
thompson has refused to comment since his apology as have other 
club members 
chewholman would not say how much money international business 
machines had planned to spend on television advertising during the 
tournament which will be televised for two days by espn and 
carried by abc for the final two days 
leaders of the southern christian leadership conference and the 
naacp have urged picketing of the tournament 
mayor richard arrington who is black says he hopes black 
leaders decide against demonstrations 
i dont think they will be necessary to bring about the change 
being sought he said 
publicity over shoal creek has started a process of assessment 
which will likely lead to the voluntary end of racial 
discrimination in birmingham area country clubs in a year or so 
arrington said

president bush and top congressional experts 
on defense compared notes today on defense spending but could not 
agree how deeply the pentagon budget should be cut in the year 
ahead 
the meeting came as bush mounts a major effort to hold the line 
on defense budget decreases in the wake of the reduced soviet 
threat in europe and pressures to reduce the overall budget deficit 
rep les aspin dwis the house armed services committee 
chairman has already said he wants to stop producing b2 bombers 
which cost 800 million each the air force now has 15 of the 
socalled stealth aircraft congress previously agreed to build 
75 
aspin said bush and defense secretary dick cheney have in mind 
a much bigger defense budget than i think is going to come out of 
this process 
he said it was impossible to come to grips with the defense 
budget without knowing how much budget summit participants will 
take out of defense 
the process bogs down when we dont even have a defense number 
for one year never mind five years aspin said 
sen sam nunn dga the senate armed services chairman said 
we didnt agree on anything but he said the session was 
probably the best discussion weve had on defense 
nunn favors continued production of the b2 which he said could 
revolutionize warfare and force the soviets to scrap their air 
defense system if the radarevading stealth technology proves 
itself 
bush said last friday at a strategic air command base in 
cheyenne wyo that he could live with the 18 billion the senate 
armed services committee has voted to cut from his 307 billion 
defense request for fiscal 1991 
nunn said we can save some very substantial sums over five 
years and do it prudently trimming 180 billion to 200 billion 
from defense 
but he warned if you do it over one year and you try to take 
onefifth of the total fiveyear savings the first year in defense 
you end up wrecking the personnel system and demoralizing not 
only those who will be forced out of the military but those who 
are left 
rep newt gingrich rga the house minority whip told 
reporters that aspin has the votes to pass a leftwing 
destructive defense budget

a virgin islands resident testified today that 
the fbi pressured him to change his story that he hadnt seen 
marion barry use any drugs on a 1986 boat ride 
defense witness albert benjamin also told the court on 
crossexamination that he became upset when he saw barry make 
advances toward a female companion on the same boat trip 
benjamin a former us army sergeant testified that he felt 
pressured to tell investigators he had seen barry and others use 
drugs 
the officers and agents questioning him kind of kept driving 
home the point that i had to know i had to see drug use 
benjamin said 
i told one mister you pushed your luck a little too 
far benjamin said he told one city police officer who had been 
hovering over him during a questioning session both city police 
and fbi agents participated in the session benjamin said 
but benjamin also said he felt disturbed seeing barry make 
advances on his female companion rasheeda moore in plain view on 
a cabin atop the vessel 
i was angry because i think adults should conduct themselves 
in an appropriate manner in public my wife was sitting there 
benjamin said i really didnt appreciate what i saw i felt 
that was very out of place 
when asked by assistant us attorney richard roberts whether 
barry had been fondling moore benjamin answered yes and she 
accepted it 
moore later became a government witness against barry 
participating in the fbi sting operation that produced barrys jan 
18 arrest moore has testified that she and the mayor used drugs 
over 100 times 
barrys attorneys called benjamin in an attempt to dispute the 
testimony of another government witness that the benjamins could 
have seen barry use drugs during the trip 
benjamin said he saw no drug use but he testified that he did 
see barry smoke a cigarette 
government witness charles lewis who was on the trip has 
testified that he and barry smoked marijuana on the boat 
benjamin said he was unfamiliar with the smell of marijuana 
on tuesday barrys chauffeur says he doesnt recall any 
specific dates and details in 12 years of driving the mayor around 
except that he didnt take him to an alleged drug pickup site on 
sept 7 1988 
testifying for the defense in barrys drug and perjury trial 
walter bracey said he vividly recalled driving barry to the grand 
opening of a supermarket that morning and then taking the mayor 
directly to a meeting with city fire department officials 
a government witness lydia reid pearson has testified that she 
handed barry cocaine and a city job application at a municipal 
building shortly after 10 am that day 
bracey testified that he drove barry to the supermarket opening 
at about 940 am stayed there with the mayor for 45 minutes and 
then took him to the fire department meeting 
barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession one misdemeanor charge of conspiracy and three felony 
counts of lying to a grand jury about his drug use

budget negotiators are looking at a new 1995 
target for balancing the budget but coming up with a plan is 
difficult because nobody wants to raise taxes house majority 
leader richard gephardt said today 
gephardt dmo told reporters at the white house that only 
incremental progress is being made in meetings with president 
bush 
however he said negotiators generally had agreed to a framework 
under which 50 billion would be slashed from the deficit in the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 and a total of 500 billion over 
the next five years 
the grammrudman deficitcontrol law which now calls for a 
balanced budget in 1993 would be eased to give two additional 
years to reach that goal gephardt said 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the administration and congressional democrats had agreed to 
present packages later this week that will contain specifics 
the proposals will be presented simultaneously at budget 
meetings either thursday or friday fitzwater said that would 
resolve a controversy over which side would go first 
the proposals will be the first specific plans proposed in the 
11 weeks of bargaining 
speaking with reporters after the second oval office session 
this week on the budget gephardt said there has yet to be a single 
hard decision made in 11 weeks of budgetsummit talks 
however he also said various packages will be presented later 
this week that will lay out specific options 
suggesting it now seems dubious that accord can be reached 
before congress begins its august recess gephardt said if we 
spend a lot of time worrying about when well get it done we wont 
get it done 
todays white house session focused on cutting programs for the 
poor and elderly he said 
both sides are troubled by the magnitude of cuts being 
discussed in these areas he said and even though president bush 
has lifted his pledge of no new taxes when it comes down to 
specifics on the revenue side nobody wants to raise taxes he 
said 
consequently its very hard to put a final package 
together he said 
gephardt who is leader of the budget negotiators when bush is 
not present mildly chided the president for appearing to break his 
pledge to tone down partisan rhetoric 
after agreeing to mute his political attacks against 
congressional democrats on tuesday morning bush went on to lash 
out at them in speeches in philadelphia and new york city 
gephardt said bush explained they had been prescheduled 
speeches and that the president had tried to separate his 
political attacks from the budget talks all of us give political 
speeches gephardt said but we have to decide if we want to 
make political points or solve this budget problem 
gephardt said if a deal cant be struck on the budget by the 
monthlong august recess negotiators may have to remain in 
washington to continue working on one 
negotiators say they are not likely to decide precisely what the 
new taxes and spending slashes will be until september or later 
only then will the house and senate have a chance to vote on the 
measure that emerges 
the problem with putting together a detailed package now is 
that its left out there dangling during the recess said sen 
james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee 
the members when they go home are subject to pressures from 
various groups and could end up agreeing to oppose the measure 
he said 
some republicans have offered to ignore the recess and keep 
working until a package is shaped said rep bill archer rtexas 
but he agreed that what is most likely by the august break is the 
broad outlines of a package 
officials involved in the talks say white house budget chief 
richard darman remains hopeful that a detailed package can be 
completed and perhaps even enacted by early august 
at the summit talks now in their 11th week bargainers failed 
tuesday to agree to the precise amount of deficitcutting they 
would seek 
but sasser confirmed that the general consensus of the 
negotiators remained a package of about 50 billion in savings for 
next year divided about evenly between tax increases and spending 
cuts the bargainers have informally been using those numbers for 
several weeks now 
bush complained at a gop dinner in new york of the long 
democratic dominance that he said has caused government by 
gridlock with spending skyrocketing out of control good 
legislation thrown aside for pork and a budget deficit looming over 
our childrens children 
he ended on a slightly kinder note taking note of his daily 
meetings with congressional leaders 
we all know that the democrats have a long track record on 
spending he said but if the berlin wall could come down in 
the same year that america goes nuts over the teenage mutant ninja 
turtles who knows what could happen next the leaders of 
congress can work with me to break the impasse on reducing the 
budget deficit and i think they are trying

soviet citizens with foreign currency they have 
been unable to use without explaining where it came from will be 
able to spend it freely at special shops and deposit it in banks 
starting aug 1 
the change in rules was announced tuesday by deputy prime 
minister stepan sitarian head of the governments foreign economic 
commission the tass news agency said 
as well as easing banking problems for soviets with legal access 
to foreign currency the change will allow taxi drivers 
prostitutes black marketeers and others with illegally obtained 
cash to open foreign currency bank accounts and spend the money at 
special shops currently used by foreigners 
it also will pump muchneeded hard currency such as us 
dollars into the soviet economy hard currency refers to money 
that is convertible on the world market the soviet currency the 
ruble is not convertible 
sitarian said individual soviets have 324 million in foreign 
currency they had acquired legally however they have been unable 
to spend the money in the soviet union except at special shops for 
foreigners known as beriozkas that have only a limited amount of 
goods 
in accordance with the resolution a network of trade houses 
and firmowned stores will be set up in the soviet union where 
soviet enterprises and organizations as well as citizens owning 
currency will be able to buy imported and highquality domestic 
goods tass said it did not say when the new stores would open 
under the current law a limited number of soviets such as 
those who have worked abroad or who work for foreign firms may 
have foreign currency bank accounts when they open the account or 
when they spend their money in the special shops for foreigners 
they must explain to the government how they obtained the funds 
this will no longer be required tass said this will enable 
many soviet citizens owning foreign currency to legalize it and use 
it on soviet territory it said 
almost all soviets are now barred from possessing foreign 
currency but many flout the law dozens of soviet shoppers are 
seen every weekend at jointventure shops paying foreign currency 
for imported food and goods 
tass quoted sitarian as saying the soviet government is aware 
of the weak sides of introducing the retail trade for currency on 
soviet territory this can evoke protests and discontent on the 
part of some layers of the soviet population 
but he said still we found it necessary to take the step and 
enable state enterprises cooperatives collective farms and 
individuals owning currency to spend it in the soviet union 
he said the currency deposits will provide a considerable sum of 
foreign currency reserves for the soviet state which the soviet 
union can use for its own purposes 
the new system of stores and legalization of foreign currency 
accounts will give the state considerable income while curtailing 
foreign currency exports sitarian was quoted as saying 
as an incentive to prospective depositers sitarian said the 
issue of interest on foreign currency accounts will be reviewed 
under the present rules foreign cash accounts do not generate 
interest

a 3yearold texas girl was awake and alert 
wednesday one day after receiving a liver and small intestine in a 
rare transplant operation 
tracey kay gonzales of corpus christi remained in critical 
condition in the intensive care unit at childrens hospital here 
said spokeswoman sue cardillo 
the toddler was being weaned off a respirator that assists her 
breathing said ms cardillo the child received the organs in a 
14hour operation that ended tuesday morning 
doctors continue to be optimistic about traceys recovery 
ms cardillo said at this point things are going as well as can 
be expected 
the first 72 hours after the operation are the most critical 
and it will be at least a week before doctors will be able to 
predict how she will fare ms cardillo said 
small intestine transplants have a poor success rate since 
1983 one adult and three children have died within a year of their 
surgeries at pittsburgh hospitals one adult patient is still alive 
no patients who have received small intestine transplants 
elsewhere have lived 
tracey needed the operation because she suffered from short gut 
syndrome which left her small intestine unable to absorb 
nutrition her liver was damaged by a highprotein liquid she was 
fed intravenously since birth

tens of thousands of people mobbed hong kongs 
immigration department today the last day to apply for permission 
to move to britain and escape communist rule when the british 
colony reverts to china in 1997 
laborers doctors clerks housewives and teachers squeezed into 
a line that snaked more than half a mile over pedestrian walkways 
and along two main avenues in downtown hong kong at least 50 
people had spent the night and several children fainted in the 
hot humid weather 
immigration officials said that at least 45000 people had 
waited in line 
by the time police closed the gates shortly after midnight 
about 18000 heads of households had applied for the nationality 
package this was in addition to an estimated 26000 who submitted 
applications in previous days 
if we dont apply well lose out and become poor like all 
communists said john lam a 41yearold office manager in a 
trading house who had been waiting for six hours 
im doing this for my son he said pointing to a baby 
sleeping in a pink stroller

immigration officials about 35 million of hong kongs 57 million 
people are eligible for consideration under the package

australia and canada because they fear a loss of rights and 
opportunities when hong kong comes under chinese rule in 1997 
mothers waiting in line today carried children strapped to their 
chests old ladies leaned on walkers and businessmen spoke into 
portable phones cutting deals as they awaited their turn 
cb chan assistant director of immigration said the 
department would stay open until midnight to accommodate the crowd 
most of those eligible for the plan dont have to formally apply 
because they already can prove they are british subjects either by 
possessing a britishhong kong passport or a hong kong birth 
certificate 
thus thousands needlessly lined up today and the immigration 
department issued pleas to people with the necessary documents to 
go home the confusion was another example that many hong kong 
residents are becoming increasingly desperate about their future 
as part of a 1984 agreement china promised to maintain hong 
kongs freewheeling economic and social system under a program it 
calls one country two systems but after the june 1989 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in beijing many in the 
territory lost faith in chinas promise 
hong kong people also question british assurances of its support 
up until 1997 when britains 99year lease on the colony runs out 
in a sign interpreted by many as kowtowing to china the 
colonial government is prosecuting five prodemocracy activists for 
breaking an obscure law banning the use of bullhorns 
the government censored a film critical of beijing and banned 
from its waters a radio ship that was intended to broadcast 
prodemocracy messages to china 
a recent letter sent by a top official william ehrman to 
chinese authorities reaffirmed britains policy of forbidding hong 
kong from becoming a base for subversive activities local 
media have said 
a sudden job switch by britains foreign minister with special 
responsibility for hong kong francis maude also has caused 
concern maude has been appointed financial secretary to the 
treasury 
this is a crucial stage of negotiations said martin lee a 
member of the hong kongs legislative council and a leading 
political activist i hope the person replacing him will take 
hong kong matters to heart 
many of the people in line today said they had little hope of 
leaving 
its just a shot in the dark said leung lingyeung a 
33yearold teacher who took the day off from school with her 
8yearold daughter my english is not too good so i dont have 
much hope but all of us will do anything to escape communism 
to gain consideration under the british nationality package 
applicants have to first become permanent residents of hong kong 
that is achieved either by birth marriage or by living and working 
in the territory for a certain number of years 
once they become permanent residents they can apply for the 
right to live in britain the british government has issued 
guidelines which says it is looking for professionals in about 20 
occupations such as doctors and engineers fluency in english 
rare among hong kong chinese is considered important

president mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday 
threatened to use military force against armed outlaw groups unless 
they disband and surrender their weapons in 15 days the tass news 
agency reported 
the ultimatum was gorbachevs latest effort to crack down on 
increasing ethnic violence that has killed hundreds of people in 
the republics of armenia azerbaijan and in soviet central asia 
it also was a tacit admission that soviet interior ministry 
troops have been unable to stop militants from organizing at 
times with what tass called the connivance of local authorities 
and obtaining caches of guns ammunition bombs and military 
hardware 
the decree also comes at a time when gorbachev is trying to 
negotiate a treaty with all 15 soviet republics to transfer some of 
the powers from the central government to local authorities who 
want more autonomy from moscow 
the official news agency did not specify which regions 
gorbachevs decree referred to but it followed a week of detailed 
reports in the staterun press of rampages by terrorists in the 
southern republic of armenia 
on friday an interior ministry spokesman told tass that armed 
groups in armenia attacked at least eight government interior 
ministry or police offices in recent days in unsuccessful attempts 
to seize weapons the attackers used explosives in at least two of 
the incidents tass said 
the unofficial interfax news agency also reported at least two 
suspicious explosions last week one aboard a train that killed 
five people and another that damaged a water pipeline to 
nagornokarabakh a region disputed by armenians and azerbaijanis 
riots and attacks against kgb government and party buildings 
have become part of a recurring pattern of antisoviet violence in 
various parts of the southern soviet union in the past year some 
attacks are aimed clearly at taking arms from police and kgb 
stocks and others have been intended to force political change 
in one of the biggest such attacks armenians bombarded the 
local kgb headquarters in the republics capital of yerevan on 
april 14 with stones torches and flareguns tass reported one 
attacker was reported killed 
on may 4 about 200 armed men who called themselves the armenian 
national army surrounded a communist party building in yerevan for 
several hours and presented a list of political demands including 
the withdrawal of all soviet troops from armenia before dispersing 
at least 200 people have died in two years of ethnic fighting 
between armenians and residents of the neighboring republic of 
azerbaijan mostly over control of nagornokarabakh a 
predominantly armenian enclave inside azerbaijan 
in the central asian republic of kirghizia where another 212 
people died in violence since june 4 between ethnic kirghiz and 
uzbeks tass also reported last week that 26 firearms had been 
confiscated by police and 180 people were detained among the 
weapons seized was a grenade tass said 
gorbachevs decree authorized local police officials of the 
republics the interior ministry and the kgb to take action to 
ensure that all weapons were confiscated from the outlaw groups 
within 15 days 
if the armed groups do not comply with the order the soviet 
interior ministry has the right to use interior troops and units 
of the soviet defense ministry may become involved in some 
operations tass said 
interior ministry and army troops have been sent to the caucasus 
and central asia in the past but only after violence has broken 
out some of these troops remain on patrol especially along the 
border between azerbaijan and armenia and in western kirghizia 
tass said gorbachevs decree was aimed at outlaw groups that 
threaten peoples lives seize arms assault soldiers and police 
and attack military and civilian facilities 
they are connected with the commission of other grave crimes 
and lead to casualties among innocent people the agency said 
criminals draft dodgers and deserters from the armed forces are 
often drawn into these groups

the government said today that it will not 
be intimidated by us pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring 
kuwait and president saddam hussein summoned the us ambassador 
for talks 
although iraq reportedly has massed troops along the kuwaiti 
border there were several signs today that baghdad was prepared to 
resolve the dispute 
diplomatic sources in kuwait said that saddam has given 
assurances he will not use military force if kuwait agrees to pay 
compensation for 24 billion worth of oil iraq claims it has 
stolen since 1980 
later in the day president hosni mubarak of egypt said that 
iraq and kuwait have agreed to hold direct talks on saturday or 
sunday in jiddah saudi arabia to try to solve their dispute 
peacefuly 
mubarak who has actively tried to mediate the dispute also 
told reporters in cairo that saddam had agreed to stop his verbal 
attacks on kuwait 
in a show of support for kuwait the pentagon announced tuesday 
that us warships and aircraft would hold a shortnotice 
exercise 600 miles to the south in the persian gulf with a second 
small state the united arab emirates 
saddam moved troops to the kuwaiti border after accusing kuwait 
and the uae of exceeding their opec production quotas and 
driving down oil prices he threatened to use military force if 
they did not adhere to opec guidelines 
at the same time he accused kuwait of stealing oil from the 
rumaila field which is along the border and includes land both 
countries claim 
the iraqi newspaper aljumhuriya said today the kuwaiti foreign 
minister sabah alahmed alsabah must know and his american 
masters in the white house know that iraq will not succumb and will 
not let anyone encroach upon its rights 
in apparent reference to the heightened us military 
preparedness in the region the paper accused kuwait of 
implementing an americanzionist plot to show that america is 
playing the role of protector in the gulf 
the paper said kuwait should be aware that those who are 
threatening the interests of the arab nation and conspire against 
it will not be protected by foreigners 
official iraqi radio said that saddam summoned us ambassador 
april glaspie for talks today the report gave no details on what 
was discussed 
president hosni mubarak of egypt met with kuwaiti and iraqi 
leaders on tuesday arab diplomats said saddam told mubarak he 
would not use force if kuwait met iraqi conditions on paying 
compensation 
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said saddam 
also stressed that the dispute could only be solved through direct 
talks with kuwait not through egypts mediation 
kuwaiti crown prince and prime minister sheik saad alabdullah 
alsabah said today kuwait was and remains with strong 
sincerity and enthusiasm willing to meet with our brethren in iraq 
to reach an understanding in a brotherly atmosphere on an 
acceptable formula in the interest of both parties 
the disputed oil field extends two miles into kuwait but iraq 
claims it owns the entire field kuwait wants an arab league 
committee to demarcate its borders and says iraq has rejected the 
request 
saddam has spent an estimated 50 billion on sophisticated arms 
since coming to power in 1979 and appears to be trying to frighten 
kuwait and the uae into ending oil overproduction 
iraq has the worlds secondlargest oil reserves but endured a 
costly war from 198088 with iran and has a foreign debt of about 
70 billion saddam claims his country lost 14 billion during the 
past year because of a world oil glut that has sent prices tumbling 
informed sources in kuwait said the iraqi troop buildup had 
increased over the last 48 hours to at least 30000 and that more 
than 200 sovietmade tanks were posted along iraqs 100milelong 
southern border with kuwait 
the sources said kuwait on tuesday reinstated a state of alert 
it had declared july 16 
iraq has 17 million residents including 1 million troops 
kuwait has 18 million residents and 20300 members of the armed 
forces 
pete williams a defense department spokesman told reporters 
that the joint usemirates exercise codenamed ivory justice 
began monday 
in abu dhabi a spokesman for the united arab emirates foreign 
ministry said that the emirates holds routine military exercises 
this time of year 
what the american official spokesman referred to is no more 
than part of a technical training program agreed upon previously 
and does not have any link with the latest developments in the 
region the spokesman said in a statement reported by the 
official wam news agency 
the state department announced at the beginning of the crisis 
that it backs kuwaits territorial integrity 
but williams would not comment when asked if the united states 
would come to kuwaits aid militarily if it were attacked by iraq

why does the endangered houston toad cross 
the road 
for making whoopee 
the 2 to 3inch toads have been making the risky trip across 
texas 21 for years and many have been flattened en route 
the state highway department said wednesday it has a plan to get 
the toads to cross under the fourlane highway not over it 
for humans the proposal is part of a roadway safety project 
for toads its safer sex 
on a 5mile stretch of route 21 just east of austin state 
highway officials want to either build a series of tunnels or 
modify four drainage lines for the amphibians which cross back and 
forth across the road looking for rainswollen ponds where they 
breed 
the toad was designated a federally endangered species in 1965 
several thousand of them live in bastrop county officials have 
estimated 
the toad proposals will be reviewed by the us fish and 
wildlife department which is responsible for protecting endangered 
species 
the underground toad trail is part of safety improvements where 
there have been numerous instances of vehicles running into 
loblolly pines that line the scenic road 
the highway department originally proposed cutting down about 
1000 of the trees but after residents protested officials decided 
to line the stretch with guardrails and build paved shoulders 
the state probably will choose to modify existing drainage lines 
for the toads said randall dillard a highway department 
spokesman that would cost about 51250 as opposed to 628000 for 
fancy polymer concrete tunnels designed by a british firm 
i dont know if a toad really knows the difference between a 
tunnel thats built for him or a modified drainage ditch dillard 
said

many hospitals should routinely offer aids tests 
to all patients especially in poor city neighborhoods because so 
many people are unknowingly infected with the aids virus a 
government study recommends 
the chief author of the report said aids screening should become 
as common a part of hospital care as testing for heart disease and 
glaucoma 
there is a large number of infected persons who are unaware of 
their status said dr michael e st louis hospitals may be 
an efficient place where they could potentially get plugged into an 
appropriate program of treatment or counseling 
his report based on a major study by the us centers for 
disease control found that aids infections are extremely common in 
some poor city areas where one in five young and middleage men 
carry the virus but unsuspected aids infections occur virtually 
everywhere in the united states 
by failing to spot these infections the study said hospitals 
are missing an important opportunity to provide early care to 
people who are likely to develop grave illnesses while there is no 
cure for aids treatment early in the infection can delay the start 
of aidsrelated health problems 
st louis said that while ideally most hospitals would offer 
routine aids testing the screening should be done only if they are 
prepared to keep the results confidential and to offer followup 
counseling and care to people who turn out to be infected 
we are not saying that every hospital should be doing this 
he said but on the basis of our findings many may need to 
consider it 
while the cdc has not changed its estimate that 1 million 
americans are infected with the aids virus the latest study found 
a 70fold difference in the infection rate across the united states 
in most places the virus is still rare in several midwest and 
western states well under 1 percent of patients screened carried 
the virus by contrast at two hospitals in new york city and 
newark nj more than 5 percent of all patients were infected 
the numbers were especially high considering that the 
researchers did not test anyone who went to the hospital with any 
condition that might result from the aids virus or suggest a 
higherthanusual risk of catching it these included all people 
with cancer infections hemophilia psychiatric problems and 
gunshot wounds 
our findings yield no support for the premise that the aids 
epidemic will soon abate even in the areas that were the earliest 
infected such as the new york metropolitan area the doctors 
wrote 
their study published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine was based on aids tests anonymously performed on 89547 
people their blood was drawn for other purposes at 26 hospitals 
during the past two years 
among the findings 
the overall aids infection rate ranged from less than onetenth 
of 1 percent to nearly 8 percent depending on the hospitals 
location the testing turned up at least one unsuspected infection 
in every hospital 
men were seven times more likely than women to carry the virus 
and blacks were almost twice as likely as whites to be infected 
at the two new york area hospitals with the highest infections 
the virus was most common among men between ages 25 to 44 about 20 
percent of them were infected 
at the eight hospitals with the lowest infection rates none of 
the 5002 women tested between ages 25 and 44 carried the virus 
dr deborah j cotton clinical director for aids at beth israel 
hospital in boston cautioned that keeping test results 
confidential can be a serious problem and often no counseling 
programs exist to advise people who find they are infected 
it would be wrong to offer the test if there is no place to 
refer patients to if they turn out to be positive she said 
st louis said the cdc is revising its formal guidelines on 
hospital screening to recommend more aggressive testing for the 
aids virus

gov buddy roemer today vetoed a 
controversial bill that would have required warning labels on 
recordings that deal with potentially offensive topics such as drug 
abuse sex and violence 
roemer said threatened economic boycotts against the state 
didnt sway him he vetoed the bill he said because it was an 
infringement on constitutionally protected free speech 
he said he hoped a voluntary labeling program being implemented 
by the recording industry would be successful and warned that the 
issue will return in louisiana and other states if the industrys 
plan does not satisfy lawmakers 
this issue will not go away he said as a parent i 
wanted to sign the bill 
tipper gore president of the parents music resource center 
appeared with roemer at a news conference her group was one of the 
first advocates of a voluntary labeling system 
we all recognize the concern to protect children from violent 
and explicit messages but we dont want government to legislate 
that concern said mrs gore wife of sen albert gore dtenn 
although the bill passed both chambers with more than the 
twothirds vote needed to override a veto the legislature is in 
recess and members would have to come back into session to 
override no veto has been overridden this century 
the bill the first of its kind in the nation would have 
required warning labels on recordings that promote deviant sex 
violence drug abuse suicide or child abuse it also would have 
prohibited sale of such recordings to people under 17 
under the bill retailers manufacturers and distributors would 
have been subject to jail terms and fines of up to 5000 for 
violations 
the aim was to protect children but the bill didnt address the 
issue of having the same songs played on radio or television 
passage of the bill brought loud protests from the music 
industry with threats of canceled performances and bans against 
groups touring in the state the neville brothers favorite sons in 
louisiana called the bill racist among performers who wrote the 
governor were patti labelle tony bennett ray charles dick clark 
dr john elton john and judas priest 
the national academy of recording arts and sciences had 
threatened to end consideration of new orleans as a site for the 
grammy hall of fame if the bill had become law music industry 
organizations threatened to cancel planned conventions in the city 
radio stations had label day marathons to play nothing but 
records that disc jockeys thought would fall under the ban among 
them were such classics as stagger lee house of the rising 
sun love for sale and mack the knife 
in may the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling 
system that it hoped would halt state campaigns for mandatory 
labeling industry spokesmen said every legislature except 
louisianas pulled back labeling bills while the voluntary program 
was tested 
the legislation would not have taken effect until 1992 haik had 
said that if the recording industry implemented its voluntary 
program he would push for repeal of the law

a male australian wallaby escaped from a 
zoo leaving behind three females and has led officials on a 
10mile chase at speeds up to 30 mph 
animal keepers didnt bother to continue the chase wednesday 
susan stevens a spokeswoman for the metroparks zoos said rainy 
weather in the boston area meant the 30pound marsupial named 
aardu probably would seek shelter 
hes not likely to be visible in the rain since he wont be 
moving around much stevens said 
aardu a hardy vegetarian with a knack for survival was 
probably in no danger stevens said 
the chase began monday when aardu was reported missing from the 
stone zoo in stoneham he was spotted in a nearby forest but 
bounded off when wouldbe captors approached 
stevens estimated that the wallaby had traveled 10 miles since 
his escape reaching speeds up to 30 mph 
she said aardu apparently leaped to freedom from his cage which 
is bounded by a moat and a high wall with a railing he shared the 
enclosure with three female wallabies and zoo keepers had hoped he 
would eventually father wallaby offspring 
he can jump about 6 feet straight up but we didnt think it 
was likely hed get out of his cage stevens said 
until hes caught aardu shouldnt have much trouble surviving 
in the new england woods stevens said 
the good news is that hes a hardy animal stevens said 
he can adapt well to colder climates and since hes a 
vegetarian he has plenty of food and water he could live out 
there indefinitely 
the question was whether human search teams could do the same 
stevens was one of about 25 searchers who slogged through thick 
brush in the rain tuesday 
we sat there soaking wet and tired and we realized hes 
smarter than we are she said

the pentagon must overhaul its management 
system congressional investigators said wednesday likening the 
defense departments financial situation to the savings and loan 
crisis and other financial disasters that have required federal 
bailouts 
the general accounting office said the pentagon is planning to 
build weapons the nation cant afford operates an inventory system 
with billions of dollars in excess parts and bases decisions on 
incomplete information 
the lack of accurate financial data for decision makers was a 
critical problem in the new york city chrysler corp and savings 
and loan crises charles bowsher the nations comptroller 
general and head of the gao told the house armed services 
committee 
a similar lack of financial data exists in the defense 
department today bowsher said 
the federal government bailed out new york city in the mid1970s 
and the chrysler corp in 1980 ways of handling the 100 billion 
savings and loan scandal are still being addressed 
rep les aspin dwis armed services chairman asked bowsher 
how far he would go in comparing defense department management to 
the nations wellknown financial disasters 
in this case you wont have the formal government bailout 
because you would have bailed out on an annual basis bowsher 
said referring to the nearly 300 billion defense budget congress 
approves each year 
he added any time you push too much money into the system 
people are going to spend it its surprising in the air force 
that the accounting was as bad as new york city its really bad 
specifically gao the investigative arm of congress said the 
proposed military budget for fiscal 1990 to fiscal 1994 totals 15 
trillion but the pentagons planned spending for individual 
programs exceeds that amount by 100 billion 
the departments fiveyear spending plan needs to reflect 
fiscal reality and recent world events bowsher said 
the gao also said the defense department has wasted tens of 
billions of dollars on weapons systems because they were not fully 
tested before they were purchases gao cited the b1b bomber as an 
example and warned that the ssn21 seawolf attack submarine was 
following the same path 
the gao also noted that as of sept 30 1989 the inventory of 
spare parts exceeded 109 billion of which 34 billion has been 
identified by the pentagon as more than necessary for current 
requirements 
among its recommendations the gao said that in light of the 
diminishing soviet threat the defense department should fully test 
weapons before buying them the agency stopped short of calling for 
slowing down various weapons systems noting that would increase 
their cost but said the department should review certain weapons 
the defense department needs to decide which of the planned 
programs it can afford bowsher said over optimistic planning 
tends to obscure defense priorities and delay tough decisions and 
tradeoffs

someone equipped with ouija boards wooden crosses 
and a sense of humor played a practical joke on a team of 
investigators trying to determine the cause of mysterious circles 
that appear suddenly in farm fields 
the team of engineers and photographers thought they had cracked 
the mystery when sophisticated cameras and monitoring equipment 
recorded flashing orange lights tuesday night in a field they are 
watching in wiltshire 
when the international team found two large circles with 
parallel lines running through them on wednesday morning they were 
really intrigued 
but upon closer examination they realized they had been had 
ouija boards and wooden crosses were found in the center of the 
circles and the operation blackbird researchers were not amused 
somebody had a joke but it has actually set our research 
back said colin andrews a team member and the author of 
circular findings 
we have a serious job to do it is only funny for 60 
seconds he said adding that the recording of flashing lights 
were probably thermal images of people running around in circles 
the investigators from the united states japan west germany 
and britain had planned to spend three weeks monitoring the field 
in the vale of pewsey in the town of wiltshire 75 miles southwest 
of london it was not immediately clear if the practical joke would 
cause them to change their plan 
they are trying to determine the source of the mysterious 
circles which have appeared suddenly among crops in england and 
elsewhere in europe 
the perfectly formed circles of flattened corn some with 
decorative patterns some with concentric rings were first 
recorded in england in 1678 
in other countries the circles have been reported in sand snow 
and rice paddies the circles have been variously attributed to 
whirlwinds witches magnetic forces animals spaceships and 
hoaxers 
last year 300 circles appeared and as many theories as to why 
the most recent theory published in the new scientist magazine 
suggested they were formed by weather conditions and electrical 
charges in the area

the coast guard today dismissed 
charges of intoxication and misconduct against former exxon valdez 
capt joseph hazelwood and the skipper pleaded no contest to two 
lesser charges 
the plea agreement was revealed at the opening of a coast guard 
hearing to determine whether hazelwood can keep his captains 
license the hearing continued before an administrative judge who 
will decide any sanctions 
administrative law judge harry gardner could dismiss the 
charges revoke hazelwoods license or place him on probation but 
no fine or prison term can be levied 
hazelwoods attorney michael chalos told the judge that 
hazelwood agreed to accept a 12month suspension of his license but 
wants to be given credit for three months because the coast guard 
has held his license for a year 
this man has suffered enough chalos told the judge hes 
a ships captain he wants to back to the sea and he wants to go 
back as soon as possible 
the coast guard dismissed a charge that hazelwood was drunk by 
coast guard standards while he commanded the 987foot tanker the 
tanker hit a charted reef in alaskas prince william sound causing 
the nations worst oil spill 
it also dismissed a charge that hazelwood was negligent in 
leaving a third mate who was not properly licensed in charge of the 
exxon valdez as it passed through the valdez narrows into prince 
william sound 
the coast guards action in dismissing the most serious charge 
related to alcohol was spurred by a recent defense discovery that 
hazelwoods blood sample was mishandled and the test results may 
have been wrong 
we now know that the alcohol test was invalid at best and 
bogus at worst chalos said at the hearing this man should 
never have been put through this ordeal 
hazelwood entered no contest pleas to charges that he was 
negligent in leaving the bridge of the tanker and that he consumed 
alcohol within four hours of sailing the coast guard changed the 
language of one charge removing the allegation that hazelwoods 
behavior contributed to the tankers grounding 
hazelwood stood and faced the judge as he answered the remaining 
charges against him in a firm voice saying no contest 
the alcohol charge that was dropped contended that hazelwood had 
a blood alcohol level exceeding 04 the coast guard standard for 
intoxication far lower than the alaska state standard of 10 
hazelwood was acquitted by a superior court jury in alaska of 
being drunk and reckless after extensive testimony about blood 
alcohol tests administered to him 10 hours after the disaster 
there was controversy over the accuracy of the tests because of the 
long delay 
the tests showed hazelwood had a blood alcohol reading of 06 
according to testimony 
hazelwood came to the coast guard headquarters with two lawyers 
and four witnesses who had testified for him in his trial four 
months ago in alaska the witnesses were expected to testify during 
the hearing 
two of them are captains of ships who are expected to say that 
hazelwoods departure from the bridge during an icy crossing was 
nothing unusual 
another witness the tankers radio engineer was expected to 
recount the afternoon he spent with hazelwood in the port city of 
valdez where hazelwood was alleged to have drunk two or three 
vodkas before boarding his ship 
the defense contends that the charge hazelwood drank four hours 
before boarding is mitigated by the fact that the ships sailing 
time had been moved up one hour earlier than scheduled 
the plea agreement was apparently the result of months of 
negotiations between the coast guard and hazelwoods lawyers 
chalos and thomas russo the lawyers said earlier they hoped 
hazelwood would be vindicated at the hearing and be able to resume 
his career as a captain 
his masters license was issued in 1966 and has been in the 
possession of the coast guard since the exxon valdez accident 
the exxon valdez was en route from the alaskan port of valdez to 
long beach on march 24 1989 when it struck the reef gashed by 
jagged rocks the tanker spilled 11 million gallons of alaska crude 
oil into prince william sound 
hazelwood was acquitted at his trial in alaska of being drunk 
and reckless but was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of 
negligent discharge of oil he was ordered to pay 50000 
restitution and spend 1000 hours cleaning beaches at prince 
william sound he is appealing 
the 11th coast guard district which includes alaska is 
headquartered in long beach

senators with jurisdiction over the energy 
departments national laboratories said wednesday the government 
should keep the facilities open despite a decline in their 
bombmaking mission 
failing to support the laboratories as they make the transition 
to more civilian uses would be the biggest mistake in economic 
history said sen pete v domenici rnm at a senate 
subcommittee hearing on the future of the national laboratories 
new mexico is the home of the los alamos national laboratory and 
the sandia national laboratories two of three nuclear weapons 
research centers in the complex of nine department laboratories 
the other center is the lawrence livermore national laboratory in 
california 
the department spends 5 billion a year on developing and 
testing nuclear weapons stockpiles 
witnesses including energy secretary james d watkins told the 
energy research and development subcommittee the laboratories can 
benefit private industry math and science education and waste 
management 
energy department laboratories employ more than 16000 
researchers with advanced degrees in science and technology 
including more than 8500 with doctorates fifteen nobel prizes 
have been awarded for work performed at the laboratories he said 
more than 50 prizes have been awarded for work related to that 
performed at the national laboratories he said 
no single laboratory or group of laboratories anywhere in the 
country can compare with this resource or match its record of 
accomplishment watkins said this country cannot afford to 
fritter away such a precious national asset 
in the last week he said the department has signed two 
agreements with industry consortiums specialty metals and 
advanced manufacturing to provide them with technology developed 
in energy department defense programs 
watkins had no trouble converting the panelists including sens 
wendell h ford dky chairman of the subcommittee and j 
bennett johnston dla chairman of the full committee on energy 
and natural resources 
it is essential that we continue to use these laboratories to 
their fullest potential said johnston

the fourth announced us nuclear weapons 
test of the year was detonated wednesday deep beneath the surface 
of the nevada test site

advance was uneventful and was an apparent success 
we had no problems with it doe spokesman jim boyer said

kilotons and boyer said it was in the smaller range of the 
underground detonations at the nations nuclear proving grounds 
the warhead was detonated at 8 am 1300 feet beneath the 
surface of ranier mesa the site was about 90 miles northwest of 
las vegas 
the test was the 703rd conducted at the site since weapons 
testing began there in 1951 and was the 498th test since the

south carolinas statehouse which still 
bears the scars of shermans cannons is being shaken anew by a 
threering scandal that involves allegations of vote buying 
drunken driving and construction payoffs 
this has rocked the entire statehouse state rep david 
beasley said of the scandals he said he worried that the 
investigations would have longterm damaging effects on 
politics in the state 
gov carroll campbell a republican heavily favored for 
reelection this year also has said he worries about his states 
image 
we cant have south carolina across the nation looking like 
the way were being painted the governor said 
the allegations have called into question the states relatively 
lax laws regulating lobbying and campaign contributions 
the current laws are so permissive that people in south 
carolina feel you can do anything said john crangle head of the 
states chapter of common cause the government watchdog group 
two of the three investigations became public in the past week 
first federal officials confirmed they were looking into 
allegations of illegal conduct by state lawmakers lawmakers say a 
lobbyist working as an undercover agent offered legislators cash 
in exchange for votes 
then tuesday sources said the us justice department was 
looking into allegations that the states top fbi officer asked the 
chief highway patrolman to help him avoid a drunkendriving charge 
the fbi already was investigating the highway department on 
allegations that top officials took money from a leading contractor 
this is not good timing beasley said 
the cashforvotes investigation troubles lawmakers the most at 
the heart of it is ron l cobb a flashy cigarsmoking former 
legislator who is a wellknown lobbyist 
cobb some lawmakers said offered them cash this spring when 
lobbying them about a bill that would have allowed parimutuel 
betting a source has told the associated press that fbi agents 
videotaped the exchanges 
many lawmakers and lobbyists believe the investigation is a 
sting operation cobbs purported client a georgiabased 
organization called the alpha group does not exist according to 
georgia or south carolina records 
however neither us attorney bart daniel nor fred verinder 
the fbis top agent in south carolina will elaborate about the 
investigation cobb has not returned telephone calls to his office 
no one has been charged with a crime 
critics blame the investigation on south carolinas lax rules on 
lobbyists and campaign contributions 
for example south carolina has no limit on corporate or 
individual campaign contributions no limits on cash donations 
little regulation on gifts from lobbyists and no preelection 
campaign finance reports 
twentyseven states limit individual campaign contributions 35 
states either ban or limit corporate contributions 26 limit cash 
contributions and 15 ban or limit gifts from lobbyists and south 
carolina is among only three states that allow candidates to wait 
until after a general election to file their campaign finance 
reports 
furthermore the finance reports are sent to committees in the 
state house and senate which crangle said is like having the fox 
watch over the henhouse 
attempts at reform have died in recent years including this 
year when the general assembly failed to complete work on a bill 
that would have required lobbyists to verify more details about 
their spending 
state sen sherry martschink said news of the investigation 
actually pleases her 
it should signal the end of the grim days the end of shabby 
ethics legislation she said the revelations bring out into 
the open practices that should never have happened perhaps this is 
indeed the beginning of the end of the sad days 
but it is not apparently the end of the scandals verinder 
who is investigating the legislators is himself at the center of 
allegations involving a drunkendriving coverup 
government sources said on condition of anonymity that the 
justice departments office of professional responsibility would 
look into allegations that verinder was drunk when a trooper 
spotted his car weaving outside the city in late march 
after verinder was stopped the sources said he persuaded the 
trooper to let him call col jh red lanier the states chief 
highway patrolman lanier who denies any wrongdoing took verinder 
home verinder whose office said he would not comment was cited 
only with a speeding ticket 
he was drinking but he wasnt drunk lanier insisted 
he also denied that his actions had anything to do with an 
investigation of the highway department by the fbi and two other 
agencies the highway patrol is part of the highway department 
thats ridiculous lanier said he added that verinder 
cant control an investigation that the state law enforcement 
division the irs and the fbi that three agencies are doing 
the investigation is said to involve allegations that highway 
department employees took payoffs from contractors

sen dave durenberger today promised his 
colleagues to be a better man and then a better senator as 
they neared a vote on a resolution denouncing him for financial 
misconduct and ordering him to pay up to 123000 in restitution 
ethics committee chairman howell heflin dala said 
durenberger knowingly and willfully violated the established 
norms of senate behavior 
the evidence of knowing and willful misconduct is clear and 
convincing and far more troubling than senator durenbergers 
admitted negligence lack of wisdom or asserted misplaced reliance 
on others heflin told the senate 
every senator was expected to vote for the sanction except for 
durenberger and possibly his fellow minnesota republican sen rudy 
boschwitz said lois west durenbergers press secretary 
durenberger will vote present so as not to take a position 
west said boschwitz may vote the same way said his press 
secretary tim droogsma 
in prepared remarks scheduled for delivery on the floor after 
the vote durenberger called the senate action an ending and a 
beginning 
i ask your forgiveness he said for future challenges i 
need your friendship 
durenberger called the experience a costly education and 
assured senators i have reordered my personal and professional 
priorities to be first a better man and then a better senator 
as for the future i would ask only that i be judged not 
necessarily by what i say but what i do financial restitution is 
only a beginning 
there have been senators who said they would support him in 
whatever he wanted them to do west said durenberger if 
asked has been saying that he would just as soon they accept it as 
he has done 
durenberger would be the seventh senator to be censured 
condemned or denounced in the 20th century the senates most 
severe punishment for a member short of expulsion according to 
senate historians 
the senate action could take as little as an hour and a half in 
contrast to what is expected to be a bitter floor fight in the 
house over disciplining rep barney frank dmass 
the house ethics committee unanimously proposed reprimanding 
frank for help he gave to a male prostitute but some republicans 
have called for censure which would strip the congressman of a 
subcommittee chairmanship or expulsion 
the frank matter is scheduled to go to the house floor on 
thursday but rep william dannemeyer rcalif could preempt 
that by introducing an expulsion resolution earlier spokesman paul 
mero said the conservative lawmaker was considering doing that 
the senate ethics committee last week unanimously recommended 
the full senate denounce durenberger for unequivocally 
unethical conduct in connection with a bookpromotion scheme and 
senate payments on his minneapolis condominium 
the committees chairman sen howell heflin dala and vice 
chairman sen warren rudman rnh were expected to take a 
halfhour each to present the case against durenberger this 
afternoon said heflin spokesman tom mcmahon 
afterward two senators were to make statements in durenbergers 
behalf and durenberger was to make a short statement after the 
vote west said 
she characterized durenbergers speech as an acceptance of the 
judgment an apology 
durenberger wrote his twopage singlespaced speech tuesday 
evening and had breakfast with a personal friend this morning 
before heading to a full schedule of meetings west said 
hes really holding steady almost as if hes doing it for 
everybody staff members around here hes got a real positive 
attitude in thats hes looking forward to having this be over 
with she said 
she declined to name the senators who planned to speak in 
support of durenberger they would not be arguing against the 
sanction but in support of him as a senator and as a person she 
said 
durenberger had appealed to the committee for a lighter penalty 
saying denouncement was much too onerous 
boschwitz believes durenberger has already been punished by the 
length of the 22monthlong ethics investigation and the 500000 
in legal fees he has incurred said spokesman droogsma 
the resolution before the senate said durenberger brought the 
senate into dishonor and disrepute and lists six violations of 
senate rules 
a book contract that durenberger used to collect 100000 in 
speaking fees in 1985 and 1987 over the senates limits on speaking 
fees 
real estate transactions involving his minneapolis condominium 
that he used to obtain reimbursement for staying there during trips 
to minnesota 
failure to report the receipt of travel expenses in connection 
with the bookpromotion appearances and trips to the boston area to 
visit a marriage counselor 
discussions about the condominium with the trustee of the blind 
trust in which the property was held 
acceptance of free limousine service during the boston trips in 
violation of senate gift limits 
conversion of a 5000 campaign contribution to personal use 
the ethics panel said durenberger should reimburse the senate 
29050 plus interest in condominium payments and give 95000 to 
charity for exceeding speaking limits the latter sum would be 
reduced by whatever taxes he has paid on the income

david h souters supreme court nomination has 
escaped harsh criticism so far even from groups inclined to 
oppose any bush nominee suggesting his lack of a record on 
divisive issues has insulated him from attack 
as the nominee toured capitol hill to meet with senators 
wednesday liberal groups said they hope the senate judiciary 
committee will closely question him during confirmation hearings in 
september but almost no one had bad words for him now 
on the right the only thing conservatives could find to worry 
about was the possibility that souter would prove to be other than 
one of their own 
richard a viguerie chairman of the united conservatives of 
america said most conservatives today have nervous smiles we 
think we can be happy but were a little apprehensive 
liberals though hardly celebrating were reluctant to attack 
the nomination 
ruth pratt of the national abortion rights action league in 
souters home state of new hampshire said the senate needs to 
find out his position on issues of privacy and choice we are 
somewhat encouraged by what we hear about his reluctance to 
overturn precedent 
marcus hurn spokesman for the new hampshire citizens alliance 
for gay and lesbian rights said he would testify in favor of 
souter if national gay rights groups oppose the nominee 
i dont think the white house is getting a very political 
judge hurn said i think he is a highly judicial person 
with a high regard for precedents 
sounding a warning though still not criticism faye wattleton 
of planned parenthood said if souter refuses to answer questions on 
abortion when he testifies before the senate judiciary committee 
probably in september i dont think he deserves to sit on the 
court 
rebecca hagelin of the conservative concerned women for america 
said were going to see an effort by extremist feminist 
organizations to bring about an abortion inquisition 
but she suggested that any group opposing his confirmation 
because he has not endorsed the high courts 1973 ruling legalizing 
abortion runs the risk of being branded extremist 
both liberal and conservative groups have acknowledged the 
president caught them off guard by picking a successor to william 
j brennan within three days of the supreme court justices 
retirement announcement 
by moving quickly and choosing someone apparently 
noncontroversial bush has accomplished the dual purpose of 
shortcircuiting a possible drive by opposing groups to influence 
the selection and enhancing confirmation prospects 
the white house made no secret of its intentions 
we saw that some of the special interests on abortion civil 
rights were going to try to cook up a stew that this nomination 
would get dumped into said presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
conservative activist pat mcguigan said nobody knows anything 
about him in terms of senate confirmation this is very helpful 
but mcguigan said there could be political trouble down the road 
for bush if souter proves to be something other than a reliably 
conservative vote as a justice

tens of thousands of hong kong residents 
worried about their future after chinas takeover in 1997 flooded 
the immigration department wednesday the last day to apply for a 
special plan to emigrate to britain 
more than 18000 heads of households submitted applications for 
the nationality package by 1230 am thursday when police clanged 
shut a portable gate 30 minutes after the scheduled deadline 
at least 45000 people including children and other dependents 
waited in line throughout the day and no one appeared to have been 
turned away immigration officials said 
the british nationality package will grant full british 
citizenship to 50000 families or about 225000 hong kong 
residents 
hong kong is scheduled to return to chinese control in 1997 
ending 99 years of british colonial rule more than 1000 people a 
week are emigrating from hong kong mainly to australia and canada 
emigration this year is expected to increase at least 30 percent 
over last year when more than 42000 people left 
according to hong kong immigration officials about 35 million 
of hong kongs 57 million people are eligible for the british 
plan but less than 10 percent will win the right of abode 
britain offered the plan in an attempt to stop hong kongs most 
skilled people from fleeing the territory as the date for the 
chinese takeover draws near 
china opposes the british emigration plan and has threatened not 
to acknowledge the british passports of hong kong residents 
on wednesday people were packed 12 deep in some places outside

the line snaked for almost a mile over walkways and along 
avenues from morning until late in the night about 50 people spent 
tuesday night sleeping on an overpass and dozens of people fainted 
in the humidity and heat 
a woman wearing a sleeveless green tshirt was the last

immigration officials said thousands of people needlessly lined 
up 
the confusion was a further indication of the growing fear hong

iraq and kuwait have never agreed on the demarcation of their 
border since kuwait gained its independence from britain in 1961 
shortly after kuwait gained its independendence iraq claimed 
sovereignty and the kuwaitis asked britain for assistance britain 
sent in paratroopers and they were replaced by an arab force led by 
egypt which acted as a buffer between the two countries until 
tensions eased in 1963

100milelong southern border with kuwait although iraq has denied 
building up troops along the border

conspiring with the united states and israel to weaken iraqs 
economy and undermine its military buildup

a jury was selected wednesday to decide a lawsuit 
that blames retired air force major general richard secord and a 
cialinked airline for the 1986 plane crash in nicaragua that 
helped unravel the irancontra affair 
cargo handler eugene hasenfus and the family of the planes 
copilot wallace sawyer jr claim in the lawsuit that secord and 
miamibased southern air transport used unsafe aircraft in the 
nicaraguan contra supply effort 
the october 1986 downing of the c123 by a sandinista rocket 
helped trigger the irancontra investigation after the crash the 
reagan administration acknowledged that money was diverted from 
iran arms sales to the contras despite a congressional ban on us 
military aid to the rebels 
a sixmember jury and two alternates were seated after 
questioning by senior us district judge c clyde atkins only a 
few of the 35 prospective jurors said they remembered reading or 
hearing about the crash none showed any recognition when former 
white house aide oliver north was mentioned as a possible witness 
secord sat at the defense table with southern air president 
william langton and a team of lawyers hasenfus of marinette 
wis sat across the room with his wife sally sawyers widow 
kasanee sawyer of magnolia ark and their attorneys 
secord pleaded guilty nov 8 to lying to the congressional 
committee investigating the irancontra affair and has been placed 
on two years probation 
when the lawsuit was filed in 1988 attorneys had estimated 
damages at 135 million however on wednesday the plaintiffs 
submitted new figures seeking actual damages of about 2 million 
for sawyers family and about 1 million for hasenfus 
hasenfus a cargo handler or kicker aboard a plane 
secretly supplying the nicaraguan rebels was captured and held for 
about three months after nicaraguan troops shot down the plane 
the lawsuit says hasenfus was recruited in 1986 through the 
pennsylvania airline corporate air services and william cooper a 
pilot for southern air which was once owned by the cia and 
continues to do contract work for the us government 
cooper who also died in the crash led hasenfus to believe he 
was working on behalf of the us government on a project being 
directed right out of the back door of the white house the 
lawsuit said 
southern air has denied any association with the hasenfus flight 
secords attorneys describe hasenfus as a mercenary paid about 
3000 a month who knew the risks

imelda marcos would donate about 5 million for 
earthquake relief in the philippines if the manila government and 
us officials release funds frozen by the courts her lawyer said 
wednesday 
james linn an oklahoma city attorney representing the former 
philippine first lady said the offer was made several days ago and 
were waiting for an answer from manila 
tambi wycoco a spokesman for the philippines consulate here 
said hed heard rumors of the offer but weve seen nothing on 
it 
of course if she offered it would be accepted he said 
there are some in the community who say it would be her way of 
returning the money later she can say she gave back 5 million 
linn said mrs marcos spoke by telephone with vice president 
salvador laurel in manila about the proposed donation 
laurel has split politically with president corazon aquino with 
whom he rose to power in the february 1986 popular revolt that 
ousted mrs marcos husband the late president ferdinand marcos 
the proposed donation of 100 million philippine pesos would 
require the approval of mrs aquinos government and a us court 
which froze the marcoses assets after they were driven into 
hawaiian exile 
philippines officials said on wednesday that the toll now stands 
at more than 1600 killed 3000 injured and 90000 left homeless 
by the quake that struck the northern main island of luzon a week 
ago 
the disaster has created another financial crisis for the aquino 
government already burdened by a 26 billion foreign debt 
linn said mrs marcos offer was just a humanitarian gesture 
with no strings attached 
some of the marcos assets frozen by the 1986 court order are in 
swiss banks and some in hong kong said linn he would not estimate 
how much money was involved 
he said the request for a court order releasing the funds would 
be put to us officials later this week 
mrs marcos was acquitted here earlier this month of federal 
fraud racketeering and obstruction charges in the alleged theft of 
more than 220 million from the philippines treasury during marcos 
20year rule 
still pending are a series of civil lawsuits filed by the aquino 
government which is still trying to recover the money 
in addition the 61yearold mrs marcos has been subpoenaed to 
testify before a federal grand jury in pittsburgh investigating 
dealings between the westinghouse electric corp and marcos 
concerning a nuclear power plant the company built in the 
philippines in the early 1980s

federal agencies studying the feasibility of 
highspeed trains propelled by magnets should know by 1993 whether 
the united states can regain the lead in this transportation 
technology said a report released wednesday 
the report a preliminary implementation plan developed by 
the army corps of engineers sets a timetable under which various 
federal agencies would evaluate and then oversee the development of 
magnetic levitation trains in the united states 
we believe there is a golden opportunity for magnetic 
levitation in this country said dan mauldin deputy director of 
civil works for the corps of engineers 
magnetic levitation trains are propelled by magnets on a cushion 
of air over a rail such trains could travel up to 300 miles per 
hour use less energy than conventional means of transportation and 
would be cheaper to ride than airplanes according to the report 
so far only the japanese and the germans have developed 
prototype trains several projects are under discussion in the 
united states 
in fiscal 1993 the federal agencies studying magnetic 
levitation which include the transportation department the 
federal railroad administration and the corps will choose from 
among three options according to the report 
the agencies may ask one or more industry teams to design an 
advanced magnetic levitation system the winning team would 
then have the opportunity to build and operate a fullscale 
prototype 
the agencies may encourage us industry to team with state and 
local interests to build several different magnetic levitation 
systems at different sites the market would then determine which 
system is superior based on operation maintenance and costs 
the agencies may encourage privatesector firms to adapt foreign 
magnetic levitation systems for us transportation needs the last 
option would require the smallest outlay of federal money the 
report noted 
magnetic levitation was invented and pioneered in the 1960s and 
1970s by americans including james powell and gordon danby at 
brookhaven national laboratory in new york but us advances 
stopped around 1974 when the federal role in magnetic levitation 
development ended sen daniel p moynihan said at a news 
conference to release the report

a shooting victim declared dead for 
hours suddenly showed signs of life as medical technicians were 
preparing his body to remove organs for transplants 
he died wednesday nearly 15 hours later 
this is the first time ive seen one respond like this and 
ive been at this for 30 some years said black hawk county 
medical examiner albert dolan 
he said a medical team that hoped to take organs for transplant 
from the body of james albert geiger of waterloo stood aside 
tuesday as doctors who initially believed that geiger had died 
eight hours before worked to save his life geiger then died early 
wednesday morning 
geiger carrying a sixinch knife and threatening suicide was 
shot late monday police said when he lunged from beneath a table 
at his home in waterloo toward a police officer a 357caliber 
bullet entered the top of his head and came to rest at the base of 
his brain dolan said 
geiger was declared brain dead early tuesday 
the medical examiner said a blood flow test was administered to 
determine if blood was reaching geigers brain 
its 90 percent accurate when theres no flow you consider 
the patient brain dead dolan said that was what we found 
early on tuesday therefore he was given the diagnosis of brain 
dead and you have to remember there was severe trauma to the 
brain 
doctors got permission from geigers family to take the organs 
for transplants but about 7 hours after geiger was pronounced 
brain dead a cardiologist who was there to maintain geigers blood 
pressure was startled by an arm movement that would not happen if 
the patient were dead 
we were all shocked he indicated he had some response to 
pain which normally a brain dead person would not dolan said 
another test showed the brain was marginally active and geiger 
was declared to be alive but very critical dolan said 
in the next several hours geigers blood pressure dropped 
causing damage to his organs that made them unsuitable for 
transplant dolan said geiger died of heart failure early 
wednesday morning 
my own answer to this is that god just wasnt ready for him 
yet thats the only explanation i can give unfortunately 
medicine is not an exact science dolan said 
the waterloo police department is conducting an investigation 
and at the chiefs request the black hawk county sheriffs 
department and iowaservices committees to press ahead with 
production of the b2 bomber and other major new weapons the house 
is considering halting production of radarevading jets which cost 
800 million apiece 
the defense session came on the heels of another meeting between 
bush and the five top leaders of congress to push the budget summit 
talks along 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that at either 
thursdays or fridays meeting both sides will simultaneously 
put proposals on the table for cutting 50 billion from the deficit 
next year and 500 billion over five years 
but democratic budget bargainers disputed that saying no 
decision had been made on exchanging offers 
that is so silly said senate budget committee chairman 
james sasser dtenn 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo told reporters 
the two sides have tentatively agreed to extend from 1993 to 1995 
the grammrudman deadline for balancing the budget 
gephardt said major differences in defense levels is a major 
hangup in reaching an overall budget compromise 
bush and the leaders discussed entitlement programs social 
security medicare and other programs for the poor and elderly 
and both sides are troubled by the magnitude of cuts that might 
be needed in those areas gephardt said 
despite bushs earlier agreement that the government must pull 
in more tax revenues nobody wants to raise taxes its very 
hard to put the final package together the democratic leader 
said 
after the defense session rep les aspin dwis the house 
armed services committee chairman lamented that bush and defense 
secretary dick cheney still have in mind a much bigger defense 
budget than i think is going to come out of this process 
aspin announced monday he favors halting production of the b2 
now that the first 15 bombers have been delivered to the air force 
bush wants to build the fleet of 75 that congress agreed to several 
years ago 
aspins senate counterpart sen sam nunn dga who favors 
continued production said afterwards the b2 has an uphill 
fight if its going to survive 
aspins committee is aiming to cut 24 billion from bushs 
request for 307 billion for the pentagon for fiscal 1991 
fitzwater said bush called the meeting to express concern about 
inordinate cuts 
despite improved relations the soviet union remains the united 
states adversary said fitzwater he quoted bush as saying 
there have been few changes in soviet strategic forces they 
are continuing to modernize their entire force and will enter the 
start negotiations fully modernized 
cheney told the lawmakers that the house cuts would force the 
pentagon to absorb personnel cuts of 250000 in the first year 
cutting back nearly four army divisions and 25 ships 
we think that is unreasonable fitzwater said 
bush said at a strategic air command base in cheyenne wyo 
last friday that he wanted to hold the line at the already 
painful reduction of the defense budget set down by the senate 
armed services committee 
that panel chaired by nunn approved a 289 billion defense 
bill last week that would cut nearly 1 billion from bushs 4 
billion strategic defense initiative request and remove 100000 
troops from active duty including 50000 from europe 
nunn said after the meeting we can save some very substantial 
sums over five years and do it prudently trimming 180 billion 
to 200 billion from defense 
the first year we can save about 20 percent responsibly 
nunn said over five years we can save about 35 percent of that 
total of 500 billion 
but if too much is cut the first year you end up wrecking the 
personnel system and demoralizing not only those who will be 
forced out of the military but those who are left nunn 
warned 
nunn said it will take strenuous efforts by bush cheney and 
national security adviser brent scowcroft to save the b2 
rep newt gingrich rga the house minority whip told 
reporters afterwards that aspin has the votes to pass a left 
wing destructive defense budget 
that bill will either be fixed in conference or it will be 
vetoed gingrich said what theyre going to do in their markup 
is going to be a massacre not a markup

a change in cambodias representation 
in the united nations would hurt the search for peace in indochina 
the association of southeast asian nations said in a statement 
wednesday 
last week the united states withdrew its support for the 
tripartite guerrilla coalition that holds cambodias un general 
assembly seat 
in a communique asean foreign ministers said any change would 
set back the search for a comprehensive political solution to the 
cambodian problem 
the communique was mild in tone and did not mention the united 
states by name 
washington also announced last week it would open talks with 
vietnam on a settlement in cambodian and would no longer support 
the right of the guerrilla coalition to represent phnom penh in the 
world body 
those steps could open the way to a broader rapprochement 
between the united states and hanoi shifting the balance of power 
in southeast asia hanoi supports the cambodian govenment 
the abrupt us policy change underlined the failure of years of 
aseanled diplomacy to negotiate a settlement asean helped form 
the cambodian resistance group in 1982 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the shift was 
designed to prevent the khmer rouge the strongest of the three 
guerrilla groups from gaining power in cambodia the khmer rouge 
took power in 1975 and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of 
civilians before it was ousted by vietnam in 1978 
asean officials plan to meet baker and foreign policy 
specialists from canada japan australia new zealand and the 
european community later in the week 
the communique also called for the resumption of the 
inconclusive cambodian peace talks it noted with regret that the 
conflicting parties themselves so far have not sufficiently shown 
the necessary political will for a negotiated settlement 
the statement said asean hopes that a supreme national 
council representing the three guerrilla factions and the 
cambodian government will administer cambodia 
the guerrilla coalition is comprised of the communist khmer 
rouge the noncommunist forces of prince norodom sihanouk and son 
sanns khmer peoples national liberation front 
asean diplomats also said the us switch could lower the 
incentive for the khme271 million in the first three months of this 
year a worse showing than in the same period a year ago but a 
sharp improvement over the previous quarter 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision said the 
red ink compared with a 31 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 
1989 and a 10 million profit in the first quarter of 1989 
the figures do not include 350 thrifts which were still open at 
the end of march but were controlled by the resolution trust corp 
a new agency charged with closing and selling failed sampls the 
corporation is expected to release those figures next week 
analysts complained that reporting profit results separately for 
private and governmentcontrolled thrifts amounts to sugarcoating 
bad news and interferes with their ability to analyze the entire 
industry the thrift office collects information from both sets of 
sampls and in the past had always released both groups of figures 
its hogwash said bert ely a financial institutions 
analyst in alexandria va the thrift office wants to be the 
goodnews boys 
however thrift office director timothy ryan declared im not 
mr rosy scenario 
putting the two together presents an inaccurate picture of the 
industry he said 
the agency also is drawing criticism from congress rep bruce 
vento dminn chairman of a house banking task force that 
monitors the sampl bailout said in a letter to ryan that there is 
no rational basis for separating the statistics 
the american people are skeptical of the good faith of the 
regulators and of the savings and loan industry and frankly this 
change in reporting looks bad vento wrote 
in wednesdays report the thrift office did not say how much 
the losses were reduced by government subsidies to sampls bailed out 
in 1988 ely estimated the subsidy at between 1 billion and 15 
billion per quarter 
the 1988 deals are coming under increasing criticism from sen 
howard m metzenbaum dohio and others in congress who say they 
provided acquirers with virtually guaranteed profits for very 
little investment 
the agency said deposits at thrifts privately run at the end of 
march increased to 798 billion from 789 billion a year earlier 
however the figure includes interest paid on the deposits 
which would have been about six times the 9 billion gain 
normally economists subtract the interest to get an idea of 
whether sampl customers are withdrawing more than they are depositing 
also the figures excluded deposits lost at sampls that were 
turned over the the rtc at some point during the year 
ryan in a press release issued by his agency had greeted the 
first quarter results as a sign of progress he was quoted as 
saying it appears that deposits and profits are returning to the 
strong part of the industry 
however at a news conference he told reporters it was too soon 
to draw conclusions from the data he said he would not know if the 
industry is capable of surviving until sometime early next year 
should we jump up and down and declare victory he asked 
no this is still a very tough situation in my view 
the agency divided the sampl industry into four parts 310 
institutions expected to fail 311 struggling thrifts that may 
fail 620 sampls that are somewhat weak but are expected to survive 
and 1264 institutions in good shape 
only the institutions in the last group earned what investors 
consider an acceptable return 692 million the next best group 
earned a subpar 192 million the struggling sampls lost 281 million 
and the expected failures lost 874 million 
you have an enormous segment of the industry that isnt making 
it ely said 
wednesdays report was about a month late ryan said the agency 
had changed its data collection process and hoped to release the 
reports on time in the future

antiapartheid leader allan 
boesak tainted by a scandal over his extramarital affair said 
wednesday he was resigning all his church posts to seek a political 
career 
the mixedrace protestant minister also said he would continue 
his relationship with elna botha a married white producer for 
governmentrun television 
boesak the father of four children said his wife dorothy had 
initiated divorce proceedings 
he and ms botha issued simultaneous statements through their 
attorneys saying their marriages had begun to fail before they met 
each other and that they intended to maintain their contact 
church officials had pleaded with boesak to reconsider when he 
announced july 8 he would resign from his religious posts 
he said wednesday he would not change his mind and had stepped 
down as a minister of the dutch reformed mission church and 
president of the world alliance of reformed churches an 
international council of protestant churches 
i have decided to offer my services to the people of this 
country to bring about a united nonracial and democratic south 
africa i am prepared to play any role which i may be called upon 
to play in this regard he said in a statement released by his 
lawyer 
boesak has played a major role in the opposition to apartheid 
leading demonstrations and touring the world to denounce south 
africas system of racial segregation 
long thought to be interested in a political career boesak 
models himself after the late martin luther king jr 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu who often marched with boesak 
at the head of protests against apartheid said wednesday the sky 
is the limit for boesaks future political career people 
recognize his gifts the sacrifices that he has made for the 
struggle and i think thay they will follow him 
he has fought a very great deal and his family has tutu 
said perhaps part of the cost is what has happened to his 
marriage 
the revelations about boesak and ms botha were seen as a moral 
scandal in south africa because both were married and boesak was an 
ordained minister apartheid laws on interracial relationships 
were dropped in 1985 
boesak came under fire in the mid1980s following press reports 
of his involvement with a white female church worker a church 
inquiry later cleared him of any wrongdoing

at fort campbell killing two soldiers and injuring three 
officials said wednesday 
the ch47d chinook mediumlift helicopter which can carry loads 
suspended in slings was on a training mission when it crashed late 
tuesday 
the soldiers were training with a load of two concrete blocks 
slung beneath the copter when it crashed said sgt steven

on the flight said harralson he did not know if they were used by 
the pilot the copilot or both 
the goggles came into controversy in 1988 after 17 soldiers were 
killed at fort campbell when two helicopters collided during a 
night flight on which the pilots were using the goggles 
the goggles have since been updated harralson said it was not 
known if the goggles used on tuesdays flight were of the early or 
latter version

carrier or to slingload items such as artillery and fighting 
vehicles in battle areas 
safety officials from the army safety center at fort rucker 
ala arrived at the fort wednesday to begin an investigation 
harralson said there were witnesses to the crash that coupled 
with survivors testimony should speed the investigation he said 
the survivors included the pilot and copilot but the pilot was 
in critical condition at vanderbilt university hospital in 
nashville officials said 
everyone aboard was from the posts 7th battalion 101st 
aviation regiment said harralson

would have a special impact 
it shouldnt have to but this brings home the daily

a chemical company warned former and current 
employees wednesday that a study shows for the first time a 
possible direct link between pancreatic cancer and the insecticide 
ddt 
the study by the university of michigan focused on 28 cases of 
pancreatic cancer among rohm amp haas employees who worked at its 
philadelphia plant from 1948 to 1971 when ddt and related 
chemicals were produced there 
other researchers expressed caution at the preliminary results 
saying too little was known to definitively draw a link between the 
chemical and pancreatic cancer the fifthleading cancer killer 
ddt is known to cause liver cancer at high doses in mice but is 
not known to cause cancer in humans said albert heier a us 
environmental protection agency spokesman the pesticide was banned 
in 1972 over concerns about its adverse effect on the environment 
and wildlife and its persistence in the food chain 
rohm amp haas spokesman george bochanski said the company received 
a draft of the study from dr david garabrant about two weeks ago 
and decided to release the results to its employees bochanski said 
the company held meetings with current employees wednesday and had 
sent letters to former employees 
we felt it was appropriate to let our workers know now 
bochanski said 
garabrant and rohm amp haas officials did not release a copy of 
the study saying it was only a draft 
garabrant and company officials said that based on the study 
ddt could neither be identified nor ruled out as the cause of the 
pancreatic cancer 
but they said the study was the first link between ddt which is 
known to cause cancer in laboratory animals and pancreatic cancer 
in humans garabrant ruled out other chemicals or lifestyle risks 
such as smoking 
we really have to look at this further before drawing 
conclusions about ddts link with pancreatic cancer the epas 
heier said 
the study was prompted by a 1987 report by rohm amp haas that 
found 16 cases of pancreatic cancer among the 6000 employees at 
its philadelphia plant from 194871 only about nine cases of the 
cancer would normally be expected according to bochanski 
the national rate of pancreatic cancer is about 9 cases per 
100000 people resulting in about 28100 new cases and about 
25000 deaths a year according to the american cancer society 
about 3 percent survive five years or longer 
the current study commissioned by rohm amp haas used the same 
employee population but researchers discovered 12 additional known 
cases of the cancer 
garabrant said the study examined the medical records of all 28 
employees diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and compared them to 112 
other employees matched for age sex and race who did not work 
with ddt and questioned them or surviving relatives about 
lifestyles such as smoking or diet 
rohm amp haas manufactured ddt until 1971 the company did not 
know the amount of ddt to which the employees had been exposed nor 
the length of their exposure 
an epidemiologist at fox chase cancer center thomas mason 
cautioned against reading too much into rohm amp haas early results 
ddt is stored in the bodys fat so a diet high in fat could 
affect the studys results he said he suggested that further 
research on the plants rate of pancreatic cancer and ddt examine 
the connection to diet 
bochanski said it was uncertain what the companys next step 
would be

president bush promised support wednesday for 
the people of lithuania latvia and estonia in their quest for 
freedom from the soviet union 
bush held a ceremony in the rose garden marking captive 
nations week an event that the presidents have observed annually 
since the eisenhower era 
bush brought with him both a piece of the berlin wall and a 
swatch of barbed wire that came from a now dismantled barrier on 
the austriahungary border 
these two symbols of tyranny should never be forgotten bush 
told his 100 guests many of them refugees from communist lands 
the audience also included a group of young interns from poland 
hungary and czechoslovakia 
they are here learning how a free society works and will 
return to build a free poland a free hungary a free 
czechoslovakia the president said 
but while we celebrate for those who are now free we must 
also remember those who are not said bush 
he recalled the scene from chinas tiananmen square last year 
where iron tanks were met by the iron will of a courageous lone 
man 
today i also want to remember especially the people of latvia 
lithuania and estonia and renew our unflagging support for their 
long quest for national selfdetermination he said 
the road ahead is going to be difficult but we can now join 
them in looking forward with hope to the day when their long 
cherished dreams will become reality he said 
he asked the audience to pray that the next captive nations 
week will be the last 
the united states has never recognized the forcible 
incorporation of the three baltic states into the soviet union in 
1940 under pressure from stalinist troops lithuania declared its 
independence from moscow this spring prompting soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev to impose an economic embargo on the republic 
bush has urged restraint on both sides while repeatedly 
affirming us support for the baltic states right of 
selfdetermination the soviet leader recently eased the economic 
blockade after the lithuanian parliament in vilnius suspended its 
declaration of independence 
the kremlin is expected to start negotiations soon with the 
lithuanians gorbachev has said it might take several years for the 
situation to be worked out 
the lithuanian parliament has also demanded independence voting 
again last week to nullify the 50yearold soviet declaration of 
power

britain natos most hawkish member said 
wednesday it plans to pull half its troops from west germany and 
cut its overall regular forces by 18 percent in response to a 
reduced soviet threat 
the united states announced defense reductions after last years 
democratic revolutions in eastern europe but british officials had 
cautioned against any quick decisions to slash forces 
in wednesdays announcement to the house of commons however 
defense secretary tom king acknowledged the lowering of global 
tensions 
our aim is an orderly and planned transition to the new world 
unfolding said king it is a time of opportunity and hope for 
change yet without putting at risk the safe protection of our 
country 
the moves which also call for eliminating 19 warships and 
submarines by 1995 will produce substantial savings king said 
but he gave no immediate indication of the size of the conservative 
party governments peace dividend 
king said britain will make no reductions in its nuclear 
arsenal britain still plans to modernized its submarineborne 
polaris nuclear missiles by the mid1990s with a more powerful 
trident system bought from the united states wednesdays 
announcement followed a fivemonth review of defense spending by 
prime minister margaret thatcher and a committee of top cabinet 
ministers mrs thatcher has been among the highest defense 
spenders in the western countries north atlantic treaty 
organization 
in the most dramatic proposal king said the government 
envisaged that by 1995 britain will have two rather than four 
divisions assigned to defend west germany it will also halve the 
number of air bases there 
britain has about 66700 servicemen deployed in west germany 
including the 55000member british army of the rhine they are the 
second biggest foreign military presence after the united states 
in other deep conventional arms cuts proposed by the mid1990s 
king said the royal navys submarine fleet will be reduced from 27 
to 16 threefourths of them nuclearpowered 
the british naval fleet of frigates and destroyers will be cut 
from 48 to 40 king said that move reverses a conservative party 
pledge to maintain a fleet of about 50 warships 
the number of royal air force squadrons will drop from 15 to 
about nine 
king said the reductions hinge on several factors the signing 
of an eastwest accord on conventional arms cuts final 
arrangements for german unification and the pace of withdrawal of 
soviet troops from other east european countries 
king said that by the mid1990s he envisages a british army of 
120000 down from 160000 and the royal air force with 75000 
personnel down from 89000 the royal navy and royal marines would 
be cut by only 3000 personnel to 60000 
in addition king said there will be further immediate savings 
of 11 billion from britains 386 billion defense budget for the 
fiscal year ending in march he said the army would ease back on 
recruiting and officials would retire several ships and submarines 
early 
despite his other comments king said the soviet union remained 
the mightiest military force in europe he warned that if president 
mikhail s gorbachev lost power britain could not suddenly try 
to recall its forces

endangered florida panthers may get a 
lethal dose of mercury when they dine on raccoons that apparently 
pick up the poison by eating everglades fish scientists say 
recent laboratory analyses found significant amounts of mercury 
in the livers of raccoons captured in the eastern everglades said 
melody roelke a veterinarian for the panther recovery project 
those cats who eat these mercuryladen raccoons will pick up 
mercury but it may not be the only source roelke said tuesday 
in presenting her findings to officials from four state and federal 
agencies 
the tainted raccoons were found in the same shark river slough 
area where a 4yearold female panther known as no 27 died of 
mercury poisoning last year 
panther no 17 one of the largest and oldest known panthers at 
154 pounds and 8 to 10 years old was found dead monday its 
remains were so decomposed biologists dont think theyll be able 
to find out what killed it 
its believed only 30 to 50 panthers remain in south florida 
and they face threats ranging from habitat loss to cars on the 
roads they sometimes cross 
roelke estimated that a 75pound panther eating a 6pound 
raccoon daily from the shark river slough would accumulate a toxic 
dose of mercury in 14 weeks 
what that means is everything from uncoordination visual 
problems to seizures and death roelke said 
in the case of panther no 27 theres a good probability that 
she moved into that slough about four months prior to her death 
this is compatible with the time course for an animal eating 
nothing but raccoons every day 
officials cautioned that the data while cause for concern was 
preliminary and they said raccoons make up a main part of the 
panthers diet in only a few areas 
raccoons eat fish state health officials have warned against 
eating fish from several areas of the everglades because of the 
mercury

a new advertising campaign unveiled wednesday 
will try to persuade teenagers that drugs and alcohol can lead to 
careless sex which can lead to aids 
aids another way drugs can kill you the public service ads 
say 
the 3 million threeyear campaign launched by the national 
institute on drug abuse and the advertising council is the first 
targeted at teenagers the age group that has one of the fastest 
growing rates of aids cases 
among teenagers 1519 about 57 percent are sexually active 
public health experts said according to last years annual high 
school survey conducted by the institute 51 percent of seniors 
have used an illegal drug 
intravenous drug use is often associated with aids because the 
virus transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids can be 
spread by sharing needles with an infected user but the new ads 
are aimed at use of alcohol and drugs not normally injected like 
crack cocaine and marijuana 
if you become influenced by alcohol or drugs and then whether 
you decided ahead of time to abstain from sex or use a condom 
youre so wiped out that you forget protection goes out the 
window said dr james mason assistant secretary of health in 
the department of health and human services 
studies have shown that people are more likely to have sex and 
less likely to use condoms when they are under the influence of 
drugs or alcohol he said 
were trying to get out front and discourage kids or adults 
from using drugs in the first place he said 
mason said public health officials are concerned about the 
rising rate of aids among teens up by 35 percent between january 
1989 and may 1990 from 342 cases to 530 
he also noted that onefifth of all people with aids are in 
their 20s about 27500 people because the average time from 
infection with the aids virus until onset of the disease is 
believed to be nine years many of these people probably were 
infected during their teens 
the campaign features radio television and print ads in which 
teenagers are in sexual situations in the tv ads directed by 
martin scorsese and narrated by spike lee the teens are at a house 
party on the beach or in a car lee also narrates the radio spots 
in the print campaign one ad shows a picture of a wrecked car 
and below it a teenage couple kissing in a car copy under the 
first photo reads this fatal accident was caused by teenagers 
getting stoned and going too fast the caption under the second 
picture reads so was this one aids another way drugs can 
kill 
mason said that some may be offended by the forthright nature 
of these messages but if we are to save lives we must speak to 
teens in a language that will get their attention make them listen 
and understand 
as of the end of may 136204 people in the united states had 
been diagnosed with aids and 83145 of them had died as many as 
15 million americans are believed to have been infected with the 
virus with 40000 to 80000 new infections each year mason said

house speaker thomas s foley on wednesday 
predicted that rep barney frank will withstand republican attempts 
thursday to expel or censure the massachusetts democrat for his 
actions on behalf of a male prostitute 
with frank saying he would likely take to the house floor in his 
own defense foley of washington said wednesday that most 
democrats and some republicans would accept a house ethics 
committee recommendation that frank merely be reprimanded the 
mildest sanction available the matter is expected to come before 
the full house thursday 
in this case a unanimous vote of the ethics committee should 
be accepted by both party leaderships and supported on the house 
floor and its what i believe the house will do foley said in a 
capitol hill news conference 
frank one of two acknowledged homosexuals in congress already 
has publicly apologized for his actions on behalf of male 
prostitute stephen gobie and has said he may apologize to the 
house in a brief interview wednesday frank said he would 
probably participate in the debate 
it does seem to me that i have an obligation to speak to my 
colleagues on this issue frank said 
some house members are seeking a tougher penalty against frank 
house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia is supporting a 
bid to censure frank a penalty that would cost the fifthterm 
congressman his judiciary subcommittee chairmanship and rep 
william dannemeyer rcalif said wednesday that he was rounding 
up support for a move to expel frank from the house an action seen 
as unlikely 
the 12member ethics committee split evenly between democrats 
and republicans has come up with what i consider less than what 
the incident deserves dannemeyer said he rejected the 
committees conclusion that frank was telling the truth when he 
said he immediately kicked gobie out of his capitol hill apartment 
in 1987 when he learned that gobie was operating a prostitution 
business from there 
dannemeyer said frank had to have known of and countenanced the 
prostitution all along 
if theres one thing any of us should be responsible for is to 
be responsible for whats going on in his own home dannemeyer 
said 
the ethics committee dismissed charges that frank was aware of 
the prostitution 
instead the committee cited frank for writing a misleading memo 
that was sent to a virginia prosecutor overseeing gobies probation 
on a sex and drug felony conviction the committee said the 1986 
memo could be interpreted as an attempt to convince authorities to 
be lenient toward gobie the committee said also that frank 
improperly used his congressional authority to avoid paying 33 
parking tickets some of them received by gobie while on personal 
business 
thursdays debate was expected to be the first item on the house 
agenda foley set aside one hour of debate on the expulsion 
proposal followed by a vote and another hour on whether the 
reprimand recommendation should be increased to a censure there 
would likely be separate votes on the censure and reprimand issues

jewish activists donned concentration camp 
uniforms wednesday to protest what they called west german 
president richard von weizsaeckers obscene plan to meet with 
austrian president kurt waldheim 
four activists led by new york rabbi avi weiss stood outside the 
main gate of weizsaeckers sprawling west berlin palace holding a 
large photo of waldheim in a nazi uniform 
weizsaeckers decision to be the first german leader to 
embrace waldheim who has a nazi past is obscene said weiss 
who has led similiar protests against waldheim in recent years 
he said the group planned a large protest thursday in salzburg 
austria where weizsaecker and czechoslovak president vaclav havel 
are to pay a private visit to the austrian leader 
the visit represents a thaw in an informal boycott of meetings 
with waldheim by western leaders since waldheims election in 1986 
to a sixyear presidential term 
waldheim served in the german army in yugoslavia during world 
war ii and a uncommissioned panel of experts has concluded he 
was in a position to know about nazi atrocities 
havel the highly regarded playwright who led the democratic 
revolt against czechoslovakias communist government last year has 
come under the most criticism for the planned meeting 
there has been little criticism in germany of weizsaeckers trip 
weizsaecker spokesman gernot fritz said it is a private visit 
he is meeting with waldheim not in his capacity as president but 
as a private person 
fritz speaking in bonn west germany on wednesday said no 
official talks were planned he said the visit is in conjunction 
with the opening of the salzburg festival of music and drama on 
thursday 
havel was quoted as saying that the boycott of waldheim by 
foreign statesmen has become a certain way stereotyped and a 
game 
in an interview with the salzburger nachrichten on tuesday he 
said by its ritualization it effectively becomes a cliche 
and there is not a bit of moral courage in this but a 
coldblooded calculation if one wont go nor will the other they 
are simply afraid of each other he was quoted as saying 
weizsaecker was in his bonn office when the protesters gathered 
outside his west berlin office the castle bellevue an 18th 
century residence of hohenzollern princes 
guards kept the protesters clad in the blackandwhite striped 
shirts of concentration camp inmates from entering the gate on the 
stately grounds where weiss tried to deliver a personal letter for 
weizsaecker 
several police officers were called and they allowed the group 
to recite hebrew prayers outside the gate 
please dont let a german officer arrest a jewish rabbi 
weiss told a police officer who ordered the group to disperse 
weiss said the protest in salzburg would be bolder and larger 
he said the group came to berlin even though they knew 
weizsaecker would not be there because it was the old nazi capital 
we felt we should come to berlin on the way to salzburg 
because this is a time of germanys unification when many people 
are asking whether germany is going to be different from its 
past he said

prospects for better relations between north 
korea and south korea and for possible expanded us trade with 
north korea have improved in the past two months a senior state 
department official said wednesday 
at 11 meetings between us and north korean officials held in 
beijing since last year the united states has spelled out steps 
that could lead to closer ties between the two countries said 
desaix anderson deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian 
and pacific affairs 
the moment is clearly propitious anderson told the house 
foreign affairs asia subcommittee saying the united states is 
looking for progress in north koreas dialogue with south korea an 
agreement on nuclear safeguards assurance that the north eschews 
terrorism and a process for returning remains of us korean war 
dead 
the united states does not expect all of those actions at once 
he said but for each positive move by north korea the united 
states will respond in kind 
if all of the steps are taken the stage would certainly be 
set for a major improvement in our relations anderson said 
adding that there are a range of possible us responses on the 
trade front and so forth 
us trade with north korea now is minimal in 1989 the 
government issued export licenses for 84 million worth of goods 
that meet basic human needs the standard set when limited 
exports began in 1988 
anderson cited the may 28 return of five sets of remains at the 
north korean capital of panmunjom and said the united states 
regards that as an indication that north korea wants to improve 
its ties with the united states 
he also noted an agreement between the north and south for a 
meeting of their prime ministers in september and october the 
highestlevel such session since 1945 
these talks may mark a turning point in interkorea 
relations anderson said how the united states responds to north 
korea will depend in part on the quality of that dialogue and any 
subsequent exchanges he said 
anderson said the united states had received no word of 
terrorist acts sponsored by north korea in the past 18 months 
north korea was put on the official us list of terrorist 
countries after the bombing of a south korean airliner in 1987 
adding to pressure for north korea to emerge from its isolation 
is the comparative economic wealth of south korea whose economy 
has been booming for years and a diminution of support from the 
soviet union and eastern european countries anderson said

george carey the bishop of bath and wells and a 
supporter of the ordination of women was named the 103rd 
archbishop of canterbury on wednesday 
carey was a surprise choice to succeed robert runcie as 
spiritual leader of the state church of england and 70 million 
anglicans worldwide including 25 million episcopalians in the 
united states 
to be nominated as the 103rd archbishop of canterbury is a 
sacred trust and i feel dazed and unworthy said carey the 
54yearold son of a hospital porter who has remained close to his 
cockney roots 
because i have a strong sense of history i am keenly aware of 
entering into a rich heritage of faith learning and spirituality 
his appointment was announced by prime minister margaret 
thatcher who chose him from two names submitted by the 16member 
crown appointments commission a churchelected body the other 
name remains a secret 
runcie who must retire by his 70th birthday on oct 2 1991 
has said he will retire at the end of january 
as archbishop carey will be appointed to the privy council 
which advises the queen and become a member of the house of lords 
the unelected upper chamber of parliament 
carey was not on any list of those considered main contenders to 
lead the church but the speed of the announcement which had not 
been expected until fall indicated the nominating commission was 
unanimous 
the 16member commission forwarded the two names to mrs 
thatcher two weeks ago she met carey on monday and decided to 
recommend him government sources said 
an evangelical christian carey is know for his orthodox views 
however he also favors the ordination of women and close relations 
with roman catholics and other protestant churches and is an 
avowed environmentalist 
i want to be a pastoral archbishop he told a news 
conference 
carey holds a doctorate from kings college london he was 
principal of trinity theological college in bristol between 1982 
and 1987 and honorary canon of bristol cathedral before being named 
bishop of bath and wells in 1987 
the two frontrunners for the archbishops post archbishop of 
york john habgood and bishop of liverpool david sheppard are 
liberals and were opposed by the conservative wing of the church 
sheppard called carey a gifted and able man who will serve the 
church and the nation faithfully with strength 
habgood 63 said there is a little human bit in anybody that 
likes the top job but he said that in his heart of hearts he 
thought he was too old for it 
runcie welcomed the imaginative appointment a sentiment 
echoed by the rt rev robert williamson bishop of bradford who 
called it exciting 
carey served in the royal air force as a radio operator before 
being ordained in 1962 he is married has two sons and two 
daughters and in a whos who entry lists his recreation as 
jogging 
he said he would encourage signs of new life and vigor in 
the church and hoped to bring in people like those he grew up with 
in londons east end for them he said all too often the church 
seems lightyears away 
the rt rev michael baughen the bishop of chester said carey 
has the church of england very much in his heart is a man of 
mission is extremely wellgrounded theologically and has a warm 
and delightful personality with a real understanding of life 
but tony benn a leftwing lawmaker from the opposition labor 
party criticized mrs thatchers role in the appointment and 
repeated his call for the separation of church and state in britain 
christianity was introduced into england within 300 years of the 
death of christ probably by roman soldiers then occupying the 
country 
in 597 pope gregory the great sent 40 missionaries to england 
headed by a monk augustine to preach the gospel to the nation 
they landed in kent where augustine was made the first archbishop 
of canterbury that year

former president reagans daughter patti davis 
on wednesday blasted reagan administration policies that she said 
contributed to the killing of more than 20000 dolphins annually 
acknowledging that this figure represented a substantial 
reduction in dolphin deaths associated with us tuna fleet 
fishing davis said she was not inured to hearing the tuna 
industry congratulating themselves on bringing the numbers down 
from over 100000 to 20000 
during the reagan administration implementation of the marine 
mammal protection act was stalled at 20500 dolphins per year 
said davis in testimony before the senate commerce science and 
transportation committee 
thats 20500 too many added davis who was backing a bill 
to require labeling of tuna caught by setting nets on dolphins she 
spoke on behalf of the earth island institute a californiabased 
environmental group 
environmentalists have long sought to protect dolphins from 
being snared in nets cast to catch tuna in the eastern pacific 
ocean where dolphins swim with tuna purse seine nets are 
intentionally dropped below schools of dolphins to capture the tuna 
underneath when a drawstring is pulled to close the net 
davis 37 blamed tuna industry lobbying and the 
antiregulatory stance of the reagan administration for weakened 
regulations concerning dolphin protection techniques 
davis argued that the marine mammal protection act aims at a 
zero rate of dolphin kill by tuna fisherman and that the nation 
should follow the example set by us tuna canners 
in april the three largest us tuna canners companies 
selling starkist bumblebee and chicken of the sea brands said 
they would no longer buy or sell tuna captured along with dolphins 
last month they began labeling such products dolphin safe 
the bill s2044 would require seafood and tuna distributors to 
label their products to disclose whether the contents were caught 
using dolphinsafe methods 
additionally the labeling measure provides for penalties based 
upon volume of canned product and citizen suits against members of 
the tuna industry in the event of intentional or unintentional 
violations 
the bush administration and us fisherman oppose the 
legislation saying it would destroy the us tuna fleet reduce 
tuna stock and do little to help save dolphins

relatives of a man charged with fatally 
plunging his 2yearold stepson headfirst into a toilet testified 
wednesday that he was a good father and may have been coerced into 
confessing 
thomas coes defense in his firstdegree murder and aggravated 
child abuse trial began after more than a week of state testimony 
that he routinely abused stepson bradley mcgee and confessed on 
tape to the boys dunking death 
prosecutors are seeking the electric chair for coe 23 if hes 
convicted 
i dont think its true at all brother jerry coe testified 
i know that he put it on a tape but i also know he was probably 
exhausted and coaxed on by the state and the sheriffs department 
only a day before jurors listened to coe on tape admitting to 
investigators that he was irate out of control and having a bad 
day when he dunked the toddler into the toilet as punishment for 
soiling his pants 
bradley died of head injuries july 28 1989 two months after he 
was ordered returned from state foster care to his mother sheryl 
coe and stepfather coe 
mrs coe 21 has testified for the prosecution that during 
those two months her husband carried out a bizarre pattern of abuse 
against bradley often forcing the child to use his mouth to pick 
feces off the floor and grinding his fist and cayenne pepper into 
the boys genitals 
mrs coe has pleaded no contest to seconddegree murder and 
aggravated child abuse and is serving a 30year prison term 
defense attorneys have acknowledged coe dunked the child into 
the toilet but say he should be convicted of a lesser crime 
because it was merely a onetime form of punishment and there was 
never any intent to harm the child 
coes sisterinlaw melinda testified that coe was kind and 
caring to bradley and his own infant daughter rebecca 
do you think he killed bradley prosecutor john aguero asked 
no i do not she said hes a good father and the way he 
treated bradley in his trailer and the way he treated my son and 
the way he treated his daughter theres no way in hell

after almost a week of hostility spanish and 
cuban officials said wednesday they were intent on finding a 
solution to the forced entry of 18 cubans at the spanish embassy 
as negotiations were proceeding in madrid spains top diplomat 
here told reporters there had been a notable improvement in the 
climate with cuba since some harsh exchanges last week 
embassy charge ignacio ruperes meanwhile said spanish 
authorities are still not sure whether nine of the cubans were 
police agents sent to thwart the asylum bids of the others who had 
arrived earlier 
if they are police or not police i cannot tell you ruperes 
told a small group of reporters outside the embassy reports 
persist that several of the wouldbe asylumseekers are government 
provocateurs 
last week relations between the two governments hit a low point 
spain withdrew its ambassador and suspended a 25 million aid 
program cuba said spain should not have allowed the 18 to remain 
because they were not suffering political persecution 
cuba has called for the voluntary and unconditional 
departure of the cubans at the embassy spain has said it will not 
expel the asylumseekers 
the crisis atmosphere seemed to be receding wednesday cuban 
officials echoed the conciliatory remarks of ruperes and the nine 
cubans suspected of being police agents dropped plans for a hunger 
strike 
and aside from the more civil relationship between havana and 
madrid three cubans who had sought asylum in the swiss embassy 
last weekend left the compound voluntarily wednesday morning their 
subsequent fate was not disclosed 
four cubans remain at the italian ambassadors residence 
the wave of entries at foreign embassies began july 9 after 
thousands of albanians who had sought refuge at foreign embassies 
in tirana were allowed to leave by boat to italy 
since then more than 40 cubans have sought refuge at a variety 
of embassies here according to some estimates perhaps half were 
government saboteurs on a mission to force out bona fide 
asylumseekers 
when the breakins began many analysts recalled the period 10 
years ago when 10000 crowded the peruvian embassy setting in 
motion what became the mariel boatlift over a fivemonth period 
125000 cubans left for florida 
at the time there seemed little possibility that president 
fidel castro would be toppled from power but among some western 
diplomats here there is serious question as to whether castro 
could survive a similar mass exodus now 
he is more isolated than before has far fewer allies because of 
the reforms in the soviet bloc countries and the economic situation 
has weakened marxism is almost universally discredited and food 
shortages among other problems have led to a rise in discontent 
so castro anxious to keep the problem within manageable limits 
has taken steps to discourage additional cubans from seeking asylum 
police have been deployed in large numbers at western embassies 
in addition castro has taken a hard line toward those who have 
entered embassies warning that none will be permitted to leave 
cuba in a way that circumvents normal immigrations procedures 
to some diplomats one possible solution lies in a deal under 
which the cuban asylumseekers would leave the embassies after 
receiving promises from the cuban government that no action will be 
taken against them they then would apply to leave the country 
through normal means 
ruperes suggested both sides are eager for a settlement 
on the spanish side there is serious will and i am almost 
sure there is the same on the cuban side to resolve the problem 
he said

a virgin islands couple testified wednesday 
that they had felt pressure from the fbi to change their stories 
and tell investigators they had seen mayor marion barry use illegal 
drugs on a 1986 boat trip 
albert benjamin and his wife carmen testified that they saw no 
drugs on the trip although benjamin said he did see barry smoke a 
cigarette he also testified he was unfamiliar with the smell of 
marijuana smoke 
benjamin said he became suspicious when passengers on the boat 
made repeated trips below decks but said he could not see what 
they were doing and was not interested in trying to find out 
i had suspicions that there was something out of the ordinary 
going on on that boat benjamin said i saw all of them going 
below decks quite repeatedly 
other witnesses have testified that drugs were used below decks 
and that barry took part in that activity 
barrys defense attorneys called the couple to dispute the 
testimony of a prosecution witness who said the former army 
sergeant and his wife could have seen barry use drugs during the 
trip to the islands 
benjamin said that in several interviews law enforcement 
officers kind of kept driving home the point that i had to know 
i had to see drug use by barry and others on the trip 
i got a little tired and angry mrs benjamin said in 
describing her interrogation at fbi headquarters in washington last 
fall i felt a little pressure 
on another subject concerning the boat trip benjamin told 
jurors at barrys cocaine and perjury trial that he became angry 
when he saw barry make sexual advances to rasheeda moore the woman 
who later figured in barrys january arrest and has been the 
prosecutions star witness 
i was angry because i think adults should conduct themselves 
in an appropriate manner in public my wife was sitting there 
benjamin said i really didnt appreciate what i saw i felt 
that was very out of place 
when asked by assistant us attorney richard roberts whether 
barry had been fondling moore benjamin answered yes and she 
accepted it 
mrs benjamin said she did not see barry and moore together atop 
the boat but said she and her husband discussed it afterward 
he was still quite angry mrs benjamin said 
moore who took part in the videotaped fbi sting operation that 
led to barrys arrest testified earlier in the trial that she and 
the mayor used drugs over 100 times 
charles lewis has testified that he and barry smoked marijuana 
on the boat trip that benjamin testified about 
benjamin said he agreed to go on the boat ride because of his 
long association with lewis family it was a spur of the moment 
thing said benjamin 
earlier wednesday barry attorney r kenneth mundy raised 
questions about fbi involvement with cocaineladen business cards 
alleged to have been found with barrys belongings when the mayor 
was arrested at a washington hotel 
mundy showed the court that mixed in with the cards were two 
business cards of an fbi agent 
frank steele a different fbi agent who seized the mayors 
belongings when he was arrested said he couldnt explain how the 
cards got there but speculated they merely indicated who later 
conducted tests on barrys cards 
mundy also said that steeles own notes from the arrest 
indicated he took possession of barrys belongings at 841 pm 
while the videotape showed steele gathering the business cards at 
856 
steele explained that he took barrys suit jacket at 841 and 
the business cards at an unspecified later time 
tests conducted on the cards have shown traces of cocaine 
numerous government witnesses have testified that the mayor snorted 
powder cocaine by placing the drug on a business card and inhaling 
the drug 
mundy said after court ended for the day that a decision has 
been made on whether or not barry will testify but he declined 
to say if the mayor will take the stand barry is being coached by 
other attorneys in the event that he testifies mundy added 
barrys lawyers also want to attack the prosecutions witnesses 
by introducing medical testimony that cocaine hinders the users 
ability to recall events accurately 
all of the major witnesses against barry testified that they had 
used cocaine 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson said he would rule 
thursday on whether to allow expert testimony on the subject from 
doctors

a black south african businessman held 
without trial for three years for alleged sabotage was freed 
wednesday hours before the government was scheduled to lift a 
25yearold state of emergency 
immigration officials then briefly detained leslie lesia 53 
anew before deporting him to neighboring south africa 
lawyers for lesia said senior immigration officials waited for 
lesia outside chikurubi maximum security prison near harare 
questioned him in downtown harare and then saw he was driven to 
the main airport and put aboard a johannesburgbound flight without 
a passport or travel documents 
he was not allowed to speak with reporters 
lesia was arrested in may 1987 under sweeping emergency powers 
that allowed for indefinite detention without trial 
he was accused of importing a boobytrapped tv set into zimbabwe 
from mozambique earlier in 1987 
the set exploded in a harare apartment killing the wife of an 
official of the south african guerrilla organization the african 
national congress 
lesia accused zimbabwean authorities of torturing him after his 
arrest he said interrogators broke both his legs with ax handles 
he also said zimbabwean agents abducted him in mozambique and 
brought to zimbabwe against his will 
state prosecutors in harare admitted they did not have enough 
evidence to convict him in court but security authorities opposed 
releasing him because of his suspected contacts with south african 
agents 
in announcing last week that the emergency was being lifted 
home affairs minister moven mahachi said lesia was the only 
detainee held in zimbabwe without trial 
mahachi cited reforms in south africa easing of regional 
tensions and political harmony at home as reasons for ending the 
emergency at midnight wednesday 
the white minority government of former rhodesian prime minister 
ian smith introduced the state of emergency in 1965 to crack down 
on black nationalists now in power 
since rhodesia became blackgoverned zimbabwe in 1980 the 
emergency has been renewed every six months by a parliamentary vote

a nasa team investigating the flawed 
mirror that crippled the hubble space telescope started hearings 
wednesday at the plant where the mirror was made amid reports that 
tests showed a problem in 1981 
the sevenmember team led by lew allen director of nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory took testimony in secret wednesday at 
hughesdanbury optical systems inc formerly a division of 
perkinelmer corp 
interviews with employees and a review of data pertaining to the 
hubble mirrors testing and manufacturing were to continue thursday 
thomas arconti spokesman for hughesdanbury said no 
information relating to the investigation would be released while 
the probe was under way 
nasa scientists have said the flaw in the 15 billion telescope 
will cut the hubbles abilities in half and can only be partly 
corrected through a space mission scheduled for 1993 
the hubble has two mirrors a main mirror and a secondary 
mirror nasa scientists have said the problem appeared to be a 
spherical aberration a problem in the shape of the primary mirror 
the hartford courant reported wednesday that scientists may have 
discovered that flaw in may 1981 but dismissed the evidence 
because they believed it was the result of a faulty testing 
apparatus 
one source a retired perkinelmer scientist told the courant 
that the 1981 test showed a possible spherical aberration in the 
main mirror a 94inch structure that nasa had called the smoothest 
large mirror in the world 
but the scientist who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
test results were assumed to be incorrect at the time because they 
contradicted tests done with an instrument thought to be more 
accurate 
its the smoking gun the scientist said 
perkinelmer built the mirrors between 1979 and 1982 hundreds 
of employees put in more than four million hours of work on the 
project 
the company also built part of the telescopes guidance system 
the retired scientist said that despite the 1981 test results 
additional testing did not appear necessary at the time those 
working on the mirror were under pressure to finish because of 
delays and cost overruns he added 
time and money was always a factor at that point in the 
program he said they were rushing to shut us down as fast as 
possible 
the company had originally been awarded a 63 million contract 
but cost overruns left nasa with a total bill of 451 million 
abe offner another retired perkinelmer scientist who designed 
some of the mirrors test equipment told the courant he didnt 
know of the test results and didnt think the tests were the 
problem 
why did they not do something about it offner said tuesday 
i dont know why it was not brought to my attention i would have 
said lets check it out and see what the problem is 
jeffrey clayton nasas deputy program scientist for the hubble 
project told the newspaper tuesday that nasa inspectors in danbury 
at the time probably were aware of the test results 
allen the leader of the nasa probe said im confident we 
have the ability to find the error and the results will be 
embarrassing to someone or some group but in order to get that 
answer we need people to be as candid as possible 
a statement on the teams progress would be issued from 
washington on thursday said nasa spokeswoman sarah keegan 
the perkinelmer division that built the mirrors was purchased 
last year by hughes aircraft co of california

yielding to demands of prodemocracy 
activists president kenneth kaunda announced wednesday he will 
release more than 1000 prisoners and delay a referendum on ending 
oneparty rule 
the opposition had demanded the postponement to allow for voter 
registration prodemocracy campaigners welcomed kaundas 
announcement but said he should go further 
in another step the president said a monthlong overnight 
curfew around the capital lusaka was being lifted immediately 
but he warned that if anyone misbehaves it will be slapped back 
on 
kaunda said the prisoners would be freed by the end of august 
but he gave no exact number for those to be released 
they include a lieutenant arrested after an abortive coup 
attempt last month and the alleged leaders of two other coup 
attempts others to be released are 34 student leaders held since 
five days of violent antigovernment riots in june 
the president said he would put off the oct 17 referendum on 
whether to end oneparty rule to aug 21 1991 
kaunda whose united national independence party has ruled for 
two decades led zambia to independence from british colonial rule 
in 1964 he declared the southern african nation a oneparty state 
in 1973 
in the face of burgeoning political opposition kaunda agreed in 
april to hold a referendum on whether to return this nation of 75 
million to westernstyle multiparty democracy 
prodemocracy reformers have founded an alliance to campaign for 
the referendum but they say the voterregistry rolls must be 
thoroughly updated 
about 26 million people were registered as voters in 1987 but 
the reformers say many of their supporters deliberately refrained 
from registering then because they were disillusioned with kaundas 
government 
arthur wina a former finance minister who is chairman of the 
newlyfounded national interim committee for multiparty democracy 
referendum welcomed the prisoner release but he said all 
political prisoners should be freed 
he also said that although the opposition had wanted a 
postponement of the referendum the 10month delay was too long and 
would encourage fraudulent activities 
at a news conference in lusaka wina also repeated the 
committees demand for the repeal of state of emergency laws giving 
the government sweeping powers of arrest 
in his announcement kaunda said he had no plans to step down 
unless voters demanded it and he criticized proreform activists 
as the maximum forces of hatred 
i will not abdicate my responsibility to this nation because 
of thuggery he said 
the zambian leader has been fighting a wave of unrest but he 
insisted he was not pressured into making the concessions 
what i have announced today does not come from extreme 
weakness but extreme strength morally politically and 
materially kaunda told reporters and rulingparty colleagues at 
his official residence in lsuaka 
antigovernment riots broke out in june after a 120 percent 
increase in the price of cornmeal a staple at least 26 people 
died in the unrest the worst since independence 
the food protests quickly escalated into political opposition to 
kaunda

the government announced wednesday it has 
found another mass grave in the atacama desert where victims of 
chiles former military regime are believed buried 
officials said the latest grave is thought to contain the 
remains of 26 suspected leftists 
belisario velasco undersecretary of the interior ministry said 
the bodies were apparently destroyed with dynamite it was not 
clear why dynamite was used but the victims may have been blown up 
after they were shot to death to make identification more difficult 
the exact number of bodies in the grave has not been determined 
but several skulls and other bones as well as pieces of decomposed 
clothing were found velasco said 
officials on wednesday sent a team of doctors and 
anthropologists to investigate the grave in the desert near calama 
a mining city 960 miles north of santiago 
it was found by relatives of dissidents executed in the region 
shortly after the 1973 military coup that ousted the elected 
marxist government of salvador allende and propelled gen augusto 
pinochet to power 
his 16year authoritarian rule was stained by charges of 
widespread rights abuses while in power pinochet decreed an 
amnesty for all rights abuse that occurred before march 1978 
 
pinochet was succeeded on march 11 by patricio aylwin an 
elected civilian the general remains commanderinchief of the 
army 
military authorities had reported shortly after pinochets coup 
that 26 leftists were sentenced by a special military tribunal and 
executed on oct 23 1973 in calama relatives were notified but 
the bodies were never delivered 
rosa silva president of an association of relatives of the 
victims said wednesday that the group believes the bodies in the 
latest grave may be those of the leftists executed in calama 
however we are not sure and we have to be very careful and 
make an investigation in depth because we must respect the pain 
and the feelings of the relatives she said 
officials announced june 5 that another mass grave had been 
found in the same desert outside the pacific fishing village of 
pisagua 1185 miles north of santiago that grave contained 20 
bodies identified as those of leftists taken prisoner after the 
1973 coup 
it was the third grave found since the country restored 
democratic rule a total of 23 bodies have been unearthed several 
of them have been identified including that of a former communist 
congressman 
however about 700 leftists who disappeared under military rule 
remain missing 
authorities say they are also nvestigating reports of other mass 
graves around the country 
after meeting with army commanders aylwin said on june 21 that 
military chiefs deny knowing where any missing victims of 
antileftist repression may be buried

us military officials said 
wednesday they are returning to the united states with six sets of 
human remains collected by cambodians that are believed to be of 
american mias from the vietnam war 
it marks the first time since the end of the war in 1975 that 
communist cambodia has allowed the repatriation of suspected 
remains of americans missing in action 
a 14member us repatriation team was scheduled to arrive in 
phnom penh early thursday by an air force c141 cargo plane 
a military honors ceremony was planned for thursday at the phnom 
penh airport and immediately afterward the remains will be flown 
to the joint casualty resolution center and the army central 
identification laboratory in hawaii agencies that account for 
americas wartime missing 
since tuesday a six us military experts have been in phnom 
penh to examine sets of remains collected by cambodians in recent 
years the first such mia mission to cambodia since the 1975 
communist takeover 
we came and did our work and the cooperation was everything we 
asked for lt col joe harvey the us team leader told 
reporters after meeting with dith munty first deputy foreign 
minister of the vietnamesebacked government 
eightythree americans are listed as missing in action in 
cambodia from the war a military spokesman earlier said 82 were 
missing in cambodia but later raised the number to 83 the 
confusion apparently concerned an aircraft that crashed near the 
cambodian border leaving a gi missing 
at least eight american civilians are also listed as missing in 
cambodia according to us officials 
on tuesday and wednesday the us team examined 28 sets of 
remains in a tiny laboratory at cambodias only medical college 
the teak caskets contained bones skulls and at least two sets of 
military identification dog tags 
a cambodian foreign ministry spokesman said his government paid 
2000 for the return of some remains from remote provinces 
harvey said six sets of remains warranted further analysis at 
the military laboratories in hawaii to reach a positive 
identification 
four were found in outlying provinces and two were from an area 
southwest of phnom penh known as choeung ek which was used as a 
mass execution ground by the fanatical communist khmer rouge when 
they ruled the country from 1975 to 1978 the khmer rouge were 
ousted after vietnamese forces invaded the country in late 1978 
however it was unclear if the remains found in choeung ek dated 
from the period when the khmer rouge held power 
the us mission broke a long political stalemate between 
washington and successive communist governments in phnom penh over 
the mia issue 
lt col thomas boyd a team spokesman said past us efforts 
to examine remains in cambodia had been either ignored or 
politicized 
he said washington would consider sending another such team to 
examine more remains but added that this was not discussed during 
his groups visit to phnom penh 
the united states does not recognize the phnom penh government 
but a week ago washington announced it was withdrawing recognition 
of the khmer rougedominated guerrilla coalition that is fighting 
the phnom penh government and would open talks with vietnam on 
ending the cambodian civil war 
cambodias deputy interior minister khim ponn head of a newly 
formed mia commission said he wanted to discuss normalization of 
diplomatic relations but the americans limited talks to the issue 
of missing americans 
most of the americans missing in cambodia are airmen whose 
planes were downed during bombing raids from 1969 to 1973 on the ho 
chi minh trail the major supply route for the north vietnamese 
into south vietnam that wound through the mountains of eastern 
cambodia 
a total of 2299 americans are officially listed as missing in 
action in indochina aside from those in cambodia 1678 are 
missing in vietnam 533 in laos and six in chinas coastal waters

iraqi troops will begin pulling back from 
the border with kuwait at dawn thursday prior to direct talks to 
try to solve the two nations dispute over land and oil production 
diplomatic sources said 
the sources based in the persian gulf said wednesday that the 
development was viewed as a victory for the small sultanate of 
kuwait in their propaganda campaign 
kuwait insisted that iraq withdraw what it said were massed 
forces at their common 100mile border before kuwait would sit down 
for negotiations this weekend with baghdad the sources said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the sultanate wanted iraq with more than eight times the 
population of kuwait to move away from its muscleflexing they 
said 
the sources credited intensive mediation by president hosni 
mubarak of egypt and king fahd of saudi arabia on tuesday night for 
lightening the crisis atmosphere mubarak kept in contact with the 
iraqis and kuwaitis into early wednesday they reported 
the announcement of direct iraqikuwaiti talks was made by 
mubarak on wednesday in cairo amid an escalating antiamerican 
campaign in the iraqi media the staterun newspaper said iraq 
would not bow to us pressure in the dispute 
in baghdad iraqi president saddam hussein summoned us 
ambassador april glaspie for talks government radio gave no 
details of the meeting 
in kuwait diplomatic sources said saddam assured mubarak that 
he would not use military force as long as kuwait agreed to the 
following conditions paying compensation for 24 billion in oil 
iraq claims kuwait stole and holding direct talks on a border 
dispute 
the oil allegedly stolen was from the rumaila oil field which 
includes land claimed by both iraq and kuwait 
in addition iraq wants kuwait to write off billions of dollars 
in loans it granted iraq during the iraniraq war and it wants the 
reopening of a border air corridor 
the dispute flared last week when iraq accused kuwait of 
stealing the oil and alleged that kuwait and the united arab 
emirates were causing a slump in oil prices by exceeding their opec 
production quotas 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
pricemonitoring committee began meeting in geneva on wednesday to 
set prices for the rest of the year iraq wants a cut in production 
to force a 7 increase per barrel 
mubarak met with leaders from kuwait and iraq on tuesday he 
told reporters in cairo on wednesday that direct talks would 
probably begin saturday or sunday in jiddah saudi arabia 
two delegations from both sides will sit and discuss the 
problem of course it will take several meetings he said only 
the two delegations with each other he said when asked who would 
sponsor the meeting 
mubarak also said saddam had denied sending troops to the 
kuwaiti border despite reports to the contrary 
what is present there was present before i can tell you there 
is no intention from president saddam to move any troops toward 
kuwait mubarak said when asked when iraqi troops would be 
withdrawn from the border 
diplomats in iraq and persian gulf states said that soon after 
the dispute erupted last week travelers saw battlefield missiles 
armored personnel carriers and tanks prominently displayed along 
the road from iraq to kuwait 
diplomatic sources in bahrain said tuesday that a washington 
post report of 30000 iraqi troops at the border appeared to be 
correct 
in a show of support for kuwait the pentagon announced tuesday 
that us warships and aircraft would hold a shortnotice 
exercise 600 miles to the south in the persian gulf with a second 
small state the united arab emirates 
in apparent reference to this the iraqi newspaper aljumhuriya 
on wednesday accused kuwait of implementing an americanzionist 
plot to show that america is playing the role of protector in the 
gulf 
the paper said kuwait should be aware that those who are 
threatening the interests of the arab nation and conspire against 
it will not be protected by foreigners

eastern airlines and several of its top 
maintenance managers were charged wednesday with conspiring to 
falsify safety and maintenance records to avoid costly flight 
delays and cancellations 
this indictment is about failure to maintain aircraft both 
regular maintenance and parts that are faulty us attorney 
andrew j maloney said in announcing the charges the motivation 
was to get the airplanes into the air an airline only makes money 
with planes in the air 
the federal grand jury indictment is unprecedented in the 
airline industry and adds to easterns woes as it seeks to regain 
passengers build service and reorganize under federal bankruptcy 
protection after a bitter strike 
none of the alleged violations caused accidents or injuries 
authorities said 
the 60count indictment charges conspiracy to defraud the 
government wire fraud falsification of documents and obstruction 
of justice it names the airline and nine highlevel managers 
including edward upton the former vice president of maintenance 
and engineering 
until a few days ago five of the defendants were still employed 
as maintenance supervisors by the airline maloney said a 10th 
employee would be named in a separate document he said 
in a statement the miamibased airline said that during the 
last two years it had taken full corrective action under the 
scrutiny of the federal aviation administration 
today there is no question that eastern is safe eastern has 
its share of problems operating a safe airline is not one of 
them the statement said 
faa administrator james b bussey said the airline now meets the 
agencys safety standards 
we are carefully studying the indictment and if we find 
anything that gives us cause for concern we will take whatever 
action is necessary to protect the traveling public he said 
at a news conference tuesday martin shugrue appointed by a 
federal bankruptcy judge to run the airline said eastern would 
admit fraudulent maintenance and recordkeeping practices but not 
conspiracy 
he termed the purported violations ancient history said the 
problems had been corrected and insisted the airline was safe 
maloney said the violations took place from july 1985 to october 
1989 at kennedy and la guardia airports in new york hartsfield 
international airport in atlanta and eastern headquarters in miami 
the investigation began after an eastern maintenance supervisor 
voluntarily went to maloneys office and told him about alleged 
irregularities 
during the 10month investigation a federal grand jury 
uncovered a pattern of top airline managers ordering that 
maintenance not be performed on aircraft but that records be made 
to falsely show that it was maloney said 
by tampering with log books work cards and computerized 
maintenance records eastern did cause aircraft that were not 
properly maintained or repaired to fly and carry unsuspecting 
passengers the indictment said 
the charges involved critical items including radar landing 
gear automatic pilots and fuel systems maloney said 
upton and other managers pressured supervisors and mechanics 
to sign off on airplanes that had not had their regular maintenance 
or corrective maintenance in order to get the plane in the air or 
perhaps risk their jobs maloney said 
among the irregularities cited by maloney were a failure to 
properly remove accumulated water from fuel tanks the water can 
freeze at high altitudes and clog fuel lines and makes fuel gauges 
read high 
in atlanta he said workers installed defective or untested 
cockpit instruments to make it appear that corrective repairs had 
been made 
if convicted on all counts eastern faces a maximum fine of 30 
million each individual defendant faces up to five years in prison 
and fines up to 250000 for each count 
this case is not about money or fines this case is about 
deterrence and a very important area of public safety maloney 
said this is one of those indictments that is trying to send a 
message to the entire airlines industry 
easterns employees went on strike march 4 1989 and the 
company filed for bankruptcy protection five days later pilots and 
flight attendants quit the strike several months later but the 
mechanics remain on strike 
shugrue said eastern expected to turn a profit in 1991 it is 
projected to lose about 500 million this year after an 852 
million loss in 1989 
maloney said prosecutors had no evidence of improprieties at the 
airline since shugrue assumed control

nasas lastditch effort to fix 
atlantis hydrogen leak on the launch pad failed wednesday forcing 
the troubleplagued agency to postpone the space shuttles flight 
until later this year 
nasa engineers who had hoped to avoid a long launch delay by 
quickly repairing the leak on the pad said the shuttle must be 
returned to the hangar for more work it had been scheduled for a 
secret military mission this month 
shuttle columbia still under repairs because of a different 
sort of hydrogen leak which scrubbed a may launch will be the next 
shuttle to fly it is scheduled for an astronomy mission in early 
september and nasa says it expects the leak to be fixed in time 
the developments came as a space agency team began probing the 
cause of nasas highestprofile problem the flawed mirror on the 
15 billion hubble space telescope 
the sevenmember team led by lew allen director of nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory took testimony in secret wednesday at 
hughesdanbury optical systems inc the maker of the mirror 
the flaw has halved the effectiveness of the telescope which 
was put in orbit on an april shuttle mission 
nasa facing mounting criticism in congress because of the 
string of setbacks got one piece of good news wednesday a 
thricedelayed atlas rocket launch finally went off without a flaw 
the rocket carried a government device designed to study 
electric fields in space and the van allen radiation fields 
its good to have something positive happen said nasa 
spokesman jim cast its a definite boost to nasa morale 
the atlas launch had been delayed three times because of a 
power problem bad weather and a helium leak 
on the shuttle experts had hoped atlantis problem could be 
solved by simple launch pad repairs but the leak reappeared during 
a test wednesday and after analyzing the data engineers concluded 
they still didnt fully understand the problem 
we were not able to fix it we have learned more so we will 
roll back smarter said william lenoir head of nasas space 
flight program 
nasa will try to launch atlantis on its classified pentagon 
flight in november 
the latest leak detected when liquid hydrogen was pumped into 
atlantis external fuel tank was about the size of the leak 
detected in two previous tests and was in the same area a flange 
in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the tank to the main 
engines 
workers tightened bolts around the flange and checked the welds 
even though engineers doubted that would be enough to correct the 
problem 
had the spot been leakfree wednesday nasa would have tried to 
launch atlantis in midaugust and columbia in september 
now officials intend to get columbia ready to move to the launch 
pad in early august said shuttle director robert crippen 
nasa officials want to get at least one shuttle up before 
discoverys october mission with ulysses a satellite that will 
explore the suns poles discovery has a 19day window in which 
it must lift off or the mission will be delayed 13 months that 
would be the next time earth is in proper alignment again with the 
sun and jupiter 
if nasa hadnt tried to fix atlantis at the launch pad we 
would have forever wondered if we could have gotten two off before 
ulysses lenoir said 
the delay in launching atlantis means nasa must bump yet another 
mission into next year the space agency originally had planned 
nine shuttle flights for 1990 but now is down to seven so far 
only three have been flown 
columbia had been due to lift off may 30 with the 150 million 
astro observatory for study of ultraviolet light and xrays emitted 
by stars and other celestial objects columbias leak was detected 
during fueling six hours before liftoff 
the space agency has since replaced columbias leaky plumbing 
with components from the unfinished shuttle endeavour columbias 
leak is believed to be larger than the one plaguing atlantis and in 
a different place 
crippen said its too soon to say how atlantis leaky fuel line 
will be repaired one option is to attach a new external tank 
the discovery of atlantis first leak on june 29 prompted nasa 
to temporarily ground its threeshuttle fleet the leak reappeared 
during a more elaborate test two weeks later 
the hubble telescope isnt expected to fulfill its potential 
until spacewalking astronauts make repairs in 1993 
allen of the jet propulsion laboratory said the hubble probers 
hoped to find what allen called a smoking gun and a fingerprint 
on the trigger 
investigators who expected to stay through thursday also 
planned to examine reams of data pertaining to the manufacturing 
and testing of the mirror and equipment used to test the accuracy 
of the mirror 
nasas proposed space station freedom also is under attack 
studies show the station will require more maintenance than is 
feasible unless major design changes are made

three prodemocracy lawyers but charged four other people with 
plotting its overthrow

lawyers release hailed the decision to free them but they said 
other detainees should also be freed 
president daniel arap moi and other kenyan leaders have been 
struggling to put down a popular prodemocracy movement they argue

rally which led to riots in nairobi and four other cities at 
least 28 people died and scores were injured 
the government gave no reason for freeing the three lawyers 
kenyan law permits detention without charge or trial of individuals 
the government considers a threat to state security 
in new york the africa watch rights group attributed the 
release to international pressure executive director rakiya omaar 
in a statement faxed to the associated press said international 
press coverage has estroyed the myth of kenya as a haven of peace 
and political stability 
the us embassy welcomed the release but it expressed hopes 
that other detainees would also soon be released we hope the 
cases of those remaining in custody can be resolved rapidly said 
an embassy spokesman 
the new charges were against former parliament deputy george 
anyona former university dean ngotho kariuki rural ruling party 
official augustine kathangu and university lecturer edward oyugi

participants had seditious intentions of overthrowing the kenyan 
government by unlawful means

were arrested together at a nairobiarea pub 
still in detention are former cabinet ministers charles rubia 
and kenneth matiba as well as raila odinga a businessman and the

trial failed to appear in court for the second day of proceedings 
wednesday and the judge ordered police to find him 
svetlana birulina lawyer for 64yearold muscovite konstantin 
smirnovostashvili said he had not told her his plans and she did 
not know where he was 
we dont have contact with each other said the lawyer who 
was appointed by the court to represent smirnovostashvili because 
his regular attorney is on vacation 
judge ai muratovs order means smirnovostashvili can be 
brought in forcibly by police she said 
on tuesday the opening day of the trial in moscows city court 
building smirnovostashvili declared his distrust of the entire 
moscow collegium of lawyers to which ms birulina belongs and 
sought her dismissal 
muratov refused his bid but postponed the trial a day because 
he could not maintain order in the crowded courtroom 
on wednesday uniformed police with truncheons limited the 
number of reporters and onlookers allowed into the courtroom 
smirnovostashvili was arrested for allegedly being an organizer 
of a jan 18 protest that broke up a meeting of writers as moscows 
central house of literature and roughed up some participants 
the case was widely publicized here and heightened jewish fears 
of antisemitic attacks 
speaking to reporters in the courtroom tuesday 
smirnovostashvili denied being antisemitic but charged that jews 
hold a disproportionate share of power in the soviet union 
more than 71000 jews left the soviet union last year and 
thousands more are leaving this year jewish leaders cite an 
unprecedented panic among the jewish population in the face of 
threats from extreme russian nationalist groups such as the pamyat 
society 
if found guilty smirnovostashvili could be sentenced to up to 
five years in prison under a new law that toughens punishment for 
insulting people because of their ethnic background or inciting 
ethnic intolerance

federal aviation administration officials said 
wednesday they would closely study the criminal indictment against 
eastern airlines but believe the carrier is now fit to fly 
eastern airlines today meets the faas safety standards for 
operating an airline said faa administrator james b busey after 
a federal prosecutor in new york announced the grand jury charges 
against the airline and several managers alleging a conspiracy to 
falsify maintenance records 
we are carefully studying the indictments issued today and if 
we find anything that gives us concern regarding the current safety 
disposition of eastern we will take whatever action is necessary 
to protect the traveling public busey said 
the faa has the power to suspend a carriers license to operate 
faa spokesman fred farrar said faa officials uncovered some of 
the problems in the first place and turned over the findings to the 
us attorneys office in new york 
the agency last year fined eastern 839000 for some of the 
safety violations cited in the indictment a fine that has not 
been paid because the airline filed for court protection from 
creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws in march 1989 
were waiting in line with all the other creditors said 
farrar 
the faa also revoked the licenses of several mechanics and was 
prepared to shut down the airlines maintenance base at john f 
kennedy airport in new york farrar said after it investigated 
allegations of records falsification but eastern closed the 
installation when confronted with the evidence he said 
the faa intends to continue with the intense surveillance now 
in place at eastern airlines and will continue to cooperate fully 
with the us attorneys ongoing investigation farrar said 
asked if the indictment would affect the way the faa oversees 
maintenance work at other airlines the spokesman said we think 
its pretty good and weve been looking at eastern awfully hard 
ever since the violations were found 
meanwhile the washingtonbased air line pilots association said 
the indictment is further vindication of its stand against texas 
air corp owner frank lorenzo who formerly controlled the airline 
eastern is now run a courtchosen bankruptcy trustee martin 
shugrue 
we take great comfort in knowing that when a panel of ordinary 
citizens finally was presented with just a few of the safety 
violations in a proper legal forum they found sufficient cause to 
act against eastern the pilots union said 
we hope that the irony of this development is not lost on 
those in washington who abdicated their responsibility to protect 
easterns customers the unions statement said 
pilots cited easterns alleged maintenance shortcuts as one 
reason for joining a strike by the machinists union that forced the 
airline into filing for bankruptcy 
the 60count indictment against the airline and nine highlevel 
managers charges conspiracy to defraud the government wire fraud

denounce him speaking in a quiet voice he pledged to strive to 
become first a better man and then a better senator 
the somber judgment marked the 24th time in 201 years that the 
senate disciplined one of its own the vote was 960 and after 
rendering their verdict many senators lined up to shake 
durenbergers hand some embracing him 
durenberger and fellow minnesota republican rudy boschwitz voted 
present 
durenberger was disciplined for violating senate speaking fee 
and gift limits misleading the senate on real estate transactions 
involving his minneapolis condominium and converting a campaign 
contribution to personal use 
sen howell heflin dala chairman of the senate ethics 
committee set the stage for the dramatic vote when he solemnly 
accused durenberger who watched from a frontrow desk of 
violating his public trust 
the evidence of knowing and willful misconduct is clear and 
convincing and far more troubling than sen durenbergers admitted 
negligence lack of wisdom or asserted misplaced reliance on 
others heflin said 
the committee findings will be referred to the federal election 
commission and justice department for further investigation but 
there have been no allegations of criminal wrongdoing 
a tense calm hung over the crowded senate gallery as tourists 
and other passersby listened as senator after senator stood to 
praise durenberger for his legislative accomplishments even as they 
were condemning him for his ethical lapses 
no one in this chamber is approaching this vote lightly 
said sen orrin g hatch rutah the stones of denouncement are 
easier to cast than they are to retrieve 
heflin a former alabama supreme court justice said there was 
convincing evidence that sen durenberger knowingly and willfully 
engaged in a pattern of unethical misconduct which violated 
statutes rules and standards of conduct 
the ethics committee said durenberger should reimburse the 
senate 29050 plus interest for improper reimbursements he 
received while staying in his minneapolis condominium during 
official trips from 198389 
it also said he should pay 93730 less state and federal taxes 
previously paid for speaking fees he improperly kept during 1985 
and 1986 
the fees were for 113 speeches durenberger said were promotions 
for his books on health care and defense issues the committee 
concluded they were normal honoraria speeches subject to senate 
limits 
durenberger whose political fortunes have suffered at home 
told the senate just before heflin spoke that he would not contest 
the committees recommendation and earlier agreed to make 
restitution 
durenberger sat at a desk at the front of the senate chamber 
listening to the proceedings with his hand on his chin 
i ask your forgiveness durenberger told his colleagues 
after the vote for future challenges i need your friendship 
he called the experience a costly education 
as for the future i would ask only that i be judged not 
necessarily by what i say but what i do he said financial 
restitution is only a beginning 
at a news conference after the senate vote durenberger 
reiterated his pledge to become a better senator 
durenberger a 12year senate veteran was elected to fill the 
unexpired term of the late sen hubert humphrey he does not face 
reelection until 1994 
the end of the durenberger case will allow the ethics committee 
to concentrate on pending investigations of six senators including 
five who received donations from savings and loan figure charles 
keating and interceded with regulators on his behalf 
in a case involving another lawmaker the house ethics committee 
has proposed that rep barney frank dmass be reprimanded for 
improperly using his office to help a male prostitute action on 
that recommendation is expected this week 
several republican colleagues said they believed durenbergers 
judgment had been impaired by tragedies problems he discussed 
during a june ethics committee hearing 
the senators first wife died of breast cancer 20 years ago and 
durenberger said he was seeing a marriage counselor because his 
second marriage was in trouble the couple remains married 
he also said he was affected by severe financial problems 
caused in part by educational expenses for his four sons 
the chairman of the senate republican caucus said durenbergers 
committee assignments and other duties would not be affected by the 
senate action the major impact on durenberger is the political 
fallout in minnesota where some newspapers have called on him to 
resign 
seven members of the senate have been censured since the first 
recorded case in 1811 one democratic sen herman e talmadge of 
georgia was denounced in 1979 
fifteen have been expelled the most serious punishment 
the last major ethics case involved new jersey democrat harrison 
a williams jr who resigned in 1982 as his colleagues were about 
to oust him 
in addition to the excess speaking fees the committee found 
that durenberger 
violated senate rules and the ethics in government act when he 
failed to disclose on public forms travel reimbursements he 
received from 43 organizations in 1985 and 1986 
broke the rules by converting a campaign contribution of 5000 
to his personal use 
exceeded a rule limiting the value of gifts to 100 annually 
when he accepted free limousine service during 1985 and 1986 from 
people or groups interested in legislation he used the limousines 
to see his marriage counselor in concord mass 
conceived a partnership arrangement for his condominium solely 
to enable him to claim reimbursement for overnight stays 
structured a purported sale of the condominium to a friends 
company and knowingly participated in back dating the transaction 
to justify claims for reimbursement 
not voting wednesday were republican sens larry pressler of 
south dakota and malcolm wallop of wyoming

no sooner had they slapped him down than his 
colleagues in the senate lined up to shake dave durenbergers hand 
he could have withered and fallen into selfpity and 
bitterness said republican whip alan simpson as the senate voted 
960 wednesday to do what it likes to do least punish one of its 
own 
instead of pitying himself said simpson i have seen my 
friend soften and mature and grow in this terrible process 
the debate was unusually personal several senators referred to 
durenberger by his first name many spoke of his personal problems 
the death of his first wife a troubled remarriage four sons 
undergoing difficult adolescences tremendous financial strains 
what simpson called truly hellish experiences 
yet there was no flinching from the facts that he had violated 
the senates rules by taking money not properly his and trying to 
conceal his transgressions 
thus hugs and praise alternated with descriptions of 
coldblooded wrongdoing as the senate struggled with the paradox of 
the popular minnesota republican 
his judgment was impaired his moral compass improperly 
calibrated when he engaged in questionable condominium and book 
promotion arrangements said sen warren rudman rnh vice 
chairman of the ethics committee that spent months investigating 
him 
i believe him and i sympathize with him 
durenberger 55 sat nearly impassively as his transgressions 
were aired for three hours he heard himself accused of willfully 
evading rules and casting a pall on the institution and in the 
next breath labeled creative decent effective and influential 
when it was all over he said he was a better man and a better 
senator he would work even harder shoulder more responsibility 
i ask your forgiveness he said i need your friendship 
there seemed little doubt he would get both 
everybody who has spoken has made it so clear that they like 
and admire dave durenberger said sen bill armstrong rcolo 
after this is all over and we denounce him we still want him to 
be our friend 
the senate was unusually full with all committee business 
suspended for the proceeding the many who spoke said they did not 
relish their task 
i feel a special sense of discomfort said senate democratic 
leader george mitchell noting he has worked closely with 
durenberger for years on health care and environmental issues 
but rudman added that durenbergers conduct could not be excused 
on that basis and durenberger staring intently at him from across 
the aisle nodded in agreement 
sen orrin hatch rutah said durenberger had approached this 
ordeal with just about as much grace and resolve to reform as i 
have witnessed in anybody in my life 
he said durenbergers predecessor hubert humphrey would be 
hugging dave and i intend to after this ordeal is over he did 
as did simpson others patted durenberger on the shoulder as they 
engaged in long intense handshakes 
some senators said they thought the trauma both durenbergers 
and their own in having to sit in judgment of him would produce 
positive results 
sometimes hard times bring people together said sen david 
pryor dark a member of the ethics panel he said the senate has 
not always been congenial lately but today i sense a sense of 
feeling together a sense of closeness and a sense of brotherhood 
and sen carl levin dmich predicted the stressful events 
would deepen the personal relationships which dave durenberger 
has forged with so many of us he summed up the paradox this way 
as senators we must unflinchingly exercise the judgment which 
is required as a human being i remain a steadfast friend of 
dave durenbergers and an admirer of the legislative work he has 
accomplished

the state department on wednesday accused 
eritrean rebels of recklessly exposing about 2 million of their own 
people to possible starvation by refusing to reopen an ethiopian 
port to relief food 
their behavior is as reckless as it is inexplicable the 
department said in a statement read by deputy spokesman richard 
boucher at the daily press briefing 
on tuesday the united nations abandoned efforts to reopen the 
port of massawa through which it hoped to ferry food for about 4 
million people on monday after four weeks of negotiations the 
eritrean peoples liberation front eplp denied permission to a 
un vessel to enter the harbor to conduct a survey 
this action was taken despite repeated public pronouncements 
by the insurgents that they would welcome and facilitate a 
reopening of the port under un auspices the state department 
said 
the statement said the rebels were endangering the lives of some 
2 million eritreans they claim to represent we hope that the 
eplf will reevaluate its decision to turn back the un vessel and 
restate unambiguously its unconditional willingness to facilitate 
an international effort to reopen massawa for relief shipments 
the ship arrived wednesday in djibouti about 350 miles to the 
southeast at the entrance to the red sea said a un spokesman in 
new york paul mitchell it will remain there for a few days said 
the us agency for international development 
another un spokesman francois giuliani said the suspension 
of the mission means that the faminestricken and waraffected 
population of eritrea will be deprived of essential humanitarian 
assistance vital for their survival 
on capitol hill meanwhile rep tony p hall dohio chairman 
of the house select committee on hunger called the rebels refusal 
a betrayal 
hall said sadly starvation is still being used as a weapon 
in ethiopia the eplf lied not only to us but to their own people 
last spring forces of president haile mengistu mariam blocked 
relief by bombing the red sea port to strike against the insurgents 
who were holding it 
the eritrean rebels seeking independence from ethiopia are 
locked in a civil war with the central government 
in may president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev acting on a pledge by mengistu to stop attacking the 
port agreed to cooperate in helping the hungry in ethiopia

operation push announced wednesday the civil 
rights organization would pressure nike inc and other athletic 
shoe companies to provide more jobs for minorities and women 
push founder jesse jackson says organization officials hope to 
meet in 10 days with representatives of nike of beaverton ore to 
discuss the companys hiring and promotion practices and to prod 
the company to use more advertising agencies and banks owned by 
minorities 
we are the margin of profit for the athletic shoe industry and 
we want our fair share of jobs and investments in banks said 
jackson we seek to meet to redefine our relationship right now 
its unbalanced and unfair 
push director tyrone crider said that from 30 percent to 40 
percent of all basketball shoes sold in the united states are 
bought by blacks 
he said nike was selected as the first shoe company to negotiate 
with because it was the biggest commanding 54 percent of the 
basketball shoe market 
liz dolan spokeswoman for nike said her company is well 
within federal guidelines for minority hiring 
no company has done more to promote positive black role models 
to the public than we have she said the companys ads feature 
filmmaker spike lee basketball star michael jordan football and 
baseball star bo jackson and other black celebrities 
dolan said she had no figures on black representation in the 
company jackson and crider did not say what percentage of 
minorities they thought the company should be hiring 
speaking to reporters at the end of pushs fourday national 
convention in chicago jackson the issue of innercity youths 
killing each other over tennis shoes and other athletic wear would 
not be brought up in the negotiations with the companies 
thats another question he said they are being shot with 
bullets nobody has ever been shot with a gym shoe 
some critics have attacked lee jordan and others for doing the 
shoe ads saying they promote an obsession with the expensive 
products in poor minority communities shoe company manufacturers 
say the innercity is not where most of the shoes are bought 
crider said a letter was sent by fax machine wednesday to philip 
h knight nike founder and chief executive officer asking for a 
meeting and suggesting it take place next week in chicago when the 
athletic shoe industry holds its national trade show 
but dolan said push hasnt contacted us at all 
in the past push people united to service humanity has 
pressed the automobile beverage and fastfood industries to hire 
more minorities 
jackson said push would call for demonstrations and possibly 
boycotts if the athletic shoe industry did not respond to demands 
during negotiations

the vote wednesday to denounce sen dave 
durenberger rminn was one of three levels of punishment 
senators can receive 
the most serious sanction is expulsion 
durenberger received the next highest punishment passage of a 
resolution condemning a senators behavior the senate can write 
such a resolution as it pleases using such words as condemn 
denounce or censure and they all amount to pretty much the 
same thing 
the mildest form of punishment is a letter of criticism sent to 
the senator by the ethics committee such a case does not involve 
action by the full senate

a federal appeals court issued a temporary stay 
late wednesday just 12 hours before condemned killer anthony 
bertolotti was to be executed a federal judge earlier had rejected 
arguments that floridas electric chair is malfunctioning and 
denied his appeal 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta ordered the 
stay until 7 pm friday the threejudge panel which has held up 
the execution of five other florida inmates based on arguments of a 
malfunctioning electric chair said it would hear oral arguments 
friday 
bertolotti had been scheduled to die at 7 am thursday but 
after the stay was issued state officials rescheduled his execution 
for 701 pm friday 
earlier wednesday us district judge g kendall sharp agreed 
with arguments from the state that a special test conducted on the 
chair monday show that at least 2000 volts can be conducted 
through the system and 2000 volts are sufficient to cause 
painless termination of life 
the judge ruled after a oneday hearing on the single issue of 
whether the chair could carry out an execution without causing 
cruel and unusual punishment to the condemned man 
sharp said the chair had operated successfully since the john 
spenkelink execution in 1979 except for the may 4 electrocution of 
jesse tafero 
when tafero was executed flames and smoke were seen rising from 
his head attorneys for other condemned killers have claimed that a 
broken electrode in the headpiece had tortured the inmate to death 
sharp the district court judge agreed with state findings that 
an artificial sponge placed under the head electrode for the first 
time had caused the botched execution of tafero he added that it 
is unlikely that the circumstances of jesse tafero will happen 
again 
michael s morse a biological engineer and teacher at auburn 
university who conducted tests of the chair on monday said there 
was no indication of any flaw in the florida state prison execution 
system 
a videotape of the public test conducted monday was shown in 
court and in it morse says i would say it is safe to conclude 
that the electric chair works as it is supposed to there is no 
question that this system is as lethal as any out there 
but fred leuchter who designs and builds execution systems for 
many states disagreed sharply with morses testimony 
the test was absolutely useless leuchter said 
noting that morse had used a colander and a metal pipe for the 
test leuchter said if the state of florida gets an executee in 
the chair with a colander for a head and metal pipe for a leg they 
would have an execution 
later leuchter said the state of florida is going to produce 
a living vegetable if it is allowed to continue executions 
leuchter and attorneys for other inmates contend that a broken 
electrode caused the problems with the tafero execution and that 
the chair has not been fixed or modified since 
bertolottis death warrant his third is good until monday 
the 38yearold bertolotti was sentenced to death for the fatal 
stabbing of carol ward in her home in orange county in september 
1983 
his execution originally was scheduled for 7 am tuesday but 
he got a 48hour stay from the state supreme court monday afternoon

the labor department said wednesday it could 
find no evidence of a leak of unemployment statistics earlier this 
month 
the departments investigation was triggered by a report that 
about a minute and a half before release of the june figures by its 
bureau of labor statistics on july 6 one trader sold bond futures 
heavily on the chicago board of trade 
we looked into it we have no evidence that there was a 
leak said spokesman bob zachariasiewicz 
the department gives its monthly unemployment data to news 
organizations at 8 am on condition that it not be made public 
until 830 am this practice called an embargo gives reporters a 
chance to digest the material before they must write their stories 
some other departments such as commerce and agriculture 
release sensitive economic statistics to reporters in a locked room 
and then let them out all at the same time a lockup release 
zachariasiewicz said the department receives allegations of 
premature release from time to time and were continuously 
reviewing our procedures but as far as this incident is concerned 
this appears to be the end of it 
he said the department could not even pin down how the report of 
a leak originated but it appears some broker or analyst was 
speculating to explain a market fluctuation 
the department has discussed possible changes in procedures 
with different physical facilities in other words a lockup of 
its own but i dont foresee that well ever have the 
facilities

president bush pleaded with lawmakers 
wednesday to spare the defense budget from cuts even deeper than 
the 18 billion already targeted by the senate armed services 
committee 
bush urged key lawmakers on both congressional armed services 
committees to press ahead with production of the b2 bomber and 
other major new weapons the house is considering halting 
production of radarevading jets which cost more than 800 million 
apiece 
the defense session came as bush administration officials and 
republican congressional leaders agreed to a deficitcutting 
proposal they plan to present to democrats at budget negotiations 
the package consists of slightly more than 50 billion in 
savings split roughly evenly between new taxes and spending cuts 
according to sen bob packwood rore and others it would save 
more than 500 billion over five years relying heavily on cuts in 
benefit programs such as medicare said one participant who asked 
to not be identified 
but it was unclear when the offer would be made 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that at either 
thursdays or fridays meeting both sides will simultaneously 
put proposals on the table for cutting 50 billion from the deficit 
next year and 500 billion over five years 
but democratic budget bargainers disputed that saying no 
decision had been made on exchanging offers 
that is so silly said senate budget committee chairman 
james sasser dtenn 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo told reporters 
the two sides have tentatively agreed to extend from 1993 to 1995 
the grammrudman deadline for balancing the budget 
gephardt said major differences in defense levels is a major 
hangup in reaching an overall budget compromise 
bush and the leaders discussed entitlement programs social 
security medicare and other programs for the poor and elderly 
and both sides are troubled by the magnitude of cuts that might 
be needed in those areas gephardt said 
despite bushs earlier agreement that the government must pull 
in more tax revenues nobody wants to raise taxes its very 
hard to put the final package together the democratic leader 
said 
after the defense session rep les aspin dwis the house 
armed services committee chairman lamented that bush and defense 
secretary dick cheney still have in mind a much bigger defense 
budget than i think is going to come out of this process 
aspin announced monday he favors halting production of the b2 
now that the first 15 bombers in development bush wants to build 
the fleet of 75 
aspins senate counterpart sen sam nunn dga who favors 
continued production said afterwards the b2 has an uphill 
fight if its going to survive 
aspins committee is aimng to cut 24 billion from bushs 
request for 307 billion for the pentagon for fiscal 1991 
fitzwater said bush called the meeting to express concern about 
inordinate cuts 
despite improved relations the soviet union remains the united 
states adversary said fitzwater he quoted bush as saying 
there have been few changes in soviet strategic forces they 
are continuing to modernize their entire force and will enter the 
start negotiations fully modernized 
cheney told the lawmakers that the house cuts would force the 
pentagon to absorb personnel cuts of 250000 in the first year 
cutting back nearly four army divisions and 25 ships 
we think that is unreasonable fitzwater said 
bush said at a strategic air command base in cheyenne wyo 
last friday that he wanted to hold the line at the already 
painful reduction of the defense budget set down by the senate 
armed services committee 
that panel chaired by nunn approved a 289 billion defense 
bill last week that would cut nearly 1 billion from bushs 4 
billion strategic defense initiative request and remove 100000 
troops from active duty including 50000 from europe 
nunn said after the meeting we can save some very substantial 
sums over five years and do it prudently trimming 180 billion 
to 200 billion from defense 
the first year we can save about 20 percent responsibly 
nunn said over five years we can save about 35 percent of that 
total of 500 billion 
but if too much is cut the first year you end up wrecking the 
personnel system and demoralizing not only those who will be 
forced out of the military but those who are left nunn 
warned

government and rebel leaders of el 
salvador struggled to reach agreement on human rights issues on 
wednesday in an overtime session of their peace talks in this costa 
rican capital 
talks began friday and were to end tuesday when the two sides 
got nowhere on the issue of reforming the military however 
negotiators decided to move on to human rights in an attempt to 
make some tangible progress 
the main objective of the talks is to reach a ceasefire in the 
decadelong civil war that has killed 72000 people in the small 
central american country 
oscar santamaria the justice minister and chief of the 
government delegation said both sides are agreeable to un human 
rights monitoring 
the position of the government is that there will be a state 
institution that supervises human rights and that it will be 
monitored by the united nations santamaria told the associated 
press 
however the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front 
wants the human rights commission to be run by the united nations 
our position is that it should be a un mission that oversees 
human rights because if its the governments that will take away 
its effectiveness rebel negotiator schafik handal the senior 
guerrilla commander told the ap 
in el salvador rebels took over a small rural community to 
explain to residents the status of the talks in costa rica 
a man who looked like a peasant with his m16 on his 
shoulder told us that if there are no concrete agreements they 
will launch another offensive on the capital which could be worse 
than the one on nov 11 said jaime tejada a resident of san 
francisco morazan 45 miles north of the capital san salvador 
the guerrillas talked of such an offensive before the 
discussions began to pressure the government to negotiate changes 
in the military 
the november offensive was the largest in the history of the 
war claiming 2000 lives 
this is the third round of talks this year aimed at ending the 
shooting

convicted mass murderer juan corona has 
decided to admit at a parole board hearing that he hacked 25 
migrant workers to death in 1971 his lawyer said wednesday 
he indicated that he is going to be willing to talk about 
it said don condren who will represent corona at his aug 1 
parole hearing at least he was when i spoke with him three weeks 
ago 
corona 56 has spoken a little bit more openly about the crime 
recently condren said in an interview from his home at carmel 
valley south of san francisco he refused to elaborate 
corona a native of mexico and a former farm labor contractor 
was convicted of mass murder in 1973 the remains of 25 people 
many of them immigrants were unearthed from farm land near yuba 
city 120 miles northeast of san francisco most of the bodies 
showed signs of mutilation and torture 
coronas first conviction was overturned in 1982 by an appeals 
court which ruled his defense had been inadequate at his second 
trial that year he was again convicted of murder and sentenced to 
25 years for each count 
mexican consular official jesus rodriguez navarro testified at 
coronas second trial that in 1978 corona had confessed to him 
saying im a sick man and a sick man cannot be judged as the 
rest of them an appeals court later ruled the reported 
confession should not have been accepted as evidence 
corona has never admitted to the killings in a public proceeding 
he has been denied parole twice in 1984 and 1987 officials 
based their last refusal on what the called ongoing mental 
instability and the horrible nature of his crimes 
corona works in the cafeteria at soledad prison and has attended 
weekly meetings of alcoholics anonymous for five years said prison 
spokesman jerry smith but he rarely speaks during the meetings and 
has lost interest in hobbies and reading condren said 
right now i dont think hes doing very much a lot of people 
down there they vegetate condren said 
condren described his client as very very polite and 
someone who no longer is a threat to society 
corona had hoped eventually to go to his mothers farm in 
mexico but she died in april condren said 
now he has no real ambitions no training all he can do is 
agricultural work he feels like thats all he knows

president mikhail gorbachev refused to open a 
dialogue on the disputed kuril islands during a meeting wednesday 
with the speaker of japans parliament tass reported 
the group of islands stretching north from the northern 
japanese island of hokkaido were seized by soviet troops in the 
final days of world war ii and the dispute has kept japan and the 
soviet union from signing a peace treaty to formally end the war 
yoshio sakurauchi speaker of the powerful lower house of 
parliament or diet said at the meeting wednesday in the kremlin 
that it was his duty to raise the issue of the kurils tass 
reported 
gorbachev replied that no one in the soviet union would say it 
holds the territory of other nations according to tass 
all this is confirmed by postwar documents it was a severe 
war for all countries international decisions were made on the 
basis of the postwar realities and we abide by them the official 
news agency quoted him as saying 
i do not want to launch a discussion today on the issue that 
was repeatedly discussed with representatives of japan gorbachev

territorial issue 
sakurauchi who was leading a parliamentary delegation on a

and president bush but the soviet leader reportedly would not 
budge 
bush has been quoted as saying he will continue to support 
japans position in the dispute 
gorbachev told sakurauchi he hoped for constructive dialogue on

six soldiers charged with going awol from 
their intelligence unit for what a friend described as a rendezvous 
with ufos could lose pay and rank under disciplinary terms offered 
wednesday by the army 
the six were reported missing from their units in augsberg west 
germany on july 9 and arrested in gulf breeze fla four days 
later 
they were offered the nonjudicial punishment after an 
investigation failed to find evidence of espionage said major ron 
mazzia a spokesman for fort knox where they were being held 
the soldiers were given three days to consider the proposed 
disciplinary action and could later be discharged mazzia said 
it was still unclear why the six all from the 701st military 
intelligence brigade in augsberg traveled to florida 
stan johnson of bybee tenn said the oldest member of the 
group specialist kenneth g beason 26 told him they had been 
chosen by divine intervention to help prepare for the end of 
the world which was supposed to occur in about eight years from 
now 
they were going to florida to kick off preparations said 
johnson a friend of beasons for several years who picked him up 
at the knoxville tenn airport on arrival from germany 
the real interesting part of this johnson said was that 
when the second coming of christ occurred jesus christ was going 
to arrive in a spaceship 
gulf breeze a beach town near pensacola where beason and others

two weeks of rain helped save some of the 
southeasts parched soybean cotton and peanut crops but farm 
experts warned that without more rain soon disastrous losses are 
still likely 
the national weather service said significant rainfall for the 
region is unlikely in the next two weeks although spotty afternoon 
and evening thundershowers will continue 
six weeks of hot dry weather with temperatures hovering around 
100 degrees destroyed corn in georgia and north carolina and 
threatened peanuts and soybeans throughout the region 
soybeans are vital to farmers in tennessee and about half the 
nations peanuts are grown in alabama and in georgia where they 
are the main crop 
larry snipes of the georgia agricultural statistics service said 
crop conditions are improving after storms over the last two weeks 
raised the months rainfall totals to almost normal 408 inches 
in july officials said parts of the state were 6 inches below 
normal for the year 
were a lot more optimistic now than we were two weeks ago 
said carl cross a statistician for the north carolina department 
of agriculture if we get normal precipitation for the remainder 
of the season we could still have some good crops before the end 
of the season 
in north carolina june rainfall averaged about 3 inches below 
normal south carolina was 2 to 5 inches below and tennessee had 
accumulated a 914inch shortage since jan 1 
the rain came too late for corn the georgia farm bureau said 
100 percent of the states dry land corn crop was lost and 
irrigated production a tiny portion of the crop would be 
reduced because of poor pollination and heat stress 
cross said that in north carolina corn also was in the early 
stages of pollination when hot dry weather arrived causing 
reduced yields and in some areas the loss of the entire crop 
but in tennessee the wet spring may have saved corn from the 
dry summer soggy conditions in april and may delayed the planting 
period meaning corn hadnt reached critical growth stages when the 
dry spell began said usda statistician ron brantner 
had it been on schedule we would have lost some corn yield 
brantner said as it turned out we did get some rains in time 
so the corn crop is looking about normal right now 
much cotton and tobacco survived the baking temperatures with 
tobacco markets recording good opening prices north carolina is 
predicting a record 1 billion crop 
peanuts georgias top crop at 500 million and soybeans were 
helped by the rain but they need more to survive critical blooming 
and pegging stages 
this is a critical state georgia agricultural commissioner 
tommy irvin said when the soil gets so hot the peg comes out of 
the vine and burns off instead of setting in the soil and forming 
the nut 
in south carolina climatologist john purvis said soybeans 
were suffering badly 
hay is in bad shape but the rain has helped prospects for 
second or third crops he added 
alabama crops have fared better than surrounding states said 
joel moore a federal agriculture statistician in montgomery 
although a dry spell earlier this month threatened the states 
corn with recent rain the crop now is classified as 52 percent 
fair 33 percent good and 12 percent excellent

as new hampshires attorney general 
supreme court nominee david souter supported obscenity cases 
against penthouse magazine its local distributor and a pharmacy 
that sold its july 1976 bisextennial issue 
court records show souters office successfully fought an 
attempt by penthouse and other defendants to quash the indictments 
on jurisdictional grounds and also defended a state law that 
included any touching of a persons buttocks in its definition of 
sexual conduct 
the penthouse case was one of dozens the state argued before new 
hampshires supreme court during souters two years as attorney 
general the records reviewed wednesday show that souters office 
supported a tough lawandorder approach and positions on evidence 
rulings favorable to prosecutors 
on another subject wednesday concord hospital said that in 
february 1973 souter was a member of the board of trustees that 
voted to allow the hospital to perform abortions 
the subject of abortion perhaps the most emotional and divisive 
the supreme court addresses each year is expected to figure 
prominently in senators questioning of souter at confirmation 
hearings in september 
concord hospital president richard warner had said tuesday that 
abortion never came before the board when souter was a member and 
later its president 
but on wednesday warner said through a spokeswoman that while 
reviewing minutes of meetings held before he came to the hospital 
in 1975 he came across the minutes of the 1973 meeting 
doctors had requested adoption of the policy statement because 
of the monthold supreme court decision legalizing abortion roe 
vs wade included in the statement and still in effect was a 
stipulation that hospital employees could refuse to assist with 
abortions 
dean williamson who was among the 45 trustees at the time said 
wednesday he recalls only a brief discussion of the issue and said 
he believed it was adopted on a voice vote without dissent 
i dont recall any emotional debate he said williamson 
said he had no recollection of souter speaking on the issue 
another trustee marily wilson also said she could not recall 
souter speaking 
this was a medical procedure vote not a social issues vote 
she said it was not over he rights or wrongs of abortion but 
rather about our responsibility as a medical facility in light of 
the law 
on another issue wednesday the union leader in manchester 
reported that in a 1976 college commencement speech souter then 
state attorney general attacked rigid federal affirmative action 
guidelines as affirmative discrimination and added there are 
some things government cannot do 
as for the penthouse issue the obscenity case was brought by a 
county prosecutor against penthouse international its new 
hampshire distributor and a manchester pharmacy 
penthouse and the pharmacy challenged the indictment on grounds 
the state had no jurisdiction to charge them because their parent 
corporations were not based in new hampshire the distributor 
manchester news mounted a separate challenge on grounds the 
states obscenity law was unconstitutional 
the trial judge rejected those challenges and his rulings were 
appealed to the state supreme court where by law the attorney 
general represents county prosecutors in all appeals 
souter was listed on the state briefs in the high court cases 
he did not personally argue the cases but approved the positions 
taken by his office 
the court refused to throw out charges against manchester news 
but did declare unconstitutional the portion of the state obscenity 
law that included any touching of the genitals pubic areas or 
buttocks of the male or female or the breasts of the female in 
its definition of sexual conduct 
souters office had filed a legal brief supporting that law 
in the end charges were brought to trial only against 
penthouse and the trial ended in a deadlocked jury 
a quick review of the cases souters office argued before the 
new hampshire supreme court turned up none that he argued 
personally but the positions taken by the office were endorsed by 
him and often mirrored approaches he took later as a judge on the 
states superior and supreme court 
among the cases were 
successful opposition by souters office to an appeal of an 
assault conviction by a man who argued that graphic slides showing 
the 16monthold victims injuries were too prejudicial to be 
allowed as evidence 
a successful argument by souters office that a murder 
conviction should not be overturned on grounds prosecutors failed 
to tell the defense the state had promised the key prosecution 
witness a new name after the trial 
successful defense of state laws setting mandatory sentences of 
life without parole in one 1978 case two convicts had challenged 
the laws on grounds that he state legislature lacked the authority 
to pass them and that such penalties amounted to cruel and unusual 
punishment prohibited by the us constitution 
an unsuccessful attempt to bring state charges to trial against 
a man who had been acquitted of federal bank robbery charges after 
two hung juries the high court said the state attempt amounted to 
double jeopardy 
a lost appeal in a case in which two men committed to 
psychiatric facilities after being charged with sex offenses 
challenged judges orders extending their commitments souters 
office argued such findings were sufficient to keep the men in the 
institutions but the court ruled the state needed to prove the men 
posed a danger to society

the coast guard dismissed charges of 
drunkenness and misconduct against exxon valdez skipper joseph 
hazelwood on wednesday but suspended his license as a ships 
master 
at an administrative hearing hazelwood pleaded no contest to 
two allegations stemming from the wreck of the tanker which 
unleashed the nations worst oil spill in alaskas prince william 
sound 
the plea that resulted in a ninemonth license suspension 
covered two allegations that he violated coast guard policy by 
drinking liquor less than four hours before taking command of the 
exxon valdez and that he improperly leaft the vessels bridge 
while it was headed for jagged bligh reef 
the coast guard dismissed a charge that hazelwood was 
intoxicated with a blood alcohol level over 004 percent the 
coast guard standard for operating a vessel also dismissed was a 
charge that he left an improperly licensed third mate in control of 
the ship 
the coast guard proceeding was administrative rather than 
criminal the only penalty that could be imposed involved 
hazelwoods license 
during arguments hazelwoods attorney michael chalos 
disclosed that the defense recently obtained documents indicating 
that the blood alcohol test taken 10 hours after the spill was 
mishandled and unreliable 
we now know that the alcohol test was invalid at best and 
bogus at worst chalos told the judge this man should never 
have been put through this ordeal 
the 987foot tankers hull was ripped open when it plowed into 
the reef the night of march 24 1989 spilling nearly 11 millions 
of alaska crude into prince william sound in the nations worst oil 
spill 
hazelwood of huntington ny was previously acquitted of 
intoxication charges by the alaska jury which also found him 
innocent of recklessness but convicted him on a misdemeanor of 
negligently discharging oil 
he was ordered to pay 50000 restitution and spend 1000 hours 
cleaning beaches at prince william sound he is appealing 
at the time of the accident the exxon valdez was en route from 
the alaskan port of valdez to long beach when it struck the charted 
reef long beach also is headquarters of the 11th coast guard 
district which includes alaska 
at the coast guard hearing administrative law judge harry 
gardner suspended hazelwoods masters license for 12 months but 
reduced that by three months because the license issued in 1966 
has been held by the coast guard since the accident 
gardner told hazelwood it was his duty to remain on the bridge 
of the exxon valdez until it had finished a crossing into prince 
william sound 
it is difficult to understand why you were not on the bridge 
until you executed the turn the judge said im sure you have 
agonized over this during the last 16 months and i agree with your 
counsel that you have been through quite an ordeal hopefully this 
will make you an even better master in the future 
gardner said he concluded the grounding of the exxon valdez was 
the result of human error citing the actions of the third mate and 
the helmsman who were on the bridge when the accident occurred 
they have not been charged with violations 
hazelwood 43 left the coast guard headquarters looking solemn 
he said im just glad this portion is over he was engulfed in 
a crowd of reporters and camera crews as he left 
his attorneys contended the newly found bloodtest documents 
raised doubts that the blood tested was hazelwoods 
the documents showed that the sacramento laboratory which tested 
the blood received three 10millimeter tubes of blood with red 
stoppers 
this report conflicted with testimony in national transportation 
safety board hearings by the coast guard officer who took the 
blood the officer said it was placed in three tubes but only one 
had a red stopper the others were gray 
to complicate matters the defense got the laboratorys own copy 
of the document three days ago and found it had been altered to 
conform to the ntsb hearing testimony 
another hazelwood lawyer thomas russo said graystoppered 
tubes ones held blood with a chemical preservative to prevent it 
from fermenting and producing its own alcohol the redstoppered 
tubes hold blood without the preservative and are used for tests of 
drugs but not alcohol 
its what we said all along and nobody would listen to us 
hazelwood said after the hearing the possible skullduggery that 
goes along with it is enough to make anybody angry 
a receptionist at chemwest analytical laboratories in 
sacramento where the sample was analyzed said wednesday she was 
told to tell reporters her company would have no comment and 
referred all questions to the coast guard 
chalos and and russo said they believed the tardy disclosure of 
the alcohol records constituted misconduct by both the coast guard 
and the national transportation safety board which had access to 
the documents 
chalos and russo said the papers were wrongly withheld from them 
before hazelwoods criminal trial in alaska 
we had no actual physical control of any of the toxicological 
specimens the ntsb said in a statement released wednesday it 
said the two laboratories which tested the blood were certified 
under the us department of health and human services and the 
results provided the ntsb were identified as those of capt 
joseph hazelwood 
at a news conference cmdr chris desmond insisted that the 
coast guard did not drop the alcohol charge against hazelwood 
because of the conflict over blood evidence 
i want you to understand that the coast guard was aboveboard 
in these proceedings he said the agency was not aware of the 
conflicting documents until their agreement with hazelwood had 
already been finalized he said 
but russo followed desmond and said the coast guard position 
regarding capt hazelwood was rather stern until this information 
was disclosed i think the coast guard dropped the intoxication 
charge because they knew they could not prove the intoxication 
charge

district attorney harry connick was acquitted 
wednesday of gambling and racketeering charges arising from his 
return of gambling records to a convicted bookmaker 
actor paul burke former assistant us attorney patrick fanning 
and new orleans businessman wilson abraham also were acquitted of 
all charges 
all three were charged with racketeering by conducting an 
illegal gambling enterprise and aiding and abetting a gambling 
operation burke also was charged with perjury 
the accused bookmaker walton aucoin and two of his employees 
steve bertolino and william condon were convicted on two counts 
each of gambling and racketeering 
connick the father of grammywinning jazz musician harry 
connick jr sat quietly rubbed his teary eyes and folded his hands 
after the verdict was announced several supporters cried as did 
one juror 
i feel fine connick told reporters outside the courthouse 
there were no thoughts going through my mind just feelings 
said burke star of tvs the naked city it was like roman 
candles going offi just thank god we have a court system 
even before the federal jury returned its innocent verdict 
connick confidently filed qualifying papers wednesday for a fall 
election 
im ready to campaign connick said weve been at this a 
long time and im ready for this to be over 
the us district court trial lasted six weeks 
the indictment alleged that connick responded to the urgings of 
burke fanning and abraham and illegally returned seized records to 
aucoin so the admitted bookie could pay off and collect gambling 
debts aucoin bertolino and condon were accused of running an 
illegal gambling operation 
connick maintained that aucoin was entitled to have his gambling 
records returned under state law aucoin said he needed them to pay 
federal income taxes 
prosecutors said those were merely excuses cooked up by fanning 
burke and abraham to help connick justify the return of the records 
the perjury charge against burke stemmed from testimony he gave 
before a grand jury 
james cole of the justice department in washington said the 
timing of the return just five days after aucoin was arrested on 
dec 4 1988 was the key to the case prosecutors said it would 
ordinarily take four to six weeks for the records to be returned 
the indictment was handed up in december after a yearlong 
investigation begun by us attorney john volz 
connick and volz had sparred for years over various issues and 
volz later turned the case over to the justice department to avoid 
any appearance of bias 
however connick always characterized the charges as part of a 
political vendetta which cole denied 
i think the evidence that we had warranted the bringing of the 
case cole said the decision to bring this case was made by 
the public integrity section of the department of justice the 
us attorneys office had no part in the decision of whether or 
not to prosecute this case 
fanning once an assistant to volz was aucoins lawyer at the 
time of the 1988 arrest burke was an acquaintance of connick and 
aucoin as was abraham a contributor to connicks political 
campaigns 
connick 63 has been district attorney since 1974 
the investigation also involved former gov edwin edwards and a 
suburban sheriff harry lee of jefferson parish although neither 
man was indicted 
lee testified in the trial that he once returned gambling 
records to aucoin after an arrest and edwards was widely reported 
to have called lee on aucoins behalf to urge return of those 
records

staff members of the nuclear regulatory 
commission staffers gave the commission inaccurate information in 
declaring that residents near the pilgrim nuclear power plant in 
plymouth mass could be protected in an emergency an investigator 
reported wednesday 
in a scathing 15page report the commissions inspector general 
concluded that the commissions staff said pilgrim was safe to 
operate without looking in detail at evacuation plans the report 
accused staffers of relying on unconfirmed information provided by 
the plant owner boston edison co 
it said the commissions rush to approve the reopening of the 
plant in december 1988 after a threeyear shutdown was a key motive 
behind the sloppy staff work 
the report by inspector general david c williams comes more 
than a year after the commission allowed the formerly troubled 
plant to restart williams said staffers were inaccurate and 
provided information to the commission which was neither balanced 
nor thorough 
the nrc staffs assessment of offsite emergency preparedness 
at pilgrim was neither balanced nor thorough williams wrote 
the staff conducted little firsthand review of offsite emergency 
preparedness at the local level and had minimal contact with local 
officials who had the primary responsibility for developing 
offsite emergency plans and procedures 
instead nrc staff relied on information obtained from the 
boston edison company we believe that in light of becos vested 
interest in restarting pilgrim beco was not the best source for 
the nrc staff to rely on for information on the status of offsite 
emergency preparedness 
the staff disputed williams findings in a written response 
arguing that it met frequently with local officials on emergency 
plans prior to two crucial commission meetings in october and 
december 1988 
in a reply to the reply williams wrote that there were 31 
meetings with local officials but they did not involve a 
meaningful dialogue with local emergency planning officials 
commission chairman kenneth carr issued a terse twosentence 
statement noting that staff members had asked to recommend what 
further actions are necessary and that we will continue to follow 
the matter closely 
as examples of the staffs work williams noted that staff 
members reported that 
they had toured the 10mile radius emergency planning zone 
around pilgrim with a special emphasis on beaches in fact 
only one tour of duxbury beach in duxbury mass and saquish beach 
in plymouth was conducted 
no one remained at saquish beach overnight neglecting to 
mention that there are several hundred homes on the beach some of 
which are occupied around the clock 
the summer population of saquish was less than 700 the nrc 
staff did not recall the source of this population figure 
williams notes and it was only in february 1989 after the plant 
resumed operation that the staff acknowledged that the population 
in summer could reach as high as 5000

the broadway production of the london hit miss 
saigon may be postponed because of complaints the english star a 
caucasian is being brought over to play the role of a eurasian 
producer cameron mackintosh said wednesday that unless actors 
equity the us union drops its opposition to lead actor jonathan 
pryce within two weeks the play would be withdrawn 
the union met tuesday but failed to resolve the issue of whether 
pryce who plays a eurasian brothel owner will be permitted to 
perform in the american version of the musical it will meet again 
but the date for a new meeting has yet to be set 
unless equity changes its position within the next two weeks 
i will have no choice but to withdraw the production mackintosh 
said this is because any interruption in our current production 
schedule would leave us with insufficient time to prepare this huge 
and complicated show for a march 1991 opening 
the earliest miss saigon could be rescheduled is autumn 1992 
because of all of the other professional commitments of our 
creative team mackintosh said 
the controversy arose after a complaint was filed with equity by 
david henry hwang author of m butterfly and bd wong star 
of the same play they were critical of the casting of pryce a 
caucasian in the musical which is set in saigon during the 
vietnam war 
in a letter to equity president colleen dewhurst wong wrote 
there is no doubt in my mind of the irreparable damage to my 
rights as an actor that would be wrought if asian actors are 
kept from bringing their unique dignity to the specifically asian 
roles in miss saigon and therefore to all racially specific roles 
in every future production which will look to the precedent miss 
saigon is about to set as a concrete model 
in london pryce won the olivier award as best actor in a 
musical for his performance in miss saigon he has starred on 
broadway before winning praise for his performances in trevor 
griffiths comedians in 1976 and in dario fos accidental 
death of an anarchist in 1984 
i once again reaffirm our intention to look for eurasian 
replacements and understudies as well as actors to originate the 
role in other companies mackintosh wrote in a letter to alan 
eisenberg an official of actors equity about pryce as our 
worldwide efforts to date have proved unsuccessful i would 
earnestly request that any candidates from among your membership 
who are in the right age group 4045 years old who are high 
baritonestenors with an a flat top and who are of a star 
performance caliber immediately contact vinnie liff of 
johnsonliff amp zerman casting with their credentials 
miss saigon is one of the most eagerly awaited shows of 
199091 broadway season the musical already has a 24 million 
advance the largest in broadway history it will also have the 
highest top ticket price for a broadway musical 100 for selected 
seats in the mezzanine

the philippines strapped for funds 
after last weeks devastating earthquake will appeal to foreign 
creditors to relax their terms officials said wednesday 
the move by the cabinet was an effort to head off a push by some 
lawmakers to freeze payments on the nations 26 billion foreign 
debt in order to finance reconstruction in the wake of the july 16 
quake 
according to the latest figures at least 1653 people were 
killed more than 3000 seriously injured and nearly 90000 people 
left homeless by the quake which measured 77 on the richter 
scale more than 1000 people were listed as missing and feared 
dead 
torrential rains forced the suspension wednesday of flights of 
relief goods to northern luzon island where hundreds were feared 
still trapped by landslides triggered by the quake 
also wednesday the senate approved president corazon aquinos 
request for 500 million in emergency funds for earthquake relief 
and reconstruction the measure already approved by the house of 
representatives is expected to be signed by mrs aquino on 
thursday 
the cabinets decision to appeal for new debtrepayment terms 
came a day after the house of representatives approved a 
nonbinding resolution urging a 2year freeze on payments 
the measure goes to the senate which had been urging a 
unilateral reduction of debt payments even before the quake mrs 
aquino has opposed any such unilateral moves 
finance secretary jesus estanislao said mrs aquino would seek 
to ease terms of payments on a temporary basis and would

death squads hired to rid the 
slums of crime are killing growing numbers of street children 
often with the help of police human rights activists say 
officials who monitor child abuse say hundreds of deprived 
destitute minors are murdered every year in brazil 
police illegally arrest torture and rape street children the 
advocacy group amnesty international said in a report 
death squads generally made up of offduty or retired policemen 
fed up with impotent courts and turnstile justice have operated in 
brazil since the 1960s when they killed known or suspected 
criminals and opponents of the military regime 
human rights advocates are alarmed by the surge in killings of 
young people particularly in sao paulo rio and recife 
the violence has never been this bad said rodrigo sousa 
filho coordinator of the national street childrens movement in 
rio de janeiro state kids are being gunned down without 
question as if they were wild dogs 
grinding poverty family disintegration and police corruption 
contribute to the increasing brutality during brazils worst 
economic crisis 
fourdigit inflation a foreign debt of 114 billion and cuts in 
social spending have left the educational and child welfare systems 
functioning as revolving doors sousa filho said 
a study by the un childrens fund released in march said half 
the 60 million children in brazil suffer abject poverty and about 
12 million fend for themselves on the streets up from 5 million in 
1985 
children as young as 5 are on the street said pedro menezes 
spokesman for the central foundation for infants and adolescents a 
child welfare agency 
poorly equipped lowsecurity juvenile detention centers release 
many children for lack of room and others run away 
street kids become beggars or petty thieves to survive menezes 
said but they soon learn they can triple their parents monthly 
salary by running drugs or joining organized crime groups 
since no one under 18 can be tried in brazil the children 
become useful to crime bosses menezes said teenagers help in 
kidnappings bank robberies and cocaine deals 
store owners pay death squads to wipe out criminals of all ages 
in their areas 
children who are petty thieves are slain for as little as 40 
each but killing a youth who runs drugs or leads a slum gang can 
cost up to 500 a policeman said on condition of anonymity 
racial prejudice also comes into it a study by the brazilian 
institute of social and economic analysis said 82 percent of street 
kids murdered by death squads were black or of mixed race 
if a street kid is white hes seen as cute and is pitied but 
a black child is immediately thought to be a thief a drug runner 
or a gang leader said paulo rios of the brazilian league for the 
defense of human rights 
several studies show violence against minors is spreading across 
this huge nation of 150 million people 
one by the health ministry revealed an increase in killings of 
young people in sao paulo from 280 in 1980 to 1880 in 1989 in 
rio violent deaths of young people rose from 287 in 1983 to 630 in 
1989 
figures compiled by the national movement for street boys and 
girls which counsels abandoned children indicate 333 street kids 
were killed by death squads last year in recife sao paulo and rio 
gilberto dimenstein an investigative reporter from sao paulo 
who interviewed 300 street children in six cities estimates the 
death toll among them in all of brazil is at least one a day 
in his book the war of the children dimenstein says street 
children often are killed for witnessing crimes committed by 
mobsters or police in violent neighborhoods the practice is called 
burning the files 
dimenstein writes of finding a youth slumped on a street corner 
in recife a northeastern city and asking the boy if he is sick 
the response no i took a bullet in my leg the bullet is 
still in there 
why dont you go to the hospital 
i am afraid the police will find me 
police routinely torture street kids for information on crime 
gangs and extort money from them as the price of leaving them 
alone said dr maria alda coordinator of the national movement 
for street boys and girls in sao paulo 
police officials deny the charges 
more minors are committing felonies than ever before said 
lt eide trindade director of rios task force on organized crime 
if they are to engage in crimes such as armed robbery they must 
be treated by the same standards as adults to stop the crime 
there is no other way 
in most cases involving torture or death no one is arrested 
alda said convictions of death squad members are next to 
impossible because witnesses are threatened and sometimes killed 
everyone in these poor areas knows whos pulling the 
trigger alda said but no one not even the kids says 
anything out of sheer terror 
last year state troopers routinely picked up children who 
begged around rios tourist beaches and dumped them in the slums of 
the distant north zone 
liborni siqueira one of only two juvenile court judges in this 
city of 55 million ordered military police in april to round up 
street kids and put them in detention centers 
television news showed scantily clad crying children huddled in 
cramped filthy cells the order was withdrawn because of outcries 
from politicians and human rights groups 
human rights activists denounced several incidents in which 
children as young as 10 were put into overcrowded cells with 
hardened adult criminals 
sousa filho said prison guards routinely beat children with 
clubs burn their sex organs with cigarettes and dunk their heads 
in toilets as punishment 
a 12yearold girl accused of killing a neighbor was locked in a 
dark 5by4foot cell alone and naked for three days without 
food he said and added 
just when i think ive come across the most barbaric case of 
all another one even more disgusting comes along

while hordes of people seek foreign passports 
as insurance before china takes over a japanese businessman 
announces that his latest acquisition is an identification card 
issued to hong kong residents 
kazuo wada got the green walletsized card this spring when he 
and his yaohan international a 16 billion retailing giant moved 
its headquarters from japan to the british crown colony 
the possibility of success for business is far greater than 
the risks wada said in explaining why he moved to hong kong 
during the jittery runup to 1997 when the colony reverts to 
chinese rule 
despite the anxiety of residents about the future wada and many 
other foreigners are betting hong kong will continue to be a good 
place to do business 
i think people generally feel hong kong will remain a going 
concern said john t kamm president of the american chamber of 
commerce for businessmen its paradise 
some aspects of paradise are a corporate tax rate of only 165 
percent one of the worlds most advanced infrastructures a 
central location in asia and a laissezfaire government attitude 
businessmen believe hong kong is the prime base for business 
with china which has promised the territory can keep its 
capitalist system for at least 50 years 
they point to chinas decision to let dissident astrophysicist 
fang lizhi leave the country after a year in the us embassy in 
beijing and to the soaring hong kong stock market 
overseas investors acknowledge that because they are 
foreigners they can bail out if the business climate deteriorates 
hong kong residents who lack the escape route a foreign passport 
provides are much less sanguine 
yaohans splashy arrival underlined the continued strong 
presence of japanese companies in hong kong retailing 
an estimated 40 percent of the colonys department store 
business is controlled by japanese companies which entered the 
market as early as 30 years ago yaohan alone plans to increase its 
number of hong kong stores from three to five by 1991 
japanese banks and financial institutions are establishing local 
branches and individual investors have been buying real estate 
said shigetu suda senior manager at nomura research institute hong 
kong ltd 
for the fiscal year ending in march japanese investment was 
about 19 billion up 142 percent from the previous year despite 
chinas brutal crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in 1989 
according to japanese government figures six years ago annual 
investment was about 400 million 
the other major foreign investor besides china is the united 
states with an estimated total of 6 billion to 7 billion in the 
colony 
citibank is investing at least 150 million in a building that 
will house much of its local operation americans with less capital 
are opening restaurants and other businesses 
although kamm believes the crackdown in china has had little 
effect on foreign investors in hong kong there are indications of 
caution the number of usowned factories has increased only 
slightly and membership in the american chamber of commerce has 
fallen slightly 
more than half the 49 multinational companies responding to a 
survey this year by the consulting firm business international said 
moving their offices out of the colony was a possibility 
rising costs and staff availability were primary concerns but 
uncertainty about 1997 obviously was a consideration business 
international said 
observers say much foreign investment could be withdrawn quickly 
in a crisis and risk analyst robert broadfoot noted that japanese 
investment throughout asia grew much faster last year than it did 
in hong kong 
he dismisses claims that the importance china attaches to the 
huge foreign economic presence is the best guarantee for hong 
kongs 57 million people of a stable and prosperous future 
you cannot have an economic guarantee he said one does 
not exist china is motivated first second and third by political 
considerations 
wada the yaohan chairman remains confident when asked where 
he expected to be in 10 years he flashed a broad infectious smile 
and said because hong kong will belong to china i should say 
hong kong and china

beggars in spain sometimes plead a penny for your soul 
this implies that the giving is for the givers sake it sometimes 
may work that way but it also can be genuine concern for another 
studies have found that kind helpful deeds may be strictly 
selfserving to gain status reassurance or influence but also can 
be utterly altruistic 
these variations also show up among religious believers whose 
faith teaches compassion and helpfulness new behavioral 
experiments find 
the studies are the first using empirical methods to measure 
whether real altruism is specifically there says psychologist c 
daniel batson of the university of kansas one of the researchers 
results from reactions to varied situations found that a certain 
quest orientation in faith a searching kind of faith that 
surmounts doubts seemed genuinely altruistic impelled to serve 
others 
but that selfless motivation didnt show up in two other faith 
orientations 
they are extrinsic religion that is strictly utilitarian to 
improve standing or reinforce ones chosen way and intrinsic 
religion that seeks unity of being and strives to transcend 
selfcenteredness 
from those perspectives it was found that in offering help 
the motivation was not directed to increasing the welfare of the 
person in need but was directed to getting a reward batson said 
that is the help offered had egoistic motives the studies 
conclude while the quest orientation seemed moved by real 
altruism 
batson compared the three ways of being religious with the 
width height and depth dimensions of an object and added in a 
telephone interview some of all three are in everybody 
while previous studies have found that religious believers 
report more charitable actions than others the new study focused 
on individual motivations in simulated life situations 
it was outside the religious context institutionally or the 
helping program of the church batson said adding in reference 
to churches one should not ignore the important 
institutionalizing of help 
a report on the studies appeared in the american psychological 
associations journal of personality and social psychology 
involved in the two experimental studies were 46 psychology 
students at the university of texas in austin and 60 students at 
the university of kansas at lawrence all of christian backgrounds 
they were presented in two different studies with opportunities 
termed real but actually not to take part in a walkathon to 
help a disabled boy get needed treatment or to help a girl whose 
parents had been killed to care for siblings and finish college 
in both situations the types of help and described difficulties 
or capabilities necessary for helping were varied which allowed 
testing degrees of concern varied conditions of peer pressure also 
allowed measuring against that factor 
besides work of batson and associates at at the university of 
kansas two psychologists at the university of texas patrick 
jennings and thomas brown supervised the studies there 
summing up the results the report says that an extrinsic 
means orientation to religion does not increase concern for the 
welfare of others but appeared to be associated with decreased 
prosocial motivation 
indications were that the extrinsic orientation was directed 
toward the egoistic goal of avoiding social or selfpunishment for 
failure to do the right thing 
on the other hand while an intrinsic end orientation to 
religion can at times be associated with increased helping the 
underlying motivation is egoistic the report says 
noting that scores on this orientation were positively related 
to volunteering to help only when likelihood of qualifying was low 
the report adds 
the pattern of results suggested that the prosocial 
motivation associated with an intrinsic end orientation to 
religion was directed toward an egoistic goal either gaining 
social and selfrewards or avoiding social and selfpunishment 
appparently for those scoring high on intrinsic religion the 
thought of helping counted more than the deed it appears the 
highly moral selfimage associated with this way of being religious 
does not reflect selfless concern for the welfare of others 
instead it reflects a more selfcentered desire to obtain 
social or selfrewards for being a good person this desire is a 
different egoistic goal than the punishment avoidance associated 
with extrinsic religion but it is still egoistic 
in contrast the report cites strong and consistent support 
for associating the quest orientation in religion with 
altruistic motivation 
among subjects who volunteered to help this orientation 
correlated positively with performance on the difficult qualifying 
task the report says 
these results suggested that although quest religion was not 
associated with a change in the quantity of prosocial motivation 
it was associated with a change in the quality

in this summer of the dartman and the zodiac 
killer of donald and ivana trump remember that there is a new 
york city the headlines never proclaim the tourists never see the 
movies never mythologize 
the real new york is a home to 75 million not a cartoon 
designed to amuse titillate or horrify it is not the statue of 
liberty the world trade center or times square it is not found on 
broadway or wall street 
the real new york is neither famous nor infamous but a third 
place where life goes on and where the extremes that flash across 
the evening news seem almost as absurd and remote as they do in 
peoria 
most new yorkers are lured or kept here by work which explains 
why they endure its hardships their consolation their new york 
is the citys endless store of hidden surprises jokes and 
treasures 
you see the real new york at dawn on the streets of hells 
kitchen where croatian women returning home after a night of 
cleaning offices in the towers to the east bump into their husbands 
heading off to the day shift 
you see it up in central park where the mist stages impossibly 
romantic vistas for the days first tennis players runners and dog 
walkers 
there are oases like pomander walk a mews of tudor rowhouses 
between west 95th and 96th streets and sniffen court an alley of 
converted coach houses and stables off east 36th that looks like it 
did 70 years ago 
the hispanic society an almost forgotten museum on the 
outskirts of harlem has six el grecos a buddhist temple on staten 
island has the hemispheres largest privately owned collection of 
tibetan art 
in the real new york the catholic workers still feed the poor 
and demented at the settlement houses founded by dorothy day a 
vietnamese immigrant who once huddled at the bottom of a boat in 
the south china sea rises to the head of his class at city college 
the real new york is a little wild whitetailed deer have been 
spotted in the forests of the northern bronx and earlier this year 
a red fox stepped over the line from nassau county into alley pond 
park in queens some people on the southern end of staten island 
still keep horses in their yards theres even a farm the klein 
family spread in eastern queens 
the spindly trees of midtown manhattan have an average life span 
of only seven years but isham park in upper manhattan boasts a 
200yearold gingko tree that stands 90 feet high 
tourists equate the bronx with the yankees and the zoo but at 
one end of the borough is wave hill a hudson river estate that was 
home to mark twain theodore roosevelt and arturo toscanini at the 
other is city island a seaport village where mansard roofs and 
church spires peek over the treetops 
real new yorkers drink the water judged by consumer reports to 
be superior to many bottled brands and slurp coffee from an 
infinite number of blueandwhite cardboard greek design coffee 
cups made in suburban westchester county 
they eat chinese at thousands of szechuan or hunan restaurants 
all with virtually identical menus all with a chicken dish named 
after a mysterious gen tso 
the world knows new yorks infrastructure is crumbling but real 
new yorkers know that the third water tunnel the nations largest 
local public works project is slowly being dug 75 stories beneath 
their feet through rock 2 billion years old 
an equally unsung engineering feat is the 400ton block of 
concrete that slides back and forth on an oily film in the slanted 
attic of the citicorp tower counteracting the winds that try to 
push the building over 
the real new york is full of real characters like the ones who 
gathered outside irving berlins window every year to serenade the 
songwriter on his birthday and the three kids who rode into the 
record book last year by completing a tour of the entire subway 
system in 29 hours 47 minutes and 12 seconds 
eric staller an artist drives a 1967 volkswagen beetle with 
1659 small lights that flash on and off in 25 different patterns 
michael feinstein president of the hatters union drives a cab in 
his off hours to supplement his income 
harry nugent the mellifluous subway conductor on the no 1 
broadway local weaves his station stop announcements into a 
travelogue that entertains the most hardened straphangers going 
our way he asks riders were the one to van cortlandt park 
nugent likes to entertain but even he thinks that a certain 
conductor on the no 6 line an elvis impersonator goes too far 
real new yorkers walk sometimes into the unexpected an old 
friend roommate or lover or the statue of a panther lurking on a 
rock above east drive in central park if they spot a star athlete 
they might wave if its an author or movie star a small knowing 
smile suffices

marshall bitkower a former prosecutor had 
built a lucrative private law practice he had a nice home in the 
san fernando valley he drove a rollsroyce 
and then something happened 
bitkower started borrowing money from client trust funds he 
was arrested and served time for drunken driving in 1982 to avoid 
disbarment he voluntarily resigned from the practice of law 
what happened to bitkower was cocaine his story it appears is 
headed for a happy ending he has been straight for eight years now 
but the state bar of california says there are thousands of 
other lawyers who come to court each day drunk or high and the bar 
which normally keeps its members personal problems private is 
going public with a highprofile campaign to battle substance abuse 
among attorneys 
if youre in a highstress occupation substance abuse is 
greater said state bar president alan rothenberg 
the legal profession is certainly a highstress profession if 
youre doing trial work thats high stress if youre in a 
criminal trial your clients life or death is at stake thats 
about as stressful as anything 
surveys conducted by the state bars in washington and oregon 
indicate 15 percent to 18 percent of lawyers are alcoholics the 
state bar of texas estimates the incidence of substance abuse among 
lawyers may be 20 percent twice as high as that of the general 
population 
the american bar association says 86 percent of state bar 
associations have some sort of program for impaired attorneys 
there are about 100 active programs across the united states 
the aba launched a commission on impaired attorneys in 1988 to 
serve as a clearinghouse and network for programs like texas 
lawyers assistance program which has offered confidential 
counseling since 1982 
the california bar is the nations largest 
if you figure that one out of 10 americans has a substance 
abuse problem and there are 122000 lawyers in the california bar 
then as many as 12000 may have a problem said rothenberg 
even if its only 5 percent thats 6100 lawyers and thats too 
many 
but california with more attorneys than any state and a fair 
share of celebrity multimillionaire lawyers has been slow to 
voluntarily tarnish its public image rothenberg acknowledges that 
going public was a tough decision 
we finally decided we had no choice he said the bigger 
risk was not to do something 
the new program involves referral to treatment programs and 
offers insurance coverage to lawyers for such treatment 
law schools will be urged to include a substance abuse course in 
their curriculums the bars mandatory continuing legal education 
also will require attorneys to take a course on the subject in 
order to keep their licenses to practice law firms will be 
encouraged to address the problem with programs in their own 
offices the bar also has a 24hour hotline for attorneys needing 
referrals to drug and alcohol programs 
meanwhile a task force is gathering statistics on how many 
lawyers actually have drug and alcohol problems 
lawyers who turn to drugs and alcohol usually get into trouble 
with their clients and often face arrest and disciplinary 
proceedings 
we find that in a lot of cases the person suffering from 
substance abuse is not handling business as they should said 
bill davis the bars assistant chief trial counsel who handles 
complaints about attorneys lodged by the public if the substance 
abuse gets worse ultimately theyre stealing clients funds to 
support their habit 
that scenario in fact is what happened to bitkower 
i was under a lot of stress he recalls of the early 1980s 
when his practice was thriving somebody recommended cocaine to 
calm me down and help me deal with the stress and aggravation 
the result was disastrous 
it ruined my life he said it almost killed me i lost 
everything i ended up sleeping on a mattress in hermosa beach and 
hitchhiking from a nice family man in the valley who had it all i 
went to having nothing 
about that time he said i woke up one day and decided i 
either was going to die or get help he checked into a sixweek 
drug treatment program at st johns hospital in santa monica 
where he kicked his cocaine habit 
you can come back after sliding so far down he said 
bitkower 47 has put his marriage and family back together 
works as an administrator at a beverly hills law firm and recently 
was recommended by the california bar for reinstatement as a lawyer 
bitkower joined alcoholics anonymous but he also credited ted 
cohen a family friend who had begun helping lawyers with alcohol 
problems 
cohen himself an attorney and recovering alcoholic introduced 
bitkower to a group called the other bar an offshoot of alcoholics 
anonymous the other bar offers lawyers and judges the help of 
their peers in a safe haven where their problems need not be 
publicized and where others understand it has helped some 4000 
lawyers deal with alcohol and drug addiction cohen said 
most lawyers now seeking help from the other bar are young and 
their addiction is to cocaine cohen said 
with anybody under 40 its drugs he said the young kids 
are not alcoholics 
cohen started the group in 1972 when his own drinking caught up 
with him he was convicted of stealing a small amount of money in 
an insurance scam and ultimately served six months in a prison work 
furlough program fellow aa members visited him and the idea of 
the other bar was born 
cohen who resumed practicing law in 1974 now splits his time 
between legal cases and the other bar he also is a member of the 
aba commission 
you try to give back what was given to you he said

dubious history was made after midnight last 
monday four national latenight talkvariety shows on the air 
on the bright side this may mean such talk shows finally face a 
shortage of famous dull guests 
two of the shows on abc and cbs are new it would be unkind to 
say theyre awful but they are competing in the whose bright idea 
was this contest that network executives in hollywood hold each 
week 
the leading contender cbs the midnight hour made its 
debut a week after the premiere of abcs into the night starring 
rick dees which mainly features an audience that shrieks and 
shrieks and shrieks 
fellow latenighters arsenio hall and david letterman can rest 
easy but they should keep an eye on dees just in case 
his los angelesbased show offering a rock band sofa chairs 
fake palm trees on one side and a new yorklike theater front on 
the other already has interrupted the usual run of famous dull 
guests for two genuinely funny bits 
one on opening night last week put the home audience in a guest 
seat literally the tv camera was put in one of those sofa 
chairs and dees posed it questions and the usual dull responses 
were printed on the tv screen 
the tv cameraaudience wound up mooning the host 
two nights later there was an inspired takeoff of those 
latenight commercials for the memorable music of zamfir and his 
magic pan flute actor leland davis used a balloon in lieu of pan 
flute to play the hit song im a little teacup 
well you had to see it 
but no such inspiration has yet attacked cbs summer series its 
first latenight talk venture since pat sajaks show went to 
nielsens boot hill in march however a bad new talk show needs 
time to settle down and get worse 
despite its midnight title the cbs newcomer is supposed to 
commence at 1245 pm edt on weeknights 
but it made its debut live only in eastern and central time 
zones at 107 am a cbs news special on the supreme court 
nominee david souter caused the delay darn those pesky news 
people 
when it finally began the show was introduced by its executive 
producer michael weisman who was the second executive producer of 
sajaks show as a tv personality weisman is no don kirschner 
were like a warmup for the cbs morning news chattered 
comic joy behar the first hostoftheweek that midnight will 
have during its eightweek summer run as showcase for new talent 
and unusual things 
the series has an unusual set for a los angelesbased show a 
band fake palm trees a fake fireplace a real sofa a real table 
and a real ashtray it even has a failureshaped swimming pool 
behar a brooklyn native who sounds like a kinder gentler joan 
rivers did jokes about new york vs laidback la and the 
incredibly trim fit la women this is unusual for a new york 
comic in los angeles 
dees debut show had charlie sheen plugging his new navy seal 
flick 
but cbs midnight daring to be different had no real star 
as its first guest 
instead it brought in a comic jenny jones who behar 
identified as a former wayne newton backup singer who mainly works 
for womenonly audiences jones said she recently played a gig in 
el toro calif 
a regular feature on the show is an 800 number for callin 
queries from eastern and central time zones unfortunately one 
caller don from tennessee apparently got cut off before he could 
ask anything 
this segment is not working behar said as more phone woe 
occurred 
but she tried again the next night when after her unusual new 
monologue about differences between new york and laidback la 
there came a true megastar guest 
he was identified as writerproducercomic tom arnold who has 
been married for six months to surly sitcom star roseanne barr 
barr was offstage she refused to come on but was televised hiding 
behind a fern 
behar grilled arnold about tabloid reports on his married life 
with barr she cited one story about a fertility test of his sperm 
with a hamster 
after they joshed about that the 800 line was opened to 
inquiring minds one citizen from new york raised the hamster 
matter anew 
the hamster looked like your mom arnold shot back he 
grinned just kidding just kidding 
cbs eventually hopes to compete in latenight television 
according to western diplomats 
 
elsewhere in television 
new reveille coanchor victoria corderi an occasional 
coanchor with charles osgood on the cbs morning news since 
faith daniels went to nbc mornings has been named his permanent 
coanchor she also will take turns with him on the news segments 
of cbs this morning which follows the morning news

willie flynn was a captive audience 
for his general development corp salesman 
while the salesman trumpeted the glories of owning a home in a 
gdc development flynn sat in his wheelchair the legacy of a viet 
cong land mine that cost him the use of his legs in 1965 and killed 
two friends 
they told me in the hospital that i was the lucky one he 
recalls but flynn 46 was not so lucky when it came to making 
florida investments 
hes among some 11000 people who bought general development 
properties between 1983 and 1989 when the miamibased developer 
now in bankruptcy court and fighting for its survival while fending 
off criminal and civil prosecutions was operating what a federal 
indictment describes as a carefully staged fraud 
authorities call it one of the largest frauds in the history of 
florida quite a distinction in a state known for its land scams 
but this was much more sophisticated than the swampland sales of 
the 1950s and 60s they say according to the indictment and 
interviews with federal authorities gdc relied on highpressure 
sales bogus appraisals and control of all aspects of a 
transaction 
prospects were kept from learning the true value of properties 
the indictment says hotel clerks were even paid to screen 
customers calls to prevent them from hearing from gdc competitors 
lot buyers were urged to move up to developed homes and there was 
constant pressure to buy now before the price goes up even more 
after the sale was made authorities say the owners were sent 
glowing statements telling them it was increasing in value 
the company pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy in a march plea 
bargain soon after the indictments were released and it has closed 
many of its sales offices and laid off more than 5500 employees 
but the plea bargain was rejected this month by us district judge 
lenore nesbitt who thought the plea to one count of fraud 
conspiracy was insufficient a new agreement now must be negotiated 
flynn who was living in hillside ill had used disability 
benefits and veterans administration help to build up his savings 
about seven years ago he decided to invest in florida home sites 
with a plan to eventually live there 
he bought gdc lots in port labelle in southwest florida and 
port st lucie on the atlantic coast 
about a year later his gdc salesman called and told him he 
needed to develop one of his lots he couldnt just leave them idle 
while the communities were growing the salesman said 
he was urged to take what the company called a southward ho 
trip customers were flown to their planned communities and 
escorted by a gdc salesman there for three days they were wined 
dined and told to buy 
flynn said his salesman was with him night and day he would 
take me out for food late at night and meet me for coffee in the 
morning 
flynn was persuaded to buy a large home with a swimming pool for 
216000 his illinois attorney told him the price was too high 
and gdc came down to 119000 like most gdc buyers flynn got his 
mortgage from a gdc finance company and he accepted gdcs own 
appraisal of the propertys value 
flynn moved here in 1988 soon afterward he wanted to 
refinance he went to sunbank and was told his property was worth 
92000 
i felt cheated and hurt flynn said 
the general development sales pitches worked flynn said 
because the prices by northern standards seemed reasonable for 
florida homes and he said general development was a big 
wellknown company 
most people felt the government wouldnt let nothing like this 
happen it couldnt happen here flynn said theyre sorry 
people if this is the way theyve got to make their money if they 
did me this way i wonder what they did to other people 
attorneys investigators and homeowner leaders can cite litanies 
of examples of buyers hit worse than flynn people who are trapped 
in homes that have wiped out their savings 
mark binstein a veteran new jerseybased landfraud 
investigator who is banding gdc owners together calls the 
operation a classic ponzi scheme that was unconscionable and 
cruel gdc habitually foreclosed on people after they had learned 
their property was worth far less than they thought he said 
gdc once had a good reputation and had been in business three 
decades harold reecer a cincinnatibased gdc salesman recalls 
the days when the company promoted honesty and letting the property 
sell itself 
but reecer said he was fired for insubordination in the 
mid1970s when he protested departures from that policy new 
managers at general development stepped up the pressure on salesmen 
and told them their first priority was getting buyers signed to 
contracts he said let company lawyers worry about any problems 
he said the managers told him 
gdc salesmen learned to tell outrageous lies reecer said 
one salesman told buyers interested in port labelle that a monorail 
would be built to connect the southwest florida town with orlando 
reecer said 
some people though think buyers should have been more wary 
i have to ask these people where were their damn brains 
said bill duigan of port labelle who worked briefly for gdc in the 
1970s its pretty silly to buy property sight unseen you 
wouldnt buy a car like this 
martin veiner a former college professor who lives in port st 
lucie is trying to organize the 220000 residents of gdcs nine 
florida communities but has found that many people act as if they 
deserve their fate they say nobody put a gun to their heads 
then they say im dumb

veiner was not caught in any fraud he bought his spacious home 
from a bank after gdc foreclosed on its buyer 
still he and all his neighbors are victims of the gdc mess of 
overbuilding and severe infrastructure problems its been said 
port st lucie was platted as if they didnt expect anyone to live 
there veiner said 
the 77squaremile citys population skyrocketed from 15000 in 
1980 to nearly 60000 now the city has only two major roads 
crossing the city and both have only two lanes traffic gridlock is 
a way of life 
port st lucie is a familyoriented community and there isnt 
enough room for necessary schools ballfields and parks 
and the roads gdc promised to develop much remains to be done 
some 230 miles of roads will cost at least 20 million to complete 
in port st lucie 
veiner and other homeowner advocates suspect the bill for road 
improvements will be much higher to the north in palm bay it 
will cost an estimated 73 million to complete roads in gdcs port 
malabar community 
money for much of the work will come out of the homeowners 
pockets port st lucie property taxes will jump from 315 per 
1000 to 405 per thousand utilities for homeowners such as 
flynn have jumped from a little over 20 a month three years ago to 
about 200 a month 
general development has begun negotiations with the cities and 
counties involved offering undeveloped lots in most cases in 
return for settlement of its development obligations gdc also is 
turning over the utilities it operated to the cities and counties 
the company which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization in april after the fraud indictments is struggling 
for survival 
its faced with myriad lawsuits must come up with a 
courtapproved restitution plan and is trying to bring in money to 
keep operating while the delinquency percentage of the more than 
77000 people still owing payments on gdc properties has jumped to 
51 percent 
company spokeswoman nelly medel said general development remains 
confident it can emerge from chapter 11 
we still have our assets we have new management she said 
were trying to put all of this behind us 
veiner and other homeowner advocates doubt general development 
can survive it has more than 100000 creditors the bankruptcy 
hearings feature packed houses of lawyers each vying for a share 
of a shrinking pie 
the company also faces classaction suits on behalf of the home 
and lot buyers their lawyers are going after not only gdc but 
also after banks they say knowingly overinflated mortgage values 
and theyll seek out more targets including possibly gdcs lawyers 
and its directors 
in the short term gdc must satisfy the judge the amount of 
fines and sentence faced by the company former president robert 
ehrling and former chairman david brown who also pleaded guilty 
to conspiracy to defraud will depend on efforts to renegotiate a 
plea agreement 
in addition courtappointed special master thomas wood said 
hes still having trouble getting gdc to agree to a restitution 
plan 
gdc originally offered to pay 100 million over 25 years to the 
homeowners covered in the fraud count but wood has said he wants 
more money sooner 
its just a mess said veiner i dont think were going 
to get full value for what we deserve thats unrealistic i dont 
know how its going to come out i really dont

whatever congress decides on the 1990 farm 
bill cant begin to settle the basic question of whether 
agricultural subsidies should exist at all are they justified or 
simply an expensive ripoff 
farm bills for decades have been complicated vehicles for 
agricultural special interests they are increasingly expensive 
costing 50 billion or more just for commodity supports over a 
fiveyear span 
defenders say such expense is necessary to preserve the heart 
and soul of us agriculture the family farmer and to guarantee 
consumers a fair shake at the supermarket 
some critics say federal farm subsidies are really welfare and 
that the larger producers should be excluded but lawyers michael 
r mcleod and john harris defend the system 
mcleod is a former general counsel for the senate agriculture 
committee and harris was associate general counsel for the 
agriculture department 
to say farmers who participate in farm programs are on welfare 
has as much validity as saying newspapers receiving a subsidy 
through the postal service are on welfare or that homeowners who 
use the mortgage interest deduction are on welfare mcleod and 
harris say in their agricultural law letter 
the two analysts commented on proposals to restrict federal farm 
subsidies to smaller producers and eliminating the payments to big 
farmers 
any farm program that confers benefits on producers of a 
particular commodity is fair game in an urban congress they 
said however it is not fair to try to bring down the entire 
federal farm structure by making it unworkable 
moreover said mcleod and harris legislation to impose 
eligibility tests for farmers comparable to the means tests for 
welfare recipients fails to recognize the broader implications of 
agricultural programs 
consumers they said have had access to an abundant supply of 
reasonably priced food year after year because of a sound and 
stable agricultural economy that at least partially depends on 
these very farm programs 
james bovard of the cato institute an independent public policy 
research organization thinks that argument is a worn piece of 
barnyard debris that should have been tossed aside years ago 
one of the features of farm programs since the early 1930s has 
been the limitation of production through acreage controls soil 
banks quotas price support incentives or other devices 
even so farm production has generally outpaced demands except 
during years when exports have drawn off surpluses and production 
suffered from bad weather 
direct subsidies are paid to farmers who cooperate in the 
various commodity programs other benefits are in the form of 
credit guarantees and technical assistance 
whether direct or indirect bovard says there is no difference 
a subsidy is a subsidy 
the only way to successfully reform farm programs is to 
abolish them bovard said in a recent policy paper we cannot 
compete with either foreign farmers or foreign farm subsidies by 
shutting down american farms 
in bovards view farm productivity has always advanced faster 
than politicians understanding of the problem 
bovard said that in the 1980s taxpayers and consumers shelled 
out 260 billion to support americas farmers farm programs he 
said currently cost around 20 billion a year plus 10 billion in 
higher food prices 
almost all of that cost is a dead loss to the american 
economy he said yet the agriculture department is rewarding 
farmers for idling almost 60 million acres this year the 
equivalent of shutting down all the cropland in california 
colorado kentucky louisiana montana and wisconsin 
there is nothing to show for the outlays except idled acres 
polluted groundwater and richer farmers bovard said 
when usda and farmstate members of congress talk about costs of 
farm programs they usually refer only to the direct cost of price 
support operations bovard said that is often less than half of the 
total government spending on farmers 
for example he said in 1990 the usda expects to spend less 
than 81 billion on price support and deficiency payments to 
farmers 
bovard said the estimate overlooks defaults in export credit 
guarantees bonuses to exporters to subsidize commodity sales 
overseas food for peace farmers home administration operations 
assistance by the soil conservation service crop insurance 
subsidies free advice from the extension service and agricultural 
research 
thus while congressmen talk of farm subsidies amounting to 8 
billion taxpayers are actually liable for over 25 billion in 
spending and loan guarantees he said 
bovard added it is difficult to know exactly how many usda 
loans and loan guarantees will be defaulted on but if the nation 
has learned anything from the savingsandloan crisis it should 
recognize that federal guarantees are often the most expensive 
government programs of all 
a mainstay of bovards argument is that the average fulltime 
farmer is a wealthy individual and doesnt need government help 
bovard said many economists agree a farm should have gross sales 
of more than 100000 a year to be viable those he said are 
fulltime farmers who account for 80 percent to 90 percent of total 
farm income in 1980 there were 271000 farms in the 100000plus 
category by 1988 there were 323000 
some farmaid advocates also count farms in the 
40000to99000 category as fulltime others however say many 
of those are underemployed in much of the year or are inefficient 
the average net worth of us families in 1986 was 78734 per 
household in contrast he said the average fulltime farmer as of 
dec 31 1988 had a net worth of more than 1 million 
some liberals advocate continuing government aid to small 
farmers only but even parttime farmers are far wealthier than the 
average american family bovard said farmers in the 40000 to 
99999 sales class have a net worth of 426487 more than five 
times that of the average american family

dont liken him to donald trump 
bernard tapie is indeed wealthy publicityhungry and 
unashamedly ambitious yes he is eying a run for the presidency 
and has just engineered the biggest deal of an extraordinary career 
by acquiring an 80 percent stake in adidas ag the giant sporting 
goods company 
but trump said tapie in a magazine interview earlier this 
month is everything i loathed most the embodiment of 
cynicism and bad taste the things he puts foremost are those that 
make me the most uneasy 
trumplike or not tapie has developed the highest public 
profile of any businessman in france 
he owns the countrys best soccer team serves in parliament 
has hosted a television show and wrote a book about himself 
titled gagner to win four years ago women surveyed in 
a national poll picked tapie over movie stars and singers as the 
man they would most like to accompany on a vacation 
but tapie 47 says hes not content to make money and live the 
good life he wants adidas to expand nonprofit sports development 
programs in africa he wants the french public to be more 
hospitable to immigrants he wants to command a crusade against 
jeanmarie le pen leader of frances farright nationa front 
its a desire to be different from trump the egodriven new 
york developer who made headlines with personal and financial 
excesses that compelled tapie to take on the mission of stopping 
le pen tapie told paris match magazine 
might he carry this fight all the way to the presidency the 
interviewer asked 
if necessary yes tapie replied if you have a chance to 
take a position of power to affect the course of events why not 
do it 
polls show tapie to be broadly popular across france and he 
finetunes his image by depicting himself as a populist scorned by 
the political and business elite 
he grew up in a bluecollar paris suburb and tried an assortment 
of jobs including pop singer before establishing himself in the 
1970s as one of frances first worldclass takeover specialists 
he refined a technique of buying up bankrupt or failing 
companies at nominal prices improving their efficiency then 
selling them for a quick and often substantial gain 
he has promised he wont repeat this pattern with adidas locked 
in a battle with nike inc of the united states for the title of 
worlds no 1 sporting goods maker 
the 290 million acquisition followed nine months of secret 
negotiations but tapie made sure the news was spread when the 
secrecy ended he announced the purchase in rome on the eve of the 
world cup soccer championship to scores of reporters gathered from 
around the world 
it was one of the biggest purchases ever of a west german firm 
by a frenchman and earned nationalistic praise for tapie even from 
commentators skeptical about his financial base tapie silenced 
some doubters by listing eight major banks as his backers four 
from france two from west germany two from japan 
an adidas subsidiary the swissbased firm isl serves as 
marketing consultant for international soccers governing body and 
tapie has stated openly that he hopes his acquisition will help 
ensure frances selection as host of the 1998 world cup 
although it lost money last year adidas remains one of the 
bestknown brand names in the world with products sold in 160 
countries it has 10000 employees and its sales and licensing 
revenues last year totaled about 28 billion 
it dwarfs the total size of tapies industrial empire in france 
a constantly changing assortment of companies involved in such 
products ranging from weighing machines to health foods 
one of his most prized possessions is olympic marseille a 
soccer team that was foundering before tapie began spending 
millions on worldclass players this year the team reached the 
semifinals of the european cup which determines the continents 
best pro team 
he previously sponsored teams in the tour de france and was the 
executive force behind greg lemond in 1986 when he became the first 
american to win the worlds premier bicycle race 
a yachtsman and pilot tapie describes sports as one of his 
three passions along with business and politics 
in december he took on le pen in a nationally televised debate 
and was a consensus winner a subsequent poll indicated 46 percent 
of french voters would support him for president 
he serves in parliament as an independent but votes with the 
governing socialist party and is believed to be wellliked by 
president francois mitterrand

more than a year after revealing a probe of 
the new york commodities pits federal futures regulators have 
charged four brokers with fraud in handling customer orders 
the commodity futures trading commission accused the four and a 
firm owned by one of them of noncompetitively executing crude oil 
futures trades for customers on the floor of the new york 
mercantile exchange in lower manhattan 
the four all registered with the cftc as floor brokers were 
identified as douglas m friedman of forest hills queens ny 
michael s pomerantz scarsdale ny lawrence a beck fort lee 
nj john j king old bridge nj 
also named in the ninecount administrative complaint disclosed 
tuesday was msp trading inc a firm owned by pomerantz 
pomerantz king and beck were accused of deceiving and 
defrauding customers by taking their orders to buy or sell and then 
taking the opposite position at the customers expense 
allegedly with friedmans help the moves would violate cftc rules 
that require a trader to submit customer orders to the general 
marketplace 
the investigation is continuing said dennis klejna 
director of the cftcs enforcement division he said further 
charges were certainly possible 
pomerantzs lawyer barry mandel and kings lawyer ira lee 
sorkin both in new york said they had not seen the cftc complaint 
and therefore could not comment lawyers for the other defendants 
were not in their offices when called for comment tuesday night 
the investigation came to light in may 1989 when the government 
revealed it was conducting criminal and civil investigations of 
alleged illegal trading at four new york commodities exchanges 
the cftc complaint alleged that the other three used friedman 
who trades primarily for his own account to circumvent cftc rules 
between july and december 1988 
if an administrative law judge rules in favor of the cftc the 
defendants could be subject to penalties ranging from suspension of 
trading privileges to fines up to 100000 per violation 
the investigations are unrelated to a longstanding probe of 
chicagos commodity markets that yielded indictments against 48 
people sixteen have pleaded guilty to lesser charges 
earlier this month a federal jury convicted two swiss franc 
traders at the chicago mercantile exchange of relatively minor 
trading violations and acquitted a third 
the jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious 
charges including a racketeering count against one defendant and 
mail and wire fraud charges against all three 
federal prosecutors have said they plan to refile the remaining 
charges against the men whose sentencings were tentatively 
scheduled for november

futures trading representatives testifying 
before a congressional panel praised socalled circuit breakers for 
stopping mondays plunge in the dow jones average of industrial 
stocks 
one day after the dow fell more than 100 points in 90 minutes 
leaders of the nations largest futures exchanges reported 
favorably to the senate banking committee on safeguards set up 
after the 1987 stock market crash 
yesterday was a very good example of just how well the 
circuitbreaker functions leo melamed chairman of the chicago 
mercantile exchange said tuesday 
the dow drop helped cause a similar decline in the stockindex 
futures market where traders bet on the direction of stock prices 
by buying and selling contracts based on market indexes 
the price tumble tripped circuitbreakers on the chicago 
merc and the chicago board of trade prompting brief trading halts 
that are designed as safeguards against a market crash 
merc officials through an automated conference call stayed in 
touch with the other future exchanges on monday as they have done 
in previous market drops an official said before the hearing 
merc president william j brodsky said officials had several 
conversations with new york stock exchange president richard grasso 
brodsky said the chicago exchanges also were in touch with 
federal regulators at the commodity futures trading commission 
which in turn passed along pertinent information to the securities 
and exchange commission which oversees the stock market 
yesterday was about as normal as you can expect for something 
thats not normal said brodsky 
the circuit breakers were put in place to forestall a collapse 
like that of oct 19 1987 when the dow jones plummeted more than 
500 points 
the dow average of 30 industrial stocks the most widely watched 
measure of the stock markets activity dropped more than 100 
points early monday before regaining about half the loss to close 
down 56 points 
the new york stock exchange has asked its member firms for 
voluntary compliance with a proposed temporary ban on computerized 
selling tactics when the market rises or falls 50 points 
an nyse request for sec approval of the voluntary program 
trading halt proposal during volatile markets is to be taken up by 
the commission in washington on wednesday 
sen donald riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate banking 
committee noted the futures markets can be more attractive to 
traders during a sudden downturn in the market 
he said the circuit breakers appeared to be effective monday 
and added it seems to me that in effect thats also an implicit 
argument that if there were no circuit breakers who knows what kind 
of races we were off to yesterday 
melamed said the circuitbreakers allowed the orders to 
reaccumulate and rethink the situation and in fact stoppped the 
market 
as you know at the nyse the market continued to go down long 
afterward so that it took a while to effect the nyse cash market 
eventually both markets steadied he said 
on the big board trading would be suspended for one hour if the 
dow falls more than 250 points and two hours after another 
150point drop 
the chicago halts call for a 30minute stoppage if the standard 
amp poors 500stock futures contract drops 12 points the equivalent 
of about 96 points in the dow the contract is not allowed to trade 
at a lower price during that time period 
melamed and other futures and agricultural group leaders were in 
washington to oppose legislation that would strip the commodity 
futures trading commission of authority over stock index futures 
and give it to the sec 
the bush administration has favored bills calling for such an 
action which are pending in both the house and senate 
after the hearing sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of 
the banking panels securities subcommittee said there are 
conversations on a compromise ongoing although he declined to 
say which senators were involved 
im not sure its going to bear any fruit ill be candid with 
you about that dodd added he also said that he didnt think the 
issue of stock index futures was dead in this congressional session

keystone camera products corp cannot blame a 
flood of cheap foreign imports for its marketplace woes a us 
trade panel said as it ruled out tariffs and import quotas 
keystone of clifton nj claimed it is the sole remaining 
american manufacturer of conventional 35mm fixed focus and 
pointandshoot cameras and 110 pocket cameras on that basis it 
asked for trade restraints on imports from japan china taiwan 
hong kong mexico south korea thailand and brazil 
imports of cameras were not a substantial cause of injury to 
the domestic camera industry the four members of the us 
international trade commission ruled tuesday 
certainly the quantity of imports as well as the price of the 
imports had negative effects on the operations of keystone wrote 
commisioner david b rohr i am forced to conclude however that 
these effects are dwarfed by other factors which have had much more 
profound negative effects on keystone 
in particular he cited failed marketing strategies and a failed 
videotape venture 
the firm which produced 25 million cameras last year said the 
competition could jeopardize the future of 500 manufacturing and 
distribution jobs in the depressed cliftonpaterson area of new 
jersey 
the company said that imports of the types of cameras it 
produces increased from 11 million in 1985 to 275 million in 1987 
an increase of 150 percent 
its petition excludes imported disc singlelens reflex instant 
print and imported 110 cameras that are not fixed focus 
myron j berman chairman of keystone did not respond to 
repeated phone calls 
berman had said earlier that without import restrictions 
keystone would be forced to move its production facilities 
overseas as other camera makers have done he said the company 
already had cut costs to the bone 
keystone still could seek relief by charging that foreign 
cameras have been dumped in the american marketplace at less than 
fairmarket value said betsy godley a spokesman for the trade 
panel 
keystone received support from one member of new jerseys 
congressional delegation sen bill bradley after it petitioned 
the international trade commission for help on march 29 it 
received an extra boost from house majority leader richard a 
gephardt of missouri and house majority whip william h gray iii of 
pennsylvania 
bradley a democrat and an opponent of protectionist trade 
measures had declined to sign the lawmakers letter he sent his 
own to us trade representative carla hills spokesman michael 
jones had said 
giant camera maker eastman kodak co of rochester ny which 
said it was not being hurt by imports had asked the trade 
commission to uphold free trade and deny relief to keystone 
kodak argued that keystone was responsible for its own market 
troubles it also had disputed keystones claim to be the last bona 
fide american camera maker

car and truck sales fell 13 percent in midjuly 
compared with a strong results last year marking a contrast with 
the gains posted in each of the past two 10day sales periods 
i think what youre seeing in these june and july numbers is 
some buying to take advantage of the incentives before they 
expire said analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors service 
inc of new york 
incentives in midjuly of last year pushed up the sales rate 
this year incentives still are in effect but automakers have been 
trimming them back as their unsold newvehicle inventories shrink 
the 10 major us vehicle manufacturers said they sold cars and 
trucks at a combined average daily rate of 34549 during the july 
1120 period this year compared with a daily average of 39726 
during the same time last year 
car sales fell 133 percent and truck sales dropped 126 percent 
counted separately general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp said their car sales during the period fell 178 
percent while sales of cars made by japanese companies in the 
united states rose 23 percent 
the big three held 845 percent of the car market during the 
period while the transplants had the rest 
auto industry observers are looking closely at the sales rates 
in july after the pace of vehicle sales began picking up in late 
june analysts have said its too soon to tell if the industry is 
beginning a rebound as some of them predicted for the second half 
of 1990 
i think the market is pointed in that direction said herb 
adcox owner of adcox chevrolet in chattanooga tenn everyone 
seems to think that things turned at the last of june and the first 
week of july 
the second week of july it just slowed down i dont know 
why he said 
so far this year the car and truck sales pace was running 36 
percent below last years with car sales down 48 percent and 
truck sales off 16 percent 
during the past two 10day sales periods automakers and 
analysts have been mildly surprised at the strength in the market 
given a generally sluggish economy analysts have said they want to 
see how the sales trend runs over a longer period before 
speculating on what may be driving the market 
there have been some early theories that the glut of new cars 
and trucks bought in the mid1980s are beginning to age and owners 
may be trading them in 
ford said its car sales plunged 246 percent in midjuly this 
year and truck sales fell 104 percent that combined for an 188 
percent decline in vehicle sales in midjuly 
so far this year fords car and truck sales were running 8 
percent behind last years pace 
chryslers north americanmade cars and trucks were selling at a 
rate 172 percent behind last years clip in midjuly as car sales 
dropped 179 percent and truck sales which include the companys 
profitable jeeps and minivans fell 167 percent 
for the year car and truck sales for chrysler were running 134 
percent behind last years rate 
gm said its midjuly vehicle sales were running 133 percent 
behind last year with car sales dropping 134 percent and truck 
sales falling 132 percent for the year gms cars and trucks were 
selling at a rate 36 percent behind last year

opec ministers today sought a way to boost oil 
prices and defuse tensions in the persian gulf where iraq has 
threatened military action against kuwait and the united arab 
emirates for exceeding production quotas 
members declined to discuss iraqs threats in advance of a 
meeting of the cartels eightmember monitoring committee later 
today 
the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries 
formally begins its midyear conference thursday 
kuwaits new oil minister rasheed salem alameeri declined to 
comment on reports that iraq has massed tens of thousands of troops 
on its border with kuwait or on earlier iraqi threats 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh expressed confidence 
the cartel would agree to increase its target price now at 18 a 
barrel to 20 or more 
i am in favor of any price that is higher than what we have 
now indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said upon 
arrival this morning 
asked about the effect of the persian gulf tensions on the 
meeting opec secretarygeneral subroto said tuesday we are an 
economics organization we talk about economics 
saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer said we are here to 
solve oil problems 
even iraqs oil chief issam abdul raheem alchalabi confined 
his public remarks to oil prices he pushed his proposal to lift 
the cartels target price to 25 a barrel by cutting opec 
production 
he refused to discuss the reports of iraqi troop movements 
the troop movements coincide with threats last week by president 
saddam hussein of iraq to take military action against countries 
producing oil in excess of their opecset caps 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have stubbornly refused in 
the past to limit crude output to their quotas a sharp fall in oil 
prices in the spring was largely blamed on too much oil on the 
world market 
saddam claimed iraq badly in need of money to repair damage 
from its 8year war with iran has lost 14 billion in oil revenues 
during the last year because of falling prices 
iraqi officials also accused kuwait of stealing 24 billion 
worth of oil from wells in the border area that they claim are in 
iraqi territory 
word of the iraqi troops sent oil prices higher tuesday the 
september contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark grade 
of us crude rose 6 cents to settle at 2056 a 42gallon barrel 
on the new york mercantile exchange 
chalabi the iraqi minister called for agreement on a higher 
target price 
libyan oil minister fawzi shakshuki also said he would like 
prices to go up to 25 a barrel but he said the cartel would 
have been there now had prices remained at the strong levels 
posted in january 
the average price for seven crudes monitored by the cartel 
reached 2046 in early january but plunged to 1364 a barrel less 
than six months later 
it has since rebounded to 1625 a barrel 
opec accounts for major portion of world oil output and a cartel 
price rise would affect the price at the pump in the united states 
which imports about half the oil it consumes 
two opec price shocks in the 1970s sent the us economy 
reeling but recent opec accords and prices have been 
undermined by members departures from their assigned quotas 
a confidential report prepared by opecs secretariat in vienna 
was understood to say the value of the cartels target price has 
been sharply eroded by inflation and exchange rate fluctuations 
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
market report estimated the cartels target price slipped from 
about 16 a barrel in january to about 11 last month 
to try to pump up prices the ministers were expected to agree 
to a proposal worked out by saudi arabia and other persian gulf 
producers to trim output so total production is limited to about 
225 million barrels a day in the coming months 
nazer said he was confident that opec would strike such a deal 
the opec market report according to the sources estimated the 
groups output at 235 million barrels a day in the apriljune 
quarter of the year 
demand for the cartels oil was estimated to run at 218 million 
barrels a day in the julyseptember quarter climbing to 244 
million barrels in the final three months of last year year said 
the sources 
under the persian gulf proposal kuwait and the uae would 
pledge to hold output to 15 million barrels a day each they have 
each been pumping as much as 2 million barrels a day 
kuwaits quota now stands at 15 million barrels a day and the 
uaes at 11 million barrels 
under the proposed arrangement only uae would see its supply 
target increase the other producers would remain at current levels 
opecs members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the uae and 
venezuela

the decision announced wednesday by britains department of

commission investigation which found that british airways intended 
20 percent stake in sabena wouldnt operate against the public

the sabena deal also calls for klm royal dutch airways to take a 
20 percent stake in the belgian airline which would be 60 
percentowned by the belgian governmentcontrolled parent company 
sabena sa 
british airways and klm were each to pay about 62 million for 
their stakes 
the european commission which safeguards competition in

renegotiated through talks with the ec 
the monopolies and mergers commission found in its investigation 
that british air travelers would benefit from a brusselsbased 
hubandspoke system the airlines want to set up 
the joint venture would increase choices available on 
intercontinental flights the department quoted the commission as 
saying 
the monopolies commission also found that british airways and 
sabena currently the only airlines serving brussels from londons 
heathrow airport would be no more likely than before to raise 
prices on the route under the new agreement pricing on the route 
is governed by britains civil aviation authority 
the monopolies commission also found that the caa would be in a 
position to restrain sabena from gaining any future competitive 
advantage in serving londons other airports from brussels 
the monopolies commissions report made no comment about the 
ecs findings however the department noted that the british 
governments investigation recognized that the greater part of 
the effects of the arrangements lie outside britain

chrysler corp and local and state officials 
announced today an agreement to bring more jeep production and 
possibly hundreds of jobs to toledo 
company spokesman michael glusac said chrysler will move 
production of the wrangler yj from brampton ontario to toledo 
starting jan 1 1993 
the company also said that if it decides to build the new jj 
model it would be produced in toledo by 1993 
in return the city and state will provide an incentive package 
that could total 225 million over the next 10 years 
the agreement meets chryslers needs as well as the needs of 
the city and state for a framework for determining the future of 
jeep in toledo glusac said at a news conference 
market conditions must ultimately govern our decisions about 
what vehicles we make where we make them and in what volume 
however the agreement being announced gives us assurances about 
what chrysler can expect in the years ahead he said 
the company already makes the jeep cherokee and grand wagoneer 
in toledo 
mayor john mchugh said he would ask the city council to grant 
chrysler a 10year tax abatement on personal property taxes on an 
estimated 75 million worth of equipment the company expects to 
install at its two toledo plants the equipment would be for 
production of both vehicles 
the city agreed to provide up to 500000 a year for seven years 
starting in 1991 for improvements to the plants 
the state agreed to provide up to 5 million for retraining 
workers 
this is a major triumph for business labor and government in 
northwest ohio gov richard celeste said in a true 
partnership we have worked to extend chryslers commitment to 
produce the cherokee at the toledo jeep facilities and returning 
the production of the wrangler to toledo will reassure that 
chrysler jeep will continue to play an important economic role in 
the community 
the agreement is the final piece of a package that was needed to 
move jeep wrangler production to toledo from brampton and keep the 
two local plants operating beyond 1992 the two plants currently 
employ 5300 people 
the first part was reached last month when chrysler reached a 
sevenyear contract with united auto workers local 12 the contract 
contained a number of work rule changes to make the plants more 
efficient 
however chrysler said it would not move wrangler production to 
the city until an agreement was reached on an incentive package 
in april several toledo area officials including us rep 
marcy kaptur and mayor john mchugh said chrysler would move the 
wrangler and build a new jeep line in toledo which would create 
between 1200 and 1600 jobs 
while chrysler officials told local 12 the wrangler would be 
coming to toledo the company said it was reevaluating plans to 
build the jj model a small sportutility vehicle made in a 
joint venture with the french automaker renault 
chrysler also told the union that in all likelihood no new 
jobs would be created the transfer of wrangler to toledo would 
offset the projected decline in sales of the jeep cherokees and 
grand wagoneers 
however union officials said despite chryslers projections 
they felt wrangler production would create 1200 jobs in toledo

congress is moving steadily toward passing a 
fiveyear farm bill that generally maintains current law and 
preserves most of the governments farm support systems including 
the hotly debated sugar program 
during a marathon session that began tuesday morning and lasted 
until nearly midnight the senate defeated one challenge after 
another to the bill worked out by its agriculture committee 
the price support system protecting honey producers is the only 
program that has been eliminated so far opponents of the peanut 
program were mounting their offensive today 
the house also was protecting the work of its committee as it 
defeated efforts to change the dairy and sugar programs 
opponents of the present sugar program wanted to change the 
support price from 18 cents a pound to 16 cents a proposal also 
supported by the bush administration 
that reduction would have brought the support for sugar more in 
line with other government farm programs easing the struggle 
between midwestern grain farmers and the betterrewarded sugar beet 
producers threatening to buy them out amendment supporters said 
wheat farmers and barley farmers support the sugar program 
sen bill bradley dnj said sarcastically they would like to 
have one like it 
rep thomas downey dny called sugar producers the most 
pampered farmers in america and the most profitable 
bradley also said the quota system used to control the amount of 
foreign sugar sold in the united states hurts poor latin american 
countries receiving foreign aid 
he said some of those countries are trying to find alternatives 
to coca the raw material for cocaine and would benefit from more 
open markets in the united states 
the coca price is below the breakeven point said bradley 
this is an opportunity for us to begin to wean some of these 
countries from coca production into other crops particularly 
sugar 
supporters said the program was needed to preserve american jobs 
and provide price stability they said that even if the support 
price were reduced consumers would not see any difference in the 
price of products containing sugar 
to say this can be passed on to the american housewife is the 
wildest speculation said rep arlan stangeland rminn all 
this will do is put more money in the hands of the manufacturer who 
is using sugar 
an amendment by sen tom daschle dsd to increase target 
prices on wheat and feed grains for smaller producers lost 7224 
daschle said it was needed to keep 500000 family farms from 
going out of business during the fiveyear life of the bill it 
would have put target prices on a twotier system in an effort to 
get more money for small and mediumsized farms without going over 
budget 
for example instead of freezing the target price on wheat at 4 
a bushel as called for in the bill daschle would have farmers 
receiving 410 a bushel for the first 12500 bushels of wheat and 
340 for every subsequent bushel 
similar adjustments would be made for corn oats sorghum and 
barley which also are frozen at current levels in the bill 
opponents of the amendment including agriculture committee 
chairman patrick leahy dvt said it would destroy the compromise 
worked out by the panel possibly preventing passage of the whole 
bill 
in other action the senate 
approved an amendment that prevents fruits vegetables 
potatoes and edible beans from being grown on acreage that is 
covered by the flexibility provisions of the bills subsidy program 
defeated a plan to allow foreign vessels to be used if no 
usflagged vessels are available for food aid shipments to 
foreign countries 
the house meanwhile 
defeated an amendment that would have allowed the agriculture 
department to reduce the milk price support level if surpluses 
exceeded 5 billion pounds in any year 
approved a provision to prevent states from imposing any 
surcharge for milk processing greater than the federal governments 
voted to allow grazing on land that is set aside under the 
cotton acreage reduction program 
approved disaster payments to cotton producers who are 
prevented from planting because of indian water rights disputes

for making french fries some analysts said

sunday has never been a day of leisure 
at the international paper mill that dominates this historic 
adirondack mountain village 
the workers liked it that way because they got paid double time 
but the paper company embroiled in a bitter labor dispute with the 
union representing nearly 700 of the mills 850 employees recently 
decreed it will only pay straight time for sunday work 
the workers are entering their third year without a contract 
the united paperworkers international union says there is nothing 
it can do to reverse the companys decision to eliminate premium 
pay without a contract in place 
the company says it needs wage and benefit concessions from 
workers to stay competitive the company has already eliminated 
timeandahalf pay for holidays 
ive negotiated a lot of contracts over the years and ive 
never seen the company negotiate in the style it does now and its 
style is take it or leave it said robert blaise jr a past 
president and current recording secretary of upiu local 497 
negotiations have deadlocked morale the union claims has 
slumped 
its deteriorated to the point where no one gives a damn 
blaise said 
dan fitzgerald a truck driver at the mill said its 
rockbottom its like stalag 13 
its difficult for everybody in a period like this but we 
continue doing our jobs and are committed to creating a good 
product in a safe environment said dale n sutherland an 
international paper spokesman 
company officials union leaders and village authorities differ 
over what effect the contract dispute has had on the community but 
all agree that international paper means a great deal to 
ticonderoga 
id shudder at the thought if international paper ever had 
massive layoffs said kitty j garrand executive director of the 
ticonderoga area chamber of commerce 
without ip you might as well lock your doors said a sales 
clerk in a retail clothing shop on montcalm street ticonderogas 
main drag 
international paper has been ticonderogas chief employer since 
1925 it is also one of the worlds largest paper manufacturers 
with 67000 employees worldwide 55000 of them in the united 
states 
the ticonderoga mill pumps millions of dollars into the local 
economy including 22 million a year in wages for its 655 hourly 
employees sutherland said 
ticonderogans are sensitive to anything concerning the company 
they watched uncomfortably as nearly 2100 upiu members lost their 
jobs to replacement workers in a 16month strike at ip mills in 
jay maine de pere wis and lock haven pa between 1800 and 
1900 of them remain out of work said gordon brehm spokesman for 
the upiu in nashville tenn 
worries that replacement workers would be used locally peaked 
last winter when more than 1000 nonunion workers arrived to fill 
temporary maintenance and construction jobs at the mill during its 
annual shutdown 
the nonunion workers were employed by beampk construction co a 
birmingham ala contractor that supplied international paper with 
replacement workers during the strike 
using beampk workers in ticonderoga was a humiliation for the 
union 
we dont believe in the credo of using nonunion help and we 
dont believe they should be working in this mill said blaise 
beampk workers rented every available apartment and motel room in 
ticonderoga and surrounding towns pumping money into an area 
desperate for extra dollars when the summer tourist season ends 
but the workers dubbed beakers by the upiu were blamed for 
what passes for a crime wave in this rural community near the 
vermont line 
two beampk employees were accused of sexually assaulting a female 
coworker while another was charged with stabbing to death his 
roommate also a beampk worker in the nearby town of schroon it was 
the first murder there since the early 1950s police said 
at the union hall a door is decorated with a mock wanted poster 
depicting a rat in a police lineup with the words beampk worker 
underneath the last of the beampk workers left the area in late 
april and its business as usual around the community garrand 
said 
contention is nothing new in ticonderoga 
located on the southern reaches of lake champlain and the 
northern shore of lake george ticonderogas name comes from the 
iroquois cheonderoga or the place between two lakes 
it became a strategic portage for generations of marauding 
indians and later french british and american explorers and 
soldiers who fought for control of fort ticonderoga a 235yearold 
stone fortress outside the village 
the union which last struck international paper locally in the 
early 1970s to protest allegedly unsafe working conditions said 
there is no justification for cutting pay or seeking wage 
concessions since the company is so profitable in 1989 
international paper reported record earnings of 864 million 
the company contends the paper industry is in a down trend and 
the pay concessions are necessary if the company wants to stay 
competitive in the world market 
of international papers 22 major paper manufacturing mills 
four are operating without union contracts the company negotiates 
each mills contract separately so if some are halted by strikes 
others keep running 
when youve got 30 40 50 mills with no contracts you 
might have more bargaining power said james w de zalia 
president of local 497 
union officials in ticonderoga say profits have come at their 
expense although mill wages are far above the average for the 
region ticonderoga mill workers average about 1350 per hour and 
the average annual pay for hourly employees is approximately 
35000 
but de zalia said the workers hardly have an easy life 
we work sevendays stretches holidays sundays de zalia 
said you work around chemicals and all the hazards of factory 
work he said 
last january union members voted 453 to 67 to reject the latest 
company offer no negotiations have been held since the company 
refuses to discuss specifics of the contract dispute 
the cuts in premium pay and an increase in health insurance 
deductions have cost workers thousands of dollars a year de zalia 
said that translates into fewer dollars spent at local businesses 
he said 
as for buying cars building new homes it has to have an 
effect de zalia said after all these years all of a sudden 
they take it right away from you 
i didnt have a chance for college but i want to make sure my 
kids have a chance to go fitzgerald said its going to be a 
burden 
but the workers are apprehensive about challenging the company 
hopefully the company will say hey lets settle before 
something happens de zalia said nobody wants to strike 
nobody wins everybody loses in a strike

site to meet our production needs to launch our products in north 
america paul cooper president of kelpie north america corp

eastern airlines and several of its top managers 
were indicted today on criminal charges of falsifying aircraft 
maintenance records and other aircraftsafety documents 
the 60count indictment alleges a fraudulent scheme to try to 
minimize flight delays and cancellations that resulted in flights 
by improperly maintained or repaired airplanes 
the violations allegedly took place from july 1985 to october 
1989 at john f kennedy international and laguardia airports in new 
york hartsfield international airport in atlanta and eastern 
headquarters in miami 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement that the 
alleged conspiracy strikes a raw nerve in anyone who has ever 
boarded an airplane 
thousands of innocent passengers may have been put at risk 
every day by the criminal actions of these defendants thornburgh 
said 
eastern faces a maximum fine of 30 million each individual 
defendant faces up to five years in prison and a 250000 fine on 
each count 
the indictment charges that by tampering with log books work 
cards and maintenance records eastern did cause aircraft that 
were not properly maintained or repaired to fly and carry 
unsuspecting passengers 
none of the alleged violations caused any accidents or injuries 
authorities said 
the airline and nine employees were charged with conspiracy 
fraud keeping false records concealing information from the 
federal aviation administration and other charges 
the charges follow a yearlong federal investigation and the 
collapse of plea bargain talks in which eastern refused to admit to 
conspiracy charges 
martin shugrue appointed to run eastern by a bankruptcy judge 
said tuesday the airline was prepared to admit to fraudulent 
maintenance and recordkeeping but not conspiracy 
andrew j maloney the us attorney in brooklyn said the 
charges involved critical items including radar landing gear 
automatic pilot instruments and fuel systems 
the indictment alleges eastern and several managers used 
intimidation and coercion to force the airlines maintenance 
personnel to avoid and minimize flight delays and cancellations 
it accuses eastern and the workers of falsifying aircraft 
maintenance records to make it fraudulently appear that scheduled 
maintenance and corrective repairs had been completed 
in addition to the airline named in the indictment were edward 
upton easterns staff vice president of maintenance and 
engineering during the period thomas lewis easterns northern 
area director of maintenance and seven other maintenance 
supervisors and foremen 
a criminal indictment is unprecedented in the airline industry 
and could add to easterns woes as it seeks to regain passengers 
build service and reorganize under federal bankruptcy protection 
after a bitter strike 
i think the public will recognize these are historical events 
that dont bear on eastern today said shugrue who has run the 
airline for about three months 
shugrue said eastern has undergone and passed a rigorous 
inspection by the faa and the defense department he called 
eastern the mostinspected air carrier in the world 
in refusing to acknowledge the conspiracy charge shugrue said 
we cannot and will not plead guilty to violations of the law for 
which we find no evidence 
the criminal investigation began last year after the faa fined 
eastern 839000 for alleged maintenance violations primarily at 
kennedy 
eastern cooperated with that investigation and closed its 
maintenance facility at kennedy last year 
shugrue said eastern expected to turn a profit in 1991 the 
miamibased airline is projected to lose about 500 million this 
year after a 852 million loss in 1989 
easterns employees struck the airline march 4 1989 and the 
company filed for bankruptcy protection five days later pilots and 
flight attendants quit the strike several months later but the 
mechanics remain on strike 
a federal bankruptcy judge appointed shugrue on april 18 to run 
the airline in place of frank lorenzo the chairman of easterns 
parent company the former texas air corp now known as 
continental airlines holdings inc

national intergroup inc said wednesday an 
investor group trying to wrest control of the troubled former steel 
giant evidently had enough shareholder votes to fill three seats on 
the 10member board of directors 
our tally shows that we dont have enough votes to elect our 
directors chief executive officer howard m love told a news 
conference after the companys annual shareholders meeting 
the vote appeared to be a significant victory in a prolonged 
battle for control of the company by centaur partners a new york 
investment concern and niis largest stockholder with 165 percent 
of its shares 
with three seats on the board centaur could wield enormous 
influence in convincing the other board members to follow its plan 
to sell whats left of nii and give the money to shareholders 
management has proposed a different future for nii formerly a 
debtridden steel company that diversified then sold most assets to 
pay creditors under the management plan nii would be restructured 
as a wholesale drug distributor niis owns foxmeyer drug the 
nations thirdlargest drug distributor 
about 200 stockholders and proxies were present to select three 
new directors candidate slates were nominated by the company and 
centaur 
the results of voting wont be known until the shareholders 
meeting reconvenes aug 9 but centaur appeared confident it had 
won 
this was an absolutely tremendous outpouring of support 
said centaur principal abbey j butler 
we do think that the shareholder vote is a mandate said 
centaur principal melvyn j estrin they declined to say how many 
votes they believed centaur had 
loves seat on the board was one of those at stake he had said 
he would retire once the companys restructuring was complete but 
said wednesday he would step down march 1 
robert king president of foxmeyer tried to persuade 
shareholders to back niis restructuring plan he said the 
wholesale drug distribution industry was a 25 billion a year 
business and growing by 15 percent annually 
eugene cohen one of a few shareholders who addressed love 
during the meeting said stockholders have not shared in profits 
from the sale of nii assets or received dividends 
what incentive is there to buy stock in intergroup cohen 
said 
walker street associates which owns 84 percent of nii stock 
objected to increases in nii managements severance pension and 
stock option plans 
most shareholders have been looking for the company to tell 
them something other than trust us said steve mizel a walker 
official 
the dissidents slate was estrin robert j slater former ceo 
of cfampi steel corp and william g tull retired chief operating 
officer of american security bank in maryland where estrin is a 
director 
the seven remaining directors include five independents as well 
as nii president james s pasman jr and richard s smith director 
of the permian corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of nii 
the next directors meeting is scheduled for aug 22

chrysler corp and an australian truck maker 
announced separate plans wednesday to bring auto production work to 
an area that has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in recent 
years 
local officials said the projects would help boost a sagging 
economy 
chrysler announced an incentive package to move production of 
the jeep wrangler from brampton ontario starting jan 1 1993 it 
also said if it decides to build the new jj model it would be 
produced in toledo 
the plan may create new jobs but how many is unclear chrysler 
said the transfer of wrangler to toledo would offset the projected 
decline in sales of jeep cherokee and grand wagoneers both made in 
toledo but the united auto workers union said it expected wrangler 
production to create hundreds of jobs 
were looking at retaining thousands of goodpaying jobs at 
jeep plus untold thousands of other jobs held by toledoans which 
rely on jeep mayor john mchugh said 
while chrysler was making its announcement kelpie north america 
corp said it would make a hydrauliclift pickup truck in 
northwood about five miles east of toledo the 225 million 
venture is expected to create 1500 production jobs and could 
result in 4500 related jobs 
given the loss of manufacturing jobs in our area it is 
especially good to see not just new jobs being added but 
manufacturing jobs as well northwood mayor john hageman said 
these are jobs that will provide a respectable standard of 
living for our families wood county commissioner thomas warns 
said 
toledo has seen its manufacturing base erode it has lost 3000 
manufacturing jobs in the last two years alone the unemployment 
rate for the toledo area in may was 70 percent 
the latest word of a plant closing came in may when champion 
spark plug co said it would close its toledo plant by the end of 
the year idling 430 workers 
three small auto parts plants have closed since january 1989 
putting 620 people out of work other companies have reduced their 
work force or moved operations to other cities with lower labor 
costs 
chrysler said the brampton plant would be closed with the move 
of wrangler production to toledo but some workers would be 
transferred to another chrysler plant in canada 
in return toledo and the state will provide incentives that 
could total 223 million over the next 10 years they include a 
possible 10year tax abatement on personal property taxes for 
chrysler up to 500000 a year for seven years for plant 
improvements and up to 5 million to retrain workers 
the agreement is the final piece of a package that was needed to 
move wrangler production to toledo and keep the two existing plants 
operating beyond 1992 the two plants employ 5300 people 
the first pickup truck made by kelpie north america could roll 
off the northwood assembly line by october of 1991 the company a 
subsidiary of sydney australiabased kelpie industries ltd 
expects to begin construction this summer on 70 acres 
the truck features a bed and tailgate that lower to the ground 
it will retail for 16500 to 17900 
kelpie expects to build 60000 trucks a year for the us 
market a canadian site also had been considered 
major contributing factors were strong community support and 
an excellent local skilled labor pool paul cooper president of 
kelpie north america said at a news conference in bowling green 
the oneton frontwheel drive truck has no rear axle the 
wheels are mounted directly to the frame the load tray known as 
the bed would be raised and lowered hydraulically making it easy 
for people to place heavy objects in the truck

digital equipment corp reported a 2567 million 
fourthquarter loss wednesday the computer giants first ever 
quarterly loss and a reflection of a voluntary severance program 
under which 3000 employees left over the last 12 months 
mark steinkrauss director of investor relations said digitals 
restructuring program included plans to cut another 5000 to 6000 
people in the coming months through voluntary severance and 
attrition 
the loss by one of new englands most important companies 
provided further evidence of economic trouble in the region which 
grew quickly during the boom years of the 1980s but tumbled into 
recession because of the slumping hightechnology financial 
services and real estate industries 
but some securities analysts who follow digital saw the loss as 
a piece of good news because it showed the company was aggressively 
trying to cut expenses while remaining competitive 
im encouraged that they decided to bite the bullet and do 
it said marc schulman an analyst with ubs securities inc in 
new york things are as bad as theyre going to get and now 
theyre going to get better 
added steinkrauss the company knew exactly what it was doing 
in light of what it needs to do in terms of reducing its cost 
structure 
still the news was not well received on wall street digital 
stock fell 62 cents a share to 7487 in new york stock exchange 
trading 
employee retraining separation incentives and other costs 
associated with the maynard massbased companys restructuring 
program cost 400 million in the fourth quarter 
senior vice president john f smith also attributed the computer 
makers loss to the continuing economic slowdown that affects 
both us and several other markets 
for its fourth quarter ended june 30 the company said it lost 
211 a share on revenue of 34 billion compared with earnings of 
3132 million or 251 a share on revenue of 35 billion for 
the same quarter in 1989 
profits for the full fiscal year after absorbing pretax charges 
of 550 million fell to 744 million or 59 cents a share from 
11 billion or 845 a share in 1989 digitals sales were up 2 
percent to 129 billion from 127 billion last year 
increasing profit is the most important challenge the company 
faces smith said in a statement we are not satisfied with our 
operating results and will continue focusing on revenue growth and 
reducing our cost structure 
he said the company was reducing costs by identifying positions 
that are no longer needed either because of changes in technology 
or business practices 
we expect to begin receiving ongoing cost savings from these 
actions in the current year and the full impact will be realized 
by next fiscal year smith said in the statement 
schulman who predicted digitals turnaround would take about 
two years said many of the bigger computer companies are 
scrambling to update product lines and keep up with overseas 
competitors 
given their size its going to take awhile he said the 
underlying problem is the shift in the structure of demand toward 
work stations and pcs personal computers areas which do not 
represent a high percentage of their revenue 
companies are also beginning to scale back from the explosive 
expansion of the early 1980s when the industry boomed in 
californias silicon valley and along massachusetts route 128 
more recently layoffs and other job reductions have been 
widespread among industry giants like digital the worlds second 
largest computer maker after international business machines corp 
in december ibm announced it would eliminate 10000 us jobs 
other affected companies have included unisys corp control data 
corp amdahl corp bull hn information systems inc wang 
laboratories inc and prime computer 
the whole industry has been slumping and it looks like its 
continuing said david wu a stock analyst with sg warburg amp 
co in new york digital can recover but its a matter of how 
much and how fast

sales of existing homes posted their first 
increase in seven months in june but analysts were divided 
wednesday on whether the modest 12 percent gain offered at least 
the glimmer of rebound for the depressed housing sector 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes edged up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 334 million units 
the june advance was the first increase in sales since a 32 
percent gain in november since then existing home sales have 
either fallen or remained unchanged as the housing industry was 
battered by rising mortgage rates 
industry officials said they viewed the june advance as an 
encouraging sign that better days may be ahead especially in light 
of the fact that mortgage rates have been declining in recent 
months 
fixedrate mortgages fell to 999 percent last week according 
to a national survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp it 
marked the first time rates have been below 10 percent in six 
months 
people have been watching to see which way rates are headed 
now theyre out scouting the inventory in general it appears the 
market is building up steam said norman d flynn president of 
the realtors group 
but david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill inc said he 
saw little reason to believe that the small june upturn in existing 
home sales would be followed by further gains 
we may have found the floor for the slump in housing but i 
dont think we will be coming off of it for awhile wyss said 
people just arent as excited about owning a home because the 
investment prospects dont look as good as they did in the 1990s 
the median price of an existing home rose 2 percent in june to 
97500 the median is the midpoint with half the homes selling 
for more and half for less 
the sales strength in june came from a sharp 91 percent jump in 
activity in the midwest where existing homes were sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 960000 units 
sales also were up in the west by a smaller 18 percent to an 
annual rate of 580000 units 
the other two regions of the country posted sales declines in 
the south sales fell a slight 08 percent to an annual rate of 
131 million units 
sales were off 58 percent in the northeast to an annual rate 
of 490000 units as that section of the country continued to 
exhibit extremely weak sales activity 
flynn said that psychological barriers caused by a general 
economic slowdown were continuing to scare away buyers in the 
northeast 
unfortunately many people in the northeast are of the mindset 
that it is a bad time to buy flynn said that is bunk sellers 
are more than willing to negotiate buyers should be jumping into 
the market

factory orders for big ticket durable 
goods plummeted 32 percent in june the government said wednesday 
in a report that raised new concerns that the united states could 
be flirting with a recession 
the commerce department said that demand for durable goods 
items ranging from bicycles to battleships fell 414 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 12469 billion last month 
the june decline came as a surprise to analysts who had counted 
on a further pickup in orders to signal that the fortunes of the 
nations manufacturing sector were on a permanent upswing 
durable goods orders are considered a key barometer for the 
future since a drop in orders normally triggers cutbacks in 
production plans and job layoffs 
hopes for a rebound in manufacturing had been fueled by a 42 
percent rise in orders in may and an even bigger 67 percent 
advance in march 
but the june decline continues the sawtooth pattern evident 
since january orders fell by 41 percent in april and dropped by a 
record of 105 percent in january 
the durable goods report is a distinct yellow flag on how the 
economy might perform in the second half of the year said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co in two of the last three 
months we have seen substantial declines in the orders numbers 
mark zandi senior economist at regional financial associates in 
chester pa said the orders report was especially disappointing 
because many economists had looked for a rebound in manufacturing 
to help bolster growth in coming months 
if manufacturing doesnt show signs of strength there really 
is no sector of the economy to provide the impetus for growth he 
said the consumer sector is extremely weak investment spending 
has been hurt by the slide in profits and housing is in a 
recession 
the news came on a day when a new poll by abc and money magazine 
said a record proportion of respondents 71 percent believed it 
was not a good time to make a purchase and the same proportion 
believed the economy was in notsogood or poor shape the poll did 
not give comparisons from the past 
a separate report wednesday showed that sales of existing 
singlefamily homes posted a small 12 percent advance in june the 
first monthly gain since last november 
the national association of realtors attributed the upturn to 
falling mortgage rates and said it offered the promise of further 
gains in the months ahead but other economists said that a 
onemonth upturn did not signal an end to the extended slump 
besetting the housing industry 
in a sign of how sluggish the manufacturing sector has been 
orders for durable goods totaled 7447 billion during the first 
six months of this year 15 percent below the same period in 1989 
the june weakness was widespread across all industry groups 
about half of the decline was attributed to a 207 percent drop in 
orders for military hardware the biggest setback in the defense 
category since a 336 percent drop in january 
the military sector tends to be extremely volatile depending on 
the timing of government contracts but analysts believe this 
years weakness reflects the beginnings of an extended period of 
defense cutbacks 
even without the big defense decrease durable goods orders 
would have been down 17 percent in june

the organization a 57yearold cartel has the financial 
resources to hold large stocks of diamonds which is how it keeps 
the market stable 
although de beers said it had had no direct contact with the 
soviet union since 1963 diamond experts say de beers already sells 
most of the soviet unions westbound diamonds 
we have not had an official agreement with the russians in 
the past obviously being major distributors of rough diamonds 
russian diamonds have found their way into the rough said de 
beers spokesman roger van eeghen it came through other sources 
other channels 
all the worlds major diamond producers including botswana 
australia tanzania zaire and namibia have sales contracts with 
de beers centenary the central selling organization had sales of 
409 billion last year 
de beers must renegotiate several key contracts this year which 
experts have said might loosen its grip on the diamond market 
the formal marketing of the soviet diamonds like those from 
elsewhere will take place in london and lucerne de beers said 
julian ogilvie thompson de beers chairman said the deal would 
bring continued stability and prosperity of the international 
diamond industry 
nicholas oppenheimer deputy chairman of de beers centenary 
said the soviet union at a time of considerable financial 
strain was able to raise a 1 billion loan while signing a 
contract assuring it of a steady flow of funds from diamonds 
over the next five years 
largescale diamond mining began in the soviet union in the 
1950s and is concentrated in the yakutia region of north eastern 
siberia de beers said

the court ruling that cleared the way for time 
inc to buy warner communications inc is a year old but wall 
street has doubts about the media and entertainment conglomerates 
prospects 
worries about the companys big debt its ability to handle 
possible interest rate hikes and absorb shocks in businesses such 
as moviemaking or records have depressed its stock price so have 
uncertainties about possible changes in the regulatory environment 
for its cable television business 
the acquisition costs have led to scary financial reports as 
well time warner lost 376 million in the first half of the year 
after paying preferred dividends 
how the mighty have fallen said media analyst dennis 
mcalpine of oppenheimer amp co in a recent analysis 
the company that won wall street raves as the forerunner of 
the international media behemoth a few months ago he wrote is 
now viewed there with the disdain normally accorded a skunk 
walking into a church social 
but he recommended buying the depressed stock citing the 
companys eminent position in most of the industries in which it 
operates its apparent ability to meet its debt obligations and its 
positive longterm prospects 
time warner stock traded in the mid90s this past week down 
from a peak of 18275 a share last summer the stock had soared in 
june 1989 after paramount communications inc offered 200 a share 
for time only days before shareholder votes were scheduled on 
times plan to merge with warner 
time executives called paramounts offer phony reworked the 
warner deal in a way that required no shareholder vote and got the 
delaware supreme courts blessing in a ruling july 24 1989 
as a result paramount never got the chance to take its offer 
directly to times stockholders many still resent that 
we would have preferred that they would have accepted 
paramounts offer said kyle krueger portfolio manager for eagle 
asset management in st petersburg fla which now owns 163 
percent of time warners stock 
but he doesnt blame time warner management for the companys 
current low price we think they are doing fairly well he said 
time warner executives say the companys stock price reflects 
the markets distaste for companies with debt and its disfavor for 
those in the cable and entertainment industries in particular 
they argue time warner can handle its debt time warners 
magazine music film book tv production and cable television 
businesses are generating more than enough cash to meet debt 
payments over the next few years they say 
securities analysts generally agree that the company will 
generate 21 billion to 25 billion in cash flow a year while 
interest and preferred stock payments will require about 13 
billion a year through 1992 
but in 1993 the company is due to reduce its debt by 2 
billion mcalpine and others feel the company will have to either 
sell assets or take on partners in joint ventures to raise money by 
that date 
mcalpine also said the company has 3 billion in investments 
that could be sold to reduce debt these include shares of 
companies such as hasbro atari and turner broadcasting systems 
inc real estate in burbank calif and minority interests in 
assorted cable system operators 
time warners cochief executives steven j ross and nicholas 
j nicholas jr told analysts in may that they are looking for 
partners who can give the company access to new makets or who will 
pay handsomely for a minority stake in various time warner 
operations 
in the meantime ross and nicholas appear determined to run the 
company as if there were no 108 billion debt 
peter appert media analyst for cj lawrence morgan grenfell 
inc wrote after the may meeting that while the company was aware 
of wall streets concerns with its high debt level managements 
focus appears to be on expanding the business first and lowering 
the debt levels second 
time warner has made a number of strategic deals over the past 
few months 
it bought lane publishing a california magazine publisher for 
about 180 million in cash and stock senior magazine executives 
hope to use lane as a springboard for regional publishing ventures 
in the west and far east 
in april the company paid 195 million for a 195 percent 
stake in six flags corp which runs seven amusement parks and may 
offer a wider outlet for the warner bros cast of cartoon 
characters such as bugs bunny and daffy duck 
time warner spent 133 million in march for a 25 percent stake 
in a cellular radio venture with price communications it offers an 
opportunity to get a close look at a new line of business 
it entered a joint venture for a scandinavian pay tv service 
and is helping build the first modern movie theaters in the soviet 
union both markets offer appealing growth potential 
its most controversial move to date was a tentative agreement to 
guarantee 650 million in loans for pathe communications incs 
12 billion bid for mgmua communications inc 
the deal alarmed some analysts who felt time warner could not 
afford the extra debt but time warner executives said the risk was 
well worth it because its loan guarantee would have been secured by 
the united artists film library that they said was worth much more 
than 650 million 
the issue has evidently become moot as the pact between pathe 
and time fell apart amid an exchange of lawsuits before any loans 
were arranged 
from an outsiders perspective maybe it was better that they 
didnt get involved said edward atorino media analyst for 
salomon brothers inc 
time warner also is investing millions in its core businesses 
it launched a magazine entertainment weekly which some analysts 
say could lose 60 million before turning profitable and a cable 
network the comedy channel 
the company also has cut back since time obtained control of 
warner last july it sold the textbook company scott foresman and 
co for 448 million last december its southern progress corp 
suspended publication of moneylosing southpoint magazine a 
regional magazine in may 
nonetheless the company says the diversity of its businesses 
which run from time and fortune magazines and bookofthemonth 
club to music from pasula abdul and movies like batman and 
driving miss daisy insulate it against reversals in any one 
business 
gordon crawford senior vice president at the research arm of 
capital group inc the single largest time warner stockholder with 
an 8 percent stake said company management is doing fine and the 
market will eventually realize it 
their actions illustrate they are going to continue running 
the company in an aggressive fashion with a longterm point of 
view he said

when the multibilliondollar fight for time inc 
landed in the delaware courts last year everyone who followed the 
case knew there was more at stake than just the outcome of a 
takeover battle 
they were right the legal precedent that emerged strengthened 
the takeover defenses of some of the nations biggest firms and 
became a model for laws in other states 
when the ohio legislature passed a new antitakeover bill in 
april lawmakers included a provision that has become known as the 
time warner amendment the selection of a time frame for the 
achievement of corporate goals shall be the responsibility of the 
directors 
the provision codifies the delaware supreme courts ruling that 
boards of directors are not under a duty to put aside their 
longterm goals in favor of a takeover bid that would give 
stockholders more money for their shares now 
leigh trevor a member of the ohio state bar association who 
lobbied for the amendments passage said he and other corporate 
lawyers wanted to remove debate over that subject in court 
should an ohio company find itself in a situation similar to times 
in march 1989 time and warner communications inc announced 
plans to merge in a stock swap valued at 18 billion then in 
june three weeks before shareholders were to vote on the deal 
paramount communications inc launched a hostile 107 billion bid 
for time alone 
time responded by beginning its own 14 billion tender offer for 
warner paramount raised its bid to 122 billion and the companies 
went to court in delaware where all three were incorporated 
paramount argued that the time board should be forced to 
seriously consider its bid which would give shareholders immediate 
cash instead of the future profits promised by time and warner 
meanwhile the wouldbe merger partners contended that their 
plans which culminated two years of negotiations should not 
have to be shunted aside just because a third party had put a 
higher offer on the table 
in july delaware chancery court judge william t allen and then 
the state supreme court upheld the right of the time board to 
proceed with the combination with warner and the creation of time 
warner inc 
in a written decision issued in february supreme court justice 
henry r horsey said a board of directors is not under any 
per se duty to maximize shareholder value in the shortterm even in 
the context of a takeover 
legal scholars viewed the ruling as strengthening the hand of 
directors in takeover battles 
the decision automatically added protection to other companies 
incorporated in delaware home to many of the countrys biggest 
firms including about half the fortune 500 other states look to 
delaware for guidance on corporate law issues so ohio included the 
delaware ruling in its statutes 
we wanted to make it crystal clear if it is not already clear 
enough the time frame for achieving corporate objectives is a 
board decision said trevor a partner with the law firm jones 
day reavis amp pogue in cleveland 
critics of antitakeover statutes tend to view laws such as the 
new ohio provision as a means for entrenching management 
but its supporters say this was no kneejerk reaction to the 
delaware ruling 
if we cannot have the opportunity for longterm planning in 
publicly held american companies we put ourselves at a 
disadvantage with foreign competitors whose legal systems do 
provide adequate time for longterm planning and implementation of 
longterm plans trevor said 
we have been handing to our international competitors an 
advantage because they can look out at the horizon and over the 
hill and we cant he said

bethlehem steel corp on wednesday reported a 74 percent slump 
in secondquarter earnings while allegheny ludlum corp posted a 38 
percent plunge in its quarterly income both steelmakers blamed 
lower steel prices for part of the deterioration 
bethlehem steel said it earned 219 million or 21 cents a 
share in the three months ended june 30 down from 841 million 
or 103 a share a year earlier sales dropped about 10 percent to 
128 billion from 143 billion during the second quarter of 1989 
allegheny ludlum the nations largest specialty steel maker 
said for the three months ended july 1 profits were 226 million 
or 68 cents a share down from 367 million or 108 per share 
in the same period of 1989 sales fell 11 percent to 29599

lower steel prices and shipments and higher operating costs at 
bethlehem steels sparrows point plant near baltimore caused the 
decline chairman walter f williams said in a news release 
steel shipments were reported down about 13 percent primarily 
in semifinished steel shipments to other steel producers the 
company said shipments are not expected to slip further during the 
third quarter because of recent strong orders from the automotive 
market and declining steel imports 
costs rose at sparrows point because of planned outages of the 
large blast furnace and the hot strip mill for maintenance and 
modernization the company said a scheduled 25day outage at the 
hot strip mill during august and continued coke oven repairs at 
sparrows point will dampen thirdquarter results but ultimately 
enhance overall performance williams said 
for the first six months bethlehem steel netted 432 million 
or 41 cents a share on sales of 249 billion in the first half 
of 1989 bethlehem steel reported income of 1488 million or 
181 a share on sales of 284 billion 
during the second quarter of 1989 results included 50 million 
of unusual charges for restructuring the companys bethforge 
division net income also was reduced in the first half of 1989 by 
55 million of restructuring charges related to the baltimore 
marine division 
operating results at both divisions improved during the second 
quarter this year the company said 
the company warned against approval of legislation pending in 
congress that would stiffen controls under the clean air act 
we believe that certain features of the bill concerning air 
toxics are not based on sound scientific data and available 
technology and if enacted could impose significant unwarranted 
costs on domestic steelmakers in the future williams said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
allegheny ludlum said its profit drop reflected lower prices 
which were pushed down by competition and increased exports of 
semifinished electrical steel 
in the first half of 1990 profits fell 35 percent to 459 
million or 137 per share compared with 71 million or 210 
per share in the same period of 1989 sales fell nearly 18 percent 
in the first half to 5754 million from 6977 million the 
company said 
while the future overall direction of the economy is unclear 
so far market demand for our specialty materials this year has 
surpassed our expectations and new market applications continue to 
be developed president robert p bozzone said 
he said the cost of a new fouryear labor agreement effective 
april 1 also contributed to the decline in secondquarter earnings

massachusetts highest court threw out parts of a 
lawsuit wednesday against a tobacco company whose cigarettes were 
bought by minors but allowed some claims to continue 
the supreme judicial court granted summary judgment in favor of 
philip morris cos inc dismissing claims that the company should 
be held liable for the fact that convenience stores sold cigarettes 
to the two plaintiffs theresa kyte and sean cann 
but the court said the plaintiffs could pursue their claims that 
the company engaged in a deceptive act in violation of state 
consumer protection laws the court also declined to dismiss a 
claim that the company breached an implied warranty that its 
products were safe 
a middlesex county superior court judge had denied the companys 
motions for summary judgment 
you only need one claim to win said edward greer an 
attorney representing the plaintiffs 
but hadrian katz an attorney for philip morris said the 
courts decision effectively wiped out the plaintiffs case 
theres nothing left he said 
tobacco liability cases have been brought against cigarette 
companies in the past but rarely have met success 
in 1988 a federal jury in new jersey awarded the first damages 
against a cigarette company giving 400000 to a man whose wife 
died of lung cancer but an appeals court overturned the award this 
year and ordered a new trial 
in boston this year a federal jury found american tobacco co 
should not be held liable for the cancer death of a cambridge man 
greer said unlike the previous cases his case focuses on minors 
who do not have the same ability as adults to gather information 
and make decisions 
kyte of waltham started smoking at age 12 and cann of 
brookline at age 15 each smoked marlboro and parliament 
cigarettes made by philip morris 
they claim they repeatedly bought the cigarettes at convenience 
stores even though state law prohibits selling tobacco to minors 
in their suit they said the company conspired to sell the 
cigarettes to minors through the convenience stores 
but the high court rejected the argument 
we have accepted the principle that in particular 
circumstances a supplier may be liable for harm caused after the 
supplier knowingly placed property in the hands of an incompetent 
person the court said 
our cases have not however held a manufacturer of a product 
liable in negligence simply because some third party unlawfully 
placed that product in the hands of a minor and as a result the 
minor or some other person was harmed the decision said 
in a dissenting opinion chief justice paul liacos said the 
plaintiffs raised legitimate issues and should have been allowed to 
present more evidence to support their claims 
the court allowed two other claims to proceed one is that 
philip morris violated state consumer protection laws through a 
pattern and practice of sales to minors greer said he said he 
would show that philip morris profits from sales to minors and 
targets its advertising toward young consumers 
the second claim accuses the company of breaching an implied 
warranty that its products are fit for intended use free from 
defect safe to consume and noncarcinogenic and nonaddictive 
to make this case the plaintiffs claim a design defect 
specifically with marlboro and parliament cigarettes rather than 
claiming all cigarettes are inherently defective 
philip morris katz said the claims of unique design defects 
were nonsense

a meeting of senior trade negotiators is expected 
to end thursday with agreement on the need for intense efforts to 
overcome barriers in crucial talks aimed at a more open global 
economy 
but the outcome of the fourday meeting leaves rifts between the 
united states and the european community and between 
industrialized countries and the third world 
david woods spokesman for the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade said wednesday that the meeting would likely endorse a 
package of proposals aimed at liberalizing trade in 15 key areas 
however he said a number of highlevel officials attending the 
105nation trade negotiations committee meeting had voiced 
disappointment that more progress had not been made on narrowing 
differences 
the proposals are described as profile accords full 
agreements are meant to be finalized at the start of december when 
the uruguay round of trade talks concludes 
the aim of the negotiations launched in 1986 is to reduce 
barriers to trade and set new standards in important areas such as 
banking services many countries have warned that failure of the 
talks will lead to a dangerous surge of protectionism 
but the profiles demonstrate how much work remains little 
more than four months before the deadline 
the proposal on liberalizing trade in textiles for example 
includes conflicting policy options backed by the united states 
the ec and third world textile exporters 
the text on intellectual property rights such as patents also 
reflects the same threeway split 
a compromise document on agriculture lays out clear proposals 
for cutting domestic farm supports and import barriers and says 
export subsidies should be reduced most of all 
but the united states and agricultural exporters like australia 
still insist on the elimination of export subsidies while the ec 
has made it plain it will defend their use 
woods said the meeting had met the endofjuly target for 
profile accords even though some countries may not agree that 
what we have achieved are satisfactory final profiles 
he said the final session thursday was expected to agree on a 
way to intensify the negotiations the meeting comprised mainly of 
officials just below ministerial rank was originally scheduled to 
last until friday 
it had been widely billed as a chance to boost progress in the 
most contentious areas 
chief ec negotiator hugo paemen told a press conference that 
senior officials were likely to travel to geneva for another 
meeting oct 8 and then be on permanent standby until the 
december ministerial gathering in brussels 
he described the package of proposals as a strong basis to 
start from 
paemens optimism contrasted with formal statements from 
developing countries brazil colombia mexico and china were among 
those criticizing lack of headway in efforts to reduce import 
duties and open markets 
the united states australia and canada all voiced concern in 
speeches tuesday
