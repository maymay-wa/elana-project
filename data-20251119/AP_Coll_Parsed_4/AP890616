brushing aside a homelessness protest storms and 
a lastminute legal scare officials thursday opened underground 
atlanta a 142 million attempt to transform the business district 
into fun city south 
wind and rain forced the opening ceremony to be moved to a 
covered section of the complex and prevented a fireworks display 
but people crammed shouldertoshoulder to get a firstday look at 
the more than 100 shops restaurants nightclubs and street vendors 
police estimated that about 200000 people visited through the 
day 
mayor andrew youngs speech capping the opening ceremony was 
drowned out by demonstrators blowing whistles and chanting 
atlanta keeps the homeless underground six people were arrested 
and charged with criminal trespassing police said 
about an hour before the complex opened superior court judge 
isaac jenrette refused to stop the developers from using the 
underground atlanta name he ruled that a company that claims it 
holds rights to the name filed a lawsuit too late 
underground atlanta adds entertainment and nightlife to a 
downtown that had lost most of its fun spots to the suburbs 
firstday visitors appeared to be enjoying themselves and many 
said theyd be coming back 
the shops are fantastic ive done my christmas shopping 
already said sharon brewer of tuscon ariz who was in atlanta 
to visit a friend 
but even the most enthusiastic merchants acknowledged success is 
uncertain 
an original underground atlanta located beneath downtown street 
viaducts opened in 1969 hurt by nearby subway construction and the 
perception that it was crimeridden it closed in 1982 
young made reviving underground a priority of his administration 
and with a combination of private investment millions of dollars of 
municipal funds and the issuance of 85 million in revenue bonds 
the project thrived developed over three years by the rouse 
company the new underground is located on and around the old site 
advocates for the homeless say many of the citys street people 
were displaced by the underground construction and that public 
money used for the complex could have gone to providing affordable 
housing 
when young was drowned out by the demonstrators he angrily 
defended his administrations actions on behalf of the poor 
dignitaries on the stand including gov joe frank harris rose to 
applaud the mayor but the protesters shouted even louder 
young a liberal democrat who was prominent in the civil rights 
movement said later he was not angry with the hecklers but insisted 
he didnt deserve their ire 
you protest when you cant get people to take you seriously or 
talk with you young said i meet with the homeless we have a 
homeless task force we put all of the resources we possibly can in 
dealing with the problems of homelessness 
maybe this helps in the sense that it puts homelessness on the 
national media he added but youre not going to be able to 
resolve the problems of homelessness unless we keep successful 
projects like this going that create jobs 
murphy davis a partner at the open door community an 
organization that aids the homeless said of the demonstration i 
think its a hard thing for a lot of people to understand why 
disrupt a good time but there are a lot of people in this city who 
never have a good time because the basics of life are denied to 
them 
ms davis said that if underground atlanta provides jobs to the 
poor they are likely to be paid the minimum wage which she said is 
not enough money to live on

in a startling first for the largest 
winemaker in the world the eamp j gallo winery said it will stop 
for six months the sale of its its two brands of cheap highalcohol 
wine in the seedy tenderloin district 
the action came wednesday after tenderloinarea distributor 
gallobay cities a galloowned business met with safe and sober 
streets activists who have protested the sale of the fortified 
wines in their district 
if what we have done in this neighborhood improves the 
alcoholism problem in this area well do the same thing in other 
neighborhoods said dan solomon a spokesman for the modestobased 
winery 
the protesters denounced fortified wines like gallos thunderbird 
and night train express and canandaiguas wild irish rose they 
said they were unable to walk through the tenderloin without 
tripping over or being menaced by a wino 
gallo has never removed a product from the shelves solomon said 
the privately held company has 1 billion in annual sales and 28 
percent of the us wine market 
sober streets group went from grocerytogrocery trying to 
persuade the proprietors to take the cheap goods off their shelves 
one grocer agreed but changed his mind he said after losing 850 
in wine sales in a single day 
solomon characterized the action as an experiment by gallo to see 
whether or not our beliefs and the evidence are correct that 
winos deprived of their cheap wine will turn to other alcohols 
the wines involved are typically made from the cheapest vinous 
ingredients and the merest hint of grape flavor then hyped with 
grape brandy to bring the alcohol to about 18 percent by volume 
they sell for around 90 cents to 125 a bottle 
its estimated that the two wines account for less than 3 percent 
of company sales

an judge changed his mind about not paying a 
12member jury which he dismissed without pay for ignoring his 
instructions in a personal injury case 
allegheny county common pleas judge silvestri silvestri on 
thursday authorized payments to the panel for five days of work 
after meeting with judges paul zavarella and ralph cappy who 
administer the civil division 
it was his order and he reconsidered it zavarella said 
silvestri refused to comment on why he changed his mind 
with all the publicity on the case i think judge silvestri 
just wants the matter to end zavarella said 
jurors normally are paid 9 a day for the first three days of a 
trial and 25 for each day therafter plus mileage the jurors will 
receive between 82 and 112 
one of the jurors benjamin margolin wrote silvestri asking him 
to reconsider his decision saying the jury was not fully 
cognizant of the law 
i for one am sorry it caused such a furor he said 
silvestri had tried twice without success to explain to the 
jurors that they had to award 10514 in medical expenses to 
christopher culver a carnegie mellon university student whose ankle 
had been broken in an impromptu wrestling match initiated by another 
student in 1987 at a fraternity party 
in their first verdict the jury decided not to award money 
damages to culver 21 of pittsburgh after silvestri repeated his 
instructions they deliberated again and awarded the injured student 
1000 but because they ruled both men were 50 percent responsible 
the student was to receive 500 
silvestri then dismissed them without pay on june 1

though churches have condemned homosexual 
activity for centuries gay men and women are beginning to find a 
home within a mainline christian denomination 
the spirit of the lakes ecumenical community church became the 
nations first openly homosexual congregation to join a mainline 
church when it was accepted into membership of the united church of 
christ in april according to its leader 
as far as we know were making history said the rev dan 
geslin pastor of spirit of the lakes we see ourselves as a 
prophetic voice 
we hope that were breaking ground and leading the way for 
other churches and other denominations to open up and recognize gay 
and lesbian peoples rightful place in the church 
spirit of the lakes has grown from 18 people meeting in a living 
room in may 1987 to 150 members it was voted into membership by 
more than 80 percent of the delegates attending the annual meeting 
of the eastern association the largest of the united church of 
christs three associations in minnesota with 71 churches and 24000 
members 
spirit of the lakes is considered a developing church while 
the association reviews the groups constitution and development 
plan those are likely to be approved at the associations 1990 
annual meeting formalizing the congregations admission 
association officials say 
samuel loliger cocoordinator of the united church coalition for 
lesbiangay concerns an athens ohiobased specialinterest group 
within the church said the acceptance of spirit of the lakes is a 
first for mainline denominations 
this one is certainly very different than anything we have 
encountered before he said it is an openly gay and lesbian 
congregation and they have sought to become a church with that 
right up front 
most christian churches accept homosexuals as members equally 
beloved by god as others but condemn the practice of homosexuality 
but the united church of christ a 18millionmember protestant 
church formed in 1957 when the evangelical and reformed church 
merged with the congregational christian churches often has been at 
the forefront of progressive social movements 
in 1969 the churchs general synod approved its first resolution 
supporting civil rights for homosexuals and three years later it 
became the first mainline denomination to ordain an openly gay 
minister 
in 1983 the general synod passed a resolution stating that a 
persons sexual orientation is not a moral issue and that sexual 
orientation should not be the basis for discrimination within the 
church the synod encouraged united church of christ churches to 
openly accept homosexuals as members 
that inclusiveness is what attracted spirit of the lakes to the 
denomination 
geslin 39 who grew up in anoka a minneapolis suburb received 
a master of divinity degree from the pacific school of religion a 
united church of christaffiliated school in berkeley calif he 
took over as pastor of spirit of the lakes in september and 
immediately began pursuing membership in the denomination 
the discussion was why bother to affiliate at all most 
homosexuals look at established churches as oppressive 
institutions geslin said 
but the membership was attracted by the united church of christs 
structure which allows autonomy for each congregation 
this is the best of both worlds for us he said we can 
remain an autonomous congregation and still associate with a 
larger christian body that allows us to be a community of 
gaylesbian christians and at the same time not be ghettoized 
he described the congregation as collegeeducated professionals 
who come from catholic lutheran and episcopal backgrounds and are 
interested in social justice peace liberation and feminist 
theology 
although spirit of the lakes has generally met with quiet 
acceptance some have voiced reservations 
i do not think that any congregation should come in with a 
sexual or a racial orientation said the rev james mccutcheon 
senior minister of the united church of christaffiliated wayzata 
community church i would be bothered if somebody proposed a 
church just for men or a church just for women or a church just 
for married couples and so on 
geslin says 10 percent of his churchs membership is heterosexual 
spirit of the lakes also is bucking christian tradition which 
holds that the practice of homosexuality is a sin 
people who interpret the bible literally point to several old and 
new testament passages that appear to condemn homosexuality one is 
leviticus 2013 which according to the revised standard version 
says if a man lies with a male as with a woman both of them have 
committed an abomination 
but geslin and mccutcheon contend that the bible must be 
interpreted in the context of the time in which it was written 
when leviticus was written geslin said the israelites were 
instinctively concerned with maximizing the probabilities of 
procreation religious laws governing sexual practices reinforced 
that basic tribal concern 
geslin criticizes people who use specific bible verses to condemn 
homosexuals today 
its not taking the bible as a whole he said its picking 
out little bits and pieces to justify cultural prejudices

a time tunnel is the visual and 
philosophical centerpiece of the berlin operas ring cycle at the 
kennedy center for performing arts 
the concept creates a thrilling sensation that everything 
happening on stage in the present is part of the past and part of 
the future 
richard wagners stunning creation der ring des nibelungen 
the ring of the nibelungen dwarfs who owned a magic ring and 
a horde of gold is being performed the way the german composer 
intended it to be a fourday cycle 
the metropolitan opera performed the entire epic about love and 
greed and gods and goddesses in april and may it was the first time 
it had been presented in so short a span in 90 years the kennedy 
center ring opened june 2 
in all four of berlins ring operas das rheingold die 
walkure siegfried and gotterdammerung the audience looks 
into the end of a tunnel designed by peter sykora the other end is 
straight ahead far away and smaller with a light beyond 
this doesnt mean that singers just stride around inside an 
otherwise hollow tunnel sometimes there are sufficient backdrops 
scenery and props so that only two pieces of the 90foothigh 
stuctures mouth are visible curving across the top of the stage on 
both sides 
the kennedy centers ring is intensely theatrical characters 
move a lot laser light flashes fire juts up from grates in some 
dozen dark circles on the stage fog pours from 20 fog machines the 
flamboyantly feathered forest bird glides in on a swing instead of 
being an unseen voice 
gotz friedrich staged the ring for the company he has headed 
since 1981 the ring he said concerns power money and love its 
characters and its viewers try to find solutions and a better way 
for the next generation but they do the same errors again he 
said 
after alberich steals the gold from the rhinemaidens and sets the 
nibelungs now his slaves to mine more gold his office slides 
onstage six tv sets for overseeing the work computers behind him 
an electronic console in front of him 
the mythic story in which wagner thought human truth could be 
found begins with alberich a dwarf who yearns for love invading 
the territory of the rheinmaidens who lead him on and then spurn 
him making him so angry he renounces love and steals their gold it 
ends with the death of the superhero siegfried and brunnhildes 
throwing herself on his funeral pyre her love redeeming the world 
in between is plenty of theft betrayal and murder 
ring lovers are divided over how their beloved opera should be 
staged some prefer the naturalistic setting with the valkyries 
rock looking like a mountain top as used by the metropolitan and 
san francisco operas rather than ring cycles staged according to a 
directors concept since wagners grandson staged an abstract ring 
in 1965 directorial interpretations have been the norm in 
europe 
friedrich general director of the berlin opera and set designer 
sykora created this ring in 1986 its kennedy center performances 
commemorate the 40th anniversary of the federal republic of germany 
when the ring was first completed and performed in bayreuth in 
1876 wagner said in the next year he would change everything 
friedrich said in an interview he saw that what he wrote in 
his score about the scenes was bad but in his lifetime it never 
came to a new production the tradition carried almost 80 years 
the berlin production was moving as the ring visually flowed 
like the silk cloth it lavishly used among present past and future 
the curved rafters in the tunnel looked like staves in a huge 
winecask in a bruegel painting but the entrances into the wings 
from the tunnel were metal like submarine hatches the armored 
dragon slain by siegfried moves forward like a tank with a 
searchlight between glowing red eyes after it is pierced by 
siegfrieds sword it collapses onto one wheel 
with love so important in the ring friedrich has added a bit of 
love interest not in the original text involving a giant and the 
goddess freia 
friedrich also has vietnam war images in the ring starting with 
the second opera die walkure weapons ancient and modern 
khaki and camouflage cloth abound in siegfried the third 
opera the wanderer dresses like a vietnam war correspondent in long 
trench coat 
siegfried wears bib overalls to convey innocence even after he 
weds brunnhilde its only when he meets gunther king of the 
gibichungs who is dressed like a marine officer and his 
sophisticated sister that siegfried changes to slacks and blazer 
trap doors arent used in this production when erda comes up 
from inside the earth she sits up out of a silk cloth which covers 
the stage four silk cloths are lifted and lowered by wires to make 
the waves in das rheingold 
valhalla isnt prominent either when the gods first see it it 
is small and distant when it is destroyed at the end of the ring a 
few fragments fall from the ceiling 
the rings ending usually is taken to mean that the status quo 
gods in the sky giants and heroes on earth and nibelungs who are 
miners and blacksmiths below the earth is destroyed and will be 
replaced by a better system 
friedrichs idea is that history will repeat itself the last 
image in gotterdammerung is the same as the beginning of das 
rheingold people covered with a huge white silk cloth 
some details werent immediately understandable as having loge 
god of fire dressed like a wild west gambler the earth goddess 
swimming offstage and the gibichung king in whiteface 
musically the berlin opera orchestra isnt as flexible balanced 
or strong as the metropolitan opera orchestra it is good but often 
doesnt rise to the high points and sometimes sounds tired jesus 
lopezcobos the companys music director conducted the first ring 
and christof perick conducted the second 
great wagnerian voices are nearly as scarce as heros such as 
siegfried this production is blessed with gunter von kannen who 
sang alberich and matti salminen who sang hagen in both cycles 
and in the second cycle also sang one of the giants in das 
rheingold and sieglindes husband in die walkure 
rene kollo probably the worlds current best siegfried sang 
with beauty and without strain simon estes showcased his rich voice 
as wotan in the second cycle

as soon as a stone landed near 
his car patrol leader meishe mishkan hit the brakes popped a clip 
of 25rounds into his uzi submachine gun and led other jewish 
settlers on a chase of a dozen arab teenagers 
moments later a short chubby settler with a white knitted 
skullcap was stoned from a rooftop im under attack he yelled 
crouching low pivoting on one foot and raking a nearby rooftop with 
bullets 
no one was hurt in wednesdays clash but the controversial 
settler patrols of the occupied lands have spurred accusations the 
settlers are taking too much of the law into their own hands 
the organizer of the wednesday patrol bella gonen said the 
settlers began the patrols in april after losing faith in the 
israeli armys ability to end the 18month palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule 
the army is becoming more like a group of united nations 
observers said ms gonen of kiryat arba a settlement of 4700 
jews that overlooks hebron a city with 50000 arabs they dont 
protect the jews all they do is separate the two sides 
army officials have ordered the settlers to end their patrols in 
palestinian areas its illegal and each time the army comes 
across such a patrol its dispersed immediately a spokesman said 
israeli civilians most often settlers were involved in the 
shooting deaths of 19 of the 516 palestinians killed since the 
uprising began twentytwo israelis also have died including six 
settlers 
gonen said kiryat arba settlers began car patrols this week 
which they officially refer to as archaeological expeditions to 
circumvent official objections 
wednesdays patrol slowly cruised through the winding streets of 
hebron for about a halfhour until the stone landed near mishkans 
car outside the islamic university campus 
during the clash yaakov bendavid a tall thin man in his 20s 
who is a moslem convert to judiasm carefully took aim before 
letting loose with a burst of three rounds theyre rounding the 
stone wall he shouted as he charged up a hill 
other settlers stood behind him firing their uzis at the 
palestinians who were running up the hill behind a wall sharp pops 
could be heard as the bullets ricocheted off the stones 
the encounter lasted about three minutes after which the 
settlers withdrew to their cars and the arab teens stood on a stone 
wall beyond gunfire range chanting palestinian slogans and flashing 
v for victory signs 
the problem here is the media if we chase them and run into 
their homes the press will go crazy and attack us we cant do 
anything here said settler david cohen as he climbed into his 
mudspattered blue car and rolled up the reinforced glass windows 
we are not shooting to kill but if we hit one well said 
the driver gilon bensaid shrugging his shoulders 
as he drove away bensaid broke into a chorus of the song am 
yisrael hai the nation of israel lives army troops arrived 
as the settler convoy pulled out firing tear gas between the 
palestinians and the departing settlers 
ten minutes later the group pulled up to the grave of the 
biblical prophet nathan in the nearby arab town of halhoul 
zvi katzover deputy chairman of kiryat arbas town council 
chastised his men for firing so freely and warned them to hold their 
fire if there was another confrontation 
if we start shooting and other people are chasing someone 
could end up with a bullet in his back he said 
as katzover finished speaking two jeeploads of soldiers pulled 
up the commanding officer a major demanded the settlers leave the 
area a jeep with paramilitary border police escorted the settlers 
to the gates of kiryat arba 
later settlers held a town meeting with a local army commander 
col baruch under military regulations his last name may not be 
revealed 
the meeting was scheduled following several incidents of 
vigilante raids on arab villages in reprisal for stonethrowing and 
confrontations with troops in which one officer was beaten 
a tall husky man wearing a bush hat and a pistol holster with 
extra clips of ammunition attached to its side stood up and said 
i support a family of 10 what am i suppose to do if i am 
attacked call the army and wait 
col baruch who patiently jotted down each settlers question 
during a halfhour session responded in a slow controlled voice 
no one can promise you that there will be no stones thrown in 
judea and samaria west bank 
but in no instance can people take the law into their own 
hands the best way for us to act is for people to let the army do 
its job he said

chinese students abroad are trying to extend their 
stays in their host countries because of the crisis in their 
homeland which has turned thousands of exchange students into 
potential exiles 
the chinese governments violent suppression of a studentled 
reform movement has sent a shiver around the world instilling fear 
in some students who had hoped to return home and hope in others who 
want to stay abroad 
since the june 34 military attack on unarmed students in 
beijing governments have said they would extend the visas of 
chinese students among those are the united states japan canada 
and the 12nation european economic community 
in australia the immigration department said it had received 
10000 inquiries from chinese students virtually all of the 10600 
registered in the country about extending their visas 
only a few have actually applied said immigration spokeswoman 
jenny hoskin but we expect a great deal more in coming weeks 
we would consider sympathetically the case of any student who 
could be considered in any sense in danger by returning to china 
prime minister bob hawke said thursday assuring students in 
australia they need not worry about their visas lapsing and being 
deported 
in beijing statistics show about 80000 chinese now are studying 
abroad with half of them in the united states according to the 
returned student association 
they were permitted to leave china only after passing competitive 
examinations rules published in 1987 said they had to show they 
love the motherland and cherish socialism political reliability 
and family connections relatives in china to ensure their return 
are important 
abroad many students hope to keep alive the prodemocracy 
movement but distance from the tensions in china has not allayed 
fears of government reprisals in several countries students say 
they believe they are being monitored and harassed by chinese 
authorities 
at brandeis university near boston mathematician cheng mo 26 
said he suspected the chinese government was responsible for taking 
down posters after a meeting of chinese students 
in japan a chinese student who asked not to be identified said 
diplomats had photographed demonstrations outside the chinese 
embassy in tokyo 
although they couldnt possibly identify everyone many of us 
are worrying he said 
another student in japan also asking anonymity said 
prodemocracy activists have toned down the optimism they felt two 
weeks ago 
it looks like the battle will be a long one he said none 
of us wants to do anything conspicuous but we will continue to 
fight maybe publish a magazine or something we wont make any 
needless sacrifices 
some chinese even want to move to taiwan where the mainlands 
old rulers fled after the communist revolution 
taiwans de facto embassy in tokyo said 200 chinese students had 
picked up applications for taiwanese passports and 20 had submitted 
them in the last four days 
in london the free chinese center which represents the taiwan 
government in britain has received several dozen applications for 
citizenship and we expect more to come said spokesman kate 
hanniker 
the taiwanese government announced last week it would relax its 
rules and issue taiwan passports to chinese students who had 
pariticipated in rallies in other countries supporting the 
demonstrators in beijing 
this is to show our concern for overseas mainland students we 
hope our passports will help them complete their studies in foreign 
countries said foreign ministry spokesman chen yuchu in taipei 
but holding a taiwan passport will not guarantee permanent 
residence in nationalist china he said because the countrys laws 
say mainland chinese must live four years in a free country to be 
eligible for entrance and residence on the island 
the taiwanese education ministry has proposed offering financial 
help to mainland chinese studying in other countries 
some of the 3000 chinese students in britain have expressed 
worry that their financing ends this summer said dr abraham lue 
assistant principal of kings college in london 
and so they are worried that if the situation in china prevails 
and its hazardous for them to return then theyre going to find it 
difficult to find funding and to stay on here longer he told the 
bbc

stung by a series of corruption 
allegations black leaders across alabama are accusing federal 
authorities of racial harassment but one us attorney says he and 
his colleagues are equalopportunity prosecutors 
richard arrington a former college professor serving his third 
term as birminghams first black mayor said federal agents tried to 
frame him through a developer who faces tax bribery charges and 
other black officials say their phones have been tapped or they have 
been the target of unjustified investigations 
at arringtons request a special state prosecutor has been named 
to review the actions of the federal agents and the federal 
governments own office that investigates bias allegations against 
law enforcement authorities is looking into the matter the senate 
judiciary committee staff is also reviewing the allegations 
blacks in alabama began flexing ballot box strength after passage 
of the 1965 voting rights act and now hold more than 1000 elective 
offices in the state including 24 of the 141 seats in the alabama 
legislature 
three black legislators from the birmingham area are under 
indictment on federal charges they tried to bribe a former 
legislator who is white in connection with a proposed dog track 
their attorneys contend race bias was a factor that led to their 
indictment 
thomas reed the state naacp president was convicted of federal 
bribery charges in september and stripped of his seat in the state 
house he was accused of accepting 10000 to use his influence to 
get early parole for a convicted killer reed contends his 
prosecution was spurred by his high profile opposition to the flying 
of the confederate flag atop the capitol 
those cases and reports of fbi surveillance of other blacks 
amount to selective harassment according to arrington and others 
fred gray a black attorney who is a veteran of the civil rights 
movement said the actions are part of a pattern that began with 
president reagans arrival at the white house eight years ago and 
continues under president bush 
all of this is a conspiracy on the part of the administration 
to destroy black leadership and black political power gray said 
state sen hank sanders a democrat claims that more than half 
the black elected officials in the state are under investigation or 
surveillance 
but us attorney jim wilson of montgomery said the justice 
department is colorblind 
were equalopportunity prosecutors he said well 
prosecute any crook in the district any time 
at birmingham us attorney frank donaldson said the harassment 
accusations were too absurd to deserve comment 
as for sanders claim that half of the black officials are 
targets of some kind of investigation it doesnt ring true to 
me said gerald shockley an fbi spokesman 
at arringtons request state attorney general don siegelman 
named a special prosecutor to investigate actions of the fbi and the 
internal revenue service arrington said he wanted a determination 
of whether agents engaged in criminal solicitation conspiracy 
attempted bribery andor obstruction of birminghams government 
sen howell heflin dala a member of the us senate judiciary 
committee said wednesday that the panels staff is making a 
preliminary investigation and a decision will be made later on 
whether to refer the matter to the full committee 
the assistant counsel for the office of professional 
responsibility in washington david bobzien said he and an 
investigator will visit birmingham next week to conduct interviews 
in response to a request by arringtons attorney 
bobziens office was created in 1975 to look into complaints 
about employees of the justice department and other investigative 
agencies 
it was disclosed this week that arrington has been a subject of 
fbi scrutiny at various times dating back to 1972 when he was a city 
councilman supporting blacks alleging police brutality 
the fbi investigated arrington for possible bribery and financial 
conflicts of interest involving his business partners but no charges 
have been filed the mayor was interviewed by the fbi in 1985 
a report thursday in the birmingham postherald also said that a 
new series of courtsanctioned fbi wiretaps has been used to monitor 
the telephone conversations of at least two members of the jefferson 
county legislative delegation reps john rogers and pat davis 
fbi wiretaps were used last year in the investigation that led to 
the indictments in the dog track case 
fbi spokesman tom moore declined to comment on the latest 
wiretaps 
i have been operating on the assumption that the phone was 
tapped rogers said i resent the investigation i havent done 
anything 
mark polson a lawyer representing ms davis said he did not 
have the foggiest idea why her phone was tapped but says it is 
more than a coincidence that it is the black politicians who are 
catching all the heat

a half dozen 8yearolds sat 
on the floor of a makeshift classroom in this west bank village and 
leafed through a science book on animals some drew palestinian 
flags in the margins but none could read the simple text 
if they were in school theyd be able to read by now said 
najah mahmoud the childrens 15yearold teacher im trying to 
get them to memorize some words but it just isnt enough 
illiteracy is growing among the west banks 230000 elementary 
school children who have been deprived of an education for 16 
months as a result of israels closure of schools classrooms have 
remained empty for all but a few weeks since feb 3 1988 
israeli authorities say they closed the west banks 1194 
schools including 145 kindergartens because they were breeding 
grounds for violent protests during the 18month palestinian 
uprising fifteen schools in the gaza strip also have been closed 
but the army has not shut down the entire system 
israel has come under increasing international pressure 
including a call from us secretary of state james a baker iii to 
end what many consider a collective punishment and to reopen classes 
when the closure order comes up for renewal on monday 
we would like to see the schools open but without an escalation 
of violence and without an increase in danger that children would be 
injured in the process thats our concern and mr bakers concern 
as well foreign minister moshe arens said in an interview 
to try to keep students from falling too far behind palestinians 
have been running underground classes in more than 100 west bank 
towns and villages in defiance of army orders outlawing such 
alternative education 
the lessons are taught in unused buildings mosques churches or 
even in the open air shaded by a tree but according to arab 
educators these socalled peoples schools have produced mixed 
results 
the problem we face now is illiteracy said khalil mahshi 
principal of the quakerrun friends school in ramallah instead of 
consolidating reading skills at ages 7 to 9 we are dealing with 
children as old as 9 years old who are illiterate 
malashi said some children from poorer families who have taken 
on unskilled jobs to supplement meager family incomes may become 
permanent dropouts and wealthy palestinians concerned about the 
educational prospects for their children are leaving for the united 
states and europe 
long term the community is going to pay a price at the level 
of development production and skilled manpower this is the biggest 
asset of any society he said 
the secondgraders studying in a cramped oneroom stone house in 
kafr ein a village of 1000 about 25 miles north of jerusalem 
spent a recent science class drawing pictures of donkeys chickens 
and camels 
samir a darkeyed 7yearold carefully sketched two outlawed 
palestinian flags onto the hump of his camel id like to be able 
to read it is important he said in a small serious voice 
instead i can draw a palestinian flag 
grades one through six in kafr ein study two hours each day 
doubling up two classes at a time on opposite sides of the room 
there are no classes for the upper grades and the only teaching 
materials in evidence were two tattered primarylevel science books 
some colored markers and two chalkboards 
but teaching materials werent the only thing missing the 
secondgraders 15yearold teacher miss mahmoud only in 9th grade 
herself conceded she has no teaching qualifications 
what i can give them is better than nothing but it cant 
compare with what theyd be learning in school she said 
besides teaching basic arabic and math to her fourthgrade class 
instructor manah abbas 20 teaches a new subject called national 
education ordered in april by uprising leaders linked to the plo 
i teach them about the intefadeh and how not to be afraid of 
the soldiers when they come to the village said miss abbas who 
wore an enamel necklace showing all palestine including israel 
painted in the colors of the outlawed palestinian flag

europe some christians have been offended by scorseses portrayal 
of jesus christ as a human being with passions and weaknesses 
in reversing the ban thursday the fivejudge panel said it was 
not enough that the movie is likely to stir up opposition or even 
offense against a portion of those who choose to see it 
amnon globus of golanglobus cannon the films israeli 
distributors who appealed the case to the supreme court said its 
decision signaled the end of censorship in israel

not is the public said globus

panamas leader manuel antonio noriega has 
deposited at least 50 million in secret bank accounts since 1982 
according to documents seized in a money laundering investigation 
nbc news reports 
the network reported thursday that the documents were seized in 
october in london by british authorities after noriegas bank the 
bank of credit and commerce was indicted in the drug money case in 
florida 
british authorities this week gave us investigators more than 
1000 documents and show that the panamanian general controlled up 
to seven secret accounts according to nbc 
according to the documents noriega deposited at least 50 
million since he opened the accounts seven years ago while his army 
salary was about 50000 a year nbc said 
in one transaction 27 million of noriegas money was 
transferred out of a secret account in london to one in luxembourg 
just one day after noriega was indicted on drug charges in the 
united states according to the report 
authorities whom nbc did not identify said one key document is a 
letter from noriega to his banker amjad awan instructing him that 
the accounts must be kept secret and that no bank statements ever be 
sent to noriega in panama 
nbc said authorities believe that most of the money came from 
noriegas dealings with colombian drug bosses international arms 
dealers and the cia which reportedly had noriega on its payroll 
the bank of credit and commerce international was charged in 
tampa fla in october 1988 with laundering millions of dollars in

a teenager charged in the firebombing death 
of a baby has become a focus of disputes about racial justice the 
death penalty for juveniles and whether washington is imposing its 
legal standards on alabama 
the district of columbia court of appeals is expected to decide 
soon whether alabama can extradite the black 17yearold known in 
court documents only as om because of his juvenile status 
prosecutors deny race has anything to do with the matter and the 
babys relatives and an naacp official agree 
it doesnt make any difference to me what color somebody is 
black white or polka dot said district attorney jimmy 
hedgespeth what a lot of folks are not saying is that the victim 
of this crime was black there is no place on my docket for white or 
black it doesnt matter to me 
om was charged with murder and arson in the death of 
14monthold tamel jackson the baby died in a kitchen blaze on the 
night of may 12 1988 after a plastic jug of gasoline was tossed 
into his apartment at a housing project where a relative had been 
involved in a fight 
the teenagers grandmother testified at a court hearing in 
washington that the white authorities in etowah county a mostly 
rural area that includes the steel city of gadsden have a 
longstanding vendetta against her family the youths father and 
uncle died in police custody she said 
washington police captured the boy in december only after his 
grandmother alyce guice thomas was jailed for 82 days last summer 
by an etowah county judge for failing to produce the teenager in 
court she said he disappeared the night of the fire after police 
released him to her custody the jailing set off small civil rights 
demonstrations in gadsden 
the district of columbia council passed legislation may 30 
intended to block the teenagers return to gadsden for 90 days 
council members said extradition would violate the districts ban on 
the death penalty because if om is convicted in alabama he could 
face execution in the electric chair 
the us supreme court has heard arguments but not yet ruled on a 
challenge to the death penalty for those who were minors when they 
committed crimes the alabama boy was 16 at the time of tamels 
death 
a superior court judge in washington ruled march 30 that om 
should be returned to alabama but the extradition was delayed until 
after his appeal which could make the councils action moot 
hedgespeth would not say what he has decided about whether to 
seek the death penalty 
theyre fanning enough flames up there in washington he 
said im just sitting here keeping my mouth shut 
he said county blacks who gave him 90 percent of their vote when 
he was elected asked two things of me that i prosecute 
blackonblack crime just like anybody else and that i not 
systematically strike blacks from juries 
he said that in his 2 years in the office he has followed both 
requests 
sol reynolds tamels uncle said race has nothing to do with the 
charges against the 17yearold 
if they want to talk about being mistreated the baby was the 
one mistreated because he is dead and gone reynolds said 
tamels grandmother emma nell rutledge said she wants whoever 
killed the baby to get what they deserve 
three people all black have been charged with arson and murder 
yul devoe guice 31 who is suspected of throwing the plastic jug of 
gasoline into the project apartment is in the county jail the 
other alleged accomplice has not been found 
spencer thomas a gadsden physician who heads the local chapter 
of the national association for the advancement of colored people 
said he believes om would get as fair a trial at home as anywhere 
it seems to me we all want to see justice dealt out thomas 
said i havent gotten the opinion that we are any better or worse 
off than some of the other areas in the country

the teenager sat gingerly at the witness table 
and spoke so softly that the congressmen had trouble hearing her 
but there was nothing gentle or innocent in the tale she told of 
children carrying guns to carry out the drug trade 
you can get guns on the street just about as easily as you can 
get candy detra j of the district of columbia whose last name 
was not revealed told the house select committee on children youth 
and families on thursday 
everyone knows how to get a gun if they want one the guns 
range from 22s to 9 millimeters to uzis 
generally she said the youngsters get their guns from the drug 
traffickers for whom they work 
if they hustle for a person hes a runner or a hit man hes 
getting a gun to carry out the orders the man has given him said 
detra 18 
the hearing on children and guns occurred one day after florida 
gov bob martinez asked state lawmakers for a law that would punish 
people who leave firearms within reach of children 
pediatrician katherine k christoffel of chicago representing 
the american academy of pediatrics painted a grim picture for the 
panel 
ten american children ages 18 and under are killed every day in 
handgun suicides homicides and accidents she said three or 
four times as many are wounded one of every 25 admissions to 
american pediatric trauma centers is due to gunshot wounds in 1987 
gun injuries were the fourthleading cause of unintentionalinjury 
death for children ages 14 and under for innercity black 
adolescent boys and young men firearm injuries are the leading 
cause of death 
but gary kleck an associate professor of criminology at florida 
state university said accidental shootings of innocent bystanders 
are extremely rare that the involvement of guns in youth 
suicide has fallen since 1979 and that fatal gun accidents 
involving youths as well as for all people have been declining for 
20 years 
nevertheless detra said she knows eight people who have been 
shot to death and more who have been wounded of those killed she 
said half had guns and were in a gunfight and half of them were 
innocent bystanders 
drugrelated killings have given washington the nations highest 
per capita murder rate so far this year 202 murders have been 
committed in the district compared to 133 at this time last year 
most have been drugrelated police say 
the lure of dramatic monetary rewards in the drug trade inspires 
youngsters to get involved even when they see friends killed said 
detra who graduated from high school last year and now works for a 
local recreation program to keep young people off the streets 
they get involved because they want fast money to buy cars 
jewelry and radios they dont get jobs because the pay is too 
low she said 
youngsters look at the hustlers as role models in part 
because they have money and in part because they are nice to the 
young children she said 
detra said one way to curtail youthful involvement in the drug 
trade is to offer better jobs at better wages she also said 
youngsters need alternative role models other adults who are 
willing to talk and spend time with younger children 
meanwhile she dismissed many ideas offered by lawmakers as ways 
to deter young people from getting access to guns 
holding parents liable for their childrens use of weapons will 
fail because theres not too many youth today who talk to their 
parents she said its not a family bond anymore and parents 
dont have control over their drugdealing children 
fear of arrest and a substantial prison term for carrying a 
firearm also wont deter those in the drug trade because they feel 
its not going to happen to me she said 
the only thing that might change their minds is if authorities 
lock them up so they understand its not so easy to carry a gun 
and get away with it theyre not going to believe it until they 
see it 
passing laws making it more difficult to buy guns legally also 
wont work detra said the district of columbia has one of the 
toughest gun control laws in the country yet young people have no 
trouble obtaining them illegally she said

mikhail s gorbachevs fourday visit 
to west germany was enveloped by good feelings and kind words that 
will be difficult to translate into personal political gain 
both the soviet president and west german chancellor helmut kohl 
face an array of domestic difficulties that cannot be washed away by 
several days of friendly highprofile meetings 
although gorbachevs great popularity abroad adds to his prestige 
and the status of the soviet union it has not touched fundamental 
problems that trouble millions of soviets a continued lack of food 
and consumer goods housing shortages and stifling bureaucracy 
kohl and his christian democratic party have suffered in state 
elections the past two years losing control of major west german 
cities the chancellor is accused of mishandling recent 
controversies such as the disclosure of a west german role in an 
alleged libyan chemical weapons plant and the nato furor over 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
the summit produced a historic joint declaration of goals for 
easing tensions in europe and boosted trust and confidence between 
soviets and west germans 
but it was devoted mostly to creating a positive atmosphere and 
skirted sensitive issues like the future of divided germany and 
differing approaches to disarmament 
after years when their tottering leaders were an embarrassment 
soviets have become accustomed to seeing foreign crowds cheering 
their leader 
gorbachev remains popular at home but many soviets are beginning 
to question when and if his reform policies will improve living 
standards 
while he was away other soviet officials were struggling with 
what has become a chronic problem an outbreak of violence between 
ethnic groups this time in the central asian republic of uzbekistan 
reasons for the unrest are not clear but some blame an economic 
collapse caused by overcrowding and unemployment 
in west germany gorbachev continually stressed the theme of 
cooperation if the two countries do cooperate more closely it 
could help the soviet union in two ways 
a lessening of military tension would allow moscow to turn more 
of its industrial potential to producing consumer goods gorbachev 
has said he needs a lessening of international tension to devote 
more resources to the ailing economy 
gorbachev invited finance and industry leaders in cologne to help 
convert soviet defense industries that offers another avenue to 
improving the soviet economy increased investment by west german 
business 
west germany is the soviet unions largest western trading 
partner and businessmen showed the soviet leader a dazzling array 
of high technology 
but gorbachev stressed that he did not come as a beggar he 
emphasized cooperation proposing to merge the soviet unions 
abilities in basic scientific research with west german technology 
for the benefit of both sides 
kohls problems are of an entirely different nature but no less 
threatening 
his party currently polls less support than the leftist social 
democrats and risks losing national elections in december 1990 
kohls slide was arrested somewhat after the even higherprofile 
visit two weeks ago of president bush with whom he was photographed 
frequently during a summit that lasted less than two days 
bush came to west germany immediately after the nato summit in 
brussels on may 2930 at which washington and bonn were able to 
mend fences after a monthslong dispute over negotiating with the 
east bloc to reduce shortrange rockets 
having salvaged a compromise from a confrontation that threatened 
alliance unity kohl was riding high during the bush visit his 
three sessions with gorbachev also likely boosted his prestige 
ralf fuecks a leader of the farleft greens party remarked 
after the summit that chancellor kohl had tried to sun himself in 
gorbachevs glow 
the effects should be apparent this weekend 
kohls party is running candidates for top posts in 
rhinelandpalatine and saarland states sunday as well as european 
parliament elections

a twostate coal miners wildcat strike 
escalated thursday with roving pickets expanding their walkout to 
the northern west virginia coal field company officials said 
i think what were seeing is its pretty much spreading said 
island creek coal co spokesman noel jones 
island creeks southern west virginia mines employing about 190 
have been shut down since monday as striking workers ignore a 
federal judges backtowork order 
on thursday the walkout spread to island creeks grant county 
mines employing 625 and its nicholas county mines where 250 
miners work jones said 
all bethenergy mines inc west virginia mines were shut down 
idling about 600 workers in boone nicholas and barbour counties 
said company president rj fisher 
estimates of the number of miners idled by the wildcat range up 
to 10000 
the walkout began monday as a show of solidarity with 1600 
united mine workers members in west virginia and virginia on strike 
since april against the pittston coal group 
umw members at pittston had been working for 14 months without a 
contract in particular workers are angry that the company dropped 
out of the unions national contract with the bituminous coal 
operators association in an attempt to wring favorable workrule 
changes 
union officials have not returned phone calls this week but they 
have said they did not authorize the walkouts which violate a 
nostrike clause in the unions 1988 national contract with the bcoa 
bcoa chairman robert quenon on thursday called on umw leadership 
to end the walkout saying any hopes the strike will make other 
companies pressure pittston to settle on a contract are misguided 
i would no more try to tell someone else how to run their 
company than i would expect someone else to try to tell me how to 
run my company said quenon president of peabody holding co the 
nations largest coal producer 
in washington us rep nick joe rahall dwva called for 
pittston and new beckley mining co also the object of a umw 
contract strike to settle with the union 
these companies are doing a grave disservice to those coal 
operators who negotiated in good faith and signed agreements with 
the umwa rahall said 
by refusing to come to terms with their workers these 
companies are creating an atmosphere in the coal fields which is not 
conducive to the type of stability and security of supply the 
purchasers of our coal have come to expect 
rahall also offered encouragement to three top union officials 
who have been jailed without bond in roanoke va for orchestrating 
picketline civil disobedience in the pittston strike 
and to those who have been jailed for no act of violence but 
for exercising your constitutional rights i say do not despair 
rahall said 
the strike also spread thursday to bargeloading operations along 
the kanawha river in the charleston area several operators along 
the river reported that pickets manned entrances to their 
facilities some continued to move coal while others could not 
umw pickets appeared briefly at amherst industries inc near 
charleston where 17 united steelworkers members failed to report to 
work a spokesman said about 18 pickets in front of hatfield dock 
and transfer inc in marmet kept a halfdozen employees from going 
to work one employee said 
madison coal and supply inc tied up three tugboats thursday 
idling 31 employees said bill barr manager of marine traffic he 
said he expects more layoffs if the wildcats continue 
this is going to put the whole state into an economic crisis 
barr said 
the walkout hasnt hurt west virginias economy yet but the pain 
threshhold could be near for some areas state energy department 
spokeswoman twila matheny said 
when youre talking about your heavier coal producing counties 
and 90 percent of their mines closed we could be near that now 
she said 
lawyers for seven coal companies filed damage lawsuits in federal 
court wednesday naming the umw and several locals in southern west 
virginia as defendants 
several companies said they are suffering daily losses of as much 
as 97000 because of the strike 
there is a 100 percent chance of a sympathy strike in 
alabama said united mine workers international executive board 
member tommy buchanan whose district 20 includes most of the state 
buchanan however said but umw president richard trumka would 
make the final decision on any walkout there are an estimated 6500 
miners in the state most of them union members

skeptical southern baptists and las vegans sized 
each other up this week as the town some have dubbed sin city played 
unlikely host to the passionate opponents of gambling and drinking 
stan pritchett a delegate to the southern baptist convention 
and cabbie don capaldi termed the threeday event a draw with eyes 
opening on both sides of what has been called the meeting of the 
high rollers and the holy rollers 
the gathering for the nations largest protestant denomination 
ended thursday 
theyre nice decent people they even gave me a bible said 
capaldi as hundreds of baptists passed out bibles and imparted their 
faith to tourists and residents i dont think they can do much 
about our image or our thinking 
down the neonbathed thoroughfare known as the strip pritchett 
approached tourists who hurried between casinos wednesday to beat 
the 100degreeplus heat 
the people have been generally very friendly said pritchett 
of pensacola fla we thought people would look at us like a calf 
looks at a new gate generally the people have been very friendly 
the atmosphere here is like almost any place except for the 
gambling 
ted wakeman pastor of the first southern baptist church in 
fallon 380 miles to the northwest said he takes exception to the 
image rap 
i get a little upset with the people who came here from back 
east and are badmouthing nevada wakeman said 
a lot of people thought theyd come here and find a lot of 
people gambling and drunk said annette edwards of nashville 
tenn who tended one of the booths in the exhibit hall thats 
just the impression people who live outside of here have but it 
wasnt like that at all 
i would think from all ive heard that the convention would 
look with favor on our returning to las vegas in the future said 
al shackleford the southern baptist conventions vice president for 
public relations i have heard nothing but good reports about the 
people of las vegas 
at the stardust hotel and casino spokesman jim seagrave said 
slot machine play for the hotel was down considerably for the week 
outside on the strip one of the baptists earlier this week 
approached jeri martinez a tourist from escondido calif 
have you met jesus the man asked 
you mean in person she responded surprised by the question 
no in your heart he replied 
yes i have in my heart ms martinez answered 
he handed her a book titled heres hope jesus cares for you 
i guess it was a nice gesture she said 
the title of the book was emblazoned on billboards across las 
vegas for weeks prior to the convention 
pages of the las vegas phone book were distributed so that the 
20423 convention delegates and others could pray for the citys 
700000 residents 
some 1800 baptists fanned out across the city last weekend 
knocking on doors in a mission to save souls they reported polite 
response 
i think theyre going to be surprised when they find were just 
a normal city like any other city mayor ron lurie had promised 
before the convention 
some members of a southern baptist advance team who have been 
here since january preparing for the convention said theyd found a 
different city than they expected 
i really have been impressed with las vegas said stanley 
clark a church volunteer weve been in a lot of other cities 
that to use a term are more sin city than las vegas is

china has always been difficult to figure out 
but as the repression in beijing rolls on president bush isnt much 
easier to read than the most inscrutable leaders who have guided the 
worlds most populous nation 
bush comes to his job with double training in chinese affairs he 
headed the us liaison office in beijing and is a former director 
of the central intelligence agency 
his experience in these and other posts helped put him in the 
white house figuring out what goes on behind the bamboo curtain in 
beijing is expected of the president based on his background and the 
data flowing to his desk from us diplomatic and intelligence 
sources 
and yet nearly two weeks after hundreds of prodemocracy 
students were gunned down in tiananmen square the president and 
secretary of state james a baker iii still seem to be waiting for 
the other shoe to drop 
there is no indication they have an overall strategy for dealing 
with china or that they have come to any conclusions about what to 
expect next 
bush in two news conference and baker sporadically through his 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler have chided top chinese officials 
for suppressing dissent and otherwise violating international 
standards of human rights 
the criticism has been mild bush suspended military sales to 
china and baker taking the advice of ambassador james lilley urged 
americans to leave the country those too were minimal actions 
undersecretary of state robert kimmitt on wednesday called in 
chinese ambassador han xu to protest the ordered expulsion of 
reporters from the associated press and voice of america from 
beijing white house spokesman marlin fitzwater defended the 
journalists right to report the news 
thats not a difficult or very imaginative stand to take 
but the administration did not retaliate by ordering the 
expulsion of any of the 25 chinese journalists in washington there 
was no us titfortat diplomacy the usual response to expulsions 
of american diplomats or reporters 
congress meanwhile has been relatively feisty on wednesday 67 
senators including both the republican and democratic leadership 
signed a letter to prime minister li peng urging him to release 
jailed chinese student leaders 
on thursday at a house hearing several lawmakers criticized the 
state department for what they said was a sluggish evacuation of 
americans some said they helped constituents out of china while the 
state department while still contemplating the situation 
many americans businesses had ordered their workers to leave 
before the department made its move on tuesday 
rep rod chandler rwash said in a crisis in which the 
lives of us citizens are in danger i believe protection of 
americans must be the highest priority clearly this was not the 
case in china this month 
bush set the tone for his gentle policy toward china at a news 
conference june 5 two days after the carnage in tiananmen square 
when he said he did not intend to respond emotionally to events in 
beijing 
bush said the students struggling for democracy would be hurt if 
the united states went beyond cutting military ties with china 
i dont want to see a total break in this relationship and i 
will not encourage a total break he said 
to this day us diplomatic and economic ties to china are 
intact ambassador lilley has not been recalled for 
consultations a traditional signal of disapproval the staff at 
the us embassy in beijing and at four consulates through the 
country has not been trimmed 
the supposition is that bush and baker are holding back on the 
theory the situation in beijing is stabilizing that the chinese 
leadership will forgo further excesses 
but on thursday three chinese were sentenced to death in 
connection with the burning of a train and the beating of security 
officials during prodemocracy demonstrations in shanghai these 
were the first announced death sentences since army troops went into 
action in tiananmen square 
state television in beijing meanwhile showed reputed protest 
leaders being crowded into police vans their heads shaven and signs 
dangling from their necks describing their alleged crimes 
in less than two weeks the chinese government has reported 
arresting more than 1000 people in a nationwide crackdown 
under presidents carter and reagan enormous pressure was exerted 
on the soviet union china was spared as deng xiaoping appeared to 
be steering his country toward both political and economic reform 
and yet the student rebellion and the crackdown did not come 
out of the blue 
li peng had spoken out repeatedly against student demands for 
greater democracy they do not realize that capitalism is not 
feasible in china he said after protests in the winter of 198687 
hope more than fact nurtured the notion in america that deng 
xiaoping and his heirs were secretly supporting democratic trends

southern baptists wrapped up their first stay in 
this gambling city by urging states to enact legislation restricting 
abortions except to save the mothers life 
the nations largest protestant body also approved resolutions 
thursday condemning past racism within its ranks and calling for an 
end to happy hours at taverns throughout the nation 
the resolutions were approved at the end of the threeday 
southern baptist convention that attracted 20423 delegates 
baptist officials said it was the sixth largest baptist 
convention in 132 years despite fears that many would stay away 
because of concerns over the sin city image of las vegas and its 
distance from traditional baptist strongholds 
the convention rejected arguments that abortions should be 
permitted in cases of rape or incest or if the fetus is severely 
deformed 
one delegate objected that the resolution would call for abortion 
laws that require moral heroism 
we do though want to say we do not want to victimize the child 
in the womb because evil things have happened to bring that child 
into the womb said mark coppenger chairman of the denominations 
committee on resolutions 
the resolution noted that a us supreme court decision is 
pending that may reopen the possibility of broader state 
restrictions on abortion 
it also reaffirmed the support of the 148 millionmember 
denomination for a constitutional amendment to prohibit abortion 
except to prevent the imminent death of the mother 
the convention formed in 1845 in a dispute with northern 
baptists over slavery said in a resolution on racism that the 
denomination repents of past bigotry it called for members and 
churches to reach across racial boundaries establishing fraternal 
rather than paternal friendships 
the resolution also called upon the predominantly white 
denomination to bring about greater racial and ethnic representation 
at every level of the church about 300000 southern baptists are 
black 
the denomination stopped short of approving an amendment 
condemning apartheid in south africa because of concerns it would 
hurt evangelistic efforts there 
the racism issue arose in the denomination last fall when a 
member of the christian life commission dr curtis w caine sr 
reportedly said in a commission meeting that the late rev martin 
luther king jr was a fraud baptist press reported caine also said 
apartheid in south africa doesnt exist anymore and was beneficial 
when it did because it meant separate development 
delegates also approved a resolution on drunken driving that 
seeks increased excise taxes on alcohol no more use of celebrities 
to promote drinking and the elimination of happy hours in which 
drinks are discounted

ambassadorial nominee donald gregg ended his 
confirmation hearings by insisting he was unaware until december 
1986 of oliver norths secret resupply operation to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua but a leading democrat says hes unconvinced 
gregg asserted thursday he didnt tell thenvice president bush 
about the resupply network because gregg didnt learn the extent of 
norths involvement until two months after one of the networks 
planes was shot down in october 1986 
gregg told the senate foreign relations committee that had he 
known about the resupply effort he would have taken steps to stop 
the operation 
the panel of 10 democrats and nine republicans will vote tuesday 
on whether to recommend to the full senate that the cias former 
station chief in seoul be confirmed as ambassador to south korea 
gregg had been bushs national security adviser when he was vice 
president 
committee members said the vote is likely to be close although 
there were indications at least one democrat on the panel might vote 
for gregg democrats repeatedly challenged greggs credibility and 
said his alleged lack of judgment disqualifies him for confirmation 
as an ambassador 
sen charles robb dva said through a spokeswoman that 
barring evidence of lying or perjury he is leaning toward 
confirmation 
he wants to review all of the evidence and he plans to make a 
conscientious decision said spokeswoman julia sutherland 
at the hearing sen alan cranston dcalif referred to a 
twopage january 1985 memo to north which according to cranston 
showed that felix rodriguez a longtime friend with whom gregg was 
in frequent contact was involved with the contras 
the memo was dated several days after rodriguez met with bush and 
gregg in the vice presidents office gregg said he couldnt 
remember whether north also attended what turned out to be the first 
of three meetings between rodriguez and bush 
gregg testified that contra resupply was absolutely not 
discussed at the january meeting 
gregg who said he sent rodriguez to el salvador to assist that 
countrys military insisted he first learned rodriguez had 
something to do with the contras in august 1986 thats when 
rodriguez complained that crooked arms merchants were gouging the 
contras in a scandal he said could become another watergate 
gregg says he didnt tell bush but rather convened a meeting 
four days later with representatives of various agencies including 
the cia and national security council north didnt attend even 
though gregg asked that he do so 
but gregg asserted he didnt learn of the extent of norths 
involvement in the operation until december 1986 when he said 
rodriguez detailed it for him 
north had contacted gregg to complain about rodriguez not using 
secure communications equipment and about allegedly stealing a plane 
belonging to the contras but gregg said he failed to conclude from 
those incidents or the august 1986 meeting that north was running a 
resupply operation or that rodriguez was part of it 
in december 1986 rodriguez telephoned gregg and told him he and 
north had agreed to keep gregg in the dark 
gregg said he was furious with north and felt very let 
down by rodriguez i faulted myself for not putting the pieces 
together gregg said 
you are trying to convince us of an elaborate conspiracy to 
keep gregg from knowing about contra assistance run by north said 
cranston 
north and courier robert owen knew about rodriguez role as did 
us ambassador thomas pickering and col james steele in el 
salvador so why didnt you know asked cranston 
thats a pretty sweeping assertion responded gregg who said 
at least two us military officials who dealt with rodriguez in 
central america testified they didnt know he was involved in the 
resupply network 
cranston said he regards greggs performance thursday as no more 
complete or satisfactory than his testimony at the first round of 
his confirmation hearing in may 
in may cranston accused gregg of sponsoring a freelance 
covert operation out of the vice presidents office to help 
resupply the contras during a congressional ban on military aid to 
the rebel force

scientists in boston are learning to treat jet 
lag insomnia and other symptoms of a jangled body clock with 
carefully controlled doses of ordinary light 
dr charles czeisler and colleagues at the brigham and womens 
hospital in boston reported today that they succeeded in 
consistently resetting the body clocks of test subjects using timed 
exposures to a light about as bright as the rising sun their 
account of the experiments was published in science magazine 
czeisler said the wakerest cycles of the subjects could be moved 
forward or back with ease but the changes lack the precision needed 
for a useful therapy for jet setters or for those with troubled 
sleep 
but eventually he said the study will develop the techniques 
needed to use light to change the body clock and relieve the wilting 
weariness many feel when their life style is out of phase with the 
sun 
czeisler said the research proved conclusively that light can 
send a signal to the brain to reset the biological clock 
when such light shows up at the wrong time it jumbles the bodys 
wakesleep cycle called the circadian rhythm airline travelers 
know this disorder as jet lag but its also a problem for night 
shift workers and for thousands of people with sleep disorders said 
czeisler 
many airline schedules aggravate jet lag he said because 
travelers are forced to cross many time zones in darkness and arrive 
at their destination just as the sun comes up 
when you leave here to fly overnight to london the flight 
arrives over there at 6 or 7 in the morning he said when you 
go outside you are getting an exposure to light that is resetting 
you in exactly the opposite direction than what you wish to be set 
it is resetting you for hawaii instead of europe 
czeisler said a flight that arrives in europe later in the day 
would be easier on the body clock but not enough is known yet about 
the effects of light on human circadian rhythm to adjust travel 
times precisely 
the system is much more complicated than we previously 
thought he said 
to better understand the body clock czeisler and other 
investigators put 14 young men into a darkened laboratory free of 
any external time cues and then exposed them to light from 
fluorescent lamps that mimicked the intensity of the dawning sun 
czeisler said the researchers found they could reset the body 
clock of the test subjects in any direction depending on when the 
light was applied 
he said exposure at one part of the cycle would move the body 
clock backward an eastward time shift while exposure at another 
time would have the opposite effect exposure at some points in the 
biological day said czeisler would cause no change 
circadian cycles of the test subjects were determined by 
measurements of body temperature hormone levels kidney function 
and alertness all of which are affected by the body clock 
unlike travelers they were exposed only to the light called for 
in the experiment czeisler said all light exposure durations 
intensities and frequencies influence the body clock 
czeisler said its now believed that light striking the retina of 
the eye sends a signal down a nerve pathway to the hypothalamus in 
the brain this organ which can control sleep alertness and other 
body functions seems to be reset daily by light 
this is the reason czeisler said that night shift workers who 
commute home at dawn may spend years trying to adjust to their work 
schedule 
the morning light resets their internal clock in a way that 
keeps their body scheduled to be dayactive and asleep at night 
even if they are trying to do the opposite they may spend their 
careers fighting their internal biological clock he said 
science which published a report of the study is the journal of 
the american association for the advancement of science 
coinvestigators in the study were richard e kronauer james s 
allan jeanne f duffy megan e jewett emery n brown and joseph 
m ronda all associated with harvard university

three recovering soviet alcoholics are 
returning home from a twomonth tour of the united states with best 
wishes from president bushs physician and cheers from thousands of 
american comrades in alcoholics anonymous 
about 20000 aa members they met during their crosscountry 
travels autographed a copy of alcoholics anonymous the 
50yearold bible of the selfhelp organization and they plan to 
present the book to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
victor 42 sasha 43 and volodya 37 who follow the aa 
tradition in refusing to use their last names belong to a fledgling 
aa group called moscow beginners which held its first meeting 
in august 1987 
the 40 members of the group meet every night of the week in the 
soviet capital to help each other maintain their newfound sobriety 
the three members who have toured the united states since april 10 
were astonished to find so many aa members an estimated 835500 
last year 
but the 12step aa program of recovery from alcoholism is the 
same in both countries they discovered 
this program treats the spiritual soul of man victor a 
moscow cinematographer told a news conference thursday at the 
national press club 
it is a paradox he said but with the recovery of the 
spirit a person can be healed of the disease 
the rev jw canty an episcopal priest from new york who helped 
start the moscow group credited gorbachevs liberal reform policies 
for allowing aa to flourish in the soviet union 
without gorbachev aa would have to function underground 
said canty chairman of the nonprofit sovietus joint conference 
on alcoholism drug addiction and peace in moscow and organizer of 
the tour 
altogether there are fewer than 100 soviet aa members its 
very small but its a beginning canty said its working 
slowly but well if you can save even one life thats an enormous 
contribution 
since they arrived in new york the three soviets have attended 
scores of aa meetings including one in california that drew 1100 
people and visited alcoholism treatment centers across the 
country from massachusetts to texas 
they also met with such celebrities as betty ford and kitty 
dukakis both recovering alcoholics nancy reagan lady bird johnson 
and dr burton lee the white house physician who applauded their 
aa membership 
at their meeting at the white house on monday the soviet 
visitors gave lee a moscow beginners lapel button which he 
promised to pin on the presidents jacket even though bush is only a 
moderate social drinker 
they will end their us tour this weekend in atlanta with a 
side trip to plains ga where they will attend a sunday school 
class led by former president carter 
perestroika is a very popular word now in my country victor 
told reporters referring to gorbachevs policy of restructuring the 
soviet economy 
we alcoholics can restructure ourselves and become better 
happier persons he said i am rebuilding my life

civil rights activists are accusing the supreme 
court of redneck justice and urging congress to stem what they 
say is a reactionary tide threatening 35 years of progress for 
minorities and women 
the courts ruling thursday on a racial harassment case is one of 
several new decisions showing that a newly solidified conservative 
majority on the court is intent on carrying out former president 
ronald reagans agenda civil and womens rights groups say 
the court by a 54 vote barred the use of a key 1866 civil 
rights law to fight racial harassment but the justices voted 
unanimously to uphold use of the law originally intended to help 
freed slaves to sue private individuals for other forms of 
discrimination 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said conservatives on the court again revealed themselves to be 
hostile and insensitive to the progress of the last 20 years 
redneck justice meted out with country club manners is no less 
painful than the real thing 
john buchanan of the liberal people for the american way said 
its a sad commentary on the state of the courts general outlook 
on civil rights that todays decision must be greeted with a measure 
of relief 
sen edward m kennedy dmass urged president bush to join 
congress in proposing bills to reverse the high court rulings 
taken separately each of these retreats would be a source of 
genuine concern he said together they are a serious threat to 
the 35 years of progress we have achieved toward a better and fairer 
society 
thursdays ruling follows three other significant high court 
setbacks for those urging more aggressive steps to combat bias 
last january the court banned racial quotas in the awarding of 
public works projects by state and local governments 
on june 5 the justices restricted the use of statistical 
evidence to prove an employer illegally relegates minorities or 
women to lowerpaying jobs 
and just last monday the court significantly expanded the power 
of white men to challenge courtapproved affirmative action plans 
even years after those plans took effect 
addressing the latest ruling julius chambers of the naacp legal 
defense and educational fund said it means employers who do not 
want blacks on their work force can simply hire blacks and harass 
them on the job until they quit 
bruce fein a conservative who keeps a close watch on high court 
rulings said civil rights groups were exaggerating the significance 
of the decision 
but he agreed that there is a conservative fivemember majority 
now changing the evaluation and approach to the civil rights law 
the court acted in the case of brenda patterson a black teller 
for a credit union in north carolina she said her boss harassed her 
by ordering her to do menial tasks such as sweeping floors 
the courts ruling bars her from suing her employer for bigmoney 
punitive damages for alleged harassment it does not prohibit her or 
others with similar complaints from suing under a 1964 federal civil 
rights law that has less sweeping financial remedies 
also the 1964 law applies only to businesses with at least 15 
employees excluding some 15 percent of the american work force the 
1866 law covers all employers 
writing for the court thursday justice anthony m kennedy the 
courts newest member denied the court was turning its back on 
minorities 
neither our words nor our decisions should be interpreted as 
signaling one inch of retreat from congress policy to forbid 
discrimination he said but he said the courts job is to 
interpret the law not rewrite it to the liking of civil rights 
advocates 
kennedy said the 1866 law governs contractual rights such as 
hiring and promotion decisions and not other forms of conduct by 
an employer including an order to sweep floors 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion said the 
court is engaging in a hypertechnical reading of the law that 
ignores its larger purpose 
joining kennedy were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and byron r white 
kennedy oconnor and scalia are reagan appointees rehnquist was 
promoted to chief justice by the former president white had been 
appointed by former president john f kennedy 
in a separate decision thursday the court said states and state 
officials may not be sued under a related 1871 law that protects 
civil liberties the 54 ruling in a case from michigan said states

the arrest of a decorated cuban army general on 
corruption charges has left us officials wondering about the 
possibility of unrest within that countrys upper military ranks 
the officials acknowledged thursday they have no hard evidence to 
dispute official assertions in cuba that gen arnaldo ochoa was 
taken into custody because he had engaged in grave acts of 
corruption and dishonest use of economic resources 
but the officials all insisting on anonymity also said they 
could not rule out the possibility that there was more to the arrest 
than meets the eye a number of ochoas subordinates were reported 
to have been arrested as well 
cuba has thus far been generally immune to the kind of upheavals 
that have afflicted other communist states and has refused to 
undertake the reforms being practiced in the soviet union and 
elsewhere 
one reason for the official caution here in assessing the 
situation is that rumors of highlevel discontent have circulated in 
cuba for 30 years but outright acts of rebellion have been 
exceedingly rare 
under the rule of president fidel castro cuba has been one of 
the most stable countries in the communist world or in latin america 
ochoa is a veteran of fighting in angola and ethiopia and also 
served as commander of cuban forces in nicaragua in the mid1980s 
according to rafael fermoselle a cuban exile and an expert on the 
cuban military ochoa was awarded the title hero of the 
revolution in 1984 
a council of state resolution approved on jan 1 1984 said 
that ochoa carried out several internationalist missions with a 
particular spirit of sacrifice and he was cited for a brilliant 
performance as commander of cuban troops in ethiopia fermoselle 
has written ochoa also was praised for his honesty 
unselfishness spirit of sacrifice purity desire to excel and 
heroism 
ochoa joined castros rebel army in 1958 among the important 
positions he has held was commander of the army in havana in 
nicaragua ochoa commanded cuban forces believed to number about 500 
gen rafael del pino the highest ranking military officer ever 
to defect from cuba disclosed thursday that defense minister raul 
castro brother of the president had said in a speech wednesday 
that many of ochoas subordinates were arrested as well 
del pino who defected two years ago said he believes that the 
arrests were based on a highlevel of discontent within ochoas 
command which could have led to an uprising against castro 
del pino said he believes there was a relationship between the 
arrest of ochoa on wednesday and the sacking of transportation 
minister diocles torralba the day before 
he said torralba during his military career was one of the 
most beloved and intelligent officers and had become the best 
prepared and most intelligent personality in the cuban government

surgeon general c everett koop says he wants 
to maintain his high public profile after he leaves office next 
month by using every outlet to deliver his health teachings as 
long as people will listen 
as he prepares to close out a sevenyear stint as the nations 
top health adviser during which he made america aware of aids and 
encouraged millions to quit smoking the achievements are way 
ahead of the failures he said 
i leave with a very good feeling koop told reporters at a 
breakfast session on thursday 
he plans to leave this job in the public health service on july 
13 and begin to write his memoirs 
after that he said i will use the written word the spoken 
word and whatever i can in the electronic media to deliver health 
messages to this country as long as people will listen he said 
the imposing silverbearded pediatrician with a reputation for 
straight talk about sensitive issues and the popularity of a 
national folk hero wants to continue to be americas health 
conscience 
koop said his most successful achievement as surgeon general was 
his relentless drive against smoking 
he noted that during his tenure the proportion of the nation 
that uses tobacco has dropped from 34 percent to 26 percent and the 
number of antismoking laws has burgeoned from 54 to more than 400 
now 
asked what was his biggest turkey he responded 
selfassuredly i didnt know there were any 
koop 72 said he enjoys a special satisfaction that he has 
turned around most of the liberal critics who put up a firestorm of 
opposition to his nomination by president reagan in 1981 
in the process though koop alienated many conservatives with 
his nononsense report on the aids crisis which advocated use of 
condoms and sex education beginning at young ages and though he 
remains an adamant abortion foe he again drew their ire when he 
refused to issue a report requested by reagan on whether women 
suffer psychological harm from abortion 
i never made any promises to espouse any causes and all that i 
have done in this job is to face the issues that were there and to 
deal with them with as much integrity and honesty as i could koop 
said 
he says this is what directed him earlier this year when he told 
reagan there was insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that 
abortions harm women psychologically 
the people who asked me to do it especially the president had 
been misled into believing that what i would find would be so 
devastating that you could reverse roe vs wade the 1973 supreme 
court ruling that legalized abortion during the first three months 
of pregnancy 
the surgeon general has no real authority to set government 
policy my only in influence was through moral suasion he said 
but he attained a popularity among the public that is unknown to 
most government officials and to a large extent he said this 
protected him from attacks by the white house where conservatives 
sometimes disagreed with him 
i think there were many times when certain very conservative 
people in the white house would have done anything they could to 
shut me up he said 
within a week after he issued his report on the deadly acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome he said reagan white house staffers 
asked him to do an update to take out the word condom 
he said no and they left my office in a huff 
koop acknowledged that he had let the bush administration know he 
wanted to be secretary of the department of health and human 
services which includes the public health service whose 
commissioned corps the surgeon general oversees 
but he denied being bitter about not getting the job 
i would have liked to be secretary koop said i think i 
could have done a very credible job but before he was passed 
over he said he was asked repeatedly what his reaction would be if 
he did not get the job his response which he said he feels is even 
more true now was i will be disappointed for a few days but 
probably very happy for the rest of my life

minorities and the working poor will be 
especially hurt by president bushs veto of legislation that would 
have raised their hourly wages to 455 by 1992 a study says 
the veto would particularly hit hard black and hispanic workers 
who have seen their earnings erode over the decade said a study 
released thursday by the center on budget and policy priorities 
the minimum wage 335 an hour hasnt been lifted since 1981 
according to the center an independent organization that 
specializes in issues affecting low and moderateincome americans 
hispanics and blacks are 40 percent more likely to be paid at or 
near the minimum wage than white workers 
yet a fulltime yearround worker earning the minimum wage and 
supporting a family of three falls 2900 below the poverty line 
the study said in 1979 the minimum wage put a family of three at 
104 percent of the poverty level 
today one in every four black and hispanic workers paid by the 
hour now receives a wage too low to lift a family of three out of 
poverty even if the worker is employed fulltime the study said 
the dramatic drop in the value of the minimum wage has 
compounded the earnings problems of poor and minority workers and 
increased their poverty rates said study author isaac shapiro 
to these workers the presidents veto of legislation boosting the 
minimum wage is ominous news 
last year 21 percent of hispanic workers and 21 percent of black 
workers made less than 450 an hour compared with 15 percent of 
all white workers shapiro said 
earlier this week bush vetoed legislation that would raise the 
minimum wage to 455 an hour by 1992 insisting that the new 
minimum wage not exceed 425 an hour the house on wednesday was 
not able to muster the votes required to override the veto

former national security adviser john 
poindexter today faces the judge who will handle his criminal trial 
in the irancontra scandal 
us district court judge harold greene given the poindexter 
case two weeks ago must deal with the same problem of classified 
information that plagued the governments prosecution earlier this 
year against oliver north 
greenes decisions will determine whether prosecutors are able to 
bring farreaching conspiracy and theft charges against poindexter 
rulings by us district court judge gerhard a gesell in the 
north case led to the governments abandoning such charges they 
focus on the diversion of proceeds from the iran arms sales to the 
nicaraguan contras 
norths attorneys fought largely successfully to convince 
gesell that substantial amounts of highly classified material were 
relevant to norths defense and had to be admitted as evidence 
us intelligence agencies refused to declassify much of the 
material due to national security concerns and the conspiracy and 
theft charges were dismissed 
the office of independent counsel lawrence e walsh is trying to 
avoid the problem in the poindexter case 
the prosecution is opposing poindexters request to file a motion 
with the judge seeking a wide range of documents for use by the 
defense 
greene who won a reputation in presiding over the breakup of 
atampt of moving complex cases along expeditiously has indicated he 
wants to resolve the question of the conspiracy and theft counts 
soon 
at todays court session greene said in a twopage order earlier 
this week he wants to address the question whether as in the case 
against oliver north the government will move to dismiss the counts 
charging conspiracy and theft of government property and when a 
decision is expected 
walsh said several months ago he hopes to be able to try 
poindexter on those counts 
if the prosecution is unable to keep those charges the 
indictment against poindexter will be reduced substantially 
he is charged with a series of obstruction and false statement 
charges involving congress those accusations focus on poindexters 
alleged involvement in producing a phony chronology in connection 
with a 1985 arms shipment to iran 
north was convicted of aiding and abetting in that false 
chronology and two other crimes 
the false chronology said that no one in the us government knew 
until january 1986 that a november 1985 shipment to iran contained 
hawk missiles 
the shipment assisted by the cia was retroactively legalized by 
president reagan with a written finding signed by the president the 
month after the shipment was made

drug czar william bennett says that beheading 
some kinds of drug dealers would be a morally fitting punishment 
although difficult to implement under the american system of justice 
bennett interviewed thursday on the larry king live 
television program on cable news network said we are not doing 
enough that is morally proportionate to the nature of the offense 
his remarks were prompted by a callers question why not 
behead the dealers as the law calls for in some middle 
eastern countries 
what the caller suggests is morally plausible bennett said 
its legally difficult 
bennett who is director of the office of national drug control 
policy said morally i dont have any problem with that at all 
ask most americans if they saw someone on the streets selling 
drugs to their kids what they would feel morally justified in doing 
tear them the sellers limb from limb bennett said 
asked by interviewer king what should we do bennett did not 
answer directly but said its not a moral problem i used to 
teach ethics 
bennetts spokesman don hamilton said later bennett did not 
mean to approve beheading just capital punishment for some forms of 
drug dealing

here at a glance are the major provisions of 
sampl bailout legislation adopted by the house and the differences 
from the version passed by the senate in april 
the house approved the bill by a 32097 vote late thursday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the house would require sampl owners to risk at least 150 in 
tangible capital for every 100 in lending starting june 1 1990 
the standard would be raised in steps until it reaches 3 on jan 1 
1995 
the senate requires sampls to meet a 150 standard by june 1 
1991 both versions impose growth restrictions on solvent sampls that 
fall below the standard 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
both chambers provide for borrowing 50 billion over three years 
to close or merge failed sampls and both provide ways to get around 
the automatic spending cuts of the grammrudman budget balancing law 
the senate adopted president bushs proposal to keep the 
borrowing off the budget the house would add the borrowing to the 
budget deficit but keep the addition from triggering spending cuts 
both versions require a contribution of 6 billion from the 
industryowned federal home loan banks to offset repayment of the 
borrowing they also require the industry to contribute at least 
300 million a year to help pay the interest 
house and senate bills increase the insurance assessment on sampl 
deposits from 21 cents per 100 to 23 cents and bank premiums from 8 
cents to 15 cents 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the house provides the justice department with 75 million a year 
from 1989 to 1991 to detect and prosecute fraud at financial 
institutions while the senate voted for 50 million a year 
both chambers raise the maximum civil penalties for reckless 
disregard for safety to 1 million a day criminal penalties would 
be 1 million per day or imprisonment for up to five years or both 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
both bills expand the authority of the federal deposit insurance 
corp which currently insures commercial bank deposits to savings 
and loan deposits as well 
the federal home loan bank board currently the regulator of 
sampls would be split up the examination and supervision wing of the 
agency would become part of the treasury department a separate 
independent board would oversee the moneyborrowing functions of the 
regional home loan banks previously overseen by the bank board 
a new agency the resolution trust corp would be created to 
close or sell off failed sampls it would dispose of the more than 
300 billion in repossessed real estate owned by the institutions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the house will require sampls to hold 80 percent of their assets 
mostly in residential mortgages and consumer loans the senate 
requires only 60 percent but says consumer loans cant be used to 
meet the requirement 
the senate bans troubled institutions from accepting 
highinterest rate deposits placed by money brokers the house 
version is similar but allows sampls to apply for an exemption 
the house version allows bank holding companies to buy both 
healthy and ailing thrifts immediately the senate provides a 
twoyear delay before bank holding companies can buy healthy sampls 
the house but not the senate requires the industryowned 
regional banks to provide 75 million a year for four years to 
subsidize housing for poor people increasing to 150 million a year 
by 1995 
the house also requires banks and sampls to disclose their record 
of serving the poor minorities and women 
the senate allows sampls to invest in junk bonds up to 11 percent 
of assets more for statechartered sampls with extra capital the 
house forbids thrifts from owning junk bonds but gives institutions 
two years to sell the highrisk highyield bonds they already own

the savings and loan bailout bill approved by 
the house gives new weapons to battle redlining the 
discrimination by banks and thrift institutions against loan 
applicants from poor and minority neighborhoods 
by a 214200 vote thursday night the house voted to include in 
the 157 billion bailout a requirement that lenders disclose both 
the number of loans they approve as well as the number of 
applications they get by race income and sex 
we know redlining is a reality said rep ronald dellums 
dcalif chairman of the congressional black caucus the banks 
and savings and loans dont want this information to become public 
because they know what it would do it would provide the basis to 
establish a national policy 
the amendment written by reps henry b gonzalez dtexas 
chairman of the house banking committee and rep joseph kennedy 
dmass also requires federal regulators to disclose their ratings 
on how well banks and sampls lend money for community needs 
civil rights and community activists have been demanding the 
release to the public of numerical ratings the government keeps on 
community lending in the wake of reports the past two years about 
redlining in atlanta new york detroit dallas and other cities 
redlining is a practice by which banks and sampls have used zip 
codes and other geographic factors to systematically deny loans to 
residents and businesses in areas with high concentrations of 
minorities or poor people regardless of the creditworthiness of the 
applicant 
rep john conyers dmich said that without the provision 
minorities would reap no benefit from the savings and loan bailout 
there is no way in the world i can go back to my constituency 
and explain to them why redlining is still allowed in this 
country conyers said i cant stress enough the important 
dimension of this civil rights amendment 
opponents of the amendment led by reps steve bartlett rtexas 
and chalmers wylie rohio said they were against redlining but 
argued that the issue had nothing to do with the bailout and should 
be addressed in a separate bill 
wylie also called the measure mischievous saying the ratings 
could be misinterpreted by the public as an indication of the 
financial soundness of a bank or sampl rather than how much it helps 
the local community 
both banks and regulators also have expressed fears that the 
disclosures will be used by community and civil rights activists to 
promote risky innercity lending to borrowers who are not 
creditworthy 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio attempted to add a similar 
provision to the senates version of the sampl bailout but withdrew it 
in the face of overwhelming opposition he promised that the issue 
would be considered in a separate senate bill

federal health officials are recommending 
aggressive use of a newly approved drug that protects people 
infected with the aids virus against a form of pneumonia that is the 
no1 killer of aids victims 
the food and drug administration approved the drug aerosol 
pentamidine on thursday the announcement came as the centers for 
disease control issued greatly expanded treatment guidelines 
recommending wider use of the drug in people infected with the aids 
virus but who may show no symptoms 
aerosol pentamidine has been widely available for several months 
to people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
under a special fda preapproval distribution program the cost of 
the drug however is a burden for many 
full fda approval means that more insurance companies will cover 
at least part of the costs of the treatment which runs about 150 
for a monthly dose 
aerosol pentamidine which is inhaled into the lungs has been 
found to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia this form of 
pneumonia kills more than 60 percent of aids patients 
the injectable form of pentamidine was approved in 1984 for 
patients already suffering from pneumocystis but injections offered 
far less protection than the inhalable aerosol form 
approval of the drug may help about 100000 aidsinfected people 
who are at risk of developing initial or subsequent bouts of 
pneumocystis said dr louis sullivan secretary of the department 
of health and human services parent agency of both the food and 
drug administration and the centers for disease control 
aerosol pentamidine to by marketed by lyphomed inc of rosemont 
ill will be labeled for use in patients who have had at least one 
episode of pneumonia or whose immune systems have deteriorated 
significantly the fda said 
the government estimates that between 945000 and 14 million 
americans are infected with the aids virus about 120000 people who 
have been tested at public counseling and testing centers have been 
informed that they are infected the number of people who have been 
found through other sources to be infected is not known cdc said 
cdc recommended that people who test positive for the virus even 
though they may have no symptoms of the disease have critical 
immunesystem cells monitored every six months these cells are 
called cd4 helper lymphocyte cells which in healthy people appear 
at counts of about 1000 or more 
cdc also recommended that when the cell count drops below 200 
patients should be started on one of two drugs that have been shown 
to protect against pneumocystis 
the guidelines are likely to increase the demand for hiv 
antibody testing by persons who believe they may be at risk for 
infection now that more can be done medically to prolong the 
lives of aids patients cdc said more aggressive testing and 
monitoring will also raise the demand for medical services cdc said 
the cdcs morbidity and mortality weekly report did not estimate 
how much health care costs would increase with increased testing 
monitoring and administering of preventive drugs 
last week at the fifth international aids conference in 
montreal dr james mason former cdc director who is now assistant 
secretary for health was quoted as saying increased monitoring of 
hivinfected people and use of aids drug treatments could cost 2 
billion to 3 billion

waiters at a wellknown downtown restaurant 
thought they were making pretty good tips until the irs started 
checking out the tabs 
checking just the credit card receipts for meals served by nine 
waiters at the palm restaurant the internal revenue service found 
that the nine failed to report nearly 145000 in combined tip 
income for each year between 1982 and 1985 
as a result the nine were charged with filing a false income tax 
return eight of them pleaded guilty to one count each and on 
thursday they were sentenced to serve nights and weekends at a 
community correctional institute for up to four months 
they also will have to pay back taxes interest and penalties 
this is probably the saddest day of my entire life said 
joseph p levaca one of the waiters i want to apologize to the 
court and keep my job so i can pay back this debt 
he and the other four waiters who still work at the palm will be 
able to continue doing so while serving their sentences 
the ninth defendant who now lives in california also has 
pleaded guilty and will be sentenced later 
according to a pretrial statement from prosecutors the waiters 
were reporting annual income ranging from 7100 to 52000 a year 
while really earning 27000 to 67000 this did not include meals 
paid for in cash

a jury recommended in a mock trial to award 
136 million to neighbors of a federal uranium processing plant a 
decision the neighbors lawyer hopes will lead to a settlement 
the jury issued the nonbinding verdict thursday on the second 
day of deliberations in a summary jury trial an abbreviated 
procedure used by us district judge s arthur spiegel to encourage 
a settlement of the neighbors 300 million lawsuit 
we won 100 percent we didnt lose a single issue of law 
said stanley m chesley a lawyer for the 14000 plaintiffs 
represented in the classaction lawsuit 
the jury ruled that national lead of ohio inc operated the us 
department of energys feed materials production center in a way 
that caused neighbors to suffer emotional distress and lowered 
property values national lead which operated the plant under 
contract to the federal government from 1951 through 1985 was sued 
with its parent firm national lead industries inc 
chesley said he hopes the energy department which represented 
the defendant companies in the lawsuit will now settle the civil 
lawsuit the plaintiffs all live within five miles of the plant in 
fernald which is 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
henry gill jr the energy departments chief lawyer declined to 
comment on a settlement saying he would continue discussions with 
chesley and would need to confer with his superiors 
if there is no settlement the case goes to a real trial aug 15 
before spiegel 
the 38yearold plant processes uranium used by energy department 
reactors elsewhere in producing nuclear weapons 
environmentalists have been watching the case in hopes that the 
advisory verdict would affect other energy department installations 
nationwide that are reputed to be polluters 
energy department lawyers argued that the defendant companies 
could not be found liable because they could only carry out the 
governments orders 
the energy department estimates that 383000 pounds of 
radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty 
exhaustair filters since the plant opened government lawyers said 
the material has not endangered residents or harmed property 
the jury believed they were reckless and careless the way they 
managed this plant they didnt give a hoot about us or the 
environment and now they are going to have to pay for it said 
lisa crawford spokeswoman for the fernald residents for 
environmental safety and health 
the jury recommended the damage amount would include 80 million 
for a fund to monitor the residents medical problems 55 million 
for punitive damages and 1 million for property damage 
jury foreman robert caplinger questioned by the judge after 
thursdays verdict said the jury thought its decision could help 
persuade other contractors not to manage plants like national lead 
ran the fernald facility 
westinghouse materials co of ohio has operated the plant since 
january 1986 and is not a defendant in the case

surrounded by controversy premier andreas 
papandreou faces the toughest test of his 25year political career 
in national elections sunday 
the results are expected to decide whether the 70yearold former 
u s university professor will continue dominating greeces 
oftenturbulent politics or end his career on a discordant note 
papandreou first was elected in 1981 on an antiamerican platform 
and promises of significant social change instead he and members 
of his government have floundered since august over charges 
involving a multimilliondollar financial scandal and illegal arms 
deals 
opponents often are critical of papandreous authoritarian style 
and sensitivity to criticism but they have not discounted him 
despite poor opinion poll ratings 
hell leave the country if he loses the election said 
opposition legislator virginia tsouderou of the centerright new 
democracy 
ms tsouderou claims papandreou will leave whether his 
panhellenic socialist movement pasok gets second place or her 
party wins an outright majority in the 300member parliament 
papandreou said he will stay regardless 
i know what it is to be in the opposition im a fighter he 
said in a recent interview 
but few political observers believe him and even some party 
members doubt him 
papandreou is too sensitive to sit in parliament and listen to 
criticism if we lose many of us in the party expect him to go but 
his magnetism could pull off a miracle agreed a panhellenic deputy 
running for reelection 
he said papandreous style of oneman rule has alienated many 
party members papandreou rarely showed up in parliament preferring 
to govern from his suburban residence 
we realize that without him pasok would have little chance of 
winning but at the same time he could be a liability because of his 
controversial private life and financial scandals we have been 
burdened with the deputy said on condition of anonymity 
harilaos florakis secretarygeneral of the greek communist 
party believes papandreou will be dumped as party leader if he 
loses the election 
observers speculate that if the panhellenics loose their overall 
majority the elections would enable the communist party to play a 
role in forming a new government 
despite statements by new democracy and pasok that they will 
reject communist support to form a coalition government anything 
can happen a west european diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity 
papandreou was dean of the economics department at the university 
of california at berkeley he returned to greece in 1959 after a 
20year absence 
with his charismatic personality and gift for oratory he used 
his fathers center union to form his own party following the 
collapse of the military dictatorship that ruled greece from 
19671974 
papandreou concedes his popularity has diminished 
he told the progovernment daily ta nea that the financial 
scandal and his open affair with a flight attendant half his age 
have affected his popularity 
papandreou divorced his americanborn wife margaret on june 9 
ending their 38year marriage the divorce frees him to marry 
dimitra liani who critics charge influences his decisions 
papandreou admits he bounces his ideas off liani because she 
has good instinct but i do not always follow her advice

the ocean floor is full of sunken treasure from 
old military ships that have been blown up as targets or sunken as 
artificial reefs an investigative report says 
although there may be no doubloons or pieces of eight in the 
newest denizens of davy joness locker 17 million in recoverable 
goods has been destroyed on board 24 ships sunk in recent years as 
reefs or in target practice the report by the navys inspector 
general said 
an additional 40 million will be lost unless something is done 
to salvage items from 64 vessels that now await a similar fate it 
said 
there are in fact significant amounts of gold and silver 
to be salvaged from communications and code equipment the report 
says 
mostly the wasted goods consist of power tools such as lathes 
drill presses band saws pumps and office and electronic equipment 
inspectors also said there were operating room and dental 
equipment including sterilizers air conditioners and ice machines 
silverware radios and teletypes new mattresses still in plastic 
bags and numerous spare parts 
the navy has been derelict in the proper management of the 
public property under its control the report concluded 
rep william broomfield rmich who released the report 
introduced legislation on thursday to permit outside contractors to 
reclaim scrap items from such ships they would apply for the right 
to salvage items under sealed bids broomfield said 
america may be the most wealthy nation in the world but we are 
not so wealthy that we can afford to dump millions of dollars worth 
of sophisticated equipment to the bottom of the ocean floor he 
said in a statement 
the navy continues to buy some of the same items it has wasted 
the inspector generals report said and has ignored the 
possibility of reusage 
in a response the service said it is reviewing the report to 
determine any appropriate action this will include reviewing the 
cost estimates of the unrecovered materials plus the associated 
recovery costs equipment condition and applicability to current 
needs 
the navy added that it also plans to review its instructions 
governing the process and procedures for inactivating and stripping 
ships 
the internal investigation was prompted by a complaint from 
william r justen whose stuart fla company had been hired to 
sink an old navy ship under the artificial reef program 
justen complained that some 300000 worth of reusable items were 
on the vessel but he was unable to salvage them because of the time 
constraints of his contract he told the navy that he was aware of 
other similar cases as well 
the inspector general found confusion in the handling of 
decommissioned ships and few clear provisions for salvage

defiant to the end a harvardeducated 
puerto rican nationalist raised his fist and shouted puerto rico 
libre after he was sentenced to 65 years in prison and fined 
500000 
juan segarra palmer who has already spent almost three years in 
jail awaiting trial on charges of masterminding a 71 million 
robbery at a wells fargo depot expressed no remorse during a 
politically charged 27minute speech before us district judge t 
emmet clarie on thursday 
my conscience is clear he told the judge in my limited 
capacity i tried to bring about change 
the 39yearold segarra who had faced up to 165 years in prison 
was convicted with three other puerto rican nationalists in april in 
the 1983 theft of a halfton of money from the armoredcar companys 
depot in west hartford 
only 80000 has been recovered from what is believed to be the 
secondlargest cash heist in us history 
after clarie announced the sentence segarra turned to supporters 
in the packed courtroom and shouted the separatist slogan about two 
dozen spectators responded with shouts of encouragement as segarra 
was led from the courtroom 
before his sentencing segarra denounced us policy and pledged 
to continue fighting for puerto rican independence 
i will keep my eyes on the prize because no price is too high 
to pay for freedom justice and the dignity of the people he said 
the judge replied common crimes do not become political crimes 
simply because the criminal is a wouldbe politician 
clarie also denied segarras charge that democracy is a sham in 
puerto rico and that the island is little more than a us colony 
the judge pointed to a recent referendum in which only 3 percent of 
puerto rican voters supported independence from the united states 
segarra convicted of charges including robbery transportation 
of stolen money and conspiracy denied he helped plan the wells 
fargo robbery as the prosecution alleged 
but he has acknowledged that he knew about the robbery in advance 
and said he received the stolen money to finance the activities of 
los macheteros spanish for the machete wielders a militant 
puerto rican separatist group 
he and other defendants have said the government prosecuted them 
because of their political beliefs 
prosecutors pushed for the maximum sentence saying segarra was 
linked to several crimes in puerto rico including two bank 
robberies an attack on a navy bus that left two sailors dead and 
the destruction of nine military planes worth 45 million 
segarras lawyer leonard weinglass said he would appeal 
segarra will be eligible for parole in 10 years but probably 
will not be given serious consideration until he has served 20 
years weinglass said 
earlier this month clarie imposed sentences of up to 15 years on 
the three others convicted with segarra 
in all 16 people have been charged in the heist one was 
acquitted two including segarras wife luz berrios berrios 
pleaded guilty to lesser charges and nine are awaiting trial 
none were accused of actually taking part in the holdup victor 
gerena a wells fargo security guard at the time is believed to 
have taken the money and fled to cuba with about 2 million

an area still recovering from a devastating 
thunderstorm was hit by showers and high winds for a second day in a 
row hampering efforts to clean up trees and leaving an additional 
22000 homes without power in the nations capital and suburban 
maryland 
the second storm swept through the area late thursday afternoon 
creating havoc with rushhour commuters for the second time in 24 
hours to make matters worse dozens of traffic signals were out as 
a result of wednesdays storm which caused an estimated 150000 
power outages and felled hundred of trees 
virginia electric power co spokeswoman deborah tompkins said an 
estimated 12600 homes in the northern section of the state were 
without power at the height of the storm around 6 pm 
tom welle a potomac electric co spokesman said the second 
storm not as strong as the first hampered efforts to repair the 
damage caused by the initial thundershower which he said was the 
most disruptive in the companys 93year history 
we have to rebuild almost all of the electrical system from 
scratch welle said at this rate some people will probably be 
without power through the weekend 
pepco was giving out dry ice at two locations for people who 
owned freezers filled with food that was thawing 
even before the new storm hundreds of trees still blocked side 
streets and were wrapped around felled power lines city and county 
police directed traffic at key intersections where traffic lights 
were malfunctioning 
insurance industry analysts said private stormrelated claims had 
already passed the 5 million mark and would likely climb much 
higher 
about 30 area schools were closed thursday due to the outages 
and at least 16 were to remain closed today three uhf television 
stations weta whmm and wdca which share the same transmitter 
site remained off the air thursday wdca still had not returned to 
the air early this morning 
pepco spokeswoman eileen griffin said about 300 crews were 
working around the clock to restore electricity the utility was 
forced to call outside crews from as far as north carolina to assist 
them in the effort

the opposition labor party won two parliamentary 
byelections today and according to an exit poll inflicted 
stunning defeats on prime minister margaret thatchers conservatives 
in elections for the european parliament 
results early today from voting to fill two vacant house of 
commons seats showed labor holding on to the innercity socialist 
strongholds of scotlands glasgow central and londons vauxhall 
district 
the government is in trouble labor campaign manager bryan 
gould declared we have just started to see the beginning of a 
major shift in the underlying political agenda 
labor tried to turn the european campaign into a referendum on 
mrs thatchers 10 years in office 
kenneth clarke health secretary in mrs thatchers government 
blamed economic problems and the midterm protest votes for the 
conservatives apparent defeats 
but weve seen worse than this said clarke arguing the 
conservatives would recover before the next general election which 
must be held by mid1992 
for her part she told voters they should reject minimumwage and 
other proposals of the european economic community that would 
introduce socialism by the back door 
the exit poll gave the tiny environmental green party third place 
in national voting for the first time 
official results are not due until early monday when voting for 
the 518member body is complete in all 12 member nations of the 
european economic community 
the computerized british broadcasting corp poll of 7500 voters 
showed labor with 44 percent of the european vote its best showing 
in more than a decade the conservatives took 32 percent 
those percentages would allow labor to win 51 of 78 seats 
allocated to the british mainland in the european parliament up 
from the partys previous 32 the governments tally dropped from 26 
from 45 according to the poll 
the scottish national party gained one seat the poll said 
the greens followed with 14 percent according to the poll the 
centrist social and liberal democratic party finished with 6 
percent the poll said such percentages would not give either of 
those two parties any seats on the european body 
minor parties captured the rest of the votes 
the poll was conducted for the bbc by national opinion poll 
in vauxhall labors kate hoey won with a 9766vote majority 
slightly more than the 1987 general election the conservative vote 
was down 10 percent at 5425 votes only 382 ahead of the centrist 
social and liberal democratic party 
in glasgow central labors majority slumped by nearly twothirds 
to 6462 eroded by the scottish national party 
laborite michael watsons 14480 votes was a 10 percent drop 
while the scottish nationalist share was up 20 percent the 
conservatives ran third in the mainly working class district 
getting 2028 votes 
the byelections were called after the death of the previous 
glasgow central legislator and the retirement of the one in vauxhall 
mrs thatchers party retains a huge majority in the 650member 
house of commons the conservatives have 375 seats labor 229 the 
social and liberal democrats 19 and the splinter social democratic 
party three the scottish nationalists have four seats and minority 
regional parties control the rest 
in his comments gould said the conservatives were hurt by mrs 
thatchers resistance to greater european unity and her often 
combative stance in the trade bloc 
now we see we are paying a price for mrs thatcher picking 
fights with everybody said gould 
in addition to benefiting from high interest rates of 14 percent 
and unemployment of 64 percent labor has also been helped by a 
new more centrist platform its plan drops the partys previous 
call for scrapping britains nuclear arsenal unilaterally and 
shutting down us nuclear bases

a monthlong search for the last three 
crossbred dusky seaside sparrows which had escaped from captivity 
during a storm revealed no traces of the birds and ornithologists 
are convinced the species is extinct 
the quest by federal biologists ended wednesday two years to the 
day after the death of the last known pure dusky seaside sparrow a 
small brownandwhite bird with a short buzzing trill 
you cant come to any other conclusion because theres no 
habitat around here for them said herb kale vice president for 
ornithology at the florida audubon society 
by the 1950s the birds salt marsh habitat near the st johns 
river in central florida was rapidly being consumed by development 
pesticides sprayed to control mosquitoes also hurt the birds 
in 1966 the dusky seaside sparrow became the first species on 
the federal governments endangered species list 
kale became an adviser to a disney world program that had tried 
since 1983 to mate the crossbred birds with a related species 
but that program was devastated in march when a storm pitched a 
palm frond through the fiberglass roof of the birds compound and 
left a hole when keepers arrived the next morning they found one 
crossbred sparrow dead and two others gone 
another stayed in its cage during the storm but flew off when 
keepers tried to put it in a more secure cage 
the birds were born in captivity they knew their natural salt 
marsh habitat only through careful recreations so the birds are 
presumed dead 
the federal government bought the 6000acre st johns river 
national wildlife refuge in brevard county to protect the species in 
1972 
some would argue that we lost a scientific opportunity to learn 
something although weve had those birds in captivity a fairly long 
time and learned about everything we could said don wood 
endangered species coordinator for the florida game and fresh water 
fish commission 
in an ecological sense its an absolutely totally 
insignificant loss wood said in the philosophical sense it 
would depend on whoevers talking to you 
one last aerial survey of the salt marshes might be made today 
but if no dusky sparrow is found paperwork will be filed to have 
it removed from the federal endangered species list because it is 
extinct

ireland began counting ballots today from 
its snap national election but politicians are already threatening 
to force another contest 
a heavy turnout was reported thursday as ireland also selected 
members of the european parliament counting for the european 
parliament begins sunday 
prime minister charles haughey called the election in hope of 
winning a majority in the dail or parliament which would be his 
first in five tries 
leaders of the other parties offered no support 
alan dukes of the fine gael party and des omalley leader of the 
progressive democrats declared on the eve of the election that they 
would not vote for haughey for another term 
the labor party and the workers party also ruled out any support 
for the 63yearold haughey and his fianna fail party in part 
because of economic problems in ireland 
that raised the possibility of a split parliament requiring yet 
another election to break the impasse 
haughey needed 83 seats to gain control of the 26th dail which 
has 166 members the speaker customarily votes with the government 
and is automatically elected 
fianna fail controlled 80 seats when the 25th dail was dissolved 
even if haughey musters a majority or woos enough independents 
and minor party deputies to form a government the cooperation that 
marked the 25th parliament appeared to be shattered 
fine gael and the progressive democratic party had supported 
haughey on his main economic policies 
but the day before the election a spokesman for those two 
parties said haughey could expect no help in view of him having 
cast aside the historic and unique consensus he and his government 
enjoyed in the last dail

group 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri banna split from yasir

japan the worlds largest importer of ivory will 
ban most of those shipments in keeping with international calls to 
protect african elephants government officials said today 
their pledge came one day after canadian officials said they too 
would ban ivory imports into their country 
the japanese ministry of international trade and industry said 
the japanese ban will take effect monday 
it will exclude however raw african ivory that has been 
specially certified under an international agreement such ivory 
accounts for about 13 percent of the imports 
japan is following the lead of the majority of industrial nations 
that already banned ivory imports ministry official toru takimoto 
told the associated press 
president bush announced june 5 that the united states was 
banning the import of ivory from all countries 
japan accounts for 40 percent of all world ivory consumption 
followed by the united states at 15 percent in 1988 japan imported 
132 tons of ivory 
the japanese use ivory mainly for seals that can make impressions 
on documents musical instruments and jewelry 
the japanese ban complies with a 1973 international agreement to 
protect animals threatened by extinction by restricting trade in 
such animals and products made from them 
african producers certify their ivory under rules of that 
agreement 
however more than 80 percent of japans ivory imports come from 
nonafrican countries including hong kong singapore and belgium 
most of that ivory lacks such certification 
though some african countries still permit limited exports of the 
certified ivory four major producers kenya tanzania gambia and 
somalia have called for a total ban on trade in ivory they say 
such action is needed to stem the swift decline in the population of 
african elephants 
the population of african elephants in 1988 was estimated at 
625000 down from 12 million in 1981 according to the world 
wildlife fund 
tamotsu ishibashi chairman of tokyo ivory and craft cooperative 
association said the ban will hurt japans traditional 
ivorycarving industry 
the majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques of 
carving ivory from generation to generation and the new restriction 
certainly will affect them severely ishibashi said in a telephone 
interview 
about 25000 ivory craftsman work in 80 japanese workshops 
producing 138 million worth of ivory products every year 
ishibashi predicted japans ivory imports would drop to 1520 
percent of the amount now imported 
of course prices of ivory products will skyrocket soon and 
ivory products will no longer be for ordinary people he said 
in announcing the canadian ban external affairs minister joe 
clark said his government intended to discourage any further 
speculative slaughter of these magnificent animals 
canada will also support an international ban on commercial 
trading in african elephant ivory

the university of colorado will keep open 
its invitation to chinese dissident fang lizhi to serve as a 
visiting fellow even though the chinese government revoked his 
travel plans 
fang 53 and his wife li shuxian took refuge june 5 in the 
us embassy in beijing after the chinese government cracked down on 
students demonstrating for democracy 
the two were targeted by the beijing prosecutors office which 
said their presence inside the embassy would heighten tensions 
between china and the united states 
the universitys joint institute for laboratory astrophysics 
invited fang an astrophysicist to participate in a sixmonth 
fellowship from december 1988 to may 1989 the school invited fang 
on feb 11 1988 and he accepted the fellowship eight days later 
he was expected to arrive dec 1 
but chinese officials stepped in and fang notified the institute 
by letter in october that permission for him to leave china had been 
withdrawn 
the reasons are completely political the letter said 
because fang is so prestigious in the field of astrophysics the 
institute said will keep the fellowship invitation open for three 
years hoping fang will be allowed to travel within that period 
according to chairman peter conti

him she said 
ronnie blackwell 18 found his neighbors missing dog and later 
was arrested with three others and charged with conspiracy to commit 
extortion blackwell allegedly tried to force the owner to up the 
reward to 200 and set up a drop at a gas station 
but his intent wasnt malicious officials said 
blackwell told police he had grown fond of the shaggy little dog 
he said he found near the spartanburg library last week after 
inquiring about how much the dogs owner was prepared to pay for its 
return he apparently decided to keep the dog 
he said he had become really attached to the dog and felt if he 
kept upping the price the lady would just think the dog wasnt worth 
it said detective audrey mcnair of the spartanburg police 
department 
bentley had been missing since june 8 three days later ms 
hawkins received a call from a man who said he had the dog and would 
bring him to her house for the 50 reward she had promised on 
fliers authorities said 
he never arrived

hawkins we have the dog and that the 50 reward was not 
enough police said 
during one phone call a man said the captors wanted 200 
according to police 
ms hawkins agreed to the price but the dog was not returned 
during one of the phone calls sunday a woman identified herself 
as a mother whose son had found the dog and was very attached to 
him ms mcnair said the caller was blackwells girlfriend rebecca 
entsminger 18 who was also charged with conspiracy to commit 
extortion 
ms hawkins a 30yearold hair stylist said wednesday she 
offered to give the callers a puppy the next time she had bentley 
bred but they were not interested she said 
a relative of one of the captors saw a television news report 
tuesday about the missing dog and apparently convinced the four to 
return it authorities said they called ms hawkins to say they 
would give bentley back that night 
ms hawkins got a call tuesday night telling her to go to a local 
gasoline station to get her dog 
ms mcnair who was at ms hawkins home at the time of the call

troops cleared student demonstrators from tiananmen square in 
beijing on the night of june 34 here is an account of events in 
chengdu from a correspondent who traveled to the city in central 
china 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when beijings night of blood and fire had 
ended witnesses said police with clubs attacked people gathered at 
a huge statue of mao in chengdu 1000 miles away starting riots 
that spread through the city 
witnesses said a market was destroyed by flames and a row of 
buses was burned during two days of street battles that began 
sunday june 4 
they said up to 30 people were killed more than half of them 
students official press reports have said 300 police were injured 
but have not mentioned fatalities 
it was one of the most violent episodes outside beijing where 
soldiers swept into tiananmen square the night of june 34 to end 
weeks of student protests for democracy 
the government says a few hundred people were killed in beijing 
at least half of them soldiers but chinese witnesses and western 
intelligence put the civilian death toll at about 3000 
as in the capital students in chengdu began protesting for 
democracy in midapril after the death of former communist party 
chief hu yaobang who lost his job for being too easy on student 
protests two years earlier 
their focal point was the white 50foot statue of mao tsetung 
father of communist china in the heart of chengdu capital of 
central sichuan province 
on that sunday police charged in with clubs arresting 47 
students and four workers the official media said were camping out 
at the statue 
word of the assault spread and 10000 people gathered at the 
statue witnesses said reports of the beijing bloodshed also were 
coming in by telephone and voice of america radio 
protesters attacked police and were turned back with tear gas and 
water cannons the witnesses said 
a student reported seeing at least one person killed with a 
bayonet unconfirmed reports said several people were shot dead 
many students were beaten with clubs with enlarged ends that 
leave no marks but scramble your brains said a student at sichuan 
university a center of the democracy movement 
the sichuan daily and chengdu evening news have denied rumors 
that two women were mutilated with bayonets 
that night protesters set fire to a police booth at the entrance 
of the peoples market and the flames spread through the entire 
halfblock area several city buses also were burned 
it was a mess said a 20yearold artist who watched the 
market burn there were fire trucks and ambulances everywhere 
there were no reports of injuries or deaths in the fire which 
the artist said started soon after midnight 
the next day monday june 5 news of the carnage in beijing 
spread and more people went to the statue

outside said a bartender at the flying dragon beer house

the minshan hotel across the street from the jinjiang and 
overturned a taxi into a pond witnesses said scaling the locked 
gates of the jinjiang about half a dozen stormed the front door 
they had knives and steel pipes they kept chasing us to the 
back of the hotel said a waiter at the jinjiangs lobby bar 
they stole beer and cigarettes they scared the hell out of us 
when five truckloads of police arrived after half an hour the 
raiders scattered 
none appeared to be students a witness said they were 
factory workers thugs and teenagers unrelated to the 
prodemocracy movement or the peoplepolice conflict 
that night the peoples movie theater across from the market was 
burned down 
shopkeepers across the street from the market were reluctant to 
talk with foreigners several said brusquely that they had closed 
june 5 for several days and therefore saw nothing 
if youre reporters go talk to city officials a restaurant 
manager said were just minding our own business 
official press reports said police arrested 100 hoodlums but 
there has been no mention of students other than a ban on their 
activist union 
few students remain on campus because no classes are being held 
and some have fled in fear of government reprisals 
the unrest is basically over said a sophomore studying 
chemistry at sichuan university i came back because i had to see 
my professors and do some experiments 
i think the student movement is over and it wont come back in 
september when classes are likely to resume said a senior 
majoring in english 
more than 400 american citizens including dependents of 
consulate staff members have left sichuan and surrounding provinces 
via hong kong leaving about 80 in the region us officials say 
the consulate issued an advisory saying travel to beijing should be 
avoided 
truckloads of police cruise the streets and authorities are 
putting pressure on foreign journalists in chengdu as well as in 
beijing and shanghai

richter scale can cause slight damage 4 can cause moderate damage 
5 considerable damage and 6 severe damage

the nations roman catholic bishops are 
aiming to tackle a number of lingering controversies including what 
their stand should be on aids education and how to settle disputes 
with religion teachers 
about 300 cardinals archbishops and bishops gathered today at 
seton hall in south orange for the national conference of catholic 
bishops opening the conference with a morning mass the meeting 
ends monday 
tension has increased over the last few years between the bishops 
and religion teachers some of whom have been disciplined for 
advocating birth control and female priests and taking other stands 
that contradict church teachings 
the doctrinal statement hopes to resolve these types of things 
without doing too much damage said bob wonderly spokesman for 
the bishops conference in recent years there has seemingly been 
an increase in these types of cases at least in perception 
the dispute itself indicates a shift within the church 
during a conference in 1968 the bishops specified the right of 
priests and laymen to disagree with the church in the classroom but 
that right has since been questioned and theologians have been 
punished for doing so 
the policy to be considered this weekend would not solve disputes 
over specific issues but would establish procedure for settling 
such arguments 
in a widely publicized case the rev charles curran was barred 
from teaching theology at the catholic university of america in 
washington the universitys action came after the vatican strongly 
criticized him for his positions on abortion homosexuality and 
other matters of sexual ethics 
disputes within the church have not been confined to the bishops 
and theologians the bishops themselves were divided over a 
statement on aids issued by the groups 50member administrative 
board in december 1987 
the aids statement insists on the churchs teaching that the only 
sure safeguards against contracting the disease are abstinence from 
sex before marriage and fidelity within a marriage 
but one paragraph said public education programs directed at 
people who may reject church standards could include information 
about condoms which most medical experts say can help prevent the 
disease 
critics charged this paragraph implied approval of condoms which 
the church has condemned as a form of birth control defenders 
insist the document did not approve condoms but said that they were 
an alternative to halting the spread of the deadly disease 
the bishops plan to issue a new report on the topic saturday 
the bishops also are scheduled to vote on a statement calling for 
a normalization of relations between the united states and vietnam 
said michael hurley spokesman for the newark archdiocese

peaceful antigovernment protests were also held today at many 
colleges in seoul and other cities but police said they had no 
figures on how many 
the fighting marked the second day of widespread campus clashes 
in seoul and other cities and indicated radical students had 
abandoned a selfimposed ban on firebombs some student groups said 
they would stop using the weapons after seven riot police were 
killed in a may 3 campus clash but other groups continued to use 
firebombs 
the students and allied dissident groups have little public 
support because of their extremist views and violent tactics 
student leaders who refused to be identified said they had been 
forced to use firebombs as selfdefense against police attacks but 
the fighting today all appeared to have been started by students 
when police blocked the marches 
about 2000 students from at least six colleges battled hundreds 
of police at hankuk university in seoul riot police surrounding the 
school hurled rocks at the protesters but did not use tear gas 
students marched out of the school and attacked riot police 
blocking the road with wooden clubs and iron bars protesters then 
attacked with firebombs and several officers were set ablaze the 
fires were put out quickly by other troopers 
protesters knocked down parts of the schools wall to make 
ammunition to hurl at police police set up iron barricades in the 
streets to hold students back during the fighting which lasted more 
than an hour 
also today opposition leader kim daejung demanded that the 
united states apologize for its alleged role in a 1980 prodemocracy 
civil uprising in the southern city of kwangju that left about 200 
people dead kim is head of the largest opposition group the party 
for peace and democracy 
kim likened recent incidents in china to the 1980 civil uprising 
in kwangju the capital city of his home province south cholla 
one day after kim and many opposition figures were arrested by 
martial law authorities on may 17 1980 studentled demonstrators 
in kwangju rose up against the government drove out police and 
seized control of the city tankled army troops ended the revolt in 
nine days 
kim and many government critics believe the united states 
acquiesced in the military suppression of the kwangju revolt they 
say a south korean army division under operational control of the 
top us army commander in seoul was used to crush the kwangju 
uprising 
the united states had denied the allegations

the indictments allege that cocaine and marijuana were sold to an 
undercover agent assistant us attorney john crews said 
the amounts of drugs are relatively small he said what 
makes it exceptionally significant to us however is that the 
offenses are alleged to have occurred either at the service 
processing center or by individuals employed by the united states

when it comes to that 
crews said no detainees were involved in the alleged offenses

said seven had worked either for the ins or a private security 
company at the port isabel service processing center where

former president ronald reagan said today 
chinese demonstrators should not be likened to antivietnam war 
protesters because the chinese students are trying to get rid of 
the type of government american students wanted to bring to power 
reagan who was governor of california during antiwar protests 
said the american communist party played a major role in those 
student uprisings against the us role in vietnam 
the former president was interviewed from paris on abctvs 
good morning america 
asked why he spoke favorably of the chinese students but had 
frowned on the antiwar demonstrations in the united states during 
the 1960s reagan said 
the difference was if you really look at what they were trying 
to change they were trying to bring aboutthe things that the 
young people in china are now trying to get rid of reagan said 
as governor reagan said he had access to police and other 
intelligence unavailable to the public 
we knew the role that the american communist party was playing 
in those student uprisings reagan said he said members of the 
party were involved in both prowar and antiwar demonstrations in 
order to keep the disturbances going to make sure that the trouble 
continued 
as for the chinese demonstrators reagan said the students might 
have pushed their goals too fast but he believed they had widespread 
support especially among their parents and families during an 
ongoing crackdown against the students the chinese government has 
characterized them as counterrevolutionaries with little popular 
support 
you have to believe that those families sided with them 
reagan said so they didnt change any of those peoples the 
chinese peoples minds about the need for more freedom and more 
democracy in their system

chancellor helmut kohl euphoric over 
the recent visit by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev predicted 
today there will be an eastwest accord on reducing conventional 
forces in europe within a year 
in a parliamentary address recapping the gorbachev visit kohl 
also sharpened his denunciation of the crackdown by chinese 
officials on prodemocracy demonstrators calling it a relapse 
into unmasked suppression 
kohl and his main political opponents were united in their 
celebration of gorbachevs fourday visit 
kohl said gorbachevs visit was a huge and important success 
that would widen the trust between the two nations and 
governments 
the chancellor also said he and gorbachev were in agreement 
that the vienna negotiations on reducing conventional weapons must 
be carried out with all energy we decided to remain in close 
personal contact over this matter 
kohl said he and gorbachev agreed it is possible to forge an 
initial agreement on reducing conventional forces within six to 12 
months and for its terms to be carried out through 1992 and 1993 
at a nato summit in brussels last month president bush announced 
a major disarmament initiative aimed at producing a conventional 
forces agreement at the eastwest negotiations in vienna within a 
year 
in his wideranging parliamentary speech kohl again criticized 
the killing of chinese students by troops in beijing and the arrests 
resulting from the crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
the peaceful protest by thousands of students and workers was 
strangled by tanks and now a decreed wave of denunciations and 
planned arrests has begun kohl said 
we mourn for the victims with all chinese in the world and 
denounce with all friends of china this relapse into unmasked 
suppression kohl said 
gorbachev returned to the soviet union on thursday after 
receiving an enthusiastic welcome on every stop of his west german 
visit 
gorbachev is the most popular foreign leader among west germans 
who view him as the most important element in a new atmosphere of 
peace and trust in eastwest relations 
even west germanys opposition social democrats normally at odds 
with kohl congratulated the chancellor for his talks with gorbachev 
a veteran member of the opposition social democrats former 
chancellor willy brandt said gorbachevs trip was a success for 
the federal government which we applaud 
brandt also reminded parliament that as chancellor he was the 
architect of the first postwar thaw between west germany and the 
sovietled east bloc which earned him the 1971 nobel peace prize 
west german relations with the soviets slid again in the early 
1980s following bonns decision to permit the deployment of new nato 
missiles

a multibilliondollar plan offering parents 
both subsidies and tax credits for child care will end the tragic 
choice parents face between leaving a child alone while working or 
accepting welfare a democratic senator said today 
sen alan cranston of california opened the second day of debate 
on the measure calling it a very fine very important step toward 
providing care for children who need it 
and cranston said the assistance provided in the legislation 
would eliminate the tragic choice many parents face where they 
either have to be at work and leave their child unattended or stay 
with their child and be on welfare we obviously should end that 
tragic situation 
under an agreement between democrats and republicans no votes on 
proposed amendments will be held before monday the proposal faces 
stiff opposition from the white house which favors an approach 
dependent almost solely on tax credits democrats say they are open 
to compromise but committed to the principles of the act for better 
child care sponsored by sen christopher dodd dconn 
dodd agreed to a number of changes in his plan in order to get it 
to the senate floor thursday a significant step in itself given the 
staunch opposition the package faced earlier this year 
opposition stemmed for the most part from two provisions in the 
original bill one calling for federal regulation of child care and 
another that many lawmakers believed would have forced the closing 
of churchrun centers 
the revised version leaves regulations to the states although it 
would establish federal guidelines for the states to follow if they 
wished and it allows for vouchers to be used to pay for child care 
at churchrun centers provided the money is not used in a manner 
inconsistent with the constitution which mandates separation of 
church and state 
those changes were drafted with the assistance of a leading gop 
senator orrin hatch of utah who challenged the administrations 
position that tax credits alone would put a significant dent in the 
nations child care problems 
it will not by itself encourage family based providers 
churches nonprofit organizations or businesses to offer child care 
services hatch said there are other factors that discourage 
choice in child care which cannot be addressed simply by giving more 
money to consumers 
also tacked on to the bill was a tax credit package passed by the 
senate finance committee it would make the existing dependent care 
tax credit refundable in advance and also establish a new credit 
that would give back up to 500 to help families with annual incomes 
of less than 21000 pay for their childrens health insurance 
also included in the measure is an amendment unrelated to child 
care that would delay the implementation of a law requiring business 
to test their benefit programs for discrimination between lower and 
higher paid employees business interests have been lobbying heavily 
for the extension and by attaching it to the child care package 
democrats hope to increase support among republicans 
but senate minority leader bob dole rkan made it clear the 
gop would press its plan shaped largely by the child care tax 
credit promised by president bush during the campaign 
this is a necessity dole said it is a high priority with 
the president it is a high priority with the administration but we 
believe there is a better way to go 
seventypercent of the money 175 billion proposed to be spent 
on the dodd bill would go to parents to help pay for child care 22 
percent would go to training and grant and loan programs designed to 
improve the quality and supply of child care and 8 percent would go 
to states to administer programs and enforce standards 
the taxcredit portion of the measure would cost the government 
103 billion over five years but includes proposal to offset the 
loss including making permanent a 3 percent federal telephone tax 
scheduled to drop to 2 percent next year

a fire that was supposed to be a controlled 
blaze to clear brush leaped fire lines charring at least 400 acres 
and injuring at least three people before being contained early 
today forest officials said 
the fire in bautista canyon 10 miles southeast of hemet was 
ignited thursday afternoon in heavy brush known as chaparral and had 
blackened 400 acres by early today said tom sintaffar a dispatcher 
for the san bernardino national forest 
about 500 firefighters were battling the blaze and had it 
contained by 6 am they expected to have it extinguished by 
saturday sintaffar said 
san bernardino national forest officials intentionally set the 
fire to clear bursh but it escaped their control said forest 
service spokeswoman lindsay maierhofer 
this happens very rarely because prescribed burns are 
conducted under very controlled conditions apparently they got some 
unexpected winds she said 
winds had calmed overnight but firefighters were anticipating 
dry hot temperatures and the possibility of the wind kicking up 
later in the day sintaffar said 
two firefighter suffered minor injuries and a california 
department of corrections prison inmate fighting the fire broke a 
leg in a fall said sintaffar and maierhofer 
sintaffar said no structures were in danger early today although 
reports thursday indicated there had been some threat to scattered 
small homes and a us forest service training facility and station

rescue people have waded through water over their chests to haul 
many elderly out of their homes said fire capt reva sanders 
the red cross could not reach the community of about 350 people 
because theres water on both ends and all the way around fire

businesses shut down as thousands of 
blacks stayed away from work today to observe a selfdeclared 
national holiday on the 13th anniversary of the soweto township 
riots 
police reported sporadic violence in several areas 
a group of blacks apparently attempting to enforce the work 
stoppage fatally stabbed a black motorist in guguletu a township 
outside cape town police said 
police used tear gas to disperse 3000 people who attended a 
rally at the regina mundi roman catholic church in soweto the huge 
township outside johannesburg police also fired tear gas to break 
up a church service outside durban witnesses said 
vandals during the night smashed the tombstone of hector 
pieterson a 13yearold boy who was the first person killed in 1976 
when police fired at students protesting the requirement that they 
be taught in afrikaans the language of the white afrikaners who 
dominate the government 
friends said the smashed grave marker at avalon cemetery in 
soweto was discovered when pietersons mother arrived to place 
flowers on the grave today 
commonly known as soweto day june 16 has no official status 
as a holiday but many businesses closed because so many black 
workers and customers take the day off hundreds of employers have 
negotiated contracts with workers to make it a paid holiday while 
others have adopted a no work no pay no disciplinary action 
policy on june 16 
the anniversary must be used not as a weapon in a war of 
bitterness but as a repeated catalyst for constructive change 
the star the countrys largest daily said in an editorial 
freedom for all remains an unattainable goal unless the 
government is willing to break away from the basic concepts of 
apartheid it added 
in the major cities of johannesburg durban and cape town black 
commuter traffic was less than half the weekday average according 
to various estimates bus stops railway stations and taxi stands 
were unusually empty black schools nationwide were deserted 
buses in durban traveled under police escort to prevent attacks 
by black militants attempting to enforce the work stoppage 
the 1976 soweto riots spread nationwide and an estimated 700 
blacks were killed in the ensuing months a period that brought a 
new level of militancy to the antiapartheid movement 
thousands of blacks fled the country at that time to join the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement the main 
black group attempting to undermine the whiteled government 
the countrys largest blackoriented daily newspaper the 
sowetan said thursday in an editorial thirteen years ago we went 
through a bloodbath over the countrys education system to this 
day very little has changed 
under apartheid south africas 5 million whites exercise 
political and economic control over 28 million blacks whites 
maintain segregated schools neighborhoods and hospitals

the governor of this british colony today 
criticized countries that oppose forcibly repatriating some 
vietnamese boat people saying they are acting illogically and 
inhumanely 
the governor david wilson spoke with reporters after returning 
from an international conference on boat people in geneva there 
the united states the soviet union and vietnam opposed calls for 
forced repatriation of boat people who are not considered refugees 
britain and hong kong support the repatriation 
hong kong is swamped with about 30000 boat people the 
government says many are not refugees fleeing political persecution 
but illegal immigrants seeking better economic conditions 
wilson said there are many countries that simply will not face 
facts he said such countries agree theres no question of 
resettling in third countries people who are not refugees but at 
the same time they oppose forcing such people back to vietnam 
to my mind that is illogical and indeed i think it is inhumane 
because what it is saying is that those people should simply pile up 
in camps around the region wilson said 
the head of the relief agency oxfam hong kong chris bale said 
today there is no alternative to forced repatriation because the 
vietnamese really do not want to go back 
those who are not refugees should be returned just as illegal 
immigrants from any other country are returned he said he said 
many vietnamese were suffering psychological problems from being 
confined in the camps for years 
starting in june 1988 hong kong tried to curb the influx by a 
screening the vietnamese and separating refugees who are eligible 
for resettlement in the west from other groups who are supposed to 
return home only 143 vietnamese have gone back voluntarily even 
though the united nations gives financial aid for people to return 
the 60nation conference in geneva adopted a plan introducing 
universal screening programs the plan called for encouraging 
voluntary return and said if this did not succeed alternatives 
would be examined 
local police in tokyo today said 105 people found on a wooden 
boat near a southwestern japanese island were all vietnamese who 
left home in search of a place where they could enjoy a higher 
standard of living 
the police official who requested anonymity said a local 
vietnamese woman confirmed the vietnamese came from hon gai a small 
village along the gulf of tonkin near the boarder of vietnam and 
china 
a local fisherman spotted the old wooden boat near hazama port 
610 miles southwest of tokyo early today 
if the immigration office grants the group refugee status they 
will be allowed a 180day stay in japan until their final 
destination is determined that stay can be extended until a 
permanent residence is found through the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees in tokyo

president bush said today his crime crackdown 
policies may not be popular with some judges because they fill trial 
calendars but he declared they are needed to stop the shooting 
war in the streets 
bush told a white house gathering of about 90 of the nations 94 
us attorneys to return to their states and enforce his policy of 
no plea bargaining with violent gunwielding offenders 
attorney general dick thornburgh gave the prosecutors a set of 
written guidelines regarding plea bargaining for crimes involving 
firearms 
thornburgh wrote in all but exceptional cases such as those in 
which the defendant has provided subastantial assistance to the 
government in the investigation or prosecution of crimes by others 
federal prosecutors will seek conviction for any offense involving 
the unlawful use of a firearm which is readily provable 
bush told the federal prosecutors they are the commanders at 
the frontlines and urged them to help put away the nations most 
wanted 
the situation in our streets has been aptly compared to a 
shooting war he said noting that many in the room might take 
issue with statements that the country is at peace 
the president hammered home his view that criminals who use guns 
in violent crimes should be prosecuted to the maximum extent 
this policy may mean more trials firearms cases like 
narcotics cases are not always very popular with some on the 
bench he acknowledged but it can be done and in fact already 
is being done even in districts with these overcrowded dockets 
 
bush said his proposals for more federal prosecutors 
lawenforcement officers and new prison construction will help ease 
the overburdened criminal justice system 
bush also emphasized the need cracking down on white collar 
crime calling for strict enforcement of laws against financial and 
banking fraud organized crime and civil rights violations 
crime is crime whether committed with a briefcase or a gun we 
will not tolerate greed over honest business he said 
bush on thursday sent congress the legislative draft of the 12 
billion anticrime package which he outlined a moth ago 
but to dramatize his commitment to fighting drugs and violent 
crime bush journeyed to the federal law enforcement training center 
in steamy glynco ga to sign the transmittal document 
most of the money 1 billion would go to expand federal 
prison capacity but bush also is intent on hiring 1600 new 
prosecutors to work under the us attorneys and 825 new federal 
agents 
the us treasuryrun center in georgia trains police and 
investigators from every federal law enforcement agency except the 
fbi and the drug enforcement agency 
in a country where criminals threaten to erode the very 
liberties we hold so dear you are domestic freedom fighters in the 
war on crime bush told trainees and several thousand others 
gathered on a 90degree day for the event 
bush said he has instructed attorney general dick thornburgh who 
accompanied him to georgia to advise americas federal 
prosecutors to end plea bargaining for violent federal firearms 
offenses 
our message to the common criminal is this pack a gun and 
well pack you away he said 
he exhorted congress to enact his plan to double the mandatory 
penalty for use of semiautomatic weapons in drug or violent crimes 
to 10 years 
but earlier bush advised a graduating border patrol officer 
david rivera to remember that criminal suspects should be treated 
with respect and given his rights or her rights even though the 
evidence looks overwhelming

republicans today commended gop national 
chairman lee atwater for his aggressive leadership and said he had 
been subjected to unremitting attacks from democrats 
atwater repeated his call for the election of a cubanamerican to 
succeed the late rep claude pepper dfla a stance termed 
inflammatory by a democratic state senator 
members of the republican national committee adopted a resolution 
commending atwaters leadership and saying it had made him the 
target of unremitting attacks from democrats and their surrogates 
in debate on the resolution jack london the gop national 
committeeman from arizona praised what he called atwaters courage 
and asked why do you think the democrats want to get rid of him 
atwater pledged that every ounce of energy i have is going to 
be dedicated to doing the best job i can to promote this party 
atwater said at a meeting of the cubanamerican national 
foundation in washington on tuesday that he gave priority to the 
election of a cubanamerican to peppers seat 
im saying it again because i believe it atwater told the 
gop committee today i believe there is a place in the us 
congress for a cubanamerican and if the democrats dont like that 
fine they can keep attacking me and keep attacking me and keep 
attacking me 
on thursday a democratic state senator jack gordon withdrew 
from the race to succeed pepper and attacked atwaters call for the 
election of a cubanamerican 
no statement would more inflame a city that has more tension 
and antagonism than it can possibly deal with right now gordon 
said calling atwaters statement outrageous and 
irresponsible 
atwater however said i think it would be great if we could 
elect a cubanamerican to congress and this party is dedicated to 
doing that 
atwater made no mention of the controversial memo sent out from 
the rnc office earlier this month attacking the voting record of 
speaker of the house thomas s foley the resolution commending him 
also made no direct mention of the memo 
most committee members and state gop chairmen interviewed as they 
opened the twoday meeting predicted atwater would ride out the 
controversy generated by the memo comparing the new house speakers 
voting record to that of rep barney frank 
critics of the memo say it was unfair because it was headed tom 
foley out of the liberal closet and frank a massachusetts 
democrat is an acknowledged homosexual 
an atwater aide mark goodin resigned after saying he had 
approved the memo democrats have called on president bush to fire 
atwater but the president has said he accepts the chairmans 
statement that the memo was written and mailed without his knowledge 
donald devine chairman of the conservative political action 
group citizens for america told reporters at thursdays session 
i would say he atwater is home safe 
he may take a low profile but his real talent is organizing and 
setting plans and for that he doesnt need to be on the front 
page devine said i would be personally upset if he did not 
stay on as chairman 
michigan state republican chairman e spencer abraham said he did 
not believe the distribution of the memo would cause continuing 
problems for atwater 
i think everybody agrees it was inappropriate and i think the 
proper actions were taken and mark goodin resigned and thats the 
end of it the michigan chairman said 
however richard m rosenbaum the national committeeman from new 
york said i find what happened to be very embarrassing and 
regrettable asked if the incident would be crippling to atwater 
rosenbaum said i dont know its still a little early to get a 
real consensus 
jennifer dunn the republican chairwoman in foleys home state of 
washington said she had received very few calls about the memo 
it was a very unfortunate thing but i think it turned into a 
media issue and a democratic issue ms dunn said

a private escrow agent nicknamed robin hud 
told congress today she considers her diversion of millions of 
dollars from government housing programs sin and intends to 
repay the money 
and the inspector general at the department of housing and urban 
development said accountability problems in the agency that 
permitted such schemes still exist 
i in no way justify what i have done as being anything less 
than sin marilyn harrell told the house subcommittee on housing 
and employment adding that she expected no leniency or immunity 
from prosecution 
allow me to state for the record that i do regardless of 
where my life takes me from here intend to repay in full all 
monies taken she said 
harrell who has admitted to investigators that she did not 
forward at least 55 million to the federal housing agency 
repeated claims that she donated much of the money to charitable 
projects to provide housing for the poor 
what was spent over and above what we needed to run the company 
was directed legitimately to help the poor and homeless and assist 
those ministries that did the same she said 
hud has not established effective monitoring systems to assure 
that closing agents properly carry out their responsibilities 
said paul adams inspector general at the department 
moreover planned changes to its automated systems have been 
slow and current systems do not contain all information field 
offices need to properly monitor agent activities he added 
i would be surprised if this would be the end of the 
revelations said subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif 
last week four senior hud employees in the washington dc 
field office were placed on administrative leave after hud 
investigators found escrow agents may have embezzled as much as 10 
million through the program without being noticed 
washington authorities also want to question earl martin an 
attorney who has been missing for about a year about the 
disappearance of another 3 million 
another agent has been indicted by a federal grand jury in fort 
worth texas on charges of stealing 25 million from the sales of 
55 homes in the dallas area 
it appears that hud monitored these settlement agents with the 
same vigilance exxon used in watching over the skippers of its 
tankers said lantos comparing former hud secretary samuel 
pierces tenure at the agency to the recent alaska oil spill 
hud secretary jack kemp reportedly has ordered all 53 field 
offices to conduct reviews and give an accounting for all proceeds 
from the sales of the agencys property 
on thursday attorney general dick thornburgh also ordered 
federal prosecutors to examine the propertysales programs for 
evidence of criminal fraud and embezzlement 
hud already is reeling from allegations of mismanagement 
favoritism and influencepeddling in the administration of a 
rehabilitation program to renovate housing for the nations poor 
lantos decided to proceed with hearings on the propertysales 
program despite adams objections they might endanger the agencys 
probe 
i rarely find that it jeopardizes an investigation 
particularly if youre not granting use immunity said 
subcommittee member christopher shays rconn 
the more we investigate the more we uncover it just doesnt 
seem to end

editorials in chinas official media in the past 
few days indicate the leadership wants to turn the public against 
people the authorities have branded counterrevolutionaries 
a gang of political hoodlums the evil remnants of the gang of 
four and other dregs of society is how the peoples daily 
described students and supporters now condemned for seeking greater 
political freedoms 
the gang of four were the radical leaders of the 196676 violent 
farleft cultural revolution 
one of the four yao wenyuan was a former journalist who became 
known for the kind of vitriolic editorials that have appeared three 
straight days on the front page of the peoples daily the communist 
party paper 
some chinese said privately that the recent string of editorials 
were not up to the standard of yao and other cultural revolution 
propagandists who condemned socalled class enemies with a wide 
range of epithets including cow demon and snake spirit 
but todays editorial called the protesters an ideological 
pimple and said the words of senior leader deng xiaoping who 
ordered the crackdown were the most powerful ideological weapon 
for lancing it 
biting language also was used to condemn two american reporters 
who were ordered out of the country the economic daily called john 
pomfret of the associated press and alan pessin of the voice of 
america gods of plague who took advantage of and stirred up 
naive pure and innocent students 
they spread the plague to tiananmen square to all of china and 
the whole world it is time to sterilize it the paper said 
the namecalling reflected traditional emphasis on names and 
labels but also an urgent drive to convince anyone still in doubt 
about the correctness of the crackdown several editorials played on 
fears of a return to past turmoil 
if the protesters plot had succeeded greater turmoil and 
division would have occurred nationwide and the peoples republic 
that was paid for with the lives of countless martyrs would have 
been destroyed in a single day the peoples daily fumed thursday 
and the whole nation would have been enveloped in a white 
terror 
white terror was a reference to nationalist executions and 
imprisonments of communist underground workers during the civil war 
in the 1930s and 40s 
if we show weakness or turn backward in the face of capitalist 
attack the achievements of 40 years of socialism would be wiped 
out in a single day and china would once again become a dependency 
of imperialism said todays editorial 
some comrades havent opened up their minds and are still 
confused about certain issues it said abroad there is 
antichinese and anticommunist clamor and in china there is a 
market for every kind of rumor 
for these comrades beijing television continued its expanded 
nightly news report double the usual 15 minutes while the usual 
30minute national news ran more than an hour most of the 
television reports have shown arrests of protesters visits by top 
officials to soldiers enforcing martial law and workers gathered to 
study dengs recent speech applauding the crackdown 
in one report a group of workers in hardhats clapped hands and 
sang the childrens song without the communist party there would 
be no new china 
most newspapers have been published with only four pages instead 
of their usual eight for the past week because of a shortage of 
newsprint caused by martial lawrelated disruptions in 
transportation but almost all the space has been taken up by 
stories related to the crackdown

a federal appeals court has ruled that mci 
forfeited its opportunity to have a multibilliondollar federal 
telecommunications contract reopened because it failed to bid the 
first time 
mci did not act on time to become an interested party with 
regard to the solicitation the us court of appeals for the 
federal circuit said thursday mcis argument that it is an 
interested party must be rejected 
last december 7 the general services administration awarded the 
contract for one network to atampt and for the other to us sprint 
losing out was a third bidder martin marietta corporation whose 
proposal included a substantial share for mci 
the contracts for the two networks are among the largest 
nonmilitary awards by the us government they are valued at 
between 3 billion and 10 billion and they could reach a maximum 
25 billion over their 10year life 
mci went before the gsa board of contract appeals to challenge 
the award to atampt complaining that gsa after awarding the 
contract impermissibly waived requirements instead of resoliciting 
the contract 
the board rejected the claim in february saying that mci which 
was to have been a major subcontractor for martin marietta was not 
an interested party mci had claimed that if the contract were 
resolicited it would be a prospective bidder but the board 
rejected that also 
mci carried the case to the appeals court 
that court agreed with the government that the laws involved do 
not provide for a prospective bidder after the time has passed for 
submitting proposals 
mcis stated intention to submit a proposal in response to any 
resolicitation and its efforts to secure resolicitation by filing a 
protest can do nothing to creat the necessary interested party 
status said the court 
by the close of the proposal period mci had placed itself 
outside the boundaries of interested party status nothing later 
proven could alter the fact that mci did not act on time to become 
an interested party with regard to the solicitation 
and said the court nothing alters the fact that mci was not 
an actual or prospective bidder and therefore is not an interested 
party

an army general told western reporters today that 
soldiers of the peoples liberation army fired on unarmed civilians 
in tiananmen square then he contradicted himself and denied troops 
shot at the protesters 
in the governments first news conference for western reporters 
since it began cracking down on the movement for democracy gen li 
zhiyun said troops were forced to use violence to enter the city 
because people who didnt know the truth blocked them on the 
outskirts of beijing 
li said soldiers in tanks and armored personnel carriers later 
exercised restraint while clearing studentled demonstrators 
from tiananmen june 34 
but still there were some thugs they were still provocative 
to the troops at this time some of the soldiers in our troops 
directed their fire into the square and especially those troops that 
have wounded or dead soldiers within their troops the army 
spokesman said 
the rest of the soldiers started to fire on those thugs who 
were provocative to them 
but at another point during the news conference inside the great 
hall of the people le said of the deaths it is not from any 
instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the people this 
incident soldiers firing on citizens never happened within the 
area of beijing 
li did not clarify the contradiction 
no news agency reporters were allowed to attend the news 
conference or join a subsequent tour of tiananmen square associated 
press reporters viewed a videotape by cbs television that showed li 
speaking in chinese and another army official translating his 
remarks 
the government previously denied firing a single shot inside 
tiananmen square but has not commented on shooting elsewhere in the 
city some of the heaviest fighting was a mile away where civilians 
threw firebombs at tanks rolling through barricades erected by 
people trying to protect the students 
the militarysponsored tour of tiananmen gave selected foreign 
reporters their first look at the vast plaza since the military 
moved to crush the prodemocracy demonstrations there 
reporters who were in the square the night of the crackdown said 
there appeared to be less firing there than in other parts of the 
city possibly because the army was trying to avoid scarring it 
there were reports in the hong kong media that tanks rolled over 
tents in which students were sleeping and that soldiers later 
burned the bodies however western reporters said they only saw 
tanks roll over piles of bedding but were not sure if people were 
crushed 
all western reporters fled the square shortly before dawn after 
the army had begun moving into it 
the government says variously that 200 to 300 people died june 
34 and that most of those killed were soldiers unofficial chinese 
and western intelligence reports say troops fired on unarmed crowds 
killing up to 3000 people 
li said snipers on buildings on the edge of the square opened 
fire on soldiers 
in the process of clearing up the blockade on the square

the prosecutor in the perjury trial of pat 
swindall told jurors today that the former congressman got deeply 
involved in negotiations for an illegal money deal and lied 
repeatedly about it to a federal grand jury 
but swindalls attorneys argued that throughout his grand jury 
testimony he acknowledged the very matters he is charged with 
trying to conceal and they accused the government of vindictive 
prosecution 
in his closing statement at the 4weekold trial prosecutor 
craig gillen detailed for the jury the nine perjury counts against 
swindall the twoterm republican lost his congressional seat in 
atlantas eastern suburbs to democrat ben jones last november 
gillen began by citing swindalls testimony that he was never 
satisfied with respect to criminality of the proposed money deal 
but the prosecutor said after swindall was told to his face that 
the money he was seeking was the product of narcotics trafficking 
what does the former representative from the fourth district have 
to say he says i can assure you that anything you tell me is 
in total confidence 
the undercover agent at that meeting was telling this to a 
citizen a lawyer a united states congressman did patrick l 
swindall know it was illegal he sure did said gillen 
gillen also slammed swindall for telling the grand jury he didnt 
recall being told narcotics dollars were involved even though tapes 
played for the jury showed that statement was made to him three 
times at a posh west virginia resort 
do you think you would remember gillen asked the jury if 
you took a walk with a man you believed to be a criminal at one of 
the ritziest resorts in america he tells you narcotics dollars are 
involved and what he does violates currency laws do you think 
you would remember do you think you could ever forget 
in a closing statement for the defense attorney tom thrash 
charged that the us attorneys office was trying to add a former 
congressman to the trophy case truth justice fairness is all 
thrown out the window in their desperation to convict mr swindall 
thrash discussed each of the counts in the indictment as gillen 
had but he pointed to numerous times during the grand jury 
testimony when swindall acknowledged details that he elsewhere said 
he could not recall 
he urged the jury to look at swindalls testimony in its entirety 
and ask themselves did he have a specific intent to lie 
youve got to believe that he did not he would not have said what 
he said if it was his intent to deceive the grand jury 
another defense attorney richard hendrix said swindall was 
tired on the day of his grand jury testimony and that the former 
congressmans attorney had tried to get the testimony delayed 
because of swindalls condition he said swindall did the best he 
could 
the judge was to instruct the jurors after a lunch break and 
they could get the case as early as this afternoon 
one juror was excused this morning and will be replaced by an 
alternate after he reported that a friend had approached him to talk 
about the case 
swindall is charged with nine counts of perjury in his feb 2 
1988 testimony to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings 
with undercover agent mike mullaney posing as a drugmoney 
launderer and with swindall associate charles lechasney later 
convicted of money laundering and awaiting sentence lechasney 
cooperated with prosecutors in swindalls case 
swindall 38 faces 10 months to five years in prison on each of 
the nine counts under federal sentencing guidelines which apply to 
the case a conviction brings prison time 
he negotiated over a period of one month in august and september 
1987 seeking 850000 from the undercover agents sources for 
construction work on the thencongressmans luxurious suburban home 
the money was to go to swindall through a mortgage company set up by 
lechasney according to testimony

house found him nearby said police sgt steve jones 
the officers struggled with merrill during the capture and 
police confiscated a knife jones said merrill was being held at 
police headquarters

prisons 
merrill fled the toronto jail by climbing a fence around a 
rooftop exercise yard and sliding down a drainpipe he disappeared 
into torontos wooded don valley 
police initially followed a trail of blood from the exercise yard

scaled 
police say merrill came to canada in 1987 after escaping from 
somers state prison in connecticut he had been awaiting trial for

a new magazine called garbage is coming along 
to worry about the ecology of diapers and whether the gasoline you 
burn driving to the recycling center does more damage to the 
environment than recycling the old newspapers will do good 
it is intended for people like its editorpublisher patricia 
poore who says she worries about how much she throws away 
i think says ms poore we all feel vaguely uneasy and 
vaguely guilty when you bring the groceries home and realize that 60 
percent of what youve bought is packaging 
she thinks there are plenty of potential readers who worry about 
what the throwaway society is doing to the quality of life to use 
two buzzwords of the environmental movement 
the magazines full name is garbage the practical journal for 
the environment it will start publishing in august 
ms poore promises the magazine will look at both sides the 
downside as well as the benefits of environmental actions despite 
its basic bias 
you have to be proenvironment if you want any quality of life 
and possibly if you want any life at all she says 
when an environmentally sound way of doing things turns out to be 
more costly or more inconvenient garbage wont whitewash that fact 
ms poore says there often is no easy solution 
to show the conflicts that can arise even among those who want to 
do the environmentally correct thing ms poore points to her own 
quandry over whether to print the magazine on recycled paper the 
answer may seem obvious ms poore says but it was not easy 
the editor in me wanted recycled paper she says the 
publisher in me didnt 
recycled paper looks like whole wheat she says in her 
publishers pose it has gooky things in it they say it will 
break on the press 
the publisher in me said there was nothing wrong with premium 
paper and the printer told us they would charge 30 percent more to 
print it on recycled paper 
but the art director and the managing editor confronted her and 
said she would be a hypocrite to use virgin paper 
and the printer in environmentally conscience burlington vt 
relented and promised to charge no extra for the first three issues 
and see how things come out 
further research found crosspointe troy book paper a 
recycled paper that is very white and film coated and is easily 
recyclable itself ms poore says so the environment and the 
editor won the battle for the moment 
ms poore is the owner and publisher of the oldhouse journal it 
was a neighborhood paper for owners of brownstones in brooklyn ny 
when she bought it 11 years ago just as the preservation movement 
was catching on it now has a circulation approaching 165000 
garbage she says will be the only environmental magazine that 
is not issued by activists and thus free to take the moderator 
point of view and to have a sense of humor if youre the sierra 
club youve got to take a worstcase view and a sense of humor is 
a dangerous thing to have 
the pros and cons of biodegradable diapers will be examined in 
the first issue the pro is that they selfdestruct while the con is 
that they introduce human waste into landfills and possibly water 
tables 
the magazines conclusion cloth diapers are better

a federal appeals court today approved ah 
robins cos bankruptcy reorganization plan which will create a 
25 billion fund to cover claims against its illfated dalkon 
shield birth control device 
the plan also calls for the acquisition of robins by american 
home products corp of new york in a 700 million stockswap deal 
american home had the option of backing out of the deal if appeals 
in the case were not settled by next month 
we are extremely gratified that our legal position has been 
upheld on all accounts said dennis drebsky a robins attorney 
in a series of four unanimous opinions a threejudge panel of 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld the entire scope of the 
reorganization 
the ruling includes a one claimantone vote plan by which women 
injured by the intrauterine device ratified the settlement and a 
separate cash settlement by robins insurance company 
i think its just tremendous news for all dalkon shield 
claimants added guerry thornton attorney for the dalkon shield 
victims association it means the decade wait for fair treatment 
and vindication of their rights is almost over 
robins sought protection from its creditors in august 1985 in the 
face of millions of dollars in lawsuits brought by women who said 
they suffered injuries ranging from infections sterility and 
miscarriage to children with birth defects caused by the dalkon 
shield 
the richmondbased pharmaceutical manufacturers reorganization 
plan was approved in july 1988 by us district judge robert r 
merhige jr and us bankruptcy judge blackwell n shelley who 
jointly presided over numerous court proceedings 
the reorganization plan created a 25 billion trust fund to 
compensate about 200000 women with injury claims against the dalkon 
shield which was sold by the company in the early 1970s 
an appeal argued before the 4th us circuit court of appeals in 
december challenged the way the court determined that users of of 
the intrauterine device had approved the reorganization 
more than 95 percent of claimants who returned ballots to the 
bankruptcy court voted in favor of the plan but alan b morrison a 
lawyer for the public citizen litigation group in washington said 
the votes should have been weighted so that women with larger claims 
would have a greater voice in deciding the issue 
he also said claimants should not have been barred by the 
reorganization plan from filing thirdparty lawsuits to seek damages 
from robins officers or its insurer 
aetna casualty amp surety co robins insurer paid 425 million 
to the trust to settle any claims against it 
merhige and shelley tried to come up with a weighted voting plan 
but could find no way to estimate each claim in advance said 
robins attorney james c roberts of richmond 
based on expert testimony 25 billion was the estimated cost of 
full compensation for all dalkon shield claimants roberts said 
only 100 million of the 25 billion compensation package to dalkon 
shield claimants has been available during the appeal 
robins pulled the iud off the market in 1974 after about 45 
million of the devices had been distributed in the united states and 
abroad before entering bankruptcy proceedings robins settled 9400 
of approximately 15000 dalkon shield lawsuits with payments of 
about 520 million

hundreds of thousands of people attended 
a reburial ceremony today for imre nagy the leader of the 1956 
antisoviet revolt who was executed and buried in an unmarked grave 
the ceremony for nagy and four colleagues in heroes square 
amounted to a catharsis for hungary and mirrored remarkably swift 
political changes 
for example the ruling communist party which is following the 
soviet unions lead in adopting political reforms began talks this 
week with opposition leaders on holding multiparty elections 
after the ceremony in the square a motorcade took the coffins to 
rakoskert cemetery in suburban budapest where nagy and the others 
were dumped in unmarked graves after their executions in 1958 the 
five were reburied today in marked graves on the same spot known 
simply as plot 301 
we see this day as a dividing line which we hope will mean we 
can begin to build a new and free hungary said andras kaplar a 
member of the opposition hungarian democratic forum 
in washington the state department praised the reburial we 
see the rehabilitation of nagy as part of a larger process that 
of hungary coming to grips with the truth of its past said 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler this was an important day in 
hungary and one that was necessary as the country moves further 
along the path of freedom toward democracy 
mourners filled the square and filed past the coffins where 650 
wreaths from across hungary were piled up many people came to 
todays ceremony bearing flowers and wearing lapel pins with 
portraits of nagy or the national colors 
a sixth empty coffin lay beside the five others it symbolized 
all those who were killed by soviet tanks and troops that crushed 
the revolt and by later reprisals the names and biographies of 250 
young hungarians executed after the revolt were solemnly read 
the mourners estimated by hungarian television at 250000 
people included many of hungarys leading intellectuals hundreds 
of former prisoners in stalinist camps and onetime leaders of the 
failed revolt for a free hungary 
this day marks the change of an era said imre mecs who was 
sentenced to death after the uprising in a speech for delivery at 
the ceremony 
we are burying a regime that was bad from the start which was 
rejected by the nation which was forced upon us and which has 
proven bankrupt in every regard mecs said he was released from 
jail in 1963 after his death sentence was commuted 
a delegation of the communistled government headed by premier 
miklos nemeth was among those paying their respects 
italian socialist leader bettino craxi us ambassador mark 
palmer and diplomats from the soviet union and almost all other 
nations with embassies in budapest attended the ceremony 
hungarian television began allday broadcasting of the elaborate 
ceremonies black flags hung from many buildings in the capital 
hungarys neighbors also recalled the events of 1956 
austrian television planned a live broadcast of much of the 
ceremony 
the charter 77 human rights group in czechoslovakia sent a 
message honoring nagy as a symbol of the struggle for freedom 
democracy and embodiment of universal values which also guide us in 
our struggle for social rebirth 
however romania albania and north korea declined to send 
diplomats to the reburial china in the throes of its own 
crackdown also did not send a representative 
in the weeks preceding the reburial the government and the 
communist party gave startling reassessments of nagy who was 
executed in 1958 on trumpedup charges of high treason 
reburied along with nagy were his defense minister pal maleter 
his minister of state geza losonczy the head of his secretariat 
jozsef szilagyi and journalist and close nagy associate miklos 
gimes 
in a de facto rehabilitation the government hailed nagy as an 
outstanding statesman this week and the party said he had become 
a symbol of communist reform policies 
hundreds of exiled survivors of 1956 returned to budapest for the 
funeral many for the first time 
bela kiraly who was no 2 in the military in nagys shortlived 
government said the stalinists forced bolshevik ideas and the 
soviet system upon the hungarians they forged shackles out of 
ideology and put the hungarian nation into irons 
now living in the united states he returned home for the first 
time in 33 years to attend the funeral 
speaking for the independent hungarian youth organization fidesz 
viktor orban drew applause when he call for the soviets to withdraw 
their troops from hungary if we muster enough courage then we 
can put an end to communist dictatorship he added 
this week the party began talks with opposition leaders on 
multiparty elections a goal of the 1956 revolt 
until last february when the party leadership conceded that a 
popular uprising began the revolt of 1956 the party had called the 
events a counterrevolution 
the revolt grew out of popular revulsion toward the stalinist 
regime of matyas rakosi it began on oct 23 1956 with mass 
demonstrations for a new government and more democracy which led to 
nagys rise to power 
soviet tanks and troops moved into budapest on nov 4 1956 to 
end the uprising

housing construction fell 21 percent in may to 
the lowest level since the last recession in 1982 the government 
reported friday but analysts said declining interest rates will 
turn the industry around in coming months 
mortgage rates peaked at 1122 percent in march and fell to 102 
percent by last week causing many analysts to anticipate a jump in 
housing construction last month 
but after the commerce department on friday reported a decline in 
housing activity in may economists said the drop in rates had come 
too late to help last month but predicted improvement in months 
ahead 
it seems to us that the drop in interest rates occurred late in 
may and continued in june so the drop really was not felt in the 
may figures said robert rosenblatt an economist for the mortgage 
bankers association of america 
the impact of interest rates which we expect to trend downward 
for the rest of the year will have a positive effect on housing 
starts and we should see an appreciable pickup in the 
fallrosenblatt said 
david berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association agreed saying that we expect single family units to 
start going up in the next several months 
until recently the federal reserve had boosted interest rates 
for over a year as it sought to restrain economic growth in an 
attempt to restrain inflation 
john a tuccillo chief economist for the national association of 
realtors said many builders thought last months drop in mortgage 
rates might have been temporary 
further interest rate declines in june will provide the 
evidence needed to bring the markets around he said we expect 
the june numbers for housing starts to be higher 
at the same time some analysts were not so sanquine about the 
immediate future 
consumer sentiment generally is slackening said david 
seiders chief economist for the national association of 
homebuilders 
it doesnt seem the trend is getting any better particularly 
single family units contended real estate economist michael 
summichrest i dont see anything more than a dropoff for the rest 
of the year 
the commerce department reported that new homes and apartments in 
may were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 131 million 
units down from 134 million in april when construction fell 50 
percent 
the pace in may was the slowest since the 130 million rate in 
december 1982 and represented the fourth consecutive monthly 
decline the longest string since activity slowed for five months in 
a row from february through june 1987 
commerce said construction of singlefamily homes was off 46 
percent in may to an annual rate of 980000 units after rising 47 
percent in april the april pace followed drops of 47 percent in 
march and 142 percent in february 
apartment construction meanwhile rose 61 percent last month to 
an annual rate of 331000 units construction of multifamily units 
had fallen 271 percent in april and 18 percent in march 
the northeast led the overall decline in housing construction 
last month down 97 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
186000 units 
declines also were recorded in the midwest down 89 percent to 
245000 units and the south down 17 percent to 516000 units 
construction was up 74 percent in the west to an annual rate of 
364000 units 
applications for building permits a barometer of future housing 
activity turned up 01 percent in may after a 85 percent hike in 
april they had fallen the three previous months

americans paid more for food clothing and 
gasoline last month pushing the consumer price index up a steep 06 
percent the government said friday in a report analysts cited as 
evidence of a stubborn inflation problem 
consumer prices which had advanced an even stronger 07 percent 
in april have risen at an annual rate of 67 percent so far this 
year compared with price increases of 44 percent during 1987 and 
1988 
its not a pretty picture said economist bruce steinberg of 
merrill lynch capital markets in new york the basic message here 
is that inflation is tenacious and its not going to painlessly melt 
away 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
called the may price increase disappointing but said 
administration officials continue to believe that inflation will 
remain low and under control 
while prices rose in every major category last month the labor 
department attributed about onefourth of the overall may increase 
to a 39 percent uptick in gasoline prices that gain came on top of 
a startling 114 percent increase in gas prices during the previous 
month the largest jump on record 
analysts said the latest inflation report makes it unlikely that 
the federal reserve will act again in the near future to reduce 
interest rates 
the central bank in march 1988 began a 15month campaign in which 
it nudged interest rates upward in an attempt to curb inflation by 
restraining economy growth last week the fed slightly eased its 
grip on the money supply in the belief that the slowing economy 
would help to tame inflation 
i think the fed cannot ease again any time soon steinberg 
said its going to have to see a whole lot of economic weakening 
before it can ease again 
new evidence of the drag that higher interest rates have been on 
economic growth became available friday when the commerce department 
reported that construction of new homes and apartments declined in 
may for the fourth straight month 
housing starts declined 21 percent last month to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 131 million units the lowest level since 
the 1982 recession 
mays rise in the consumer price index was heavily influenced by 
a 06 percent increase in costs for food and beverages prices for 
fruits and vegetables shot up 32 percent and poultry costs rose by 
a like margin 
energy costs meanwhile increased 16 percent in may after 
shooting up 51 percent in april the uptick in both months was 
largely due to the surge in gasoline prices 
excluding the volatile food and energy categories all other 
consumer prices still were up a solid 05 percent in may after 
rising 02 percent in april many analysts believe these figures 
represent the core level of underlying inflationary pressures in 
the economy 
reports of inflations demise have been grossly exaggerated 
said economist david berson of the federal national mortgage 
association the core doesnt appear to be subsiding and with the 
economy running close to full employment will edge up as the year 
goes on 
apparel prices also showed a strong increase in may rising 08 
percent after a 03 percent rise in april smallerthanusual price 
declines for womens and girls clothing were largely responsible 
for the seasonally adjusted increase 
stacy kottman research coordinator for the economic forecasting 
center at georgia state university said last years fashion 
bust may have created pentup demand for clothing this year that 
allowed retailers to delay seasonal markdowns 
kottman said that despite the persistence of inflation in may 
price increases could return to the 4 percent range later this year 
as upward pressure on food and energy costs eases 
its not a good report but we can look forward to a plateauing 
of this increase kottman said in the last half of 1989 the 
inflation range will come down 
the various may price changes left the overall consumer price 
index at 1238 percent of its 198284 base this means that a 
hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 during the base period 
would have cost 12380 last month 70 cents more than in april 
in a separate report the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation fell 13 
percent in may after rising 05 percent a month earlier 
average weekly earnings in may before adjusting for inflation 
were 33120 up 34 percent from a year earlier taking the 54 
percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the 
12month period real weekly earnings were down 19 percent

relations between the vatican and the 
us catholic church have never been better the president of the 
national conference of catholic bishops said today 
i believe that the bridge between rome and the united states is 
stronger than it has been in recent memory said archbishop john 
l may of st louis 
may spoke after a morning mass that opened the annual spring 
meeting of the nations 300 bishops his address also expressed 
support for a document that proposes ways to resolve disputes 
between bishops and theologians 
the bishops are scheduled to vote saturday on the proposal which 
has been criticized by the vatican for appearing to place bishops 
and theologians on equal levels the bishops also were expected to 
tackle other controversial topics such as normalizing relations 
with vietnam 
the tone of mays talk contrasted markedly with a speech given by 
his predecessor archbishop james malone of youngstown ohio before 
a bishops meeting in 1986 malone spoke of a growing disaffection 
among segments of the church in the united states with rome 
may said today he believes relations have improved because of a 
series of encounters among the two groups including the popes us 
visit in 1987 meetings with individual bishops last year and a 
march meeting of cardinals and archbishops with vatican officials 
the recent meetings showed that whatever differences there are 
have to do with approach and not with doctrine he said 
may also appealed for the bishops to approve a proposed document 
on doctrinal responsibilities that has drawn substantial criticism 
from the vatican 
he said the document submitted by the bishops committee on 
doctrine tries to foster legitimate diversity in theology while 
upholding the authority of the magisterium or church hierarchy 
in march the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in rome 
said the proposed document which advocates the rights of 
theologians to lawful freedom of inquiry and expression of scholarly 
opinion gives the impression bishops and theologians are on an 
equal footing and tends logically to the erection of a second 
teaching authority in the church 
the most celebrated dispute in the us involves the rev charles 
curran a priest who lost his license to teach moral theology at the 
catholic university of america in washington for his opposition to 
some church teaching particularly in the area of sexual ethics 
the bishops also are scheduled to vote on a statement calling for 
a normalization of relations between the united states and vietnam 
said michael hurley spokesman for the newark archdiocese 
the fourday meeting at seton hall university ends monday

the energy department said today it expected to 
go ahead with plans for a new plutonium refinery in idaho despite a 
house panels recommendation that the department be stopped from 
starting construction next year 
we still stand on our position that it is a very important 
and vital project said kathy kaliniak a department spokeswoman 
a special panel of the house armed services committee voted in 
closed session thursday to recommend delaying the start of 
construction at the plant which the department contends will assure 
supplies of plutonium for nuclear weapons 
the panels decision adds to congressional pressure on the bush 
administration to seek negotiations with moscow to ban production of 
nuclear weapons materials 
the panel chaired by rep john spratt dsc recommended 
slashing 75 million from the administrations 1990 budget request 
for the plant known as the special isotope separation project 
the panel also stipulated that none of the 121 million that 
would remain for the project in 1990 could be used for construction 
or site preparation said chuck fant a spratt aide 
the plant is scheduled for construction at the federal idaho 
national engineering laboratory near idaho falls it would use a 
yettobedeveloped laser technology to convert fuelgrade plutonium 
to weapongrade material for nuclear weapons 
the energy department had planned to begin preparing the site for 
construction this month it already has spent 588 million on 
development of the technology 
the spratt panel was created earlier this year to review the 
administrations plans for modernizing the problemplagued weapons 
program and cleaning up its wastes the panel advises the armed 
services committee and its recommendations will go to a regular 
armed services subcommittee on military procurement 
an environmental group opposed to the idaho project hailed the 
panels decision as a sign that the tide has turned against the 
project expected to cost 31 billion 
the plant has never been needed and it will never be needed 
the snake river alliance said in a statement issued from boise 
idaho after the spratt panel acted 
energy secretary james d watkins has lobbied hard for the 
project which he contends is needed to ensure an adequate supply of 
weapongrade plutonium in the late 1990s 
fant predicted the full house would go along with the spratt 
panels recommended cuts 
opponents of the project including many leading members of 
congress contend the united states has more than adequate supplies 
of plutonium and that embarking on additional production would hurt 
chances for new superpower arms control deals 
a group of 29 scientists and arms control experts last month 
urged congress to reconsider the idaho project saying it was not 
needed for national security and would undermine us efforts to 
limit the spread of nuclear weapons 
spratt said earlier this week that he opposed starting 
construction in idaho in 1990 saying while the requirement for 
plutonium is real it is not compelling reflecting a view widely 
held in the house spratt said delaying construction would buy 
time for the united states to negotiate arms issues with the 
soviets 
spratt also said a delay would allow time to complete a critical 
set of experiments on the isotope separation technology he said the 
tests could not be finished before next fall 
the house and senate are considering bills aimed at compelling 
the administration to seek negotiations with the soviet union to ban 
plutonium production bush opposes the bills the soviets have 
expressed interest in a mutual ban 
the administration also is encountering stiff congressional 
opposition to its plans for building two nuclear reactors one in 
idaho and another in south carolina to produce tritium a 
radioactive gas used in making nuclear warheads 
the spratt panel decided to recommend authorizing the 303 
million sought by the administration for development of the new 
tritiumproducing reactors in 1990 fant said 
a bid by rep pat schroeder dcolo to cut 100 million from 
the program was defeated in a close vote fant said

a member of parliament on friday predicted a famine 
if radical agricultural reform is not undertaken in the next year 
and he blamed bureaucrats for the miserable performance of soviet 
farms 
other members of the parliament the congress of peoples 
deputies told a news confernce that agricultural reform must be a 
top priority but said widespread hunger was unlikely 
i am sure that if radical transformations are not undertaken 
next year there will be famine waiting for us said deputy 
vladimir tikhonov an economist 
tikhonov noted that the soviet union is forced to import potatoes 
even though large tracts of land are wellsuited to raising a 
substantial crop 
he also criticized low agricultural productivity that results in 
chronic shortages of meat fruit vegetables and grain needed for 
flour the soviet union also must import grain 
he said the country may have to reduce imports because of a 
shortage of hard currency 
despite attempts at agricultural reform in president mikhail s 
gorbachevs economic revival program such products as meat sugar 
butter and potatoes are rationed in many parts of the country 
tikhonov said the key to improving farm production lies in land 
reform and reducing the massive state bureaucracy administrators 
are responsible for the crisis he said without elaborating the 
state controls distribution of seed gasoline farm machinery and 
fertilizer 
the communist partys policymaking central committee in march 
approved a policy of leasing land to farmers for 50 years but 
maintained the state and cooperative farms that many blame for 
shortages 
politburo member yegor k ligachev who heads a party commission 
to redress agricultural problems was criticized as incompetent at 
the session of the congress that ended last week 
oleg bogomolov director of the institute of economics and world 
socialist systems and a parliament deputy told the news conference 
economic reform must begin with agriculture and that peasants must 
be given land 
commenting on tikhonovs prognosis bogomolov said while the 
possibility of famine exists i dont think it is a probability 
bogomolov said a lack of agricultural reform could have 
destabilizing effects on the economy in general 
leonid abalkin head of the institute of economics and a 
parliament deputy named to head a new government commission on 
economic reform said he didnt think the word famine was 
quite right but did not offer his own prediction

time inc today rejected a 107 billion buyout 
offer from paramount communications inc previously 
planned tender offer for warner communications that values warner at 
more than 124 billion 
the move comes amid a complicated threeway ba and launched attle 
for time 
which had announced a merger with warner before paramount jumped in 
with its own bid for time that was launched june 7 
paramount said today it will proceed with its unwanted 
175ashare bid 
time and warner had been expected to try to salvage their deal 
which would create the worlds largest media company 
after the announcement warner stock jumped 387 to 5950 a 
share on the new york stock exchange and times slipped 387 to 
16762 a share paramount stock was down 1 to 5850 a share 
paramounts unsolicited 175ashare offer was not in the best 
interests of the company because it is financially inadequate and 
highly conditional time said 
time said it would pay r either 
company 
in addition time filed a lawsuit to block paramount from taking 
any steps to disrupt the merger of time and warner 
communications inc 
the suit filed at federal court in manhattan charged securities 
laws violations and sought a preliminary injunction to prevent 
paramount from aquiring or attempting to acquire any shares of 
times stock and making or attempting to make any tender offer 
for times securities 
the lawsuit charged that paramount made false and misleading 
statements in its tender offer 
paramount calling times bid for warner a defensive device 
pure and simple said it would continue its pursuit of time 
from the standpoint of time shareholders we dont see how it 
begins to compare with our offer of 175 a share in cash for all 
share paramount said 
securities analysts said the bid for warner does little to 
resolve times battle with paramount 
peter appert the media analyst for the investment firm cj 
lawrence morgan grenfell inc said time still has the problem of 
figuring out a way to get to its shareholders value that is 
equal to the 175 a share paramount has offered 
one way for time to increase shareholder value would be to pay a 
special cash dividend but appert doubted whether time could afford 
to acquire warner and pay the dividend 
he said the decline in times stock price today indicated wall 
street is skeptical that the time bid for warner will be successful 
if the market thought the bid would be successfully completed he 
said times stock price would be down substantially more 
time and warner agreed in march to merge in an allstock deal 
under which time stockholders would get a share in the new company 
timewarner inc for each time share while warner shareholders 
would get 0465 of a share of the new company for each of their 
warner shares 
in todays statement time reiterated that it is not for sale 
we are convinced that remaining independent and combining 
operations with wci will best serve the interests of time its 
stockholders and its other constituencies time chairman j 
richard munro said 
time said its board turned down the paramount offer because the 
bid was highly conditional in terms of obtaining the required 14 
billion in financing and securing regulatory approval which time 
said paramount might never receive 
an extended delay in the closing of the tender offer would 
substantially reduce the present value of the offer to time 
shareholders time said 
paramount formerly called gulf amp western inc announced its bid 
for time on june 6 just 2 weeks before time and warner 
shareholders were to vote on the proposed merger the tender offer 
was formally launched the next day 
time and warner did not immediately say whether their shareholder 
meetings scheduled for june 23 would take place 
since paramount announced its bid there has been intense 
speculation on wall street over what steps time and warner would 
take to preserve their planned merger a time tender offer for 
warner was among the options the two companies were expected to 
explore 
on thursday paramount chairman martin davis sent a letter to the 
time board complaining he had not heard from the company and 
indicating he might be willing to sweeten his offer reportedly to 
pressure the time board 
in a separate development thursday time and warner said new york 
city officials approved the proposed transfers in ownership of the 
six cable franchises in the city owned by either time or warner 
time and warner together own cable systems serving about 55 
million subscribers but must get permission from local cable 
authorities in each case to transfer the ownership to the new 
company

a spokeswoman said friday that the state 
department was disappointed that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev failed to promise unconditionally to tear down the berlin 
wall 
gorbachev drawing praise thursday from west german officials 
said the wall between east germany and west germany could come down 
when those conditions that created it fall away 
we noted president gorbachevs remarks that the wall could come 
down some day said state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
we just wish he would drop the words some day she added 
the west consistently has called for the wall to come down 
immediately she said 
the most recent such appeal was made by president bush in a 
speech he gave in the west german town of mainz earlier this month 
it is disappointing that gorbachev said that the wall could 
only come down when conditions that created a need for it 
disappear ms tutwiler said the wall can never be justified 
east germany has maintained the 100mile wall is needed to 
prevent skilled workers from leaving the country and endangering the 
economy the united states has responded that the wall drives a 
wedge between the german people and perpetuates tensions in europe 
gorbachev winding up a visit to west germany told reporters 
that the wall was raised in a concrete situation and was not 
dictated only by evil intention it can disappear when those 
conditions that created it fall away he added 
west german officials praised the remarks saying gorbachevs 
willingness to discuss the matter suggested a new phase in the 
kremlins dealings there 
but ms tutwiler disagreed saying such a statement represents 
what gorbachev himself calls old thinking the bush 
administration has urged the reformminded soviet leader to 
demonstrate new thinking by allowing more domestic liberalization 
and relaxing kremlin control over its allies

the state department criticized israel friday 
for closing down the offices of a prominent palestinian intellectual 
blamed for directing an 18month uprising against israeli rule of 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the criticism came as soviet and us officials held a second day 
of talks on ways of advancing peace talks between israel the 17 
million palestinians under its control and israels arab neighbors 
the talks at the state department are a continuation of the 
periodic consultations between the superpowers begun by the previous 
us administration to foster cooperation in various parts of the 
world 
but us officials say this time the discussions on the middle 
east could result in a role for the soviet union in the socalled 
arabisraeli peace process which has so far been orchestrated 
mostly by the united states 
the soviets have been making some positive comments in recent 
months that could give them a concrete role said one official 
who asked not to be named 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler declined to 
discuss specifics of the talks saying only they had been 
constructive 
the united states wants the soviets to use their influence with 
the hardline arab states like syria and iraq as well as the 
palestine liberation organization to push forward arabisraeli 
peace talks but it continues to insist the soviets can only become 
active partners in the dialogue if they renew the diplomatic ties 
they broke with israel in 1967 
tutwiler said israels decision to shut the offices of sari 
nusseibeh an islamic philosophy professor and journalist with close 
ties to plo leader yasser arafat was counterproductive to its 
recent proposal for elections of palestinian negotiators in the 
occupied territories 
we are disturbed by actions such as this she said at a 
time when israel has put forth a positive and constructive 
initiative aimed at reaching out to palestinians its hard to see 
how this step can be helpful 
if as israel contends nusseibeh has engaged in illegal 
activities he should be afforded an appropriate open judicial 
proceeding tutwiler added 
the nusseibeh case which has attracted wide attention because of 
his ties with western journalists is likely to come up in talks 
friday between state department officials and israeli justice 
minister dan meridor

anniversary of the soweto township riots in south africa with a call 
on friday for the release of imprisoned black nationalist leader 
nelson mandela 
since that day in 1976 the tragedy of soweto has been played 
out again and again said a statement released by the state 
department the united states deplores the continuing resort to 
violence by all parties in south africa

country illegally 
the department also urged freedom for other political 
prisoners and an end to the declared state of emergency under 
which legal rights of south africans have been suspended in response 
to opposition to apartheid 
we urge the south african government and its opponents to enter 
into serious negotiations leading to the dismantling of apartheid 
and its replacement by a just social order the department said 
the riots that began in soweto a large township outside 
johannesburg on june 16 1976 spread to other parts of south 
africa in succeeding months leading to the deaths of an estimated

federal prosecutors on friday got orders to be 
especially vigilant on stern prosecution of violent offenders as 
president bush directed them not to make deals with criminals who 
use guns 
bush continued touting the crime package he delivered to congress 
this week by inviting the nations 94 us attorneys to the white 
house friday morning and later having lunch with a group of law 
enforcement agency heads 
in remarks to the us attorneys the president said were 
going to up the stakes for those who calculate that our criminal 
justice system is a crapshoot where the risks are worth the rewards 
and when criminals think about reaching for a gun theyre going to 
know and theyre gong to learn that they will do time hard 
time 
attorney general dick thornburgh distributed guidelines to the 
us attorneys to implement the presidents approach 
thornburgh wrote in all but exceptional cases such as those in 
which the defendant has provided substantial assistance to the 
government in the investigation or prosecution of crimes by others 
federal prosecutors will seek conviction for any offense involving 
the unlawful use of a firearm which is readily provable 
the guidelines said that sentencing should reflect the totality 
and seriousness of the defendants conduct 
the specific affirmation of these policies by the president 
requires that you be especially vigilant about their full 
implementation in your district thornburgh wrote 
bush called the prosecutors the commanders at the frontlines 
and urged them to help put away the nations most wanted 
the situation in our streets has been aptly compared to a 
shooting war he told the gathering in the east room of the white 
house 
the events friday were to keep the spotlight on the 12 billion 
legislation he sent to congress on thursday with his anticrime 
proposals 
the package calls for 1 billion in new prison capacity in 
addition to hiring 1600 new prosecutors to work under the us 
attorneys and 825 new federal agents 
it also calls for doubling the mandatory penalty for use of 
semiautomatic weapons in drug or violent crimes to 10 years

a jury began deliberating federal perjury charges 
against pat swindall friday after hearing a prosecutor describe the 
former congressman as a liar who was willing to deal with the 
devil but only in private 
the jury got the case about 230 pm and planned to deliberate 
about an hour before going home us district judge richard c 
freeman said deliberations will continue saturday 
in his closing statement in the 4weekold trial assistant us 
attorney craig gillen said swindall knew he was negotiating for an 
illegal money deal made plans to cover his tracks and then lied 
repeatedly about it to a grand jury investigating money laundering 
defense attorneys said swindall was guilty of poor judgment in 
considering the money deal but never did anything wrong and did his 
best to recall the details for the grand jury 
swindall was indicted on nine counts of perjury for lying to a 
grand jury on feb 2 1988 about his negotiations with an 
undercover agent posing as a money launderer and with a swindall 
associate concerning an 850000 loan to finish building the former 
congressmans luxurious home 
gillen noted that swindall told the grand jury he couldnt recall 
being told the money was drugrelated and said he had walked away 
from it basically 
the prosecutor pointed out that in a sept 13 1987 meeting with 
the agent and swindall associate charles lechasney swindall was 
repeatedly told the money was drugrelated but continued to deal 
he will deal with the devil gillen said he sat there and 
listened to it and he didnt walk away 
gillen scoffed at the notion that swindall didnt recall that 
meeting with undercover agent mike mullaney at west virginias posh 
greenbriar resort 
do you think you would remember gillen asked the jury if 
you took a walk with a man you believed to be a criminal at one of 
the ritziest resorts in america and he tells you narcotics dollars 
are involved what he does violates currency laws 
do you think you would remember do you think you could ever 
forget 
swindall who did not testify in his own defense sat still jaw 
clenched as gillen accused him of lies 
swindalls lead defense attorney richard hendrix admitted to 
the jury that swindall is guilty of poor judgment foolishness 
stupidity and just plain being dumb 
but he attacked the credibility of lechasney an admitted con man 
who testified for the prosecution and pointed out that former us 
attorney larry thompson advising swindall before his grand jury 
appearance urged a postponement because of swindalls fatigue 
did you believe larry thompson did you find him a credible 
man hendrix asked if you did thats reasonable doubt on every 
count 
gillen angrily noted that swindall was granted a postponement of 
his appearance but refused in order to keep to his schedule 
defense attorney thomas thrash accused the government of 
inviting swindall into a perjury trap in order to add a united 
states congressman to the trophy case 
thrash argued that in his grand jury testimony swindall 
acknowledged many of the things he is accused of misleading the 
grand jury about and he said that while swindall is a sinner 
hes not a criminal 
in the name of god thrash whispered to the jury let this 
nightmare end now 
swindall under the cloud of the perjury indictment against him 
lost his congressional seat in atlantas eastern suburbs to democrat 
ben jones last november

an ancient chumash indian village with 
artifacts dating back at least 5000 years has been discovered by 
workers bulldozing a college campus site where a new building was 
planned 
the first artifact buried beneath thomas aquinas college was 
discovered may 6 said byron estes associate planner for ventura 
county 
since the discovery and subsequent excavation college 
administrators county officials archaeologists and the owl clan of 
chumash indians have been quietly reinterring remains originally 
buried more than 500 years ago the santa paula chronicle reported 
thursday 
archaeologists have long searched for the village contemporary 
chumash knew of as mupu they determined in 1976 that chumash 
artifacts were buried around the small catholic college nestled in 
a largely rural area 50 miles northwest of downtown los angeles 
the bulldozer made its first pass and brought up bones said 
cw clewlow of ancient enterprises inc a cultural resources 
consulting firm in santa monica 
the remains have been removed and reburied by the chumash who 
have been wonderfully cooperative about the whole recovery said 
clewlow a former chief archaeologist at the university of 
california los angeles clewlow had been involved in the search 
since 1976 
chumash tribes usually having 60 to 160 members lived close to 
the southern california coast from santa monica to san luis obispo 
the chumash were the only new world indians to make plank canoes 
seaworthy enough to travel in the ocean the tribes were believed to 
have a population of 2000 when spanish explorer juan cabrillo first 
landed on the california shore in 1542

the only state in the nation to require premarital 
aids testing found only eight cases of the virus in six months at a 
cost of 25 million says a study by illinois public health chief 
dr bernard turnock has fought the illinois testing program from 
the outset and has said repeatedly that the results do not justify 
the expense 
turnock and a colleague at the department of public health say in 
a study published friday that they found that of the 70846 marriage 
license applicants tested for aids in the first six months of the 
program only 011 percent were infected with the aids virus 
illinois is the only state that requires the tests prior to 
issuing marriage licenses in 1987 33 states considered similar 
legislation but only illinois and louisiana adopted it louisiana 
repealed its law after six months according to the article in 
fridays journal of the american medical association 
illinois adopted the law in 1986 spurred by those who said the 
testing would prevent the spread of the aids virus among 
heterosexuals and their children 
a move to repeal premarital aids testing law is pending in the 
state senate and may come to a vote next week 
the period turnock studied was from january to june 1988 in a 
more recent examination he found that of 150000 marriage 
applicants tested through november 1988 23 tested positive for the 
virus 
the illinois experience with premarital testing provides a 
strong argument against widespread mandatory or publicly supported 
hiv antibody screening of low prevalence population the authors 
wrote 
the authors also noted that the number of marriage licenses 
issued during the first six months of the program dropped 225 
percent as about 10300 residents traveled to other states to get 
married 
that cost illinois 77250 in revenue they said

at least two more chinese diplomats in the 
united states have been granted refuge here state department 
sources said today 
meanwhile white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
bush deplores the persecutions of chinese demonstrators but has no 
current plans to impose further sanctions on china 
two diplomats in san francisco last week were given us 
permission to remain in the country a state department official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said today there have been 
additional chinese officials who have asked for protection in the 
united states 
such diplomats are covered under bushs recent order that grants 
any chinese citizen permission to stay in the united states until 
june 1990 the official said 
the chinese diplomats have not formally asked for asylum but 
could do so in the future the official said 
he source declined to specify the number of chinese diplomats 
involved and said he could not confirm a report that two diplomats 
in the chinese embassy in washington had sought such protection 
secretary of state james a baker iii has been negotiating with 
chinese ambassador han xu to resolve a dispute over the chinese 
dissident fang lizhi and his wife who are being shielded in the 
us embassy in beijing 
speaking of administration plans with regard to china white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we continue to watch 
the situation well continue to measure it as we go forward 
sanctions are always a part of that review but we have nothing to 
announce 
fitzwater speaking a day after the chinese government sentenced 
some protesters to death declined to characterize bushs reaction 
to the current effort by beijing to rewrite the story of the bloody 
protest and its claim that no demonstrators were killed 
but he said anyone who has seen the television reports knows what 
happened despite the chinese propoganda attempts 
those matters all speak for themselves the pictures and the 
reality of the reporting has been so dramatic that these kind of 
efforts stand beside them so starkly that i wouldnt even want to 
try to diminish that by giving it words fitzwater said 
fitzwater read from a prepared statement saying the 
persecution of people for the exercise of basic human rights such as 
the freedom of expression freedom of association freedom of the 
press is of course deplorable 
further he said the aspirations expressed by the people 
killed in tiananmen square and those who are being persecuted today 
will not be stilled by harsh repression 
we believe that dialogue and reform not arrests and show 
trials are the route which offer the best hope for stability in 
china 
the comments bolstered those of a top administration official 
thursday that the united states still can do business with chinese 
leader deng xiaoping despite his military crackdown and the massacre 
of hundreds perhaps thousands of people 
bush has been reluctant to affix blame for chinas bloodshed but 
has said it would be extraordinarily difficult for the united 
states to have normal relations with officials responsible for the 
massacre of students and workers participating in prodemocracy 
protests 
however the administration official a top policymaker in bushs 
inner circle who spoke on condition of anonymity said us ties 
with china involve a very important relationship with a very 
important country 
despite the crackdown the official said china has come a long 
way since 1972 when washington reestablished ties with beijing 
the official called china a great important country in the world 
and we have great stakes there 
i think they have made a decision that theyre going to restore 
order and that theyre going to try to rediscipline the system 
the official said it is not so clear that they have made a major 
reversal in course and will not resume a path like they were on 
before i think its premature to make that decision 
the official appeared open to continued contacts with deng 
chinas senior leader who has praised the military for its bloody 
assault against chinese citizens 
he is the head of a very major country there are lots of heads 
of government and state who do things that we dont like that we do 
business with the official said 
are you suggesting we should not have done any business with 
soviet leaders nikita khrushchev leonid brezhnev anybody who 
has done anything wrong the official asked 
saying it was premature to say china has abandoned reforms the 
official added it is not so clear that they have made a major 
reversal in course and will not resume a path like they were on 
before

thousands of blacks stayed away from 
work and school friday to mark the 13th anniversary of the soweto 
township riots in which police opened fire on black schoolchildren 
protesting education policies 
the riots brought a new level of militancy to the antiapartheid 
movement and the government does not recognize the june 16 soweto 
day holiday declared by blacks and recognized by most major 
employers 
the us government observed the anniversary with a call for the 
release of imprisoned black leader nelson mandela at the united 
nations the security council called on south africa to eliminate 
apartheid 
an estimated 500700 blacks were killed in nationwide riots that 
erupted after police fired on children marching in soweto to protest 
being taught in afrikaans the language of the white afrikaners who 
control the government 
vandals on thursday smashed the tombstone of hector pieterson a 
13yearold who was the first person killed june 16 1976 friends 
said pietersons mother found the smashed headstone at a cemetery in 
soweto when she arrived to place flowers on the grave friday 
the event will remain forever etched in letters of stone and 
gold in the history of this land when the children said enough is 
enough anglican archbishop desmond tutu told a church service in 
the black township of manenberg near cape town 
when you perpetuate injustice oppression and exploitation you 
are not just taking on ordinary human beings you are fighting 
against god he said 
police used tear gas to disperse 3000 people who attended a 
rally at the regina mundi roman catholic church in soweto the black 
township of 25 million outside johannesburg

achieved they now can choose which language they are taught in but 
other complaints about black education have not been addressed the 
government recently abandoned its plan to make black and white 
education standards equal in 10 years saying the booming population 
of black children and reduced government revenues makes it 
impossible the government spends five times as much for every white 
childs schooling as it does for each black pupil 
at the united nations us ambassador thomas pickering speaking 
as president of the un security council said the council 
condemned the south african government for its use of force in

the state department and the senate foreign 
relations committee chairman welcomed on friday cubas arrest of a 
decorated army general on corruption charges as a potential turning 
point in the countrys approach to narcotics problems 
south american drug dealers have been making increasing use of 
cuban air space and territorial waters for usbound narcotics 
deliveries an activity that us officials last week said strongly 
suggested the collaboration of cuban authorities 
cuba is directly in the flight path between colombia and south 
florida and the number of suspicious northbound flights through 
cuban airspace has increased in the past several months according 
to administration officials 
the coast guard also has detected an increase in air drops of 
drugs into cuban territorial waters the cargo is then picked up by 
speedboats for delivery to us ports the officials said 
to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the cuban 
government has admitted involvement of cuban officials in drug 
smuggling operations margaret tutwiler the state department 
spokesman said of the arrest of gen arnaldo ochoa 
the cuban party newspaper granma said ochoa had been taken into 
custoday because he engaged in grave acts of corruption and 
dishonest use of economic resources 
ochoa is a veteran of fighting in angola and ethiopia and also 
served as commander of cuban forces in nicaragua in the mid1980s 
according to rafael fermoselle a cuban exile and an expert on the 
cuban military ochoa was awarded the title hero of the 
revolution in 1984 
ms tutwiler noted that the june 15 edition of cubas commmunist 
party newspaper had accused ochoa and and other officials of 
making contacts with international drug traffickers and reaching 
agreements with them 
she also pointed out that cuba radio reported that two armed 
force officers and four ministry of interior officers had been 
arrested and quoted the report as saying that it is possible that 
ochoa and his accomplices cooperated in drug trafficking operations 
near cuban territory 
the spokeswoman said the administration hopes the charges 
against ochoa and the other officers will be investigated and if 
found true will be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible 
meanwhile sen claiborne pell dri foreign relations 
committee chairman said this arrest could open the way for 
mutually beneficial cooperation between the united states and cuba 
to combat the narcotics trafficking that is taking place in the sea 
and air space that we share 
pell earlier proposed that the us coast guard and the cuban 
border patrol cooperate on narcotics interdiction

four associates were interred again 31 years after they were put to 
death and buried in unmarked graves on the same spot

chinas leadership intensified efforts friday to 
absolve itself in the deaths of prodemocracy protesters a 
government spokesman also acknowledged for the first time there was 
a split among communist party officials over how to deal with the 
popular uprising 
also on friday nearly 100 more people were arrested nationwide 
for taking part in the protests including a fourth person named on 
a wanted list of 21 student leaders and the government ordered two 
more western reporters to leave the country 
an army spokesman gen li zhiyun said for the first time that 
soldiers fired into tiananmen square the night of june 34 but 
later contradicted himself 
some of the soldiers directed their fire into the square 
li told selected western reporters during a news conference at the 
great hall of the people 
at another point however li said of the deaths it is not 
from any instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the 
people this incident never happened within the area of beijing 
reporters who were not allowed to attend the news conference 
obtained the comments by watching a cbs news videotape li spoke 
through an official translator and did not clarify the remarks 
before the news conference the military took selected western 
reporters on their first tour of the square since the fighting 
the government campaign appeared aimed at demonstrating that 
protesters were not shot while they were inside the 100acre square 
the symbolic center of power in china 
although tiananmen square was the focus of the demonstrations 
reporters on the scene said most of the shooting was on changan 
avenue the main road to the square but there were conflicting 
reports during the confused fighting in the darkness and some 
students reported shooting inside the square 
other shooting incidents were reported from the edges of the 
square and at the bridge at muxudi the western gateway to the inner 
city reporters saw many wounded students treated at tents set up by 
protesters in tiananmen square 
the heaviest fighting occurred on the road to the square and the 
government has previously acknowledged that some soldiers shot 
civilians to death while pushing their way toward tiananmen but 
officials have insisted that no shots were fired when troops entered 
the square with tanks and that no one died there 
the government says the fighting killed nearly 100 soldiers and 
police and about 100 civilians chinese witnesses and western 
intelligence estimate the death toll may have been as high as 3000 
chinas evening tv news showed crews disinfecting the square 
repairing the pavement and replanting bushes it did not say when it 
would be reopened 
soldiers held solemn memorials for troops killed in the fighting 
shrines were set up on the streets where several soldiers died and 
tv showed residents bowing in front of pictures of the dead 
government spokesman yuan mu asked in an interview with nbc news 
about the fate of communist party general secretary zhao ziyang 
said it is true that certain individuals in the top chinese 
leadership are guilty of supporting the counterrevolutionary of 
supporting turmoil 
but their questions will be dealt with soon and will be made 
public he said he did not mention zhao by name 
the party chief has not been seen in public since may 19 when he 
visited student protesters occupying tiananmen square and tearfully 
appealed to them to go home he said with apparent sympathy that the 
problems they had raised including official corruption would be 
resolved with time 
premier li peng declared martial law in beijing the next day 
sources later said senior leader deng xiaoping joined by aging 
conservatives stripped zhao of his power but that he had yet to be 
formally removed from office 
yuan skirted a question on whether china might invade the us 
embassy in beijing to arrest dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li 
shuxian who took refuge there after the army marched into tiananmen 
he must be brought to justice we will deal with him according 
to legal procedures yuan said the translator stumbled on the 
reply saying fang had been served a death an arrest warrant 
the official media continued its attacks on the protesters and on 
fang who is accused of plotting to overthrow the party he did not 
participate in the demonstrations 
hardliners called on the nation to study the penetrating 
analysis of deng on the true goals of the sevenweek studentled 
movement for a freer society 
the party newspaper the peoples daily said this is the most 
powerful ideological weapon for lancing every kind of ideological 
pimple 
it described the students and their supporters as a gang of 
political hoodlums the evil remnants of the gang of four and other 
dregs of society the gang of four were the radical leaders of the 
196676 violent farleft cultural revolution 
the number of arrests reported since the crackdown began climbed 
past 1185 among arrests announced friday was ma shaofeng a 
24yearold student from the beijing film academy who was a leader 
in the independent student union that organized the protests 
a radio report said ma surrendered in southeastern chinas 
guangdong province that left at large 17 of the 21 student leaders 
named on a wanted circular distributed tuesday 
the government gave two journalists from britains independent 
television network 24 hours to leave the country vernon mann and 
john elphinstone both in china on temporary visas had been filming 
the aftermath of protests in the southwestern city of chengdu 
another itn reporter was ordered expelled from shanghai last 
week two beijingbased reporters john pomfret of the associated 
press and alan pessin of the voice of america were scheduled to 
leave china on saturday after being ordered out 
chinese authorities accused all of the journalists of violating 
martial law regulations which ban coverage of the protests 
the american committee of the international press institute 
issued a statement in philadelphia deploring the expulsions 
it is essential that reporters or organizations such as the 
associated press have the access and opportunity to report said 
eugene l roberts executive editor of the philadelphia inquirer and 
committee chairman 
we urge the leaders of the peoples republic to reinstate john 
pomfret and to increase not decrease access to events in china

an army general said friday that the peoples 
liberation army fired on unarmed civilians when it entered tiananmen 
square because soldiers were provoked by thugs 
but at a confusing news conference gen li zhiyun later 
contradicted that statement saying soldiers did not shoot at the 
protesters 
the government invited selected journalists to attend the news 
conference the first since it began its crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement and a subsequent tour of the square 
news agencies were not allowed to participate associated press 
reporters obtained lis remarks by viewing a videotape made by cbs 
news he spoke through a translator 
li said troops were forced to use violence to enter the city on 
june 34 because people who didnt know the truth blocked the 
soldiers on the outskirts of beijing 
he said soldiers in tanks and armored personnel carriers 
exercised restraint in trying to clear studentled demonstrators 
from tiananmen 
but still there were some thugs li said during the news 
conference in the great hall of the people near the square at 
this time some of the soldiers in our troops directed their fire 
into the square and especially those troops that have wounded or 
dead soldiers within their troops 
the rest of the soldiers started fire to those thugs who were 
provocative to them 
but at another point li said of the deaths it is not from any 
instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the people this 
incident soldiers firing on citizens never happened within the 
area of beijing 
li did not clarify the contradiction 
the government previously had denied that a single shot was fired 
in tiananmen but had not commented on shooting elsewhere in the 
city 
the governments actions friday appeared to be part of a campaign 
aimed at demonstrating that protesters were not shot while they were 
inside the 100acre square 
although tiananmen square was the focus of the demonstrations 
reporters on the scene said most of the shooting was on changan 
avenue the main road to the square but there were conflicting 
reports during the confused fighting in the darkness and some 
students reported shooting inside the square 
other shooting incidents were reported from the edges of the 
square and at the bridge at muxudi the western gateway to the inner 
city reporters saw many wounded students treated at tents set up by 
protesters in tiananmen square 
li said protesters in tiananmen attacked soldiers with sticks and 
threw stones and bricks and that snipers fired on them from 
buildings on the edge of the square 
some of the soldiers were beaten until they fainted and even 
some were beaten until death li said 
the xinhua news agency said nearly 100 soldiers and police died 
and that thousands were injured while about 100 civilians died and 
nearly 1000 were injured it did not account for the discrepancy 
with government figures issued last week that said nearly 300 people 
died altogether 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources said the death 
toll may have been as high as 3000 
reporters in the square the night of the crackdown said there 
appeared to be less firing there than in other parts of the city 
there were reports in the hong kong media that tanks rolled over 
tents in which students were sleeping and that soldiers later 
burned the bodies western reporters said they only saw tanks roll 
over piles of bedding but were not sure if people were crushed 
reporters saw soldiers firing indiscriminately at crowds as the 
troops moved toward the square western reporters fled the square 
shortly after the army began moving in 
students had occupied the square for several weeks before the 
crackdown 
tiananmen is in the center of beijing and is the symbolic heart 
of china on one side stands the former imperial palace on another 
is the great hall of the people the seat of government 
it remained closed to pedestrians on friday

japan and hong kong announced friday they will end 
most ivory imports as part of a worldwide effort to protect african 
elephants in danger of being hunted to extinction 
japan and hong kong were considered particularly critical to any 
effective reduction in ivory demand japan is the largest importer 
and consumer of ivory accounting for 40 percent of the world 
market hong kong is heavily involved in making ivory carvings for 
reexport 
conservationists estimate african elephant populations have 
dropped by half to twothirds in the past decade from 15 million 
in 1978 to between 400000 and 700000 today ivory exports have 
increased from 300 tons a year in the 1950s to more than 800 tons 
annually this decade they say 
the ministry of international trade and industry said the 
japanese ban will take effect monday it will exclude raw african 
ivory specially certified under an international agreement such 
ivory accounts for about 13 percent of the imports 
hong kong announced a moratorium on all raw ivory imports but 
said traders and importers who had entered into contractual 
agreements before friday were exempt 
their pledges came one day after canada said it will ban ivory 
imports 
since june 4 the united states the 12nation european economic 
community and switzerland also have imposed bans on ivory imports 
its been a real snowball effect jorgen thomsen senior 
program officer for elephant conservation at the world wildlife 
fund said friday 
the 102nation convention on international trade in endangered 
species will consider a worldwide ban on ivory imports at a geneva 
meeting in october 
conservationists feared that prospects of a worldwide ban could 
lead poachers to a frenzy of elephant killing unless interim 
measures were imposed by major importing countries now 
ivory is used for the signature stamps popular in many asian 
nations and for jewelry piano keys and carvings 
though some african countries still permit limited exports of the 
certified ivory four major producers kenya tanzania gambia and 
somalia have called for a total ban on trade in ivory they say 
such action is needed to stem the swift decline in the population of 
african elephants 
kenya which banned hunting of african elephants a decade ago 
last year began using police and paramilitary units its war with 
poachers an aerial survey last year found an estimated 20000 
elephants remaining in kenya which 15 years ago had a population of 
121000 
poachers have killed most of the big male elephants in some 
countries and are switching to females and young beasts according 
to a conservationists report this month based on material from 
biologists conservationists economists and trade specialists 
as a result three times as many elephants must be killed to 
provide the same amount of ivory as 10 years ago the report said 
most ivory is added late in life among males 
tamotsu ishibashi chairman of tokyo ivory and craft cooperative 
association said the ban will hurt japans traditional 
ivorycarving industry 
the majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques of 
carving ivory from generation to generation and the new restriction 
certainly will affect them severely ishibashi said in a telephone 
interview 
about 25000 ivory craftsman work in 80 japanese workshops 
producing 138 million worth of ivory products every year

a house subcommittee approved legislation to 
considerably limit the ability of physicians to refer medicare 
patients to laboratories or clinics in which the doctors have a 
financial interest 
the measure is part of a package of nearly 3 billion in medicare 
savings for fiscal 1990 that attempts to curb soaring growth in the 
program it also includes a major overhaul of medicare spending on 
physicians and an unprecedented cap on payments to doctors in the 
program 
the package was approved 110 in a closed session thursday night 
by the house ways and means health subcommittee and details were 
released friday by the subcommittee staff it now goes to the full 
committee 
the physician ownershipreferral measure sponsored by rep pete 
stark dcalif chairman of the subcommittee would allow clinics 
and laboratories with physician ownership to continue operating but 
they would have to register with the government they also would 
continue to be subject to current law which bars direct payments 
for referrals 
for new joint ventures however the bill would prohibit 
physicians from referring medicare patients to a facility in which 
the doctor or an immediate family member has an ownership or 
investment interest 
exceptions could be made for a facility that could show it 
provides a service unavailable elsewhere 
a report by the health and human services department inspector 
general earlier this spring found that patients of physicians who 
have a financial stake in clinical labs received 45 percent more lab 
services than medicare patients in general 
outlays under the federal health care program for the elderly 
would rise from 986 billion in the current fiscal year to 111 
billion in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 without the cutbacks 
medicare would cost 114 billion next year 
medicare spending has been increasing about 15 percent annually 
since 1980 louis sullivan secretary of the department of health 
and human services said this week that medicare spending on 
physicians has increased 16 percent annually over the past 10 years 
savings would be achieved by squeezing hospitals and physicians 
but leaving intact benefits for the 33 million people enrolled in 
the program 
however the subcommittees package recognizes the current 
financial dilemma faced by many rural and urban hospitals 
all hospitals would see an increase in medicare payments next 
year under the panels recommendation however rural and inner 
city hospitals would get larger increases than suburban hospitals 
physicians would also take a hit with reimbursement for some 
medical procedures considered overpriced being cut by up to 15 
percent these procedures include coronary bypass surgery and 
cataract surgery 
the physician payment overhaul was approved by the subcommittee 
on wednesday with bush administration backing 
the cornerstone of the plan is a national spending target that 
would limit medicare payments to physicians this feature is opposed 
by the american medical association which says it would ration 
health care 
the two other parts of the plan would raise reimbursed charges 
for family practioners and internists while lowering them for 
surgeons eye doctors and other specialty practices and limit the 
amount physicians can charge their medicare patients beyond the 
reimbursed charge 
sullivan told a senate finance subcommittee thursday the 
administration supports the three elements of the house 
subcommittees package but he said the administration would oppose 
a change in the physician fee schedule if it is not linked to a 
volume control mechanism such as an expenditure target

the house operating under an ethics 
microscope stripped special interest exemptions from a savings and 
loan bailout bill at the last minute but they may resurface in an 
anticipated blitz by industry lobbyists 
before house members approved the 157 billion taxpayerfinanced 
sampl rescue just before midnight thursday provisions aimed 
specifically at benefiting sears citicorp chemical bank of new 
york merrill lynch paine webber and several other financial houses 
suddenly were removed 
however lawmakers and outside observers expect the provisions to 
come up again when house and senate negotiators meet later this 
month to iron out differences between their two versions of the 
legislation the senate approved its bill in april 
its so unlike the congress to do something like that bert 
ely an independent consultant on the sampl industry said of the 
11thhour removal of the provisions but i know theyre going to 
come back up in conference because the senate bill has a bunch of 
amendments like that 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash and rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking committee said 
friday they hope to have the bill ready for president bushs 
signature by july 4 
house banking committee experts who have examined the senate 
version say they count about 40 special interest provisions in 
it intended to benefit specific insurance companies banks sampls or 
other financial institutions 
the biggest according to rep jim leach riowa is a provision 
that would allow columbia savings and loan association of beverly 
hills calif to exceed federal restrictions on how many highrisk 
highinterest junk bonds sampls can own 
according to leach the senate provision was inserted at the 
behest of columbia which has the largest portfolio of junk bonds of 
any sampl in the country 
columbia also was involved in the junk bond deal that helped 
bring about house democratic whip tony coelhos resignation coelho 
who left congress thursday made about 6880 in four months in 1986 
after an executive of the sampl bought the bonds and held them for 
coelho until the congressman could raise the money partly through a 
loan from the sampl 
leach a leading gop proponent of making sampls as well as banks 
and other financial institutions meet much stricter accountability 
standards was the primary force behind knocking the special 
interest provisions out of the house bill 
in a parliamentary move that caught both many democrats and 
fellow republicans by surprise he asked minutes before lawmakers 
were scheduled to vote on final passage that the house send the 
bill back to its banking committee with instructions to immediately 
return it without the provisions he was opposing 
frankly it was something that i had had in the back of my mind 
for three or four days he said in an interview friday its 
because of the greatest legislative lapse of this century that we 
have this problem if were going to ask the public to pay for it to 
the tune of 500 for every man woman and child people here should 
make it clear there are no special benefits to the large and 
wellheeled 
as the bill was structured when it went to the house floor only 
republicans were allowed to offer amendments weakening bushs demand 
for strong regulatory requirements 
under the debate procedure set by the democraticcontrolled house 
rules committee democrats were allowed to introduce and pass 
several reform amendments 
among them were a measure opposed by drexel burnham the nations 
largest underwriter of junk bonds to forbid all sampl investments in 
the highrisk securities and a measure opposed by the american 
bankers association to establish 1millionaday civil fines for 
bank fraud 
when the vote on leachs motion began republicans automatically 
supported it as a protest and democrats at first voted against it 
but soon democrats started switching their votes when the final 
vote was tabulated leach won 4118 
the sentiment among a lot of democrats was that he was right 
said rep charles schumer dny who had been criticized by 
members of both parties close to sampl interests as being the 
administrations pawn in seeking tougher regulations on the 
industry 
foley called leachs use of the parliamentary tactic one of the 
most successful he had ever seen gonzalez said democrats had no 
choice but to go along with it so they could say look were on 
the high road too were not for these special interests and 
giveaways 
democrats who had sponsored the special exemptions among them

the pentagon unit set up six years ago to test 
weapons was criticized by a senate panel friday for hiring defense 
contractors to do the tests 
we wanted a tough junkyard dog who would stop bad weapons 
however what we seem to have created is just another layer to the 
pentagon bureaucracy sen david pryor dark said in prepared 
remarks at a hearing of a senate governmental affairs subcommittee 
congress has been so disappointed in the testing office that 
some have spoken of eliminating it 
six years after setting up the testing office america is still 
sending poorly tested weapons to the troops and spending billions 
due to misleading or incomplete test reports he said 
rep barbara boxer dcalif added in a statement that it is 
no secret that the testing office has been a terrible 
disappointment to many members of congress 
the staff of the federal services subcommittee chaired by pryor 
compiled a report on the pentagons office of operational test and 
evaluation the top weapons testing office data came from the 
general accounting office the congressional watchdog agency from 
the defense departments inspector general and from other sources 
contractors with ties to weapons being tested regularly review 
test plans analyze test results and and prepare test reports 
pryor said 
trw inc and science applications international corp or saic 
have been hired under an 85 million contract to provide a wide 
variety of technical support across the full spectrum of test and 
evaluation activity the report said 
trw is the 11th largest weapons supplier to the pentagon and the 
fourth largest contractor working on the strategic defense 
initiative the report noted 
the testing office insists that its staff is making all the 
decisions and the firms are merely providing support but the report 
said trw has contact with a wide variety of other dod projects and 
contractors and it is difficult to understand how this firm 
can be used to perform objective independent operational testing 
at the cleveland headquarters of trw the firms media relations 
office said everyone who could comment was traveling 
frank c conahan assistant comptroller general in the general 
accounting office told the panel that testing has not been 
comprehensive realistic or rigorous nor has there been sufficient 
oversight of the testing and evaluation function by top management 
of the defense department 
to improve testing conahan said officials in his agency 
strongly support the need for having some results available 
early in the acquisition process before production commitments are 
made 
john e krings the head of the 50person office who has 
announced he is retiring defended the testing operation saying the 
pentagon has made tremendous strides to ensure that equipment 
sent to the troops is safe and effective 
he cited a number of cases in which organized tests have affected 
weapons but he said some weapons cant be subjected to full up 
operational testing until a considerable monetary commitment has 
been made congress has not always been forthcoming with the 
money he said 
while he praised the goal of an independent testing office 
krings said the price of independence is a constant attack from 
those who would leave you independent from all but them

premier andreas papandreou ended his 
election campaign with a giant rally friday urging 500000 
supporters to give his socialist party another term to complete 
reforms begun eight years ago 
recent opinion polls have indicated however that the 
conservative new democracy party will get about 47 percent of the 
vote in sundays election compared with 36 percent for the 
socialists 
the supreme court said 25 parties are participating including 
anarchists fascists and the coalition of the left and progress a 
new alliance of the moscoworiented greek communist party and the 
greek left party that is the countrys the thirdlargest political 
organization 
if neither major party wins a majority in the 300member 
unicameral parliament the coalition could become a power broker 
some polls give it 14 percent of the vote 
both new democracy and the socialists have said they would reject 
communist support in forming a government 
papandreou told the cheering crowd in constitution square the 
socialists need four more years to finish their tasks and prepare 
for the challenge in 1992 when greece and the other 11 members 
of the european economic community drop internal economic barriers 
and become a single market 
the four years leading to 1992 to a united europe compels 
us to develop technology to a great degree he said 
people in the crowd waved flags of green the party color and 
sang along with music blaring from giant loudspeakers before 
papandreou 70 appeared on a platform in front of the unknown 
soldiers tomb 
approaching the platform he was accompanied by his 35yearold 
mistress former airline hostess dimitra liani papandreou said they 
will marry soon 
his divorce from his americanborn wife margaret became final 
june 9 and on friday their lawyers submitted the documents 
necessary for the greek orthodox church to end their 38year 
marriage 
fireworks exploded above the square and lit up the darkened 
skies giving the rally a carnival atmosphere papandreou shouted 
into the microphone but the noise of the crowd drowned most of his 
speech 
departing from prepared remarks the premier attacked new 
democracy and its leader constantine mitsotakis 
they cannot defeat us with their slander and mudslinging he 
said 
the reference was to allegations that he and ranking members of 
his party were involved in a 200 million embezzlement scandal at 
the bank of crete 
papandreou has denied any wrongdoing but at least eight 
ministers in his adminstration have resigned including deputy 
premier agamemnon koutsogiorgas 
new democracy finished its campaign thursday night in the same 
square no campaigning is permitted saturday

prosecutors trying to avoid a clash over 
national secrets said friday they will narrow the irancontra 
indictment against former national security adviser john poindexter 
while poindexters lawyer said hell try to force president bush and 
former president reagan to testify 
defense attorney richard beckler said the governments plan to 
adjust but not drop a broad conspiracy charge doesnt make any 
sense but the judge said it depends on the specifics of the 
prosecution motion which wont be submitted until next week 
beckler said he wants to subpoena reagan and bush because 
poindexter had substantial contact with both of these individuals 
throughout this offense as outlined in the indictment 
associate independent counsel christian mixter told us district 
court judge harold greene that after the charges are narrowed 
there would be no reason to involve bush and reagan in the trial 
independent counsel lawrence walsh said the prosecution will seek 
dismissal of theft and wire fraud charges which deal with the 
diversion of iran armssale proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels and 
portions of the broad conspiracy charge against poindexter 
later in the day walsh filed a motion to dismiss the three 
charges against arms dealer richard v secord who is scheduled to 
be tried separately in november 
in court papers walsh said he wished to avoid the same legal 
fight over state secrets that loomed in the poindexter case 
particularly because of the reluctance of federal agencies to give 
secord access to classified documents to prepare his defense 
secord is also charged with conspiring to pay an illegal gratuity 
to former white house aide oliver l north by arranging to set up a 
200000 swiss bank account for his children and by financing 
installation of a 13800 security system outside norths suburban 
virginia home 
he also faces charges of lying to the 1987 congressional hearings 
on the irancontra affair 
the move to drop the major irancontra charges against secord 
foreshadows the ultimate dismissal of those counts against his 
former business partner albert hakim who is also awaiting trial 
after the poindexter hearing walsh indicated outside the 
courtroom that the governments motion would seek to preserve 
portions of a wideranging conspiracy charge dealing with 
obstruction of congress thus the government appears prepared to 
scuttle the portion of the 38page conspiracy count dealing with the 
diversion of profits to the contras 
walsh said he is trying to avoid the kind of protracted battle 
over classified material that threatened to derail the prosecution 
of north 
north a former poindexter aide was convicted of three felonies 
in the irancontra affair and faces sentencing next friday 
he tried unsuccessfully to require reagan and bush to testify at 
his trial us district court judge gerhard gesell quashed 
subpoenas for both men gesell said that the trial record contained 
no proof north received authorization from reagan to engage in 
illegal conduct and that north failed to demonstrate that bush who 
was reagans vice president had any relevant information 
however poindexter unlike north met daily with reagan and so 
may have more solid legal grounds for asking the former president to 
testify 
walsh said that if he attempts to prosecute the charges against 
poindexter in their entirety greene might rule that vast amounts of 
nowclassified material might be required at the trial 
objections by us intelligence agencies to introducing such 
material led to scuttling of the entire conspiracy charge as well as 
the theft charge against north 
beckler expressed concern to greene that walsh isnt planning to 
seek dismissal of the entire conspiracy charge against poindexter 
the lawyer suggested that walsh thinks he may be solving 
problems but that his move doesnt make any sense 
greene responded that if walsh decides to drop 5 percent of the 
conspiracy count then we have a big problem concerning the use 
of classified information but if walsh seeks dismissal of 95 
percent of that count there wont be a big problem the judge added 
the remaining four counts against poindexter accuse him of 
obstructing and making false statements to congress in connection 
with norths secret resupply operation for the contras and a 1985 
arms shipment to iran 
greene didnt set a trial date but did say he wanted to avoid 
november and december when secord may go on trial

the soviet union admitted for the first time friday 
that a tank of radioactive waste exploded at a nuclear weapons plant 
nearly 32 years ago showering particles over nearly 400 square 
miles and forcing 10000 people to evacuate 
before the chernobyl power plant explosion on april 26 1986 
western specialists called the disaster in the southern ural 
mountains the worlds worst nuclear accident a secret cia file made 
public in 1977 quoted soviet sources as saying hundreds of people 
were killed 
the western accounts said the explosion created a vast 
radioactive wasteland onethird the land area of rhode island or 
about 400 square miles 
thirty rural villages vanished from soviet maps fishing was 
banned in lakes dams were built to contain radioactive waterways 
and rivers were diverted with canals according to the western 
accounts 
but the official news agency tass said friday no casualities had 
resulted it quoted boris nikipelov first deputy minister for 
medium machinebuilding as telling a news conference a chemical 
explosion occurred in september 1957 near kasli about 870 miles 
east of moscow 
a tank of radioactive waste exploded at a military plant where 
atomic weapons were to be built forming a radioactive trail 105 
kilometers 65 miles long and 8 to 9 kilometers roughly five to 5 
miles wide said nikipelov whose ministry administers 
militaryrelated nuclear programs 
tass said 2 million curies of radioactive elements were released 
and more than 10000 people were urgently evacuated from the 
contaminated zone in comparison tass noted that 50 million 
curies of radiation were released in the chernobyl explosion and 
fire in which 31 people were killed 
the 1979 accident at three mile island power plant in 
pennsylvania released 14 curies a measure of the amount of 
radioactivty contained in a material 
us analysts have calculated that the urals accident spewed out 
more radiation than that produced by the us atomic bombing of 
japan 
the effects of the accident lasted for decades tass indicated 
it said economic activity resumed in the area only by 1978 and even 
then only in 80 percent of the contaminated zone the remaining 
territory was turned into a reserve radiation returned to safe 
levels in the area only by 1974 and lakes and other waterways 
remain contaminated tass reported 
tass did not say when or where nikipelov gave the news 
conference nor did it say which radioactive particles were released 
or whether the atomic weapons plant is still operating 
some western reports have said the accident happened at the 
soviet unions first nuclear production facility in kyshtym about 
20 miles south of kasli the complex or a replacement is believed to 
be still producing plutonium 
tass said the accident was kept secret so long in the soviet 
union because it occurred at a military plant 
president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
has brought to light other disasters long hushed up in april a 
soviet magazine reported for the first time that an icbm exploded in 
1960 killing the chief of soviet rocket forces and incinerating 
many other people 
tass said disclosure about the 1957 accident poured oil onto 
the fire of a debate about building an atomic power plant in the 
southern urals nikipelov defended the plants construction 
claiming it would help purify water contaminated by radiation by 
evaporating it 
since chernobyl soviet public opinion has turned against 
harnessing the atom for electricity several nuclear power projects 
were canceled because of protests 
the urals accident was first disclosed in 1972 when zhores 
medvedev a soviet biochmist now living in britain wrote that 
hundreds of people probably died of radioactive poisoning after 
nuclear wastes near the first soviet atomic power plants exploded 
lev tumerman a physicist who emigrated to israel said in a 1976 
interview that he visited the area in the early 1960s and found it 
was empty land almost like a lunar view 
cia documents say another nuclear accident an explosion 
occurred at kyshtym in 1960 or 1961

democratic party chief ronald brown 
called on republican counterpart lee atwater on friday to join him 
in writing an ethics code to steer politicians away from dirty 
campaigning 
atwater said brown should join him in supporting a proposal 
president bush will soon send to congress 
american politics is in trouble said brown who was 
attending the association of democratic chairs summer meeting 
voters are sick and tired of attacks dirty tricks phony phone 
banks and rumor mongers 
brown said he sent an invitation to atwater asking for a meeting 
as soon as possible 
i believe the two major parties can make a difference by 
setting new standards of conduct in the profession of politics he 
said 
atwater in a statement issued in washington did not refer 
directly to browns call for a campaign code but said he would 
consider meeting with him if the democratic chairman endorsed a 
campaign reform proposal bush is preparing to send to congress 
the best thing ron brown and i can do is to work with our 
respective congressional delegations for quick passage of this 
legislation atwater said democrats however are working on a 
campaign reform package of their own 
atwater also said he would like any such meeting with brown to 
include discussion of rules for congressional redistricting to take 
place following the 1990 census both parties are spending heavily 
trying to gain control of legislatures that will redraw 
congressional districts in states that lose or gain seats in 
congress because of population shifts 
the indirect exchange between the party chairman came a week 
after brown called for atwaters resignation because of a republican 
national committee memo attacking new house speaker thomas s foley 
the memo compared foleys record with that of rep barney frank 
dmass who is homosexual 
mark goodin who sent the memo resigned as rnc communications 
director and said atwater did not see the document in advance of its 
distribution 
on friday brown stood by his suggestion that atwater resign but 
said he also believed it important for the party chairmen to discuss 
campaign conduct 
brown also said president bush has to step up and lead his 
troops his troops are out of control the republican party 
leadership has become the princes of dirty politics dirty practices 
and negative campaigning 
he declined to say exactly which issues should be addressed in 
his proposed campaign code but said a nonpartisan group probably 
would be needed to enforce any such guidelines

a federal judge enjoined the energy department 
on friday from randomly checking 24 drivers and computer specialists 
for drug use ruling the tests would be an unwarranted invasion of 
privacy 
us district judge john h pratt issued a preliminary injunction 
barring the energy department from beginning the random drug testing 
program on monday 
but pratt upheld the agencys plan to proceed monday with the 
testing of employees suspected of using illegal drugs 
such testing shall be based on reasonable articulable and 
individualized suspicion that a specific employee may be under the 
influence of drugs while on duty pratt said 
pratt issued the injunction in a lawsuit brought by the national 
treasury employees union which represents 2200 energy department 
employees at the agencys washington headquarters 
pratt rejected the governments contention that because the 
drivers and computer specialists handled classified documents they 
held sensitive positions that would subject them to random drug 
testing 
the judge noted that these employees have never been subjected 
to ongoing security checks or strict job controls once their 
security clearance has been determined 
they are not required to routinely disclose information 
concerning their medical or financial circumstances and are not 
required to undergo routine physical examinations for work pratt 
said 
pratt also noted a complete absence of any history of 
drugrelated accidents safety violations or a single incident of 
blackmail or bribery involving employees in these positions 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown said government 
attorneys are reviewing the opinion and studying our options 
the lawsuit is one of a series brought by various employee 
organizations following thenpresident reagans drugfree 
workplace initiative 
federal court orders enjoining random drug testing of justice 
department attorneys and civilian army employees are being reviewed 
by a federal appeals court here

the environmental protection agency proposed 
113 million in civil penalties against dow chemical co friday 
because the company allegedly failed to promptly inform the agency 
it was manufacturing a new chemical substance 
such notification is required under federal toxic substances 
control laws the law provides a civil penalty of up to 25000 for 
each day the notification provision is violated 
the epa said dow based in midland mich accumulated 227 
separate violations because of the reporting lapses involving the 
new chemical product a clear plastic called polycarbonate 
the company has 20 days to request a formal hearing on the 
proposed penalties 
bill donberg dows business director for polycarbonates said 
the product has been manufactured by dow in freeport texas since 
1985 he said dow determined no epa notification was required 
because some of the chemicals used in the product already were on 
the epas list of toxic substances 
donberg said the company gave the epa notification in 1987 
what were going to have to do is explore with the epa to see 
whether or not we did actually commit this violation and if we did 
what the appropriate penalty would be donberg said

president bush has decided against major shifts 
in the us negotiating position when talks resume next week with 
the soviet union to reduce longrange nuclear weapons arsenals by up 
to 50 percent 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday there would be 
only relatively minor changes from the stand the reagan 
administration took at the bargaining table in geneva before 
negotiations were suspended seven months ago 
the previous administration left an excellent foundation on 
which to build fitzwater said 
bush convened a meeting of the national security council on 
thursday before formulating instructions to richard burt and henry 
cooper who head the us delegation for the strategic arms 
reduction and spacedefense talks 
among the items the president took up with his key advisers was 
whether to shift the us position on mobile missiles 
the chairmen of the senate and house armed services committees 
sen sam nunn dga and rep les aspin dwis wanted to push for 
a ban on mobiles with multiple warheads 
the us position in the talks last year was that all mobile 
missiles should be outlawed until ways are found to keep track of 
them and make sure any negotiated reductions are carried out 
fitzwater said that remained the us position in the 
negotiations with the soviets but he stressed that on mobile 
missiles and other weapons questions we do reserve the right to 
review these matters and make changes on an ongoing basis 
overall the spokesman said there will be a considerable 
degree of continuity in the approach of this administration 
while the talks formally reopen on monday negotiations do not 
begin until wednesday that leaves time for bush to make changes in 
the instructions he gave to burt and cooper 
but a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said he 
did not expect the president to revise the us position in the days 
ahead 
the talks are aimed at reducing us and soviet longrange 
bombers landbased missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 
50 percent 
earlier a senior administration official also said the bush team 
is taking an optimistic view about the kremlins approach to the 
negotiations 
the official said the soviets have indicated in their rhetoric 
they are eager to get back to talks and that they have a 
positive attitude well see 
when the negotiations were suspended last november about 90 
percent of the work was completed the talks have been on hold ever 
since as bush took office and ordered a review of us policy on 
national security issues 
the unfinished 10 percent of the agreement contains some of the 
thorniest issues such as weapons ceilings limits on air and 
sealaunched cruise missiles verification and how to deal with 
mobile missiles 
a senior pentagon official told reporters that us negotiators 
would seek to turn the talks immediately to verification issues 
intead of treating verification as the caboose on the train 
and treating it at the end or after the end during ratification 
debates i think that we will probably see an effort to bring that 
to a higher priority and get serious movement going on things that 
could substantially advance our ability to verify this agreement 
when it is done said the official speaking on condition that he 
not be further identified 
the intermediate nuclear force treaty ratified by the senate 
last year drew complaints from some senators that it would be hard 
to verify although it allows unprecedented onsite inspection of 
soviet and us military sites 
of particular concern under the proposed start treaty said the 
official was the ability of the united states to verify the number 
of soviet mobile missiles the soviets have fielded two such 
systems the ss24 and the ss25 whereas the united states has not 
yet developed one 
bush has asked congress to provide money for two mobile missiles 
a railbased mx with 10 warheads and the socalled midgetman with 
one or two warheads 
whether under start its going to be more desirable to permit 
mobiles or to continue to seek the ban on them is something that we 
may not be able to determine until the verification issue is 
settled said the official 
when the arms talks resume parallel talks will begin again on 
spacebased defenses against ballistic missile attacks 
both the senior officials who spoke to reporters said bush has 
indicated he is not going to make a 90degree change in direction

governing parties in the 12 eec nations 
will lose ground in the european parliament if results in seven 
member states that vote sunday match those of the five that voted 
thursday 
unofficial projections of thursdays ballotting in britain 
spain the netherlands denmark and ireland showed gains for 
opposition candidates with conservative parties often the main 
losers 
the european economic community common market nations to vote 
sunday on the 518seat european parliament are belgium luxembourg 
greece portugal west germany italy and france 
official results from thursdays balloting will not be released 
until voting has been completed sunday exit polls and other surveys 
indicated this voter swing thursday 
britain the opposition labor party trounced prime minister 
margaret thatchers conservative party which has been in power for a 
decade 
a british broadcasting corp poll gave labor 51 of the 78 seats 
allotted to britain and the conservatives 26 labor had held 32 and 
the conservatives 45 
spain prime minister felipe gonzalezs socialist party will 
lose 2 of its 28 seats in the parliament spain has 60 seats the 
conservative popular party also lost 2 seats dropping to 15 as did 
the centrist democratic social center losing 2 and holding 5 
a communistled coalition won 4 seats 1 more than it had 
several other parties made slight gains 
denmark prime minister poul schlueters conservatives may lose 
2 of its 4 seats with the socialists going from 3 to 5 seats 
denmark is allotted 16 seats in the parliament in strasbourg 
france the peoples movement against the eec which wants a 
referendum on denmarks membership lost at least 1 of its 4 seats 
according to the polls other seats were scattered among various 
parties and coalitions 
the netherlands prime minister ruud lubbers and his christian 
democrats gained 1 seat for a total of 9 but their conservative 
coalition partners lost 2 of their 5 seats and the socialists held 
all 9 seats 
ireland it has 15 seats in the parliament but the ballots are 
not be counted until sunday and the news media did not carry 
predictions 
polls indicated that when all of the elections are complete the 
socialists with 166 seats will strengthen their dominant position 
the centrist christian democrats hold 112 seats and also were 
expected to gain 
green and environmental parties with 20 seats also should do 
well especially in west germany and france 
conservative parties were expected to suffer the losses 
thursdays turnout generally was low though turnouts for the 
european parliament usually are 
it was 35 percent in britain compared to 325 percent in 1984 
the netherlands 48 percent down from 51 percent five years ago 
denmark dropped to 46 percent from 524 percent in 1984 and spain 
recorded 65 percent compared to 69 percent in 1987 when elections 
were held there and in portugal the two nations joined the eec in 
1986 
polls have consistently shown that the parliaments role in eec 
affairs is largely unknown to most of the people in the 12 nations 
as a result the election campaigns are dominated by national 
rather than paneuropean issues 
the parliament meets one week per month in strasbourg

a communist party spokesman on friday said 
the party will need to institute reform to overcome its stinging 
defeats in democratic parliamentary elections earlier this month 
his pledge followed a party pep talk given by prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski himself a loser in the june 4 elections 
rakowski analyzed the losses in preparation for the second round of 
voting sunday 
jan bisztyga spokesman for the communist partys policymaking 
central committee told a news conference we are aware that 
increased social support for the party in the future especially 
support by youth must be linked with further democratization of the 
system and economic reforms 
in other developments friday 
a small band of young protesters shouting antisoviet slogans 
from the steps of a warsaw church hurled gasolinefilled bottles 
toward police who detained several before the demonstration 
dispersed without further incident and apparently without injuries 
president francois mitterrand of france called polands 
communist leaders courageous patriots for their recent steps toward 
democracy and reiterated a promise of economic aid as he ended a 
threeday state visit 
rakowski acknowledged in a televised speech to wroclaw party 
members thursday night that the party underestimated the vigor of 
the solidarityled oppositions campaign and was too slow to shed 
stalinism in favor of reform 
the speech followed intensive consultations within the party 
leadership and the rankandfile members after the setback suffered 
in the june 4 elections the most democratic in eastern europe since 
world war ii 
counting on favorable results in the first round of the 
elections proved to be a mistake he said could this have been 
avoided in part yes if we would have noticed the threatening 
dangers but we did not notice them 
sundays runoff is for candidates who failed to receive 
majorities on june 4 most of the races will be for seats reserved 
for the communist party or its allies in the sejm or parliament 
candidates of the independent solidarity movement won all but one 
of the 161 seats open to the opposition in the 460member 
parliament they won 92 of the 100 seats in the new freely elected 
senate with the remaining eight to be decided sunday 
only three party coalition sejm candidates reformers supported 
by solidarity activists in their regions won firstround 
victories and 33 of the 35 top government officials on a national 
list of unopposed sejm candidates did not receive the required 50 
percent of votes cast 
the defeated rakowski says he will not run again for parliament 
sunday under a plan worked out with the opposition to fill the 33 
seats and maintain an agreedupon 65 percent sejm majority for the 
communist coalition 
however he left open the possibility of continuing as prime 
minister which is possible under polish law 
the new government and possible changes in party leadership are 
expected to be the main topic at a party plenum this month the 
party is expected to confirm gen wojceich jaruzelski as its 
candidate for president a new post to be filled by the vote of the 
senate and the sejm 
the president is to name the new prime minister 
the plenum will deeply analyze the electoral defeat rakowski 
said 
rakowski said public dissatisfaction with the government and 
living conditions has made many poles judge us onesidedly and to 
pin exaggerated hopes on the opposition 
he said the aggressiveness of the oppositions campaign took 
many party leaders by surprise according to a translation provided 
by the staterun pap news agency

gen michel aoun said friday his christian 
troops will attack syrian supply routes in retaliation for the 
shelling of a tanker carrying gasoline destined for lebanons 
besieged christian enclave 
syrian artillery fire set the tanker ablaze thursday evening as 
it approached the christian port of tabarja 15 miles north of 
beirut 
roads leading to capitals of occupation forces will not be 
safe henceforth aoun said in a statement broadcast by government 
radio we shall confront this foreign enemy with the courage of a 
warrior at the front 
syrias 40000 soldiers in lebanon receive supplies over a 
network of roads from damascus the syrian capital about 50 miles 
east of beirut 
attacks on the roads would be a dramatic escalation of the 
3monthold confrontation between aouns forces and a moslem 
alliance of the syrians and druse militiamen which has largely 
consisted of artillery duels 
at least 372 people have been killed and 1450 wounded since the 
fighting began march 8 two days after aouns christian army units 
blockaded illegal ports operated by moslem militias 
the general describes the syrians as an occupation force and has 
declared a war of liberation president hafez assad of syria has 
had soldiers in lebanon since 1976 the year after the lebanese 
civil war began under a peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
christian gunners have shelled the supply routes several times in 
recent weeks mainly in the syriancontrolled bekaa valley of east 
lebanon aoun did not say what other methods of attack he might use 
but commando raids land mines and car bombs are among the 
possibilities 
syrian forces have blockaded the 310squaremile enclave where 1 
million christians live since the early days of the confrontation 
and shell the christianheld coast north of beirut to stop supplies 
arriving by sea 
aouns gunboats tried in vain to salvage some of the 660000 
gallons of gasoline from the tanker the vessel still was burning on 
friday 
gunboats rescued 13 of the 14 crew members after they abandoned 
ship and the other man is missing and presumed dead police reported 
syrian shellfire destroyed fuel depots in the christian enclave 
march 30 creating a fuel shortage that has grown more acute 
dozens of small cargo ships carrying supplies and weapons 
provided by iraq syrias main arab rival have reached christian 
ports successfully but others either have been hit by syrian fire or 
turned back because of it 
the tanker was shelled several hours after three lebanese cargo 
vessels used to run food supplies to the christians were blown up in 
the port of sidon 25 miles south of beirut 
sidon is predominantly sunni moslem the sunnis have stayed out 
of the fighting and merchants in sidon have been shipping food to 
the christian ports by night 
a ceasefire proclaimed by the arab league in april has been 
violated regularly 
lebanons government and army have been split on sectarian lines 
since a political crisis arose last september 
at the united nations in new york on friday lebanon protested 
israeli air raids even as israel conducted another raid against a 
palestinian guerrilla base 
lebanons permanent un representative rachid fakhoury 
protested a raid on wednesday against bshamun southeast of beirut 
in which he said several people were killed or wounded 
israeli warplanes friday attacked targets at rashidiyeh lebanon 
police said two children were wounded in a house near the beachside

the justice department exercising its 
authority under the voting rights act of 1965 objected friday to 
state legislation creating two judicial circuits and 48 superior 
court judgeships in georgia 
the objection renders the judgeships null and void said 
kathleen wilde an american civil liberties union attorney an aclu 
lawsuit challenging georgias method of election of all superior 
court judges as racially discriminatory is pending in federal court 
the voting rights act requires that georgia and other southern 
states submit all voting or election changes to the justice 
department which must determine that the changes have neither a 
racially discriminatory purpose or effect before they can take 
effect 
the 48 judgeships covered by the departments objection friday 
out of 137 total superior court judgeships in the state were 
created since passage of the voting rights act in 1965 ms wilde 
said 
deborah burstionwade a spokeswoman for the civil rigts division 
of the justice department had no immediate comment on the 
departments action 
but georgia attorney general mike bowers said he had been 
notified of the departments objection and was studying it 
im not sure what this means he said 
ms wilde said the justice departments objection was based on 
bowers refusal to provide the department with requested information 
on the racial makeup of the new judicial districts 
the lawsuit pending in brunswick challenges the atlarge method 
georgia uses to elect superior court judges in an atlarge 
election two or more judges are chosen by the voters of an entire 
jurisdiction created by the state

the state department issued a travel alert 
friday to call attention to steppedup antiterrorist precautions at 
frankurt airport in west germany and the conclusion of authorities 
there that terrorist attacks cannot be ruled out 
the department did not advise travelers to avoid the airport 
believed by many investigators to have been the place where a bomb 
was placed on the pan american jetliner that exploded over scotland 
in december with 270 deaths 
the alert quoted from a statement issued by german officials from 
the state of hesse which said 
security measures at frankfurt airport remain at a high level 
this is primarily due to the aggravated situation in the arab 
region terrorist actions especially in the area of the frankfurt 
airport cannot be ruled out the security measures tie in with an 
investigative proceeding against a terrorist organization which has 
become active in the frankfurt area 
in a similar announcement tuesday police in frankfurt said they 
were searching for palestinian terrorists who might be planning 
attacks in west germany 
kurt kraus a frankfurt police spokesman said the search and 
security alert was linked to recent activities of terror groups in 
the middle east and there appeared to be a connection with the 
conviction of twa hijacker mohammed ali hamadi 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem was sentenced to life in prison 
after being convicted by a frankfurt court in may on charges of air 
piracy and murder in the 1985 twa hijacking 
a us navy diver was killed and 39 americans were held for 17 
days during the ordeal 
federal prosecutors have said they believe the suspected 
terrorists to be members of a group called the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command 
the syriansupported group has been mentioned as a prime suspect 
in the bombing of pan am flight 103 
police raids last october uncovered weapons and explosives and 14 
palestinians were arrested warrants have since been issued for four 
of the suspects 
kraus said police suspect other members of the group are still at 
large in west germany

about 7500 people were evacuated from their 
homes and businesses for about three hours friday while authorities 
burned nine cases of old dynamite found by a warehouse cleanup crew 
the evacuees included 4000 employees at goodyear tire amp rubber 
co in addition 150 residents of the middlebury manor nursing home 
were taken to two high schools and hospitals said police capt 
david whitmire 
workers at guran concrete amp supply co found 450 sticks of 
dynamite after prying off the lid of a container in a warehouse 
said fire capt john robles authorities were alerted about 11 am 
the evacuation was ordered about an hour later when the bomb crew 
decided the best way to handle the dynamite was to slowly burn it in 
a dirt bunker robles said 
elmer guran one of the companys owners said the dynamite had 
been in the warehouse for about 20 years but was not sure where it 
came from 
from what we can tell it was part of an acquisition of a 
construction company that went bankrupt in 1969 said 
the dynamite was burned shortly after 3 pm flames shot 1520 
feet high but there was no explosion 
dan testa deputy fire chief said the evacuation was necessary 
because there was a small chance of an explosion 
you hate to do some of the things necessary but you are 
dealing with peoples lives he said 
the evacuation order took in a mostly industrial but partly 
residential area within 2000 feet of the dynamite it also shut 
down an ohio edison co substation cutting power to 4170 
residential and business customers said spokesman bud carter 
in addition natural gas service in the neighborhood was shut 
off officials said 
everything went amazingly well said sue gregg administrator 
of the nursing home although some of the patients didnt want to 
go when they got to the high school they had lunch and a 
singalong she said 
the evacuation was the second in akron this year about 2000 
residents were evacuated following a chemical train derailment feb 
26 
it also was the second time in ohio since 1986 that residents had 
to be evacuated because of dynamite 
in october 1986 about 1700 residents of columbus east side 
were forced to flee their homes temporarily after employees of a 
storage company found a dozen 50pound cases of unstable dynamite in 
a locker burning that dynamite without moving it caused about 
40000 in damage 
the owner of the columbus dynamite john g rieder of kansas 
city mo was sentenced to six months in prison fined 1000 and 
ordered to make restitution

the staff of the environmental protection 
agency recommended friday that permits be issued to nine new york 
cityarea municipalities which dump treated sewage sludge in the 
atlantic ocean 
an epa hearing officer said authorities should be allowed to 
increase dumping sewage to five times their normal rates under bad 
weather up to 15500 gallons per minute 
the report also recommends creating two barge tracks inside the 
dumping area rather than the current single track enabling more 
barges to use the dump site simultaneously the permits would also 
reduce the time and distance that must remain between barges 
i believe that these modifications while continuing to 
provide for maximum protection of the marine environment result in 
a permit which is fully implementable epa hearing officer richard 
l caspe said in his report i do not foresee any environmental 
condition which would result in its impracticability or its lack of 
environmental protection 
the permits which would be valid until march 17 1991 must be 
approved by the epa regional administrator said herman phillips an 
agency spokesman in new york 
currently new york city westchester and nassau counties and 
six sewerage authorities in new jersey dump more than 8 million wet 
tons of sewage sludge annually at a site 106 miles off the new 
jersey coast 
they are the only municipalities in the united states that dump 
sewage sludge in the ocean the municipalities have been dumping 
under a court order issued in 1981 but the ocean dumping ban act of 
1988 makes such dumping illegal after aug 14 1989 unless the 
municipality has entered into an agreement with the epa to phase out 
the practice

the justice department objected friday to 
georgia laws that created two judicial circuits and 48 elected 
superior court judgeships over the past 24 years 
the action was disclosed in a letter to state officials from 
james p turner an acting assistant attorney general in the civil 
rights division under the 1965 civil rights act the objection 
renders the laws legally unenforceable until the departments 
objection is withdrawn or overturned in court 
but deborah burstionwade a spokeswoman for the civil rights 
division said the departments objection does not prevent the 48 
sitting judges from continuing to fulfill their duties nor does it 
provide a basis for challenging their past decisions 
the voting rights act requires that georgia and other southern 
states submit all voting or election changes to the justice 
department which must determine that the changes have neither a 
racially discriminatory purpose nor effect before they can take 
effect 
the 48 judgeships covered by the departments objection friday 
out of 137 total superior court judgeships in the state all were 
created since passage of the voting rights act 
but the state of georgia did not submit any of the 48 judgeships 
to the justice department for approval until after a 1986 supreme 
court ruling made it clear that the creation of elected judgeships 
was an election change covered by the voting rights act 
turner said in the letter that the departments objection was 
based on the refusal of state officials to respond to requests for 
additional information needed to determine if the new judgeships and 
judicial circuits were free from racial discrimination 
turner said however that the department is ready and willing 
to reconsider its objection if the state provides the requested 
information on the racial makeup of the new judicial districts and 
the general assemblys rationale for creating them 
georgia attorney general mike bowers said he was studying 
turners letter im not sure what this means he said 
kathleen wilde an american civil liberties union attorney whose 
lawsuit challenging georgias method of election of all superior 
court judges as racially discriminatory is pending in us district 
court in brunswick said the justice department action will 
strengthen my hand

labor party and the workers party and the collapse of the 
centerright progressive democratic party the electoral partner of 
fine gael 
computer projections for the rte network indicated that in 
thursdays election haugheys fianna fail party won no more than 77 
seats a loss of three from its position when the dail parliament 
was dissolved in may 
ballot boxes were opened friday morning and by early saturday 
122 seats had been decided fianna fail 55 fine gael 38 labor 
party 12 progressive democrats 4 workers party 7 democratic 
socialist 1 green party 1 independent and others 4 
roger garland the green party winner was the first of his party 
to win a seat in the dail 
if haughey forms a coalition it would be the first time since 
1969 that an irish government won a second term 
one of the disappointing things is that irish politics may now 
become polarized between right and left said des omalley the 
progressive democrat leader who won reelection i think that 
would be a great pity 
fianna fails general secretary frank wall conceded that the 
best his party could do would be 82 seats one short of a majority 
mr haughey is now a fivetime loser fine gael party leader 
alan dukes declared 
fianna fail won 81 seats in 1987 and held 80 when the dail was 
dissolved fine gael got 51 seats in 1987 labor 12 the progressive 
democrats 14 workers party 4 and others 4 
foreign minister brian lenihan of fianna fail was the first 
confirmed winner he missed the campaign to undergo a liver 
transplant at the mayo clinic in rochester minn but easily held 
his district in dublin west 
haughey swept to a predictable victory in his own dublin 
constituency 
in irelands complicated election system a quota is set in each 
constituency for the number of votes needed for election 
voters mark their ballots in order of preference up to five 
choices if no candidate reaches the quota the vote transfers 
to the voters second choice and so on 
about 77 percent of the 24 million eligible voters turned out 
thursday in hot sunshine 
haughey 63 has failed in four elections since 1979 to win a 
majority relying on the support of splinter groups and 
independents he called the latest election three years ahead of 
schedule when his poll ratings were high and he sensed a chance for 
a majority but his ratings have dropped since 
despite his lack of a majority in the last parliament haughey 
was able to implement a sweeping austerity program to ease the 
countrys debt and bring down interest rates

miners in kentucky pennsylvania indiana virginia and tennessee 
joined the walkout which began monday in west virginia in sympathy 
with 1600 miners on strike in virginia and west virginia against 
the pittston coal group 
umw officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are 
responsible for the wildcat strike which the companies say violates 
the 1988 national contract the union signed with the bituminous coal 
operators association 
in pennsylvania 2300 miners were on strike less than 14 
percent of the states total umw district 2 president nick molnar 
said union officials planned to tell each of the districts 52 local 
unions by telegram that their members should report to work as 
usual molnar said he could not predict whether the miners would 
obey 
but in birmingham ala district 20 international executive 
board member tommy buchanan said the final decision on whether 
alabama miners will join the strike will be with trumka 
it might be two days it might be a week it will start 
whenever it comes down from the union president buchanan said 
buchanan said earlier there is a 100 percent chance of a 
sympathy strike by the districts 5000 members 
trumka did not return telephone calls friday umw spokesman joe 
corcoran in washington was not in his office and has not returned 
phone calls this week 
about 5000 miners on friday attended a rally in ebensburg pa

organized miners who could leave on short notice from trumka to 
picket in support of the pittston strikers said bill ray district 
25 president and an acting member of the unions international

meeting friday but local president jim griffith said he was unsure 
whether workers would obey the order company officials also refused 
to comment 
lester weist chairman of the locals mine committee said the 
members were ordered back to work because the work stoppage violates 
the contract 
no local issues are involved he said the stoppage was not 
initiated on the local level and at this point were unsure of what 
level it was initiated 
he said union members on the midnight shift apparently received 
phone calls that they were on strike until further notice 
in terre haute umw district 11 spokesman mark arnold said the 
cbs television program 48 hours whose program thursday night 
focused on the pittston strike apparently sparked the spurgeon 
miners to walk off the job

the government lost a dry run of a 300 million 
lawsuit brought by neighbors of a federal uranium processing plant 
and now will have to decide whether to settle the case an energy 
department spokesman said friday 
us district judge s arthur spiegel used a nonbinding 
hurryup procedure called a summary trial to encourage a settlement 
the eightmember jury decided thursday to recommend a 136 million 
award to residents who claim they were hurt by contamination from 
the feed materials production center in fernald 18 miles northwest 
of cincinnati 
the jury ruled that national lead of ohio inc operated the plant 
in a way that caused neighbors to suffer emotional distress and 
lowered property values national lead which operated the plant 
from 1951 through 1985 was sued with parent company national lead 
industries inc 
the energy department argued that the companies could not be 
liable because they carried out the governments directions 
energy department lawyer henry gill jr said the government would 
pay any settlement of the case because of an indemnification clause 
in its contract with the operator if there is no settlement the 
case goes to actual trial aug 15 before spiegel 
in washington energy department spokesman will callicott said 
officials would have to confer with gill next week before responding 
to a statement by stanley chesley lawyer for the 14000 plaintiffs 
that he would consider a settlement offer 
were going to have to assess what the most appropriate course 
of action for us is callicott said 
the department admitted in documents filed with the court that 
the government sometimes told the operators to emphasize production 
and not worry about environmental protection or regulations 
the plant is one of several government nuclear weapons facilities 
around the country whose safety has been challenged prompting 
expensive cleanups and interruptions in production 
in colorado the energy department agreed with authorities friday 
to tighten federal monitoring of the rocky flats plant where 
investigators are looking for evidence of illegal waste dumping 
residents around fernald said in their lawsuit that radioactive 
contamination from the plant has polluted soil air and water in 
their environment causing them mental stress and making their homes 
undesirable 
tom carpenter a staff lawyer with the washingtonbased 
government accountability project a nonprofit watchdog group said 
he thought the jurys verdict did not go far enough carpenter said 
he investigated the plant for several years on behalf of disgruntled 
workers and found negligence and inattention to worker health and 
safety 
they went too far at fernald definitely and the lapse was 
inexcusable carpenter said 
the energy department estimates that 383000 pounds of 
radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty 
exhaustair filters since the plant opened government lawyers said 
the material has not endangered residents or harmed property 
westinghouse materials co of ohio has operated the plant since 
january 1986

the centrist democratic christian party 
denounced as repressive and unconstitutional on friday a proposed 
law by the new rightist administration to crack down on those who 
disagree with it 
the governing republican nationalist alliance known as arena 
has called the legislation a law in defense of the democratic 
process it proposes fines and prison sentences for those who 
oppose the government or its policies including journalists and 
those who take part in protest marches 
christian democratic leaders gave reporters a copy of the 
proposed law which executive committee member ricardo perdomo 
called the preamble to total repression in el salvador 
fidel chavez mena party secretarygeneral and onetime 
presidential nominee told a news conference the measure was 
unconstitutional and would violate the most elemental guarantees 
and individual rights 
arena was scheduled to submit the bill for congressional approval 
on thursday but did not arena members did not explain at that time 
why the legislation was not submitted and refused to discuss details 
with reporters 
el salvadors new president is arena member alfredo cristiani 
who assumed power june 1 from christian democrat jose napoleon 
duarte after winning big in march elections 
gloria salguero gross a highranking arena member and assembly 
deputy told reporters thursday the assassination of cabinet member 
jose antonio rodriguez porth on june 9 is a call to reflect and we 
must give an answer within the constitution within the arms of 
democracy 
arena holds a congressional majority 
arena officials and the military blamed the killing on the 
farabundo marti liberation front guerrilla group or fmln the 
marxistled fmln on thursday issued a communique denying 
responsibility the guerrillas said the 73yearold minister of the 
presidency probably was shot on june 9 as a result of factional 
fighting within the government 
the fmln has fought the usbacked government for nine years 
perdomo said friday we are worried that a repressive law such 
as this could in one given moment bite down on the social and 
political forces of this country taking away the space we have to 
oppose and fight for the interests of the great majority 
the bill would establish fines for the fmln and what the 
government considers to be rebelrelated groups that engage in armed 
actions sabotage strikes or public demonstrations that clog 
traffic on principal roadways avenues or streets of the a city 
impeding the passage of people or vehicles 
the christian democrats pointed to one article they said denies 
freedom of the press 
it would makes it illegal for reporters to send outside the 
country news or information destined to upset the constitutional 
or legal order the tranquility or security of the country the 
economic or monetary regimen 
the government will move against publishers and broadcasters 
who use in their journalistic pages or on radio and television 
transmissions such news or information the legislation says 
the document says the legislation would augment a law already on 
the books banning the existence of armed groups of a political 
labor union or religious character

scientists in boston are learning to treat jet 
lag insomnia and other symptoms of a jangled body clock with 
carefully controlled doses of ordinary light 
dr charles czeisler and colleagues at the brigham and womens 
hospital in boston reported today that they succeeded in 
consistently resetting the body clocks of test subjects using timed 
exposures to a light about as bright as the rising sun their 
account of the experiments was published in science magazine 
czeisler said the wakerest cycles of the subjects could be moved 
forward or back with ease but the changes lack the precision needed 
for a useful therapy for jet setters or for those with troubled 
sleep 
but eventually he said the study will develop the techniques 
needed to use light to change the body clock and relieve the wilting 
weariness many feel when their life style is out of phase with the 
sun 
czeisler said the research proved conclusively that light can 
send a signal to the brain to reset the biological clock

human rights groups claim 
israeli military courts that try palestinians for such things as 
throwing stones at soldiers are biased because both judges and 
witnesses are army comrades 
the groups also maintain that israeli soldiers brought before the 
same courts on charges of abusing palestinians get proportionately 
lighter sentences than the arabs 
the military rejects the claims 
palestinians throw stones often to kill soldiers act in 
response to the violence said brig gen amnon straschnow head 
of the military court system 
he maintained the trials are fair he said several hundred 
palestinians have been acquitted in stonethrowing cases even when 
soldiers identified the accused 
we are conducting justice under fire straschnow said in an 
interview this may not be a classic war but it is a kind of war 
but we try to balance this security problem which is unprecedented 
on the one hand with the need to honor individudal rights 
one recent day in the military court in ramallah a 15yearold 
palestinian munzer zaatari was convicted of throwing stones at 
soldiers in the west bank village of el ram on may 9 although he 
insisted he was in jerusalem at the time 
the military judge maj shlomo isaacson decided on the guilty 
verdict even though a key witness a soldier contradicted his own 
previously written statement about the location of the arrest 
isaacson sentenced zaatari to 10 months in jail although no one 
was hurt in the stoning incident 
these actions have turned into a plague on our country which 
must be uprooted the judge said 
i didnt do anything the jeanclad zaatari shouted as a 
soldier led him out of the courtroom 
in an adjacent courtroom the same day maj jonathan livni 
acquitted ibrahim jaber 18 of charges of throwing stones at 
soldiers nov 16 he had been caught with a slingshot and a knife 
but livni based his decision on the testimony of a soldier who said 
he had recognized the stonethrowers from a distance of 150 yards 
the trials were among dozens that are held daily to process most 
of the 35000 arabs who by official count have been arrested since 
the uprising began 18 months ago 
before the start of the rebellion which has claimed the lives of 
more than 500 palestinians and 22 israelis the military courts 
dealt mainly with cases involving armed attacks or terrorism 
today they are inundated with cases involving stonings tire 
burnings flag raisings demonstrations 
more than 13000 palestinians have been tried since december 
1987 when the uprising began compared to about 1000 the previous 
year according to army statistics 
the average sentence has been a year in jail and a fine the 
equivalent of 500 many of those arrested are released before being 
brought to trial and about 6 percent have been acquitted nearly 
5000 others are awaiting trial 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said 8500 palestinians are behind 
bars for uprisingrelated offenses excluding 4000 security 
prisoners jailed earlier he said the army intends to increase its 
prison capacity to accommodate 1500 more 
straschnow said the heavy caseload has forced him to double the 
number of judges to six full time and 60 reservists on call 
in april he also implemented a supreme court recommendation to 
set up a new army appeals court to give palestinians a second chance 
it is an excellent example of the rule of law even in a 
difficult period like this straschnow said 
however as in the case of zaatari palestinian attorneys are 
reluctant to appeal fearing they will set a precedent that will 
institutionalize harsh sentences for acts such as throwing stones 
a human rights report by the us state department published in 
january said acquittals are rare for palestinians in israeli 
military courts 
the civil rights group al haq an arabrun affiliate of the 
international commission of jurists in geneva said evidence of 
an israeli soldier in military court is almost always believed in 
preference to the detainees 
another focus of criticism has been the wide use of socalled 
administrative detention in which activists are jailed for up to six 
months without trial about 5000 arabs have been held without trial 
during the course of the uprising 1508 currently are held in such 
detention according to the army 
straschnow said administrative detention was used only in serious 
cases where evidence could not be submitted in open court to protect 
the source presumeably an informer or secret agent 
we maintain the rules of standard and reasonable trial and due 
process straschnow said he noted that trials are public and 
suspects are represented by lawyers 
its a hopeless case this military system said osama saadi 
zaataris palestinian lawyer its arbitrary the judges and 
prosecutors are on the same side so one sides story is usually 
accepted more than the other 
of 67 israeli soldiers who have gone on military trial 36 were 
found guilty of misconduct ranging from assault and battery to 
causing death by unnecessary use of beatings or shootings 
the heaviest sentence has been 21 months for causing death 
an additional 400 soldiers have been disciplined by their 
commanders with such punishments as loss of rank or position

ramses back home from cairo to this quiet village on the edge of the 
desert known in ramses time as memphis 
the rose granite colossus of the warrior pharaoh ramses ii who 
reigned in 12921225 bc was taken from mit rahina in 1954 to a 
platform in front of cairos bustling central railway depot on 
orders of gamal abdel nasser who had taken power in a coup two 
years before 
that decision proved a headache for the officials however they 
worried that exhaust fumes from heavy motor vehicle traffic would 
cause the statue to crumble and that the vibration from railroad and 
subway trains beneath it would cause it to crack 
in the late 1980s talk turned to saving it one suggestion was to 
move ramses to the giza pyramids and another was to put him on an 
artificial island in the nile 
in early june however a different course was decided 
we decided to take him home back where we got him said 
sayed tawfik chairman of the egyptian antiquities organization 
when ramses left mit rahina for the square renamed for him cairo 
was a city of treelined boulevards today its a megacity of 12 
million people and growing 
poor ramses egyptologist gamal mokhtar a former chairman of 
the antiquities organization said in cairo 
he was brought here at the request of president nasser who 
had overthrown the monarchy and wanted a symbol of ancient egyptian 
power nobody questioned it you didnt at that time nobody thought 
whether being in the city center was good for the statue it isnt 
nasser died in 1970 
the statue has to be moved not only for its safety but also the 
pharaohs dignity mokhtar said 
such statues never belonged in a public square he said 
they belonged in temples facing the people as a warning and 
reminder of the pharaohs might 
when you come into cairo from the north you see ramses 
backside that was never meant to be on public view for one of 
egypts greatest pharaohs this isnt proper 
mit rahina is a fitting place for ramses it is rimmed with date 
palms and swaying halfa grass which when it was called memphis 
brought fear and dread to adversaries throughout the ancient world 
memphis was egypts first true capital and later its military 
headquarters 
ramses ii brought great power and wealth to egypt he built more 
buildings and more colossal statues than any other pharaoh 
he had other capitals but ramses had special affection for 
memphis 17 miles south of cairo memphis is thought to have begun 
life as no more than a tiny fortress beside the nile protected by a 
white wall in its heyday it stretched for miles and incorporated 
military barracks temples palaces shipyards weapons factories 
and craftshops 
its cemeteries extended for 50 miles and included the giza 
plateau home of the pyramids historians record that its temple of 
ptah the creator god and memphis patron was a third of a mile 
long and a quartermile wide and fronted by monumental statues of 
ramses 
how many colossi of ramses graced memphis is not known but 
records say at least 15 were at the ptah temple alone a fallen 
statue that would have stood about 45 feet with fingernails the 
size of hands lies toppled on its back 
a third colossus is the centerpiece of the ramses exhibit now in 
dallas texas at the end of a tour of the united states 
pieces of other statues lie among ancient memphis ruins red 
granite torsos and heads mingled haphazardly with weeds some are 
covered with dirt for protection from village children who use the 
ruins for playgrounds 
for part of the year the sacred texts column bases and statues 
are trapped in marshes salty water rising as high as 6 feet 
soaking and decaying all in its path 
tawfik said he believes the return of ramses will mark a new 
beginning for the ancient city 
when visitors come to mit rahina they stay only 30 minutes or 
so just enough to see the fallen ramses and the monuments on 
display he said we want to provide enough to keep them here 
all day 
he said memphis suffered because it was too important for too 
long lived in for 1700 years by ramses time the city was built 
largely of perishable mudbrick generations built on the fallen 
mudbrick houses of their forbears so that what we have now are 
ruins not a complete city tawfik said 
except for the remnants of the oncemagnificent temples little 
of old memphis remains in mit rahina 
the ancient egyptian was mainly interested in the 
netherworld the afterlife this is where he put his major 
efforts tawfik said this is why we have left so many examples 
of monuments for eternity but not so many for life

last summer viewers of evening at pops tapped 
their feet to everything from tchaikovsky to stephen sondheim simon 
and garfunkel to irving berlin not to mention conductor john 
williams scores for star trek et the exterrestrial and 
raiders of the lost ark 
after 20 years on pbs the eclectic summertime perennial is one 
of the longestrunning and mostwatched public television programs 
i dont think its name is accidental said peter mcghee 
program manager for national productions at wgbhtv which produces 
the series 
pops is short for popular right it draws on a sort of 
mainstream popular musical vernacular and it does so in a musically 
intelligent way with people of great luster and accomplishment 
beginning friday check your local pbs station schedule pbs 
will air a special 20thanniversary evening at pops taped at 
boston symphony hall the home of the pops 
the concert kicking off the 12week season features humorist art 
buchwald opera stars robert merrill and roberta peters 
comicpianist victor borge and piano duo anthony and joseph paratore 
williams took over as pops conductor in 1980 after the death of 
arthur fiedler 
i dont think its complacent to point out that the popularity 
of the pops does not seem to have diminished at all but we 
have to keep up the search for a new repertoire finding new things 
discarding things that no longer work williams said in a recent 
interview 
the pops is famous for delivering a certain glowing good 
feeling that it must produce each and every time out the amazing 
thing is that it does 
mcghee suggested that the show is so popular because it is a 
refuge from the violence and banality of the rest of television 
evening at pops runs from june through august half the 
60minute concerts are new the rest are repeats 
the pops was born 104 years ago when the boston symphony 
performed its first music hall promenade concert 
the pops first program promised the programme for these 
concerts will be made up largely of light music of the best class 
to draw summer crowds the concerts offered electric lighting 
instead of the more stifling gas lights which drew oxygen from the 
air and cafe tables set up in a hall where alcoholic beverages 
could be consumed a move considered risky by staid bostonians 
the boston globe reviewed the inaugural concert on its front page 
and declared more than a seachange has come over music hall 
the statue of beethoven which has witnessed many a strange sight 
looked out last evening on a summer garden scene as teutonic as 
though boston were in the fatherland 
newspapers came to refer to the summer shows as popular 
promenade concerts and from this came the truncated moniker 
pops 
in 1969 the orchestra took to the airwaves and has been there 
ever since 
although under the baton of williams since 1980 for many people 
pops is synonymous with arthur fiedler 
for 50 years until his death in 1979 at age 84 the mustachioed 
maestro conducted embroidered classics as well as lush renderings of 
modern fare from broadway tin pan alley and even nashville elvis 
presley and the beatles are among the composers whose works fiedler 
translated into pops style 
with his exuberant almost baroque orchestration of wellknown 
songs and symphonies fiedler has been credited with placing the 
pops among the most recorded orchestras in the world

two years ago the epa tested a trout from the river and it had a 
dioxin level of 90 parts per trillion more than three times higher 
than the consumption cutoff level recommended by the government 
sludge taken from the river has tested as high as 260 parts per 
trillion 
if after three years the company has met all of our 
requirements we will issue them a discharge release permit 
marlar said meanwhile as long as they continue to operate 
without a permit they are leaving themselves liable to possible 
legal actions 
blackwell estimated the compromise proposal would mean a 50 
percent reduction of the mills workforce over the next few years 
he said it will cost champion about 300 million to install the 
necessary technology 
but he added it will allow us to remain in operation so 
we can live with this compromise if we have to 
whether the people downstream can accept the threeyear plan is 
another matter 
something should be done right away joe hall said its 
wrong to let a company destroy a beautiful river simply in the name 
of profits

when gis came home after world war ii 
the nation looked to the great forests of the northwest for lumber 
to build their houses 
oregon and washington mills responded and still supply more than 
a third of the lumber and plywood used in the united states 
there was always that one more shining hill covered with trees 
to the west said us forest service budget officer ron johnson 
in portland now we find theres a pacific ocean and we fell into 
it 
from the western slope of the cascade range to the shore of the 
pacific this is the home of the douglas fir the towering king of 
the ancient forests whose structural strength tops all other lumber 
it is also home to the northern spotted owl a 14inch bird that 
could face extinction because with rare exceptions it wont nest 
or hunt anywhere but the dwindling virgin forests that are most 
prized for timber 
while logs are tied up in the legal battle over how much of the 
national forests can be cut without killing off the spotted owl 
record amounts of raw timber grown on private and state land are 
being shipped for premium prices to japan china and korea without 
ever seeing the inside of an american mill 
if a log is of export quality and is available to be exported 
it will be exported said tom mayr owner of the mayr brothers 
mill in hoquiam wash mayr has been reduced to counting his supply 
in months instead of years while watching a stream of logs being 
loaded onto ships in grays harbor wash 
we want to put out logs to the highest value market in recent 
years the highest value has been offshore said jack taylor 
operations manager for weyerhaeuser in coos bay where the regions 
leading exporter of raw logs has started a new mill to produce 
metricdimension lumber for the japanese homebuilding market 
companies can generally get 25 percent more for export logs than 
they can in the domestic market said forest service economist don 
flora in seattle 
boomandbust cycles were known to the timber industry before the 
spotted owl entered the spotlight but for the first time the pinch 
is from a shortage of logs rather than rising mortgage rates and 
dips in the housing market 
eighteen years ago brad wentworth stopped off in the coastal 
town of gold beach to see some friends on his way to college to 
study forest management now hes 37 a husband and father and one 
of the 300 workers at gold beach plywood who will be out of a job 
this summer when the mill shuts down 
i got sucked into the mill because it was such good wages 
wentworth said i kick myself in the butt now 
thirteen other wood products mills in oregon and washington have 
closed this year putting nearly 2000 people out of work as the 
industry enters a new era of highpriced timber in short supply 
the mill is old and inefficient said gold beach mill manager 
eric saunders it would take about 3 million to bring it up why 
should we put in that kind of investment without knowing there is a 
stable supply of timber 
the shortage of timber doesnt come as a surprise but its 
magnitude does 
in 1976 oregon state university forestry professor john beuter 
reported that little mature timber was left on private land and that 
the industry would have to depend on national forests home to most 
of the oldgrowth timber to make it to the next century when 
secondgrowth trees planted before world war ii would be ready for 
harvest 
jerry hamilton director of resource services for seattles 
simpson timber co had expected harvests in national forests to 
decline about 20 percent in oregon and washington this year as the 
forest service revised its longrange management plans he now fears 
it could drop 50 percent because oldgrowth forests have been ruled 
offlimits because of the spotted owl 
historically a lot of the impetus for the management of 
federal lands in the west was to settle the west and develop it 
said beuter now a consultant in portland we are sort of at the 
end of that era now we are at the point of recognizing that cutting 
more timber isnt going to create new cities and new economic 
opportunity in the west in fact we are coming around to where 
saving the forests may create new economic opportunity 
ed whitelaw a university of oregon economics professor has been 
a leading proponent of the idea that the northwest has more to gain 
from preserving its blue skies green forests and clear water than 
from exploiting its resources 
most oregonians receive two paychecks he said one is in 
dollars the other comes from the environment by accounting for all 
other amenities i estimate that the environmental paycheck is worth 
13 billion the paycheck from the timber industry is 15 
billion 
in 1988 oregon and washington national forests supplied 54 
billion board feet of timber a third of the regions total harvest 
from all lands where the forest service management plans used in 
the 1980s allowed the annual harvest of 55 billion board feet the 
limit in the 1990s will be closer to 47 billion 
unlike owners of private forests the forest service by law may 
cut no more timber than it can grow back it also has to provide for 
the needs of fish wildlife campers hikers and water quality 
where it once had to answer only to the timber industry the 
service now has a crowd of watchdogs panting over its shoulder the 
governors of washington and oregon want to be sure there is enough 
timber to sustain the rural economy environmental groups demand 
preservation of oldgrowth forests academics have started offering 
new management techniques that follow the lead of nature and there 
is new unrest inside the forest service 
jeff debonis a willamette national forest timber sale planner 
has organized the association of forest service employees for 
environmental ethics with a mailing list of about 200 debonis 
wrote in february to forest service chief dale robertson claiming 
the agency is in bed with the industry 
the question we need to ask concerned citizens is why should 
the national forests be sacrificed to an overzealous and greedy 
industry that liquidated their own lands to make a fast cut he 
said 
robertsons staff is preparing a detailed response to debonis 
letter said spokeswoman rose narlock in washington dc maybe we 
need some of these things talked about it was a gutsy move on his 
part 
robertson has acknowledged that the forest service has taken a 
beating in the courts under the national environmental policy act 
evidence debonis cites for his argument that too many trees are 
being cut 
while loggers tie yellow ribbons to their trucks and demand more 
timber the grim truth is jobs are disappearing spotted owl or no 
spotted owl 
the biggest source of change in employment has been the 
modernization and automation of the forest products industry said 
wilderness society economist jeffrey t olson who produced a study 
concluding the decline in timber jobs in the northwest has little to 
do with cutting old growth in national forests 
flora the forest service economist said in the 1970s he figured 
each 1 million board feet of timber translated into eight timber 
jobs thats now down to 15 jobs in the hightech mills and four to 
five jobs overall 
timber is virtually extinct as a factor in the economies of 
portland and seattle but still vital in small cities and towns that 
grew up with it 
oregons 68700 woodproducts jobs almost all of them outside 
the portland area account for 52 percent of the states 
employment washingtons 41800 timber jobs account for 21 percent 
of its employment in 1986 the most recent figures available 
timber accounted for just 6 percent of oregons gross state product 
at 25 billion and 22 percent of washingtons at 16 billion 
but forest service economist con schallau in corvallis argues 
timber has a greater impact than that because it accounts for 38 
percent of oregons basic economy bringing in outside dollars 
and 18 percent of washingtons 
while economists may differ over timbers importance they agree 
the places that will be hurt worst are towns like gold beach 
population 1500 with a payroll of 6 million from gold beach 
plywood 
if you live in a big city youve got a lot of choices 
wentworth said but if you live here youve got to work in the 
brush or the mill

one tip that weyerhaeuser is taking bold 
steps with its newest sawmill is the bed of pansies in the log yard 
weyerhaeuser a leading exporter of logs to japan has gone a 
step further to produce precisionsawn metricdimension lumber for 
japanese home builders for whom the appearance of wood for 
traditional postandbeam construction counts more than the 
structural strength valued in the american market 
we want to put out logs to the highest value market in recent 
years the highest value has been offshore said operations manager 
jack taylor 
so the company scrapped an aging mill in north bend on the 
southern coast and converted a cedar plant here into its mill of the 
90s called cbx 
were pulling out all the stops said superintendent sam 
dickey as he showed off the paved log yard laserguided saws 
flowers and a new management style that emphasizes teamwork were 
spending 1 million on the upgrade 
but hightech also means fewer jobs when weyerhaeuser announced 
the cbx project in january north bend employed about 200 and 
produced about 65 million board feet a year about 3 jobs per 
million board feet the cbx crew of 69 can produce 45 million board 
feet a year or 15 jobs per million feet 
the mills that survive the current shakeup in the industry must 
be extremely efficient and dickey expects his handpicked crew to 
lead the way were aiming to have this site be the model for the 
industry 
to emphasize that point weyerhaeuser has installed catwalks for 
visitors 
all the major japanese trading companies have been here once or 
twice said dickey who is learning japanese 
while weyerhaeuser took the obvious steps of upgrading the 
physical plant at cbx it also is going where no sawmill has gone 
before in its contract with the international woodworkers of america 
basically it lets people work as teams rather than in 
individual job situations said milo summerville field 
representative for iwa local 3261 sometimes you have to give 
something like this a trial period to see if it will work 
lumber grader al esch is enthusiastic about being able to rotate 
through three positions rather than sticking to one job its kind 
of like being an immigrant in a new country he said 
cheryl howell an 11year veteran of the company scored well on 
a handeye coordination test and was crosstrained to run 
barkstripping machinery and giant loaders in the yard before 
its done i expect to know how to run everything in here she 
said 
the first shift starts at 630 am with workers and managers 
joining in 10 minutes of exercises followed by as much as 45 
minutes of talk as the crew helps make management decisions to 
emphasize teamwork weyerhaeuser scrapped an old cleanup contract 
and made everyone including dickey responsible for keeping the 
mill clean 
dickey is happy to get away from the oldstyle management 
approach he calls big brainlittle brain 
generally you get dissatisfied employees because they are 
starved for information he said were giving them a big piece 
of the operation

in the rugged illahe country where gold 
miners still pan creeks running into the rogue river the siskiyou 
national forest is trying techniques from a movement known as the 
new forestry 
i see it as a major philosophical change rather than an 
incremental change said forest service scientist jerry franklin 
a leading spokesman for the movement in terms of forestry 
practice it is revolutionary 
the new forestry is gaining credibility in the midst of debate 
over how much national forest can be logged while preserving the old 
growth ecosystem pressure to log these forests has increased as 
private lands have been overcut 
we need to make this crisis the basis for not just resolving 
the issue of how much old growth to leave but perhaps more 
important how do we manage our commodity lands over the long 
term franklin said 
people are looking for ways to harvest the forest and provide 
jobs yet keep values that are important to the public said gold 
beach district ranger kathy johnson the public is interested in 
oldgrowth forest interested in the species that inhabit the old 
growth forest 
we think there is an opportunity for these new forestry 
techniques to provide that middle ground 
while most national forests in oregon and washington still are 
developing 10year management plans the siskiyou national forest 
has fit the new forestry into its plan with a goal of balancing 
production against a healthy forest 
the key to new forestry is to save more of the forests parts so 
what is left after logging has the best chance of surviving radical 
climate changes a growing number of scientists predict will come 
within the next 50 years 
on the siskiyou the new forestry is the basis for plans to start 
logging in the next couple years the 7100 acres known as the illahe 
project about 40 miles west of grants pass in southwestern oregon 
as we move out from that large block of oldgrowth forest into 
areas previously harvested we feather out the impacts said 
johnson well leave a certain amount of oldgrowth trees per 
acre that number increases as you get closer to the undisturbed 
block of old growth forest 
that differs radically from traditional practice of clearcuts of 
20 to 40 acres scattered throughout the forest in hopes of diluting 
the impact 
as scientists have learned more about how pieces of the forest 
interact they have found that scattered clearcuts fragmented the 
ecosystem breaking it into pieces too small to function they also 
have found it valuable to leave corridors linking the pieces of 
forest 
instead of clearcutting new foresters will leave dead trees and 
some live trees standing to give animals places to feed and live 
some logs will be left to rot and restore organic material to the 
soil planners say the new forestry will mean a 5 percent cut in 
timber production over the 130year harvest cycle 
no decision has been made on how to approach slash burning in 
which debris left by clearcutting is burned to return minerals to 
the soil reduce fire danger and make it easier to plant seedlings 
johnson said 
when it comes to replanting loggedover land the new forestry 
suggests restoring the mix of species that were cut to maintain a 
diverse genetic base more able to withstand future climatic change 
rather than filling the land with one commercially valuable species 
such as douglas fir 
oregon state university forestry professor david perry also part 
of the new forestry movement said the point is that whatever you 
do to take trees off it has got to be consistent with the 
adaptations of the forest that have evolved over millenia to cope 
with disurbance

robert hornbeck aimed his truck up the 
winding mountain road and eyed the aged forest looming above 
there is your pristine oldgrowth forest said the logger 
pointing to silver shafts of dead and dying trees within the green 
shag of hemlock fir and lightercolored cedar to me its not 
beauty its a little bit pathetic its a forest thats overripe 
it would have been logged by now but it was pulled from the 
market because of the spotted owl and i dont think it will ever be 
logged now if they take it away its a way of life that is gone 
not just jobs 
whether when and where cutting may resume in many northwestern 
national forests wont be known until us district judge william 
dwyer in seattle decides whether to alter a march injunction 
temporarily halting the sale of 1 billion board feet of timber in 
oregon and washington 
dwyers ruling came in a lawsuit challenging a forest service 
plan to set aside 374000 acres as habitat for the northern spotted 
owl environmentalists charged that the plan fails to set aside 
enough oldgrowth forest to ensure the owls survival dwyers 
injunction expands the affected acreage 
meanwhile the us fish and wildlife which refused in 1987 to 
list the spotted owl as a threatened species reversed itself in 
march and decided the birds dwindling habitat warrants giving it 
that status a yearlong process 
oregon gov neil goldschmidt and state congressional leaders have 
called a summit meeting saturday in salem to try to resolve 
conflicts over the owl the governor the states entire 
congressional delegation and representatives of government agencies 
and timber and environmental groups will attend 
the prospect that the owl will be listed as a threatened species 
has added more doubt to the future of timber supplies 
but there is much more at stake than board feet of lumber and a 
subspecies of spotted owls said forest ecologist peter morrison of 
the wilderness societys seattle office who insists im no tree 
hugger 
we need to consider longterm impacts on biological 
diversity said morrison noting that relatively little is known 
about virgin forests and interactions between plants and animals in 
them 
i can see serious impacts if we give up that biological 
diversity found in an ancient forest and by then it will be too 
late its not going to be just the spotted owl disappearing 
the unique attachment of the owl to old growth is what put the 
bird in the middle of controversy biologists say that while the owl 
can use other forest land it requires a certain amount of old 
growth for nesting and mating if that old growth is too fragmented 
the owl could spend so much time seeking food and shelter that it 
wouldnt have time or energy to mate 
the forest service doesnt know how much old growth is left but 
the wilderness society has estimated that less than 15 percent of 
the original oldgrowth forest remains in the owls range from 
northern california to southern british columbia what is left is so 
badly fragmented that much of it is worthless as habitat for the owl 
and other wildlife 
people want to say lets sit down at a table and reasonably 
talk about this dividing of a loaf when in reality the loaf is all 
gone what we are doing is squabbling over the crumbs said rick 
brown a former mount hood national forest biologist now working for 
the national wildlife federation 
but ted anderson executive director of ffacts a group in 
washingtons skagit valley organized this spring to defend the 
timber industry said its the livelihood of workers and their 
families thats at stake 
national parks wilderness areas wild and scenic rivers and 
other setasides have removed 53 percent of the federal forest lands 
in washington from the timber base he said we simply cant write 
off our industry 
for example six timber sales in the mount baker district 
covering half of the 2200 acres set aside for one pair of spotted 
owls would have produced 47 million board feet of timber to keep 
local mills running for the next year 
to us thats our life said anderson to them its for 
one owl 
andy kerr conservation director of the oregon natural resources 
council said timber jobs are going owl or no owl he cited a study 
by the wilderness society estimating that the 71500 timber jobs in 
washington and oregon in 1985 will shrink to half that by 2030 
mainly because of increased mill productivity stopping the harvest 
of old growth altogether would eliminate only 6 percent of the 
timber and 2300 extra jobs in that period the study said 
chuck sisco of the national audubon society another forest 
service veteran said the agency has bungled the works since 1978 
when it picked the owl as the indicator species for the wellbeing 
of the oldgrowth ecosystem under provisions of the national forest 
management act 
about twothirds of the sites the forest service identified in 
oregon and washington as owl habitats would affect lumbering but 
their own data showed that 65 or 70 percent of the areas they said 
were spotted owl sites in wilderness where logging is prohibited 
didnt have any birds in them sisco said 
on the west side of the olympics larry mason owner of the mason 
lumber mill in beaver reiterated the doubts held by many in the 
timber industry that the spotted owl is threatened even if the 
owls days are numbered he said it is not responsible to shut 
timber supplies down overnight 
mason complained that the fight over the owl vividly illustrates 
the growing urbanrural separation in washington where the 
seattlearea economy has been fueled by a growing aerospace industry 
and computerage businesses while the traditional forest industry 
has been pushed aside 
you know he said there are people who have to get their 
hands dirty every day earning a living and there are city people 
who think the forests should be their private playgrounds

the 15foot cross made of oldgrowth timber

in 1964 a university of chicago law student 
named arthur wise got the novel idea that school funding formulas 
based on unequal property taxes violated the constitution 
twentyfive years later that legal theory by a fledgling lawyer 
has helped change the shape of school finance in some three dozen 
states 
this month kentucky became the latest to feel its effects that 
states highest court ordered the legislature to come up with a new 
system of public schooling that gives rich and poor kids an even 
shake 
as radical as that may sound nearly three decades of experience 
with school funding reform suggests that change in kentucky will be 
slow in coming and probably hard fought 
by 1967 wise had spelled out his theories in a book rich 
schools poor schools the idea simple but elegant was that 
funding formulas used by virtually all states deny children in poor 
communities equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the 
14th amendment 
states and even some educators have countered that intangibles 
like dedication count more than money in creating better schools 
reformers like wise insist that all the dedication in the world 
wont provide kids foreign language teachers and decent science 
labs only money can 
wises 228page book became the bible for the budding school 
finance reform movement the cause won big victories in the 1970s 
when civil rights and equity topped the education agenda 
one result the average state share of education spending rose 
from 409 percent in 1970 to an estimated 502 percent in 1989 
while the local share dipped from 518 percent to 436 percent 
according to national education association statistics the 
remaining share is federal aid 
finance reform faded through the 1980s as state money tightened 
the property tax revolt spread and the education reform debate 
shifted from equity to excellence 
but the funding reform movement is showing signs of new life 
lately thats especially true in some agricultural states where 
poor districts already strapped by declining farm values and lower 
property tax receipts nonetheless must meet state mandates for 
costly school reforms 
montanas supreme court declared that states school funding 
system unconstitutional in february the legislature opens a special 
session on monday to meet a july 1 deadline to devise a new one 
a similar challenge in texas is heading for that states highest 
court as is one in new jersey a group of poor tennessee districts 
have banded together to sue that state 
in kentucky the supreme court decision didnt stop at ordering 
an overhaul of state school funding to make it fairer to poor 
children it said the whole school system had to change top to 
bottom 
lest there be any doubt the result of our decision is that 
kentuckys entire system of common schools is unconstitutional 
wrote chief justice robert stephens 
rich and poor alike must be given the same opportunity and 
access to an adequate education the court ruled in the case 
brought four years ago by a coalition of 66 property poor 
kentucky districts 
wise and other school finance experts called the ruling a 
bombshell probably the most sweeping of its kind yet history 
suggests change may not be as quick or dramatic as the ruling 
implies 
even when you win you have to go to the state legislature and 
start all over again said peter d veillette a school finance 
specialist at the national education association 
its been 16 years for example since new jerseys highest court 
ruled in robinson vs cahill that that states financing system 
violated the state constitutions education clause guaranteeing a 
thorough and efficient system of free public schools 
but inequities persist and lawyers representing poor new jersey 
students will reargue the case in state supreme court next september 
wise now director of the rand corporations center for the study 
of the teaching profession in washington said that affluent 
moorestown nj spends 3000 more per pupil than east orange 
nj one result is that moorestown provides one computer per 11 
students compared to one per 43 east orange pupils 
new jersey state education commissioners have criticized poor 
districts for the weak quality of schooling but have failed along 
with the legislature to provide full equalization wise said 
the powers that be would rather regulate than provide money 
that doesnt mean such lawsuits accomplish nothing it does mean 
that the national scorecard has been uneven 
the legal principles underlying the funding reform movement have 
fared badly in federal court they flunked their biggest test in 
1973 when the us supreme court sustained texas funding system it 
held that inequality was an unfortunate but unavoidable byproduct of 
the principle of local control over schools 
that setback led reform advocates to focus on state courts where 
they found greater success 
a recent study of school finance cases by robert berne associate 
dean of new york universitys graduate school of public 
administration found that state courts have overturned funding 
systems in 11 states since 1970 new jersey kansas wisconsin 
california connecticut washington west virginia wyoming 
arkansas and this year montana and kentucky 
the first big decision serrano vs priest in california in 1971 
has meant that per pupil spending is now virtually equal within 
200 per pupil in 95 percent of that states school districts an 
added factor was propertytax slashing proposition 13 which led the 
state to increase its share of education spending from 373 percent 
in 1970 to 691 percent in 1989 to help bail out cashstarved 
districts 
but courts have sustained systems in 10 other states arizona 
michigan idaho oregon pennsylvania ohio georgia colorado new 
york and maryland 
such states typically have defended their funding systems by 
citing the texas argument that the principle of local control of 
schooling justified wide spending discrepancies among districts 
many also cited effectiveschools research suggesting that 
dedication and sound school leadership mean more to learning than 
money 
wise dismisses such arguments no research has ever shown he 
said that a school with high expectations and no german teacher 
will produce students who speak german or that a school with 
orderly classrooms and no laboratory facilities will train its 
students to be good scientists 
the recent history of school finance reform shows above all 
that court rulings even one so sweeping as in kentucky are but a 
first step in a long bitter and politicallycharged process 
as michael w la morte an education professor at the university 
of georgia pointed out in a study published in november initial 
responses by legislatures or state education agencies to 
courtordered reforms have frequently been brought back to courts 
for later and often protracted rounds of deliberation 
school funding formulas die hard

a small navy of spill response vessels 
being assembled in prince william sound is the most graphic evidence 
of the changes affecting tanker traffic since the nations worst oil 
spill 
weve had to scour the world for the equipment and were still 
recruiting says tom brennan of the alyeska pipeline service co 
the consortium of north slope oil producers operates the 
transalaska pipeline that carries onefourth of the nations oil 
supply and the tanker terminal at valdez 
an interim plan alyeska submitted in the face of criticism over 
its handling of the exxon valdez spill provides for a response team 
of 10 vessels and 48 people capable of skimming nearly 11000 
barrels an hour virtually anywhere in the sound within 10 hours it 
also calls for more pilots and escorts for tankers and breathalyzer 
tests for tanker captains and crews 
crew members will be tested before entering the tanker terminal 
if guards suspect they are intoxicated alyeska already has denied 
three people access to their ships drunken sailors previously were 
turned over to their captains 
captains now are tested an hour before they sail if they fail 
they will be removed from their vessels and authorities will be 
notified all those tested apparently have passed the test brennan 
describes as very unusual i dont think its done anywhere else 
in the world he says 
under a plan in effect march 24 when the exxon valdez ran 
aground on bligh reef and dumped almost 11 million gallons of oil 
alyeska promised to have people and equipment on scene within five 
hours it took almost 12 
gov steve cowper threatened to shut down the pipeline if alyeska 
didnt come up with something better and six weeks later it offered 
the new plan 
before the spill one tugboat accompanied loaded tankers through 
the valdez narrows into the sound a statelicensed pilot got off 
short of bligh reef 
under the new system one tug and a 210foot escort response 
vessel will accompany every loaded tanker to hinchenbrook 
entrance leading from the sound to the gulf of alaska the escort 
vessel will have two skimmers almost 14000 feet of containment 
boom and storage capacity of 4000 barrels 
seventyfive to 80 loaded tankers leave valdez a month brennan 
says and alyeska will have three escorts enough to handle the 
tankers in the sound at any one time 
statelicensed pilots will accompany tankers past bligh reef the 
last prominent obstacle between valdez and hinchenbrook from there 
tankers must have a federally licensed pilot some tanker captains 
also are licensed pilots once past hinchenbrook all pilotage 
restrictions are off 
when traffic was backed up by weather or loading problems 
tankers have always anchored at knowles head a sheltered area on 
the southwest side of the peninsula between the port of fidalgo and 
port gravina about 30 miles south of valdez 
under the new system two more vessels will be anchored there 
around the clock one will be a tug with a barge capable of holding 
140000 barrels of oil the other will have equipment to pump oil 
off a damaged tanker and a storage capacity of 180000 barrels 
their only responsibility will be responding to a tanker accident 
two storage barges with a combined capacity 136000 barrels will 
be kept in valdez each will carry absorbent material and 16000 
feet of boom two tugs will be stationed there to tow the barges to 
a spill and assist a grounded tanker a vessel with boom deployment 
equipment will round out the fleet 
another 8000 feet of boom will be stored at the tanker terminal 
giving alyeska a total of almost 39000 feet almost twice as much 
as was immediately available for the exxon valdez spill 
it is still unclear what the new measures will cost obviously 
it is in the millions of dollars how many millions we cant say 
yet brennan says 
one thing that hasnt changed is coast guard monitoring of tanker 
traffic 
lt cmdr tom falkenstein second in command of the port of 
valdez marine safety office emphasizes that the coast guards role 
is purely advisory as an aid to navigation we do not control 
their movements were not like air traffic controllers 
the ultimate responsibility always rests with a ships master 
and federal law would have to change to give the coast guard more 
authority he says i dont anticipate that were going to begin 
controlling vessel movements 
the coast guard has asked for about 12000 in computer equipment 
to improve its monitoring but falkenstein says he doesnt forsee 
installation of stronger radar he estimates the cost of providing 
radar coverage of the entire sound at 24 million not including 
personnel and housing 
under ideal conditions he says the radar will reach just beyond 
bligh reef ideal conditions are rare in prince william sound and 
frequently radar coverage wont reach even to the reef 
tanker traffic in the port has not changed significantly from 
the coast guards perspective falkenstein says its not business 
as usual by any stretch but our procedures havent changed because 
there was nothing wrong to begin with

pro basketball player vern fleming used to 
worry that when he was hit in the mouth his teeth would spill out 
onto the court years of neglect had left the indiana pacers guards 
upper teeth decayed and loose 
georgia price never had real teeth only soft tooth buds barely 
emerging from her gums where her baby teeth never came in the 
bloomington nurse now 41 received her first dentures at age 3 and 
a second set at 12 
both have found relief with permanent implants teeth anchored on 
metal rods supported by frameworks hidden underneath the gums 
i always thought how wonderful it would be to feel like i have 
teeth price said i speak clearer now without my teeth flying 
across the room 
dental implants have been around since the early egyptians but 
remain largely unknown among the public more frustrated denture 
wearers are receiving them though as implants gain wider 
acceptance among dentists 
a national institutes of health conference last year said in a 
statement that the number of dentists performing implants had grown 
tenfold in five years and that 300000 americans a year will be 
getting implanted teeth by 1992 
implant dentistry was a 150 million industry last year 
estimated dr richard guaccio of lake county president of the 
2000member american academy of implant dentistry 
some dentists caution that implants arent for everyone 
particularly those with overriding health problems and those who 
wont give the devices the care and cleaning necessary to prevent 
infection and prosthetic failure 
few people enjoy having to take dentures out at night and some 
are embarrassed to let their spouses or others see them without 
their false teeth said dr craig cooper of indianapolis who does 
300400 implants a year they eat better but its way beyond that 
from a psychological point of view 
sixty percent of the respondents to a marketing survey last year 
had never heard of implants said cooper who directs the faculty at 
the midwest implant institute in columbus ohio which has trained 
600 dentists in implantology since 1981 
yet a survey three years ago by the national institute of dental 
research suggests many people could use them fortytwo percent of 
americans over age 65 and 4 percent of those aged 35 to 64 have no 
teeth it reported 
the growing older market a wealthy segment of the population 
provides implant dentistry with a tremendous opportunity for growth 
and manufacturers have provided a variety of devices cooper said 
its exponential growth there are fewer and fewer patients we 
cannot treat 
the american dental association has reservations 
in general the feeling is that implants can be used on a 
selected basis depending on the patient and the patients 
condition said dr wayne wozniak of adas chicago laboratory on 
certification and product research it should only be done on 
people the dentist feels can properly maintain the implant it 
requires meticulous oral hygiene after the device has been placed 
so it requires a highly motivated individual 
infection around the implant would erode the bone where many of 
the devices are implanted lack of adequate bone would immediately 
eliminate some patients from being implant candidates one implant 
subperiosteal is not based in bone and consists of a wiry framework 
fitted between the bone and the gum 
depending on the type implants can cost as little as 600 for a 
single tooth or as much as 10000 for a full upper or lower arch 
and some procedures are covered by medicare most are performed as 
outpatient surgery 
the nih statement said there was little information on longterm 
effectiveness of implants and called for a national registry to 
collect data however its generally considered 80 percent to 90 
percent of implants are successful for at least five to 10 years 
cooper who inserted the 28yearold flemings subperiosteal 
implant said it should last the rest of his life with proper care 
implants can last 20 years and more said guaccio estimating 
that after 18 years about 87 percent of the implants ive ever 
placed are still functioning in the mouth

a groggy volunteer crew of five gathered early new 
years day and raced to where a 500pound sea cow had been found 
with deep gashes from a boat propeller in its grayishbrown 
leathery back 
but the west indian manatee wasnt injured in the congested 
intracoastal waterway it was the everglades it shows you they 
arent safe anywhere said dr gregory bossart miami seaquarium 
veterinarian and pathologist 
besides the unmistakable prop marks the manatee had three 
fractured ribs and a punctured lung the injuries caused a bubble to 
form inside the animal leaving it floating helplessly 
the manatee dubbed marjory after marjory stoneman douglas a 
protector of the everglads has been recovering at the seaquarium 
one of two marine parks the other is sea world in orlando in 
florida that are authorized to rescue the protected animal 
an estimated 1200 of the prehistoriclooking creatures live in 
florida based on aerial surveys the docile planteating 
creatures weighing more than 3000 pounds and ranging from eight to 
14 feet long are found from northern south america to as far north 
virginia 
they face a growing threat from floridas development boom 
a total of 133 manatee deaths were reported last year including 
a record 43 from being hit by boats there were 39 boatrelated 
deaths in 1987 the 45 deaths so far this year exceeds the 1987 
period through march 15 deaths have been blamed on boats and 23 
carcasses were recovered last month alone 
our guess is that the numbers increased through the 60s and 
70s as there was more protection but in the 80s theyve held 
about steady said dr bruce ackerman a state marine mammal 
researcher if thats the case the fact that deaths are 
increasing is of considerable concern 
even if boatrelated deaths were reduced the manatee faces other 
obstacles such as a low reproductive rate and diminishing habitat 
officials say 
were not that optimistic their ability to recover from 
any kind of problem is limited even if everything was perfect 
ackerman said 
the rehabilitation of injured manatees is a painstaking process 
that takes months there is also the question of what awaits them 
and babies born in captivity once they are returned to the wild 
theres no problem with breeding in the wild the problem we 
have is habitat destruction said jp garner assistant manager 
of homosassa springs park where nine manatees are kept 
manatees rely on seagrass beds for food and have begun to 
congregate around the warmwater discharges of power plants where 
boat traffic is often heavy 
patrick rose a marine mammal coordinator for the state 
department of natural resources said florida is focusing efforts on 
tying manatee protection to county growth management plans in 
addition there has been an extensive campaign to increase public 
awareness about the creatures plight 
singersongwriter jimmy buffet gave a big boost to the manatee 
cause eight years ago when he became chairman of the save the 
manatee club which now boasts an international membership of 
about 22000 
they have absolutely no ability to be aggressive said rose 
people identify with them as the ultimate victim 
more than five months after being picked up marjory remains in 
guarded but stable condition in a seaquarium tank bossart said 
shes feeling a lot better and is able to dive better 
unlike many others of the gentle mammals she still has a 
fighting chance

occidental petroleum ltd says it plans to 
redevelop the piper alpha oil field where 167 workers were killed 
last summer in the north sea oil industrys worst disaster 
occidental petroleum said thursday that its new single fixed 
platform would keep the main controls and sleeping quarters 
completely isolated from the drilling and processing equipment 
most of the victims of the july 1988 explosion and fire died in 
an accommodation area located near processing equipment some 
industry critics since have called on oil companies to remove living 
areas from drilling platforms 
a public inquiry into the cause of the disaster is currently 
under way 
occidental said it awarded contracts worth 175 million pounds or 
approximately 264 million to four british companies for the 
redevelopment 
we are fully sympathetic towards the people still trying to 
come to terms with their grief following last years tragic 
accident said john brading chairman of occidental uk whose 
parent company occidental petroleum corp is based in los angeles 
the company must also be mindful of its responsibilities to its 
1000 employees in the united kingdom and a further 2500 people who 
will find jobs as a direct result of these contract awards 
the company said it hopes to get the field back into production 
in 1992 
the consortium operating the field made up of occidental texaco 
britain ltd lasmo north sea plc and union texas petroleum ltd 
have agreed on the plans for the project 
the new rig will be designed to handle 120000 barrels of oil a 
day for export via the existing pipeline system leading to the 
occidental consortiums oil handling terminal at flotta in the 
orkney islands the old rig produced 160000 barrels a day 
brading said that the platforms new design incorporates all of 
the lessons learned to date from the disaster and has the 
flexibility to include any recommendations following the 
conclusion of the piper inquiry 
our intention is that the new production facilities will 
include stateoftheart safety concepts and technology he said 
occidental said it shortly would submit the redevelopment plans 
to the government for approval 
the contracts were awarded to brown and root vickers ltd 
british steel plc mcdermott scotland ltd and press offshore ltd

michael milken the fallen drexel burnham lambert 
financier is striking out on his own 
but what isnt clear is whether loyal excolleagues will follow 
the pied piper of junk bonds to his new firm and how long the 
venture will last with milken facing a lengthy jail term 
milken 42 resigned thursday after 19 years at drexel where he 
began a wildly successful career that helped reshape corporate 
america in the 1980s through the pioneering use of lowgrade 
securities called junk bonds 
milken who made a reported 550 million in 1987 said he is 
forming a consulting firm to assist companies that want to raise 
money to start up grow or stay in business 
but he faces 185 billion in forfeitures of alleged illegal 
profits and a lengthy jail term if convicted on a 98count fraud and 
racketeering indictment the governments largest securities crime 
prosecution to date 
people involved in milkens plans for the new firm international 
capital assets group said milken does not intend to raid drexels 
beverly hills calif junk bond division which he founded and ran 
until his march indictment 
the principals in the new firm which now has a handful of 
employees and a temporary los angeles office are not going to be 
drexel people milken associates said 
but milken still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junk 
bond employees and drexel clients and no one is ruling out 
defections milken associates did not release details on his plans 
including whether an affiliated brokerage would be formed 
a drexel official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
wall street giant does not anticipate conflicts with milkens new 
firm because it will not be in the brokerage business 
under drexels stilltobeapproved settlement of civil insider 
trading and other fraud charges with the securities and exchange 
commission drexel and its employees are barred from doing business 
with milken directly or indirectly 
the drexel official said the provision likely will be reviewed on 
a casebycase basis so some contact between the new york 
investment firms clients and milken may occur for instance milken 
may be able to refer clients to drexel and vice versa but not 
receive any fees 
milkens resignation ends the relationship between one of the 
most important financial players of the decade and the firm he 
helped boost from a secondtier brokerage to the nations fifth 
largest 
michael milken made many important contributions to drexel 
burnham and his resignation although not unexpected is a sad 
event drexel stated we wish him well in his new endeavor 
milken widely was credited with creating a 175 billionayear 
junk bond market his pitchman sale of the bonds previously used 
mainly by companies with low credit ratings helped fuel the 
decades corporate takeover mania by giving smaller companies and 
corporate raiders a tool for financing growth mergers and takeovers 
but the federal government alleges milken used his powers through 
drexel to engage in a range of securities crimes including schemes 
with nowjailed stock speculator ivan boesky 
he also is accused of insider trading in a separate sec lawsuit 
no settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled in that case 
milken had been on leave from drexel since his criminal 
indictment his brother lowell who also was charged in the case 
announced thursday he was quitting the firm to return to practicing 
law 
i am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave drexel as 
part of the firms settlement with the government but i look 
forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies 
michael milken said in a statement 
milken joined drexel fulltime in 1970 after graduating from the 
university of pennsylvanias wharton school in 1978 he moved 
drexels junk bond division to beverly hills 
milkens trial in federal court in manhattan is set for next 
march he is free under a 700 million bond package 
lawyers close to the case indicated milkens decision to resign 
was calculated by quitting milken preempts the firms agreement 
with the sec to dismiss him once the settlement is approved by a 
federal judge 
with milkens resignation lawyers may argue that parts of the 
drexel pact are moot and mount further challenges they also are 
expected to challenge the provision barring drexel and milken from 
doing business with the same clients

paramount communications inc still awaiting a 
response to its unwanted 107 billion takeover bid for time inc 
has stepped up the pressure on the media giant by indicating it 
might sweeten its offer 
but investors were unimpressed thursday by the prospect of a 
higher bid for time the companys stock fell 362 to 17150 a 
share on the new york stock exchange on reports the time board was 
leaning toward making a cash tender offer for warner communications 
inc as a way to foil paramounts 175ashare bid 
time and warner previously agreed to merge in an allstock deal 
in a letter sent thursday to times directors paramount chairman 
martin s davis said since our offer commenced no representative 
of time has contacted us to discuss our proposal 
the time board which was considering how to fight paramount and 
whether it could salvage times merger with warner seemed to be in 
no rush to reply to the offer or davis letter 
time spokesman edward adler said the company had no comment on 
the letter and would not say when it would respond 
george sard a spokesman for paramount an entertainment and 
publishing conglomerate declined to comment on the purpose of the 
letter saying it speaks for itself 
however observers said the letter was intended to pressure the 
time board davis said paramount might be willing to raise its bid 
if a review of times financial records justified a higher offer 
davis called for a meeting between the two companies at which 
paramount could examine times books 
time stock which has traded as high as 18275 a share since 
the paramount bid was announced fell on the prospect of a time bid 
for warner which cast doubt on the paramount offer time has a 5 
billion line of credit that it could use to help finance a bid 
an offer for warner was one of several options the time board was 
believed to be considering the others included a recapitalization 
of the company a cash tender offer for paramount or a continued 
pursuit of its planned merger with warner warner also could launch 
a cash tender offer for time 
stock in paramount formerly called gulf amp western inc was 
unchanged at 5950 a share thursday while warner picked up 62 
cents to close at 5562 a share 
under the planned timewarner merger time stockholders would get 
a share in the new company for each share they own while warner 
shareholders would get 0465 of a share of the new company for each 
of their warner shares 
however if the two companies were to pursue their merger it was 
widely expected the deal would have to be renegotiated because 
times stock price has soared from the 126 level it fetched before 
paramount announced its bid 
in a separate development thursday time and warner said new york 
city officials approved the proposed transfers in ownership of the 
six cable franchises in the city owned by either time or warner 
time and warner together own cable systems serving about 55 
million subscribers but must get permission from local cable 
authorities in each case to combine their respective operations 
under a time warner umbrella

a pediatricians group is upset with plans by the 
baby food maker gerber products co to market a new infant formula 
directly to parents rather than through physicians 
gerber disclosed thursday that it would break with the customary 
practice in the infant formula business by advertising its new 
gerber baby formula in television commercials and direct mailings to 
parents starting in august 
the new formula which will be manufactured by bristolmyers co 
already a big player in the 165 billion infant formula market 
will be available starting in september 
the proposed marketing approach immediately drew fire from the 
american association of pediatrics which opposes advertising infant 
formula to consumers for fear that it would discourage breast 
feeding 
im disappointed that gerber with an impeccable reputation in 
the field of infant nutrition would resort to this tactic said 
dr joe sanders associate executive director of the academy based 
in elk grove village ill 
gerber officials said their ads would emphasize that breast 
feeding is the preferred method for feeding infants they said it 
would also encourage mothers to talk with their physicians before 
deciding on a formula 
the announcement was unusual in that it links gerber which has 
twice discontinued infant formula products with a company that is 
already a major factor in that business 
bristolmyers based in new york claims a 37 percent share of 
the market with products including enfamil and prosobee 
abbott laboratories inc has about 523 percent of the market 
while amrican home products corp is third at 97 percent according 
to gerbers figures 
under the agreement bristolmyers will manufacture the new 
formula and be responsible for assuring the quality of the product 
while gerber market it 
infant formula is a logical extension to our 61year dedication 
to helping parents feed babies said robert l johnston head of 
the gerber products division at the fremont michbased company 
gerber makes about 180 baby food products the formula will be 
available in powdered concentrated liquid and readytouse liquid 
forms 
gerber spokesman steven poole his company sold an infant formula 
called modilac for about 10 years ending in the mid1960s it was 
discontinued because it was too costly to make and sell at a 
competitive price 
he said gerber had also made a special formula for infants who 
could not tolerate milk but discontinued it about three years ago 
bristolmyers spokesman dave dubber said his company approached 
gerber about marketing a new line of formula 
gerber has a food reputation in this market we feel they have 
a chance to strengthen our position in the market he said 
he said the gerber product also will give bristolmyers another 
outlet for formula bristolmyers sells its infant formula through 
pediatricians while gerber baby formula will be sold in stores 
infant formula makers have generally avoided marketing directly 
to parents but last year carnation co came out with two formula 
products good start and good nature that were initially promoted 
directly to parents 
the company has quit marketing good start to parents reportedly 
under pressure from pediatricians and the food and drug 
administration but still markets good nature formula for older 
babies to parents 
sanders of the pediatricians group said he cannot help but 
wonder if there is a subliminal message here that says if you choose 
not to breast feed here is an alternative just as good 
tim atwater a spokesman for the minneapolisbased advocacy group 
action for corporate accountability said gerber has a builtin 
conflict by advocating breast feeding while selling a substitute 
they will only make money when moms choose not to breast 
feed he said

the administration is hailing the house version 
of savings and loan bailout legislation as a major victory for 
taxpayers after the resounding defeat of an attempt to weaken 
president bushs key reform proposal 
shortly before 11 pm thursday the house capped a 13hour 
session by voting 32097 to solve the worst financial crisis since 
the depression with the most expensive government bailout in 
history it will cost according to the congressional general 
accounting office 285 billion over 30 years 157 billion of that 
from taxpayers 
the legislation also includes a series of what bush has labeled 
never again provisions in what the president identified as the 
heart of his proposal it requires sampl owners to risk more of their 
own money in a capital cushion between sampl losses and the government 
deposit insurance fund 
the american taxpayers won a major victory today when the house 
of representatives voted for strong tangible capital requirements 
for the nations savings and loans treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady said in a statement 
we applaud the house leadership for moving this bill rapidly 
through the house said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the house action paves the way for a conference early next month 
with the senate which passed its sampl bill in april and for final 
enactment before congress goes on vacation in august 
the sharpest conflict between the two chambers will likely be on 
their funding plans the senate would allow bush to keep some sampl 
spending out of the budget deficit through a plan to sell bonds 
through a new quasiprivate agency but the democraticdominated 
house would swell the deficit by 44 billion increasing pressure on 
the administration to agree to a tax increase in a bid to cut 
longterm interest costs 
on capital the house would require sampl owners to risk 3 in 
real money capital for every 100 in lending while the senate 
standard is 150 
despite heavy industry lobbying the house on a 32694 vote 
rejected an amendment offered by rep henry j hyde rill which 
would have given 241 sampls a chance through an administrative 
appeal to win exemption from new capital requirements 
hyde was arguing on behalf of institutions currently benefiting 
from an accounting break known as supervisory good will 
regulators granted the 197 billion break to institutions many of 
them in illinois that took ailing institutions off the governments 
hands in the early 1980s supervisory good will allows many of them 
to operate without risking any of their owners money 
hyde said the government should keep its word but his critics 
said the policy change was warranted because of the huge bill to 
taxpayers 
earlier this week hyde appeared to have a good chance of 
success but thursday morning bush threatened to veto the bill if 
house members adopted the amendment 
there should be no mistake this matter goes to the very heart 
of my determination to clean up the abuses of the past among the 
savings and loans about which every voter is entitled to be 
outraged the president wrote 
both house and senate versions of the sampl bill reorganize the 
bureaucracy to give the administration greater control over sampl 
regulators and they provide more money the house 75 million 
and the senate 50 million to detect and prosecute fraud in 
financial institutions 
among the other differences between the two chambers 
the house unlike the senate requires the industryowned 
federal home loan banks to spend 75 million a year rising to 150 
million by 1995 to subsidize housing for the poor it barely 
defeated by a 208204 vote an attempt by rep steve bartlett 
rtexas to delete the subsidy program which was written by rep 
henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking committee 
by a 214200 vote the house also adopted antidiscrimination 
provisions sponsored by rep joseph kennedy dmass and gonzalez 
forcing banks and thrifts to disclose their record of serving the 
poor minorities and women 
the senate permits sampls to hold 11 percent of their assets in 
highyield highrisk debt instruments known as junk bonds more for 
statechartered sampls if they raise extra capital however the house 
voted 303114 to adopt an amendment by rep byron l dorgan dnd 
banning thrifts from holding junk bonds and giving those that 
already own the bonds two years to sell them

gd searle amp co has agreed to settle the 
claims and lawsuits of more than 100 people linked to its copper7 
contraceptive device but a spokeswoman said about 350 other cases 
still are pending in courts 
the agreement which requires approval from the affected clients 
of the minneapolis law firm of robins kaplan miller and ciresi 
bars disclosure of any details said searle spokeswoman kay bruno 
the settlement also bars the parties from disclosing how many 
individuals were covered by the settlement although the law firm 
previously said it represented more than 100 people 
even so ms bruno said the settlement leaves about 350 other 
copper7 lawsuits in state and federal courts 
at last count 330 cases involving the copper7 had been 
disposed of in our favor of the 19 that went to trial we won 15 
and lost four said ms bruno 
two of those are pending appeal and of the two completed we 
have paid a total of about 300000 she added 
ms bruno confirmed the june 9 agreement in response to questions 
from reporters she also said the settlement does not have a 
materially adverse effect on the financial positions of searle or 
its parent monsanto corp 
women who have brought lawsuits against the skokiebased 
pharmaceutical concern contend the copper7 once one of the 
nations most widely prescribed intrauterine devices caused pelvic 
inflammations ectopic pregnancies or perforation of the uterus and 
could result in infertility 
a baltimore lawyer whose firm is representing clients in 40 
lawsuits and evaluating the claims of several hundred more called 
the settlement a hopeful sign 
i couldnt estimate what the settlement may have been worth my 
guess is that like our firm robins kaplan miller had one group 
of cases pending in court and a second group whose cases were being 
investigated for possible lawsuits attorney h robert erwin jr 
said from baltimore 
typically iud cases can range from 10000 if the causation is 
weak and the injury nominal to 250000 or more if you have a young 
married couple rendered childless due to an infection from an iud 
searle pulled the product from the market along with a second 
iud in january 1986 citing the high costs stemming from hundreds 
of lawsuits the company has maintained in court documents the 
product cannot cause the various injuries plaintiffs claim 
esther kociemba represented by the minneapolis firm was awarded 
8 million last year by a jury in st paul minn it could not be 
determined whether that case was part of the settlement 
michael ciresi who has been the firms lead attorney in copper7 
cases did not return messages left with his office

a new magazine devoted to the pros and cons of 
biodegradable diapers and other ways of dealing with debris promises 
to do more than just talk trash 
if you say what garbage youre not a likely reader of 
garbage 
but the publishers of this new magazine say the throwaway 
society has gone beyond the concern of the counterculture to 
become a mainstream issue 
i think we all feel vaguely uneasy and vaguely guilty when you 
bring the groceries home and realize that 60 percent of what youve 
bought is packaging said editorpublisher patricia poore 
formally known as garbage the practical journal for the 
environment it will start publishing in august ms poore 33 
said it will have a proenvironment tilt but she promises to be 
evenhanded 
you have to be proenvironment if you want any quality of life 
and possibly if you want any life at all she said but her 
magazine will also print the downside to proposed solutions to 
environmental problems 
when an environmentally sound way of doing things turns out to be 
more costly especially for the poor garbage will so report said 
ms poore there often is no easy solution she said 
the first question the magazine had to confront was whether it 
should be printed on recycled paper the answer may seem obvious 
ms poore said but it was not 
the editor in me wanted recycled paper she said the 
publisher in me didnt 
recycled paper looks like whole wheat she said this was 
the publisher speaking it has gooky things in it they say it 
will break on the press 
the publisher in me said there was nothing wrong with premium 
paper and the printer told us they would charge 30 percent more to 
print it on recycled paper 
but the art director and the managing editor marched in and said 
ms poore would be a hypocrite if she printed garbage on virgin 
paper the printer in environmentally conscious burlington vt 
relented and promised to charge nothing extra for the first three 
issues and see how things come out 
research located a recycled paper that is very white and film 
coated and is easily recyclable itself ms poore said so the 
environment and the editor won the battle for the moment 
ms poore owns the oldhouse journal which like garbage is 
based in brooklyn ny the oldhouse journal was a neighborhood 
paper for owners of brownstones in brooklyn when she bought it 11 
years ago just as the preservation movement was catching on it now 
has a circulation approaching 165000 
garbage she said will be the only environmental magazine that 
is not issued by activists and therefore free to have a sense of 
humor 
if youre the sierra club youve got to take a worstcase view 
and a sense of humor is a dangerous thing to have she said 
the pros and cons of biodegradable diapers will be examined in 
the first issue 
pro they selfdestruct 
con they introduce human waste into landfills and possibly water 
tables 
the magazines conclusion cloth diapers are better from the 
environments point of view 
in a solicitation for subscriptions that was mailed to 700000 
homes a week ago printed on recycled paper too ms poore 
explains the choice of the magazines name 
here we were planning a new environmental journal but my 
staff and i found ourselves referring to it as the garbage 
magazine it dawned on us that that was the right name it 
doesnt beat around the bush but goes right to the heart of the 
problem our throwaway society

fathers who take time off for the birth of a 
baby will become the majority in the coming decade says a new study 
that finds dads joining moms in the struggle to cope with work and 
family responsibilities 
balancing work and family responsibilities is becoming a total 
work force issue not just a womens issue reports sandra burud 
of burud amp associates in pasadena calif in the analysis the 
1990s father balancing work amp family concerns 
we tend to think working moms have a monopoly on guilt but 
its not true added james levine of bank street college of 
education in new york 
while fathers continue to face traditional pressure to do well at 
work they also want to spend more time with their children 
reported levine 
he and burud were among several researchers included in the study 
compiled by the bureau of national affairs an independent 
washington research group 
men are feeling that theyre repeating the same pattern of 
their own fathers not being around enough noted levine in the 
analysis issued to coincide with fathers day 
a generation ago it would not have occurred to most new fathers 
to take time off for the birth of a child an increasingly common 
practice today said barney olmstead codirector of new ways to 
work in san francisco 
joseph pleck of wheaton college in norton mass predicts that 
fathers taking time off for the birth of a child will become 
increasingly commonplace 
in the 1990s he said it will become the dominant pattern for 
fathers to take one or two weeks off and that the proportion of 
fathers who take longer periods of time will grow 
men are spending more time with their kids and men and women 
are sharing the time theyre staying home with sick children 
reported carol ann rudolph of child care management resources in 
bethesda md but when childcare arrangements break down it 
still is the woman who misses work more often than the man 
fran rodgers of workfamily directions reported that many men are 
beginning to seek a balance between work and family they dont 
want to work overtime they dont want to relocate and they dont 
want their performance measured in terms of hours put in on the 
job 
the intensity of feelings is greater for women but theyre 
there for both she said 
while socalled familyfriendly company policies have largely 
concentrated on women more and more they will need to consider 
males also according to the study 
fathers still define themselves primarily in the family as the 
provider observed stephen segal of the philadelphia firm family 
partners but he added they also are increasingly wanting to be 
with their children 
fathers are connecting with their kids their young kids in a 
stronger way and there are expectations for them to connect in a 
stronger way than their fathers had and that sets up the conflicts 
for the father as he moves through his career segal said 
but he added its not altogether socially acceptable for men 
to stay home when their kids are sick and such 
some companies are in the early stages of developing ways to aid 
working fathers commented levine who operates the fatherhood 
project at bank street college 
the bna study said that where childcare facilities are provided 
fathers are increasingly likely to use the facilities and 
increasingly often are the ones taking children to medical 
appointments and for other obligations 
yet said patricia d hawkins of the us department of health 
and human services these are relatively rare occasions you

for the first time since president bush was 
elected on a notaxincrease pledge a congressional subcommittee 
has voted to raise taxes 
the house ways and means subcommittee on human resources is 
calling for a boost in the tax that employers pay for federal 
unemployment benefits which would bring in an estimated 106 
billion over the next five years when fully in effect in 1992 it 
would cost employers an additional 4 a year for each employee 
the increase would finance improvements in jobless benefits and 
higher spending for child care and welfare it would also leave 161 
million next year and 17 billion over five years toward reducing 
the budget deficit 
the package was approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote over 
republican opposition it now goes to the full committee 
before the vote kenneth w gideon assistant treasury secretary 
for tax policy said the administration is strongly opposed in the 
first place he said the unemployment fund does not need more money 
a statement that was challenged by democrats on the panel 
second gideon wrote increasing the amount of wages 
subject to federal unemployment tax is a tax increase and is opposed 
by this administration 
bush was elected after a campaign in which his opposition to a 
tax increase was repeated several times a day he also has predicted 
that if taxes were raised congress would spend the money rather 
than cut the deficit 
its basically a 10 billion tax increase and a wish list 
of social spending rep hank brown rcolo a member of the 
subcommittee said of the bill many of the proposals have merit 
but i dont think we have the money 
he predicted the tax increase will make it far more difficult for 
the ways and means committee to meet its deficitreduction goal 
present law requires employers to pay a tax of 08 percent of the 
first 7000 earned annually by each employee a maximum of 56 per 
worker the rate is due to drop to 06 percent in 1991 
the subcommittees bill would raise the taxable wage to 8000 in 
1990 9000 in 1991 and 10000 in 1992 thus the employers 
maximum tax per employee would rise to 60 
rep thomas downey dny chairman of the subcommittee 
rejected the administrations argument that the trust funds from 
which unemployment compensation are paid need no extra money 
these accounts currently do not have enough funds on reserve to 
cover increased outlays if a recession occurs in the next few 
years downey wrote in presenting his recommendation to the 
subcommittee he noted the administrations estimates are based on 
economic assumptions that many economists say are too rosy 
even with the administrations optimistic assumptions over the 
next five years the administration has projected that the loan 
account which helps states replenish their jobless benefits will 
not have enough reserves by the end of 1994 when its shortfall will 
be 35 billion downey said 
gideon also opposed the tax increase on grounds that because of 
the way the unemploymentbenefits system is structured raising the 
federal tax would automatically increase employers state taxes 
among the spending improvements voted by the subcommittee were a 
177 billion increase in federal grants to states for such social 
services as meals on wheels and childcare services a boost in 
supplemental security income a welfare program for elderly and 
disabled of 2 a month for individuals to 370 and 3 a month for 
couples to 553 and making it easier for states to trigger 
payment of extended unemployment benefits for the longterm jobless

the transportation department is taking the 
first step toward nationwide random alcohol testing of airline 
pilots train engineers ships officers pipeline workers and bus 
and truck drivers 
transportation secretary samuel skinner told congress on thursday 
he had asked department lawyers to examine rulemaking that would 
expand the departments random drugtesting program to include 
alcohol rules on drug testing of 4 million transportation workers 
take effect at the end of the year 
skinner said alcohol testing raises complex issues and should not 
begin hastily as proposed in a house bill requiring random testing 
for both drugs and alcohol among railroad workers skinner said he 
would recommend that president bush veto that bill if adopted 
because it would require the department to start over with its 
testing program 
skinner testified at a hearing of the senate commerce science 
and transportation committee which is considering its own version of 
mandatory drug and alcohol testing for transportation workers 
the transportation department last november ordered drug testing 
programs in private transportation industries but the programs face 
several court challenges and the congressional bills would give 
testing the force of law 
the supreme court has approved some drug testing but has yet to 
rule on random testing 
at the hearing the proposed senate bill brought general support 
from transportation industry representatives and strong objections 
from groups representing the employees who would be tested the bill 
is nearly identical to measures passed by the senate but not the 
house in both 1987 and 1988 
i have decided that we must step forward and address the issue 
of alcohol misuse in transportation now skinner told the 
committee 
he noted that a coast guard program of mandatory postaccident 
alcohol testing for the maritime industry begins in december but 
said more thought is needed before extending the testing to other 
modes of transportation he noted that alcohol is legal while the 
drug testing covers illegal substances 
skinner said the house version of the antidrug bill would 
mandate random alcohol test rules just 90 days after enactment of 
the bill i look to the long term and i know that to develop a 
program that will achieve its objective and withstand legal 
challenge requires more care and consideration he said 
committee chairman ernest f hollings dsc said alcohol and 
drug use by transportation workers cannot be ignored he said 
railroad accidents linked to drug or alcohol occurred once every 12 
days last year 
call it intimidation call it whatever you will hollings 
said but the fact is that random testing is the only method we 
have to reasonably ensure that transportation employees will not use 
drugs on the job 
rep thomas luken dohio sponsor of the house drug bill said 
the bill requiring random testing of railroad workers has bipartisan 
support he accused skinner of wanting antidrug measures left to 
the whims of the transportation secretary 
richard b stone of the air line pilots association said errors 
in testing could result in the loss of 200 pilots 
stone said no crash of a scheduled airliner has been linked to 
alcohol abuse the national transportation safety board blamed a 
january 1988 colorado crash on cocaine use by the pilot but stone 
said other possible causes of that crash were not adequately 
investigated 
stone said random testing would cost the industry millions of 
dollars but would not produce much 
michael oconnell lawyer for a national association of 
owneroperated trucks said millions of innocent drivers will be 
victimized by random tests 
oconnell introduced sandy craig of anderson ind who owns and 
drives a single truck with her husband as an example of a driver 
who would have to give random urine samples 
mrs craig interviewed after the hearing said she opposes 
roadside random testing because it would delay her trips and i 
think the procedure proposed is humiliating

researchers at britains atomic energy authority 
say they were unable to reproduce cold fusion something two 
university of utah scientists earlier this year claimed to have 
achieved 
after spending 480000 over three months trying to repeat the 
experiment the scientists at the british atomic energy authoritys 
harwell laboratory near oxford said thursday they failed 
not every mad idea works out saidteam leader david williams 
who nonetheless spoke admiringly of the previous work by the two 
scientists 
but one of the two martin fleischmann of southampton university 
stood by his findings 
he told press association britains domestic news agency we 
cannot find any flaw in our technique and we are very happy with 
the work we have done so far 
fleischmann and stanley pons of the university of utah said on 
march 23 they had generated energy with palladium and platinum 
electrodes dipped in a beaker of heavy water at room temperature 
heavy water is made of oxygen and deuterium a form of hydrogen 
with a neutron in the nucleus 
in fusion tremendous amounts of energy are released when the 
nucleus or core of one hydrogen atom fuses with the nucleus of 
another hydrogen atom 
in contrast nuclear power plants generate energy from fission 
which is the splitting of atoms 
nuclear fusion is the energy source of the sun and thousands of 
researchers have been trying to achieve it for 20 years 
reporting on his teams results williams said it was unable to 
detect a single neutron the key sign indicating a fusion process is 
occurring it also found no heat produced 
williams told the british broadcasting corp weve used three 
different types of heatflow instrument weve used all sorts of 
different types of neutron counters weve used them upside down 
inside out changed the solution weve checked weve calibrated 
everything 
were very disappointed this would have been a very 
significant discovery he said

the agriculture department has a new list of 
experts who can help new and veteran smallscale farmers find just 
the right information about raising game birds exotic herbs and 
hundreds of other specialties 
its a 109page softcover book the directory for smallscale 
agriculture which its chief promoter says will be a handy tool 
for anyone seeking to establish a small farm or improve the 
operation of an existing acreage 
howard w bud kerr jr director of the departments office for 
smallscale agriculture said thursday that the publication is not 
only for those who have the acreage but for those who are 
contemplating getting into the ownership of a small parcel of 
ground 
kerr added in an interview they have dreams they have 
visions they dont know how to network how to reach the right 
source of information 
the book tells how to trace subject matter to hundreds of sources 
listed alphabetically with addresses telephone numbers and 
specialties kerr said a user with questions can go to the horses 
mouth for an answer 
for example someone in georgia or elsewhere for that matter 
might want to know about shortstake tomatoes peppers and cole 
crops theres an address and phone number for an expert at the 
university of georgia 
what about greenhouse production of european cucumbers or 
perhaps khigh bush and rabbit eye blueberries theres a listing for 
someone at usdas south central family farm research center 
booneville ark 
the latest in research on fresh market vegetables in new 
hampshire plant scientists at the university of new hampshire 
durham will be able to help 
and if a virginia broccoli growers has problems with club root 
disease perhaps a call to virginia polytechnic institute and state 
university blacksburg could help 
kerr said the directory is a pioneer effort for his office which 
is part of the departments cooperative state research service an 
agency that has close working ties with landgrant and other state 
institutions 
in a statement included in the directory kerr said the intent is 
to link the vast network of people in the vast federal and state 
systems with others who work the nations small farms 
seven out of every 10 family farms in america are smallscale 
farms grossing 40000 a year or less he said apart from 
production these smallscale farms also contribute to the 
preservation of the environment the stability of the community 
structure which maintains a varied landscape for people to live and 
the supply of agricultural materials for food and industrial 
purposes 
kerr said the book can be ordered from superintendent of 
documents government printing office north capitol street nw 
washington dc 20402 refer to stock number 00100004539 or 
telephone 202 7833238 the cost is 550 per volume foreign orders

agriculture department economists are 
forecasting a significant rise this summer in broiler production 
over all of 1989 broiler output is expected to rise 5 percent 
from last year when production was up 4 percent from 1987 
however the departments economic research service said broiler 
production in the first quarter of this year rose only 3 percent 
compared with a 7 percent gain during january february and march of 
1988 
thus the agency said in the june issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine broiler output in the second quarter probably will be up 4 
percent from a year earlier while thirdquarter production may gain 
7 percent 
analysts said the production increase is being fed by high 
prices and lower feed costs and that net returns to broiler 
producers have been on the plus side for a year 
broiler wholesale prices based on a composite city market 
averaged almost 64 cents per pound in april well above the 49 cents 
of a year earlier the report said the average in the first three 
months was 59 cents 
with higher summer demand for broilers and tighter secondhalf 
beef supplies wholesale prices may average 68 to 70 cents for the 
second quarter and 65 to 71 cents for the third the report said

mazda motor corps new twoseat 
convertible is being billed as a sports car for the masses 
the japanese automaker introduced the car thursday saying its 
base price of 13800 leaves it alone in a segment of the market 
that had been populated by the pontiac fiero and other cars not so 
long ago 
mazda is counting on consumers to make the distinction between a 
sports car which its new miata mx5 is and a sporty car like 
the rx7 or nissans 300zx or 200sx 
its our belief that many of those sportycar buyers would like 
a sports car said george mccabe vice president for sales of 
mazda motor of america inc its a sports car for the masses 
prices for sporty cars have been pushed into the 20000 
range because of currency exchange rates and the addition of an 
array of electronic gadgetry leaving a gap in the market at the 
lower end 
options on the miata could push it into the 16000 range 
officials said 
mazda began fullscale development of a twoseat car without a 
lot of the electronic additions on the moreexpensive models in 
1986 development costs were held to a modest 100 million because 
it shares some features with the mazda 323 
mazda plans limited production of the car the company expects to 
sell about 20000 during the last half of this year and twice that 
many during 1990 the assembly plant in japan has a 
60000carayear capacity 
for now the car is being marketed only in the united states 
with distribution in japan and europe possible next year officials 
said 
the rearwheeldrive car carries a 116horsepower fourcylinder 
16liter engine and that could pose a problem with insurance 
companies officials said 
its true that insurance has really impacted the sports car 
category in the last couple of years mccabe said at a news 
conference we dont expect the insurance companies will view the 
miata in a negative light

the united auto workers will gather for their 
triennial constitutional convention just down the street from 
disneyland next week but the atmosphere inside the convention 
center may rife with hard feelings 
underneath the speeches political wrangling and hoopla in 
anaheim calif will be rumblings of dissent 
union president owen bieber the administration caucus he runs 
and the unions increasingly cooperative attitude toward management 
have been sharply criticized by the new directions movement 
spearheaded by jerry tucker of st louis mo and don douglas of 
detroit 
while the two are seeking seats as regional directors they may 
be darkhorse candidates in local delegate elections new 
directions candidates in tuckers and douglass regions came up 
short 
nevertheless tucker who goes into the convention as director of 
one of the uaws largest regions in a position he won through a 
federally supervised election last year has said the new directions 
movement has widespread support and that could show up in reports 
from the conventions credentials and resolutions committees 
the credentials committee certifies the seating of delegates 
its possible that challenges could by mounted by new directions 
forces which have contended that some delegate elections were won 
by administration caucus supporters through questionable and in 
some cases illegal means 
tucker has asked the unions hierarchy to review some of the 
elections and has hinted that lawsuits could be filed over local 
delegate elections after all tucker has said in the past thats 
how he was elected director of uaw region 5 in the first place 
new directions supporters also may show up around the middle of 
the weeklong convention if a resolution surfaces that would seek 
delegate endorsement of more uaw representation on automakers 
boards of directors 
bieber sits on the board of chrysler corp a position granted 
during the early 1980s when the uaw signed concession contracts with 
the nations no 3 automaker the detroit news reported thursday 
that the resolution also would support increased union cooperation 
with management 
both of the issues are at the core of new directions arguments 
with bieber and the administration caucus 
despite potential challenges bieber is virtually assured of 
election to a third threeyear term at the head of the huge union 
which during his administration has looked outside the auto industry 
for members 
joining the traditional delegates from auto factory shop floors 
will be representatives of michigan state workers clerical workers 
from new england colleges and jai alai players 
among those addressing the convention are newly elected house 
majority leader richard gephardt senate majority leader george

du pont co has developed a new version 
of its familiar teflon frypan coating for computers fiber optics 
and other high technology uses 
teflon af is a descendent of the nonstick substance that was 
discovered 51 years ago specialty business director david c 
sanders said thursday 
the af stands for amorphous fluoropolymers the chemical compound 
that is credited with making the new product an improvement over the 
stuff that is best known for keeping food from sticking to pots and 
pans 
this product is a quantum leap forward in polymer technology 
it is designed specifically for advanced high technology 
applications and can be tailored for many high performance uses 
said thomas r darling du pont venture manager for teflon af 
with performance characteristics that far exceed ordinary teflon 
the new product is expected to meet design engineers material needs 
in a variety of high technology areas including highspeed computer 
circuitry the company said in a statement 
du pont has targeted several markets for the new product 
including aerospace automotive aircraft biomedical specialized 
chemical handling and possible petroleum exploration darling said 
we view this as a complimentary addition to the teflon product 
line its not likely it will compete with markets teflon now 
serves it will open up new markets for this particular type of 
teflon and it tends to be in areas of fairly high technology 
darling said 
he said the new teflon is soluble unlike the original solid 
version it has electrical properties that are expected to be ideal 
for highspeed advanced generation computers and other high 
technology needs of the 21st century 
the company said the new product can also function in severe 
temperatures and can be used in such chemical applications as 
semiconductor processing 
darling said more uses for the new product are sure to be 
discovered over the years 
i do expect this will have a long and healthy life it has 
performance features new to the teflon current family and over the 
long term we will continue to find uses for it as they have for 
the older version darling said du pont technology can help 
customize and tailor the material to meet specific and as yet 
unknown needs 
the company has built a teflon af plant in fayetteville nc 
which is expected to begin operations at the end of july or in early 
august darling said 
the original teflon was discovered accidentally april 6 1938 by 
a young chemist named roy j plunkett 
in addition to cookware it coats chemical tanks jogging suits 
and lightbulbs 
its greatest commercial use is in wire coating followed by 
gaskets and shaft seals and pipe and tank coatings

goldome today rescinded its policy of 
requiring laidoff workers to sign an agreement promising not to 
talk to the media about losing their jobs in order to receive full 
severance pay 
the policy had embittered current and former employees who felt 
the company was threatening laidoff workers 
goldome chief executive officer thomas cooper said our 
intention to help assure the confidentiality of employee customer 
and corporate information has been submerged by misperceptions 
of the agreement this makes its continued use counterproductive 
as many as 150 people had been terminated in recent weeks and 
asked to sign the release and confidentiality agreement which 
prevented them from suing goldome or discussing their layoff with 
anyone except counsel personal tax adviser immediate family or 
as required by law 
if laidoff employees refused to sign their severance benefits 
would have been cut to two weeks pay from a maximum of six 
sources within the company said management thought news of 
goldomes layoffs could cause customers to withdraw money from the 
bank 
although many companies require new employees to sign 
confidentiality agreements it is highly unusual for a company to 
require terminated employees to sign such an agreement as a 
condition of receiving severance pay 
its not illegal but i wouldnt consider it morally right 
said an analyst with mercer meidinger and hansen a leading human 
resources consulting firm in washington 
nearly all of goldomes laidoff workers signed the agreement 
sources said 
the confidentiality requirement came after the company reduced 
its severance policy may 1 companies are not required by law to 
provide any severance pay but most offer it as part of a benefits 
package to attract qualified employees and as a humanitarian gesture 
goldome which lost 119 million last year is in the middle of a 
restructuring effort

chicag0 ap krafts efforts to appease winners in its botched 
ready to roll game arent winning over everybody 
i dont mean to sound greedy but the settlement offer is kind 
of skimpy and its a far cry from what was being offered says 
larry bernstein who matched game pieces for a 17000 van 
bernstein was one of an estimated several hundred people who 
matched game pieces for a dodge caravan in a contest designed to 
have only one van winner kraft on thursday offered those winners 
250 and a special drawing for four vans 
im not really too pleased he said youre talking 17000 
versus 250 i suspect lots of people will want to go ahead with the 
lawsuits 
at least three classaction lawsuits have been filed against the 
company 
the suburban chicagobased company known formally as kraft 
general foods group of philip morris cos also offered to make up 
for the mistake by quadrupling the number of prizes and giving away 
cash to all winners 
kraft told the suntimes the mistake was made by the unidentified 
companies that prepared the game not kraft 
there was a mistake obviously but it was clearly 
unintentional said mitch weinick president of refrigerated 
products for kraft usa because our customers are so goodnatured 
and goodhumored were trying to do right by them 
the promotion was run only in the chicago and houston 
metropolitan areas the contest required consumers to match left 
halves of a pictured van contained in specially marked packages of 
kraft singles cheese with right halves appearing in coupons in 
sunday newspaper advertisements 
bernstein wasnt the only one balking at the deal 
i look at it this way said sharon lamont who also had 
matched game pieces for a van if they had cheese on sale for 
139 and i offered to buy it for 14 cents do you think theyd let 
me have it 
the skokie resident joined one of the classaction lawsuits 
we have five secretaries just taking the calls said attorney 
burton weinstein who filed a lawsuit he said his firm is 
representing at least 300 people 
diana redmond a rockford resident who hasnt decided whether to 
join the lawsuit said a drawing that included everyone who matched 
game pieces for the van wouldnt be fair 
im one of the people who followed instructions specifically 
and put the entry in the mail on monday i feel i should have a 
little better chance 
instead she said theyre giving a lot of 
johnnycomelatelies the people who started scrounging through 
their garbage after they read about this the same chance as me to 
win 
in separate negotiations with illinois and texas officials kraft 
entered into voluntary compliance agreements that in effect free 
the company from charges of violating consumer laws in its ready 
to roll game under the agreements kraft is voluntarily offering 
the extra contest payments and holding the alternative drawing 
investigators have found no ground to suggest that there was 
any effort to deceive or otherwise violate any consumer protection 
law said illinois attorney general neil hartigan 
kraft said virtually every package of cheese contained a game 
piece that matched the pieces found in sunday newspaper inserts 
after hundreds of people called sunday night to claim theyd won 
the grand prize kraft declared the contest null and void the 
company also pulled packages of the cheese slices from grocery store 
shelves 
kraft spokesman mike caruso said the companys attorneys believe 
its not liable for the prizes because of the nature of the 
mistake it was appropriately revoked 
in addition to the van kraft had planned to award 100 bicycles 
500 skateboards and 8000 packages of cheese 
the company said in addition to the 250 cash prizes for those 
who matched game pieces for the van it would award 50 to bicycle 
winners 25 to skateboard winners and 5 to cheese winners the 
drawing for the vans was set for july 14 
only one winner will be allowed per household the deadline for 
submitting winning entries is midnight friday

chinas credit ratings are at risk due to its 
political upheaval and the nation may face increased difficulty 
raising money in world financial markets for economic development 
projects experts say 
moodys investors service recently put its ratings of chinese 
bonds on review for a possible downgrade japans creditrating 
agencies also said they are reexamining their assessment of chinas 
debt 
should the creditrating companies lower their ratings china may 
have to pay a higher interest rate on future bond issues 
the price of existing chinese bonds has plunged on european 
markets in reaction to the governments crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators china has more than 1 billion worth of bonds in 
circulation on the euromarkets 
in addition the turmoil has delayed a new 100 million bond 
offering in japan by one of chinas provincial development 
corporations stalled a 120 billion japanese bank loan to a chinese 
petrochemical company and held up a 60 billion agricultural loan 
from the world bank 
analysts say its too soon to say what lasting impact the 
upheaval may have on chinas ability to borrow overseas from 
commerical and governmental sources but many believe damage has 
been done no matter what the outcome of the nations power struggle 
its already going to be marginally more expensive for china 
to borrow but the question is how much higher said rick 
harbaugh an analyst for the wefa group a financial forecasting 
firm 
harbaugh said he believes china increasingly will rely on its 19 
billion in foreign reserves this year for funding instead of foreign 
debt these reserves consist of convertible currencies such as 
dollars pounds and yen held by the chinese central bank 
wefa recently released a grim forecast for chinas economy for 
the rest of the year it said production of goods has faltered and 
the confidence of foreigners who invest in china has been shaken 
chinas reliance on foreign finance has grown as its freemarket 
economic system has expanded the nation has about 40 billion in 
outside credit from all sources according to moodys and wefa 
of that about 12 billion is government debt either in direct 
loans from other nations or from governmental bodies such as the 
world bank said stephen taran moodys china analyst 
the rest about 28 billion is commercial debt he said this 
includes about 6 billion in bonds with the remainder in bank loans 
and credits from foreign companies that sell goods to china on 
credit 
china has floated most of its bonds on asian exchanges no bonds 
have been sold in the united states 
moodys has given the chinese bonds it rates a rank of a3 which 
it considers a middlehigh rating on its scale of aaa to c 
when moodys originally rated the bonds we made some 
judgements about the possible range of political instability that 
might take place in china said david levey another moodys 
analyst 
under the reevaluation he said the company will look again at 
all the factors that it took into account for the original rating to 
see what has changed 
among these factors is chinas economy and whether the chinese 
government has lost some element of its longterm support among the 
population he said but undertaking the reevaluation wont be 
easy he said 
lots of things we would like to know are shrouded in secrecy 
and obscurity he said 
another bondrating service standard amp poors corp hasnt 
formally rated chinas debt but it said in a statement last week 
that despite the recent turmoil it considers chinas ability to 
meet debt obligations on time as satisfactory but vulnerable to 
adverse developments 
chinas strong export growth balanced current account modest 
external debt burden and large international reserves continue to 
provide ample ability to service foreign debt sampp said 
no matter what the outcome of the review of chinas debt an 
executive at a major wall street investment house said her company 
hasnt put much faith in the ratings 
we think the ratings do not take sufficient account of the 
political risk in china and we think events bore us out she 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
harbaugh the wefa analyst also advised traders in chinese bonds 
to be cautious i think they should certainly be skeptical but i 
think probably things will work out he said

troubled coleco industries inc has agreed 
to sell most of its assets to hasbro inc for 85 million in cash a 
deal analysts said means the demise of the toymaker that introduced 
the hottestselling toy in us history the cabbage patch doll 
coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take 
risks said paul valentine a toy analyst with new yorkbased 
standard amp poors corp the industry is poorer because of their 
demise 
under the agreement announced thursday avonbased coleco now 
operating under bankruptcy court protection also will receive 
warrants to purchase 1 million shares of hasbro stock 
pawtucket ribased hasbro the largest us toymaker will 
receive colecos product line which includes the scrabble and 
parcheesi board games as well as the cabbage patch dolls coleco 
chairman morton handel said 
in addition to buying inventory and the equipment to make the 
products hasbro will buy certain accounts receivable handel said 
coleco will retain all of its cash assets and certain real estate 
that it will convert to cash handel said at the completion of the 
transaction coleco will have as much as 150 million in cash the 
85 million from hasbro and about 65 million coleco had in the 
banks in midmarch handel said 
the cash will be used to pay off the companys debt he said 
when coleco filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago it listed 
debt of 5403 million 
the agreement still must be approved by the bankruptcy court 
handel said the deal is also subject to the approval of original 
appalachian artworks inc creator of cabbage patch kids and coleco 
directors 
if the deal is approved most of colecos remaining 250 employees 
are expected to be laid off although some may be hired by hasbro 
handel said 
coleco was pretty much the victim of its own success said 
david leibowitz senior vice president of new yorkbased american 
securities corp cabbage patch in 1985 was the largest single 
selling toy of all time selling 600 millionplus at wholesale 
the success of the homely cabbage patch dolls forced coleco to 
expand borrowing money to do so he said when cabbage patch kids 
sales tumbled and new products including the adam home computer 
and toys based on rambo movies did not sell the company could not 
pay off the new debts he said 
valentine said arnold greenberg the former coleco chairman 
managed the company too aggressively without focusing on cost 
controls 
they managed their company for a sales revival that never 
came valentine said but he added it was greenberg who 
transformed coleco into a major company 
greenbergs russian immigrant father maurice greenberg founded 
the company as the connecticut leather co in hartford in 1932 
selling leather and shoe heels and soles the company expanded into 
toys in 1954 
arnold greenberg joined coleco full time in 1966 he bought the 
license to the cabbage patch kids in 1982 after several major toy 
companies turned down the dolls which were designed with their own 
set of adoption papers 
for growing hasbro which in the last decade has bought such 
bigname toymakers as milton bradley co and introduced a steady 
stream of new products the deal means yet another line of toys 
hasbro which makes gi joe mr potato head my little pony and 
the transformers had sales of 134 billion last year up from just 
1043 million in 1980 
under hasbro i think cabbage patch will grow substantially 
over the next few years valentine said even barbie has her ups 
and downs the cabbage patch kids wont wilt forever

the eamp j gallo winery responding to 
activists demands says it will pull two brands of highalcohol 
wine from store shelves in the citys seedy tenderloin neighborhood 
in a sixmonth experiment 
the modestobased gallo the worlds largest winery said if the 
removal of the offending wines succeeds in reducing alcoholism in 
the area the company will pull its thunderbird and night train 
express brands in other neighborhoods 
the company has never removed a product from the shelves before 
said gallo spokesman dan solomon 
the action came wednesday after tenderloin area distributor 
gallobay cities a galloowned business met with a group called 
safe and sober streets which recently kicked off a public protest 
of highalcohol brands in their district canandaiguas wild irish 
rose was also singled out as well as the two gallo brands 
the protesters said they couldnt walk the streets of the 
tenderloin without tripping over or being menaced by apparent 
alcoholics 
gallo a privately held company has 1 billion in annual sales 
and 28 percent of the us wine market 
the sober streets group went from store to store to ask 
proprietors to take the cheap wines off their shelves one grocer 
said he resumed selling the wine after he lost 850 in sales in a 
single day 
solomon characterized the action as an experiment by the gallo 
organization to test the premise that alcoholics deprived of their 
cheap wine will turn to other types of alcohol 
we believe and the evidence tends to support that if 
alcoholics are deprived of one source be it beer wine or cheap 
distilled spirits they will find another regardless of difficulty 
or cost he said 
if what we have done in this neighborhood improves the 
alcoholism problem in this area well do the same thing in other 
neighborhoods he said 
solomon refused to say whether he meant san francisco california 
or the entire country 
the highalcohol wines are typically made from the cheapest 
vinous ingredients with a hint of grape flavor then mixed with 
grape brandy to bring the mixture to about 18 percent alcohol by 
volume regular table wine is about 12 percent the highalcohol 
wines sell for about 90 cents to 125 a bottle or fifth of a 
gallon

dozens of workers at two rockwell 
international facilities in southern california were exposed to 
excessive levels of radiation in the 1960s federal documents show 
no overexposures were shown for subsequent years 
the documents released thursday by the department of energy 
under the freedom of information act exclude two overexposure 
incidents rockwell officials have confirmed took place in the 1970s 
and 80s 
also omitted from the records were the settlements rockwell paid 
recently in at least three workers compensation cases involving 
cancer deaths allegedly caused by radiation exposure rockwell 
didnt admit liability when it paid the settlements in 198788 
the released documents are called unusual occurrence reports the 
energy department requires contractors such as rockwell to file such 
reports after safety or equipment problems 
we fully recognize we have a very serious responsibility to the 
public and thats why we monitor our activities so closely said 
pat coulter spokesman for rockwells rocketdyne division thats 
why when there is a deviance we record it and make sure it doesnt 
happen again 
most of the unusual occurrence reports described minor equipment 
malfunctions that apparently didnt involve worker or environmental 
safety 
the two facilities one in the canoga park area and the other the 
companys santa susana field laboratory in the hills bordering los 
angeles and ventura counties have worked for more than 30 years for 
the energy and weapons programs of the energy department and its 
predecessor the atomic energy commission 
workers during several episodes between 1960 and 1967 were 
exposed to higherthanacceptable limits of rems per year at the two 
plants according to the documents allowable limits measured by 
film badges worn by workers are three rems per calendar quarter or 
five rems per year 
a report for example on a 1961 incident shows that an employee 
was assigned to work in a nuclear reactor room although his 
quarterly exposure was already near the 3 rem limit prompting his 
dose to rise to 3455 rem 
five rems is equivalent to between 100 to 200 chest xrays or 
about 50 times the natural background radiation from the sun rocks 
and soil 
experts say five rems isnt considered a high radiation dose but 
warned a worker exposed to that level for 30 years has up to three 
extra chances in 100 of dying of cancer

most employers should be required to provide 
health insurance according to polls of doctors and the public but 
a manufacturing group is worried about the cost 
the cost of health care for american business has tripled over 
the past eight years said laura brown a spokeswoman for the 
national association of manufacturers we havent seen parallel 
improvements in quality 
mandated coverage she said would only worsen an enormous 
financial drain on revenues that could otherwise go for capital 
improvements worker training and industrial technology 
a poll published in todays issue of american medical news said 
that 57 percent of the public and 34 percent of doctors questioned 
believed all employers should be required to provide 
healthinsurance coverage 
an additional 22 percent of the public and 36 percent of the 
physicians surveyed believed that coverage should be required in 
most cases but that small businesses and parttime employees should 
be exempt 
only 19 percent of the public and 27 percent of the physicians 
said the government should not mandate coverage 3 percent in both 
surveys were undecided the report said 
the gallup organization conducted the polls for the american 
medical association whose house of delegates meets here for its 
annual policy meeting next week 
the polls did not specify whether employers would pay the full 
cost 
more than 35 million americans lack health insurance according 
to some estimates and ama trustees in march said the government 
should require that all employers gradually provide health insurance 
for fulltime employees 
a bill sponsored by sen edward m kennedy dmass to mandate 
coverage for employees who work more than 17 hours a week and their 
dependents is before a senate committee the bill applies to all 
businesses but contains a clause under which small companies could 
get government subsidies 
gallup questioned 1500 randomly selected us adults via 
telephone during late january and early february with a sampling 
error estimated at 25 percentage points 
for the doctors poll gallup queried 1004 us physicians from 
the amas list in late january and early february the margin of 
error is calculated at 35 percentage points

investigators have found severe cracks in the 
engines of grounded boeing 737400s operated by british carriers 
the times of london reported today 
the department of civil aviation which ordered the aircraft 
grounded last week and the department of transport said they could 
not confirm or deny the report 
jack gamble a spokesman for boeing commercial airplanes said 
the seattlebased company also could not confirm or deny the report 
we know of some cracking found in suspect engines sent to paris 
for repair but we cant confirm it he said today 
the times said the cracks were more serious than the breaking of 
fan blades in two engines which occurred during two british flights 
last week it said the new cracks have been found on previously 
untested engines 
the damage is so fundamental that any hope of getting the 
aircraft flying in time for the holiday peak has been dashed said 
the report by the newspapers air correspondent harvey elliott 
the newspaper said detailed reports on the cracks have been sent 
to the french manufacturer snecma which makes the engines in 
conjunction with general electric under the joint name cfm 
international 
on monday the department of civil aviation grounded the 12 
britishoperated boeing 737400 aircraft powered by cfm563c engines 
after the two incidents on british planes last week 
in the united states boeing commercial airplanes and cfm 
recommended tuesday that 737400s with the 3c engines and some 
other engines that had been operated at high thrust levels be 
grounded for engine modifications the federal aviation 
administration followed with its own grounding order wednesday 
the five us planes with affected engines all operated by 
usair were back in service thursday gamble said usair exchanged 
the planes engines for ones with lesser maximum thrust he said 
the other 28 affected 737400s are all operated by airlines 
outside the united states 
in the british incidents a danair 737400 returned to londons 
gatwick airport and a british midlands 737400 made an emergency 
landing at east midlands airport after engine vibrations both 
airlines said the turbofan blades had been damaged 
in january a british midlands boeing 737400 crashed near east 
midlands airport killing 47 people after the pilot reported one 
engine failed in flight the investigation not yet complete has 
found that the pilot shut down the good engine before trying to land

consumer prices rose a sharp 06 percent in 
may pushed up by strong increases in food and gasoline costs the 
government said today 
the rise in the consumer price index the governments primary 
gauge of inflation at the retail level followed an even stronger 
07 percent april increase that was the largest jump in more than 
two years the labor department reported 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the price increase 
disappointing but said administration officials continue to 
believe that inflation will remain low and under control 
during the first five months of the year consumer prices rose at 
an annual rate of 67 percent a significantly faster pace than the 
44 percent price increases registered in 1987 and 1988 
inflation at the wholesale level has been even stronger rising 
at an annual rate of 94 percent so far this year 
reports of inflations demise have been grossly exaggerated 
said economist david berson of the federal national mortgage 
association the core rate doesnt appear to have subsided and 
with the economy running close to full employment will edge up as 
the year the goes on 
despite the persistently strong price increases some other 
analysts believe inflation now may begin to level off and that it 
could start to drop again late this year 
its not a good report but we can look forward to a plateauing 
of this increase said stacy kottman research director at the 
economic forecasting center at georgia state university in the 
last half of 1989 the inflation range will come down 
todays report will be closely scrutinized by the federal reserve 
board which last week slightly eased its grip on the money supply 
in the belief that the slowing economy will help to tame inflation 
analysts believe the central bank will wait for further evidence 
that inflation is under control before it eases any more 
in may the overall inflation rate was heavily influenced by a 
16 percent increase in energy costs these costs had shot up 51 
percent in april when there was an alltime record increase in 
gasoline prices of 114 percent 
last months increase in gasoline costs was a stillstrong 39 
percent which accounted for about onefourth of the overall 
increase in the cpi for may 
food and beverage prices meanwhile increased 06 percent last 
month after rising 05 percent in april the may increase included a 
sharp 32 percent jump in prices for fruits and vegetables beef 
prices rose 05 percent and poultry prices 32 percent 
excluding the volatile food and energy categories other consumer 
prices rose 05 percent in may up from a 02 percent increase in 
april many analysts closely watch these figures and believe they 
represent the important core level of inflationary pressures in 
the economy 
in a separate report the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation fell 13 
percent in may after rising 05 percent a month earlier 
average weekly earnings in may before adjusting for inflation 
were 33120 up 34 percent from a year earlier taking the 54 
percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the 
12month period real weekly earnings were down 19 percent 
the various may price changes left the overall consumer price 
index at 1238 percent of its 198284 base this means that a 
hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 during the base period 
would have cost 12380 last month 70 cents more than in april 
the 06 percent increase in prices last month was slightly higher 
than most analysts had expected the consensus projection had been 
05 percent 
the labor department offered these other details of price changes 
in may

apparel prices increased 08 percent after rising 03 percent in 
april smallerthanusual seasonal price declines for womens and 
girls clothing were largely responsible for the seasonally adjusted 
increase 
entertainment costs rose 01 percent in may after jumping 06 
percent in april admission charges for movies theaters concerts 
and sporting events were down 
medical care prices rose 07 percent and advanced 73 percent 
over the past 12 months drugs and medical supply costs rose 11 
percent in may 
transportation costs rose 1 percent in may after shooting up 21 
percent in april with both months figures boosted by the sharp 
gasoline price increases 
before it moved last week to ease credit the federal reserve 
since march 1988 had been pushing interest rates upward in an 
attempt to curb inflation by restraining economic growth 
signs that the economy is in fact slowing have proliferated in 
recent months most recently the fed reported thursday that factory 
operating rates declined last month and industrial production levels 
held steady 
economist maury harris of painewebber inc in new york said the 
easingof factory use bodes well for slowing inflation because it 
reduces the likelihood of production bottlenecks and shortages that 
can push up prices 
this is telling us that the economy still has plenty of room to 
run and the inflationary pressures are going to be cooling off 
harris said its going to take the pressure off inflation 
harris said he expects inflation to drop back down to the 4 
percent range in the second half of the year which should prompt 
the fed to again relax its monetary policy

britains annualized inflation rate rose to 83 
percent in may from 8 percent in april the government said friday 
the latest rate was lower than financial markets had expected but 
was higher than the peak of 8 percent that chancellor of the 
exchequer nigel lawson had forecast in march 
the department of employment said its retail price index rose 06 
percent in may from the previous month 
the index stood at 115 in may compared with 1143 in april and 
1062 in may 1988 the index uses a january 1987 base of 100 
market forecasts called for an 84percent annual rate and a 07 
percent monthly rise 
employment secretary norman fowler said that if mortgage interest 
payments were excluded the rate of inflation would have been 6 
percent in may 
he said inflation is likely to fall back later in the year as a 
result of policies already in hand 
there is continuing evidence that the action taken by the 
chancellor is beginning to work fowler said pointing to a recent 
slowdown in retail sales and consumer borrowing growth as well as 
moderation in the rate of increase of producer prices 
the government has pushed up interest rates 10 times in the last 
year to 14 percent from 75 percent in an effort to fight resurgent 
inflation 
the annual inflation rate in may 1988 was 42 percent

more than 10000 coal miners in four 
states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in 
virginia and west virginia who have waged a bitter strike since 
april against the pittston coal group 
miners in pennsylvania and kentucky today became the third and 
fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies the sympathy 
strikes began monday in west virginia and spread to indiana late 
thursday 
one united mine workers representative said today that the 
indiana walkout was prompted by thursday nights telecast of cbs 
48 hours which focused on the pittston strike in which 1600 
miners have been off the job since april 
pittston dropped out of the bituminous coal operators association 
to negotiate with the union independently and the two sides have 
failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations 
umw officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are 
responsible for the wildcat strike some said they are asking union 
members to return to work but tommy buchanan international 
executive board member in umw district 20 in birmingham ala said 
today the final decision on whether 5000 alabama miners will join 
the strike will be with union president richard trumka 
it might be two days it might be a week it will start 
whenever it comes down from the union president buchanan said 
union spokesman joe corcoran was not in his office and has not 
returned phone calls this week 
the head of the coal industry bargaining unit said he had no 
plans to confer with the pittston on the wildcat strikes 
i would no more try to tell someone else how to run their 
company than i would expect someone else to try to tell me how to 
run my company said robert h quenon president of peabody 
holding co the nations largest coal producer and chairman of the 
bituminous coal operators association 
quenon flew to charleston from st louis on thursday to meet with 
reporters and express peabodys and the associations concerns about 
the walkout 
an estimated 2300 united mine workers members stayed away from 
their jobs today in pennsylvania most worked for rochester amp 
pittsburgh coal co operations in central pennsylvania where 1600 
miners failed to report for work at midnight thursday said company 
spokesman hank waneck said 
about 290 miners at peabodys camp no 1 mine in morganfield 
ky didnt report for work today said company spokesman tom clarke 
at least 270 miners were off the job at two mines in indiana 
today spokesmen said mark arnold a spokesman for umw district 11 
in terre haute attributed the action to the cbs show 
when the miners saw that last night that kind of set them off 
to where they decided to walk out he said 
about onethird of west virginias 24000 miners were reported 
off the job today some 600 miners in wise county va who walked 
out earlier in the week returned to work this morning 
the coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other than 
pittston violate a nostrike clause in the 1988 national contract 
the union signed with the association pittston did not take part in 
that agreement 
union officials have not returned phone calls this week but in 
the past they have said they have not authorized the walkout 
i think the union leadership ought to exercise its leadership 
role and do what they can to lead the miners back to work quenon 
said thats why we have a union thats why we have an agreement 
with the union to set out the terms and conditions under which we 
will have labor to run our coal mines 
and we expect that to be honored

goldome bank on friday rescinded its 
controversial policy of threatening to cut the severance pay of 
laidoff workers unless they signed an agreement not to talk about 
losing their jobs 
our intention to help assure the confidentiality of employee 
customer and corporate information has been submerged by 
misperceptions of the agreement this makes its continued use 
counterproductive thomas cooper the chief executive said in a 
statement 
cooper said goldome wants to cut staffing levels by 20 percent 
or about 980 jobs nationwide he said the company has already 
completed more than half of the job cuts either through layoffs 
attrition or the sale of business units 
goldome one of the nations largest thrifts has lost 167 
million in it last six quarters sources within the company said 
cooper wanted to keep the layoffs secret so customers would not lose 
confidence and withdraw their money 
as many as 150 people had been terminated in the last 10 days and 
asked to sign the agreement which prevented them from suing goldome 
or discussing their layoff with anyone except counsel personal 
tax adviser immediate family or as required by law 
if laidoff employees refused to sign their severance benefits 
would have been cut to two weeks pay down from a maximum of six 
nearly all of goldomes laidoff workers signed the agreement 
because they could not afford to lose the money sources said 
goldome based in buffalo employs 4900 nationwide and has 
operations in two dozen states

corn and soybean futures prices posted strong

warm dry weather in the midwest next week wheat futures closed 
mixed 
meteorologists are continuing to call for a change to warmer and 
drierthannormal conditions in the corn belt by late next week 
stirring memories of last years drought 
corn futures also were supported by expectations that the 
agriculture department will extend certain corn loans to farmers 
that would keep some corn in storage that otherwise would move onto 
the market 
the dollars weakness was another bullish factor since a weaker 
dollar could encourage foreign purchases of us grain 
the soybean complex has been trading with a kind of a wary eye 
on that dollar situation said dale gustafson a grainmarket 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
improving harvest weather in the great plains kept pressure on 
wheat prices 
at the close wheat was cent lower to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 394 a bushel corn was cent to 
4 cents higher with july at 263 a bushel oats were unchanged to

an attorney representing a fired eastern airlines 
manager said friday the federal aviation administration has been lax 
in taking action against falsification of records that led to fuel 
contamination at new yorks laguardia airport 
ira j furman an attorney in woodmere ny said he represents 
a former eastern maintenance manager at laguardia who has talked to 
the faa the fbi and the us attorneys office about alleged 
violations that occurred at least a year ago 
the former manager whose was not identified has said he 
initialed documents saying tests were made on jets parked overnight 
at laguardia when no tests actually were made furman said the 
tests are to ensure the planes fuel does not have too much water in 
it excess water can damage an engine or cause engine failure 
this is like a whitewash furman said the faa should have 
shut down operations at laguardia 
it has taken a while for us to look into this case said 
kathleen bergen a spokeswoman in faas eastern district office 
however she said the delay was in the interest of thoroughness 
furman a deputy director of the national transportation safety 
board until 1987 said his client was granted immunity in the case 
last september 
easterns maintenance and safety operations have come under 
increased scrutiny since the walkout of its machinists union on 
march 4 with regulators trying to determine whether the strike has 
led to unsafe practices in easterns maintenance 
early last month eastern surrendered its repair station 
certificate at new yorks john f kennedy international airport 
after the faa determined the carrier failed to properly record and 
inspect maintenance work 
the suspension of the jfk certificate was for actions that 
predated the start of the machinists strike that was joined by 
pilots and flight attendants the walkout virtually grounded 
miamibased eastern and pushed it into bankruptcy court 
reorganization 
on may 12 the faa completed a special investigation of 
recordkeeping at easterns maintenance posts in miami and atlanta 
to determine if violations of recordkeeping rules such as those 
found at kennedy were widespread 
the final report hasnt been submitted to acting faa 
administrator robert e whittington but jack barker an faa 
spokesman in atlanta said monday the agency told eastern informally 
that the inspection had revealed no irregularities 
the former manager at laguardia asserted that easterns 
maintenance department there didnt even have the necessary tools to 
conduct the fuel tests and said he sometimes signed documents using 
madeup initials for nonexistent managers furman said 
jim ashlock a spokesman for eastern at its miami headquarters 
said there are no indications that aircraft safety was compromised 
at laguardia he said the airline has cooperated with the faa in 
examining all available records relevant to the managers 
accusations 
the former eastern manager said he became concerned after a 
superior told him they would not hire a lawyer for him if an 
accident occurred as a result of the nontesting he refused to 
falsify any more documents furman said two weeks later the manager 
was fired on what he says are false charges that he smoked marijuana 
on the job furman said 
the manager alerted the faa and the justice department about the 
allegations in 1987 after losing an arbitration case over his 
firing and has given the faa tape recordings and written documents 
furman said 
the manager has put himself on the line the attorney said 
the faa had it laid out on a silver platter for them 
the faas inaction calls into question the effectiveness of the 
faa in rooting out problems at eastern furman said 
since 1983 176 accidents resulting in 45 deaths were caused by 
excess water in fuel according to the national transportation 
safety board none involved jets or major commercial carriers

a federal court friday approved the 
bankruptcy reorganization of ah robins co including 25 billion 
for women who claim they were injured by the companys dalkon shield 
birth control device sold widely in the 1970s 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld all parts of the 
longawaited restructuring of robins which will become a subsidiary 
of new yorkbased american home products corp in a 700 million 
stock swap 
i think its just tremendous news for all dalkon shield 
claimants said guerry thornton attorney for the dalkon shield 
victims association in atlanta it means the decade wait for fair 
treatment and vindication of their rights is almost over 
robins a richmondbased pharmaceutical manufacturer sought 
chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors in august 
1985 
the company faced millions of dollars in damage claims from women 
who said they suffered injuries including infections sterility 
miscarriage and having children born with birth defects caused by 
the dalkon shield intrauterine device 
robins distributed about 45 million dalkon shields in the united 
states and abroad before taking the device off the market in 1974 
robins paid about 520 million to settle 9400 of some 15000 dalkon 
shield lawsuits before seeking bankruptcy protection 
alan b morrison attorney for the public citizen litigation 
group in washington dc lead lawyer for opponents of the 
reorganization plan said no decision had been made whether to 
appeal to the us supreme court 
in a series of four unanimous opinions a threejudge panel of 
the appeals court upheld the entire scope of robins reorganization 
in addition to a 25 billion settlement trust fund for about 
200000 dalkon shield claimants the reorganization includes full 
payment to robins other creditors 
the restructuring was designed over three years and approved in 
july 1988 by us district judge robert r merhige jr and us 
bankruptcy judge blackwell n shelley who presided jointly in the 
case 
the ruling includes approval of a one claimantone vote plan by 
which 95 percent of dalkon shield claimants ratified the settlement 
and a separate cash settlement by robins insurance company 
lawyers for a group of claimants who opposed the plan contended 
that ratification vote dalkon shield users was flawed they argued 
before the appeals court in december that women with larger claims 
should have had a greater voice in deciding the issue 
the reorganization plan also bars claimants from filing 
thirdparty lawsuits to seek damages from robins officers or its 
insurer another aspect opposed by some claimants 
aetna casualty amp surety co robins insurer paid 425 million 
to the trust to settle any claims against it the claimants 
contended aetna was an active participant in marketing the dalkon 
shield and should have been liable for claims beyond those covered 
by the 25 billion trust 
but the threemember appeals court panel rejected the argument 
citing the likelihood of conflicting decisions on liability if aetna 
had to face trial in different courts on essentially the same 
question 
the court also ruled that while the one claimantone vote method 
of approving the reorganization denied weighted voting at most 
harmless error was committed because almost 95 percent of 
claimants endorsed the plan 
based on expert testimony 25 billion was the estimated cost of 
full compensation for all dalkon shield claimants robins attorney 
james c roberts said 
only 100 million of the 25 billion compensation package to 
dalkon shield claimants has been available during the appeal 
michael sheppard director of the trust funds claims resolution 
facility said 52 million of the initial 100 million already has 
been paid to 77662 claimants 
also at issue on appeal was whether judge merhige interfered with 
the fivemember trustee board handling the claimants compensation 
fund 
last november merhige removed three of the trustees because of 
slow progress in setting up a procedure for resolving initial 
claims the appeals court on friday upheld the judges action

a rally in the dollar fizzled friday one day 
after a sharp selloff leaving it higher against the british pound 
canadian dollar and swiss franc but lower against other major 
currencies 
the dollar rose from late thursday levels in asian and early 
european trading despite central banks dollar sales but it failed 
to hold ground after a us report showed inflation in may at the 
high end of expectations 
thursdays panicky selling appeared to have altered the bullish 
psychology that had carried the dollar to its highest levels since 
1987 or late 1986 against some currencies traders said 
the same inflation number last week would have pushed the 
dollar definitely higher said bernd becker chief trader for 
oesterreichische laenderbank in new york 
the commerce department said the consumer price index rose 06 
percent in may high inflation increases the chance the federal 
reserve will keep interest rates high to keep the economy from 
overheating 
higher rates attract global money into dollars but nervous 
speculators used the report as an opportunity to sell 
also pushing down the dollar becker said was a report out of 
japan quoting sources saying the central banks of japan and west 
germany had agreed to intervene jointly to hold down the dollar 
outside their home markets 
i think the market really got shaken by what happened becker 
said referring to thursdays session in which the dollar lost 25 
percent or more of its value against the pound west german mark and 
japanese yen 
billions of dollars were bought at top levels when it looked 
like it was a oneway street up now speculators are going to use 
any higher levels to sell he said 
dealers said trading was erratic with the dollars movement 
exaggerated by thin volume many market players chose to stay on the 
sidelines after being burned by thursdays sharp swings 
in london the dollar fell against the british pound it cost 
15340 to buy one pound more than 15195 late thursday in new 
york the pound fell to 15410 from 15510 late thursday in new

eastman kodak co said friday it will 
consolidate its consumer photography products and picture finishing 
operations cutting costs and hundreds of jobs 
four operations will be merged in the newly created consumer 
imagery division said company spokesman paul allen 
kodak said the move would strengthen its consumer photography 
business part of the firms imaging segment which made a dismal 
showing when kodaks firstquarter earnings were announced in may 
by years end the new division will include the consumer 
products photofinishing and united states sales divisions he said 
it also will include the administrative service area within the 
photo products group said allen 
if you look at the stock over the last couple of weeks there 
has been a lot of speculation after the firstquarter earnings 
release that there could be a major restructuring or a hostile 
takeover or spinoff said alex henderson an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc 
i am very strongly of the opinion that those basic rumors that 
got the stock to rally are unfounded 
kodak stock fell 12 cents friday to 4862 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading 
kodak profits were down 23 percent in the first quarter and the 
company had problems making money selling products overseas caused 
by the increasing strength of the us dollar overseas and foreign 
competition kodak has also had to absorb costs from last years 
purchase of sterling drug co 
in the imaging segment operating earnings fell from 201 million 
in last years first quarter to 160 million the same period this 
year 
kodaks plan included cutting several hundred jobs from the work 
force but the exact number would not be determined until summers 
end said allen 
the job cuts would occur in support areas and would be primarily 
confined to the companys rochester headquarters said allen 
there will be no major impact in the field among our sales 
force or at our manufacturing facilities allen said 
kodak vice chairman j phillip samper said the company will 
view consumer photography as single business driven by the 
recognition that consumers see photography as a natural sequence 
involving cameras films and photofinishing 
separately xerox corp announced in rochester that 680 employees 
nationwide have been accepted in a voluntary reduction program that 
xerox announced in march including 170 in the rochester area where 
xerox has its largest manufacturing work force 
while the voluntary reductions wont guarantee against future 
layoffs said spokesman john rasor xerox had originally predicted 
that only 250 to 350 would take advantage of the program

petroleum futures prices fell sharply friday as 
the market relaxed its concerns over supply problems and traders 
cashed in gains achieved earlier in the week analysts said 
on the new york mercantile exchange the july contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude finished 62 
cents lower at 1995 a barrel the drop retraced most of the 69

fell 055 cent to 4571 cents a gallon other product contracts also 
declined 
analysts said the market had been overbought in recent days 
youre bound to see profittaking coming in basically as a 
result of it said nauman barakat vice president of energy 
investments at prudentialbache securities inc 
some observers had attributed the recent rise in july crude oil 
to concerns about pipeline distribution problems that resulted in 
some customers receiving foreign crude in place of west texas 
intermediate 
although the delivered crude met specifications customers used 
to receiving west texas intermediate were concerned about supplies 
analysts said 
the shortterm scare is over said james steel an analyst 
with refco inc that led to a relaxation in the market and made 
the market go down

strikebound eastern airlines has agreed to sell 
its eight philadelphia airport gates 16 jets and other assets to 
midway airlines for 2065 million eastern said friday 
the move heads off threatened antitrust action by the justice 
department to block easterns earlier proposed sale of the 
philadelphia gates and two uscanadian routes to usair group inc 
eastern announced the midway deal at a federal bankruptcy court 
hearing over its earlier agreement with washingtonbased usair us 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland gave eastern permission to 
terminate that agreement but still must approve the sale to 
chicagobased midway 
eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on march 9 
five days after the start of a strike by machinists that was joined 
by pilots and flight attendants 
the sale of the philadelphia assets is part of easterns plan to 
reorganize as a smaller carrier and sell 18 billion in assets 
lifland on wednesday had approved easterns agreement to sell 15 
aircraft for 2775 million to uasinvest inc 
the unions have opposed the plan but have been unsuccessful in 
finding a buyer for the entire airline 
on thursday william winpisinger president of the international 
association of machinists said he saw a sevenin10 chance that 
the bankruptcy court would approve easterns downsizing plan 
referring to frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas 
air corp winpisinger said its distinctly possible he can win 
and survive winpisinger made his remarks to the indiana state 
aflcio annual convention in french lick ind 
a buyout plan for eastern proposed by the unions and chicago 
commodities trader joseph ritchie remains under discussion but 
lifland has said the first priority should be talks over the 
airlines proposed reorganization 
midway agreed to purchase easterns eight philadelphia gates its 
routes from philadelphia to toronto and montreal two landing slots 
at new yorks laguardia airport two slots at washington national 
airport and 16 mcdonnell douglas dc9 aircraft 
used dc9 jets generally fetch around 3 million each industry 
experts say 
eastern attorney bruce zirinsky told lifland the airline held 
negotiations through thursday night and into friday morning with 
officials of midway which previously had expressed interest in 
easterns philadelphia assets 
the justice department planned to sue to block the planned 85 
million sale to usair of easterns airport gates in philadelphia and 
its philadelphiatoronto route the sale also would have included 
easterns philadelphiamontreal route but the department didnt 
object to that element 
the department contended the sale to usair threatened to lessen 
competition in airline service between philadelphia and other 
cities usair already has nearly a third of the flights into and out 
of philadelphia 
the state of pennsylvania also challenged the proposed usair 
purchase saying the transaction could lead to higher ticket prices 
obviously were disappointed in what happened but the deal is 
over thats it said usair spokesman john bronson in pittsburgh 
dan ashby a spokesman for the pilots union said the unions 
planned to object in court to the proposed midway sale 
we believe that philadelphia is an integral part of the eastern 
system ashby said he contended lorenzo wants to sell easterns 
assets in that city because they compete with continental airlines 
hub in nearby newark nj continental a nonunion carrier is a 
texas air subsidiary

live cattle futures prices posted modest gains friday on the 
chicago mercantile exchange and experts predicted a surge next week 
after a government report showed an unexpectedly sharp drop in may 
placements of cattle on feedlots 
on other markets energy prices tumbled grains and soybeans were 
mixed and precious metals retreated 
live cattle settled 13 cent to 30 cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in june at 7170 cents a pound feeder cattle were 
unchanged to 18 cent lower with august at 8097 cents a pound live 
hogs were 05 cent to 60 cent higher with june at 4822 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 38 cent lower to 115 cents higher 
witth july at 3392 cents a pound 
cattle futures prices had been rising ahead of the agriculture 
departments monthly cattleonfeed report 
expectations were that it would show about a 15 percent decline 
in the number of cattle placed on feedlots last month in the seven 
largest producer states compared with the recordhigh placements of 
may 1988 
but the usda indicated an even sharper drop in may placements 
reporting 25 percent fewer cattle were moved from pastures to 
feedlots last month than a year ago 
the sevenstate total of 16 million cattle was 11 percent below 
the 10year average and represented the lightest may placements 
since 1981 the placements brought the total number of cattle on 
feed in the seven states to 75 million 3 percent below a year ago 
there are two major reasons for the lower placements last years 
drought dried up pasturelands and forced calfandcattle producers 
to sell more of their animals to feedlots earlier in the year than 
normal which led to recordhigh placements in may 1988 
this years spring rains had the opposite effect 
the rain improved your pasture conditions and just slowed down 
that movement of cattle off of pastures into the feedlots said 
dale durchholz of agrivisor services inc in bloomington ill 
the low placements will result in tighter supplies of 
slaughterready cattle in late summer and early fall and will 
likely push cattle and beef prices higher 
analysts said the contracts for august and october cattle 
deliveries should see the greatest gains on monday with prices 
expected to open 50 cent to 1 cent higher 
petroleum futures prices plummeted on the new york mercantile 
exchange on signs of easing supplies of crude oil for prompt 
delivery and reports that the opec cartel may raise its production 
ceiling by 1 million barrels per day in september

lower with july at 1995 a barrel heating oil was 21 cent to 63 
lower with july at 4571 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 134

most corn and soybean futures posted strong gains on the chicago 
board of trade boosted by forecasts for a warmup in the midwest 
next week wheat futures closed mixed 
corn futures also were supported by expectations the agriculture 
department will extend certain corn loans to farmers which would 
keep in storage some corn that would otherwise move onto the market 
wheat settled unchanged to 3 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 394 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 3

court approval friday of ah robins cos 
reorganization should end more than a decade of waiting for 
thousands of women seeking compensation for injuries from the dalkon 
shield birth control device 
there is some justice in the world said karen hightower 
director of the dalkon shield victims association in atlanta and a 
claimant this is absolutely wonderful 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals affirmed ah robins 
bankruptcy reorganization plan with 25 billion set aside for women 
claiming injuries from the intrauterine device sold widely in the 
early 1970s 
the money cannot be distributed until appeals to the plan are 
exhausted about 200000 claims against the richmondbased 
pharmaceutical manufacturer are outstanding 
an appeal to the us supreme court is possible but analysts and 
attorneys said the high court is unlikely to hear the case because 
the appellate court gave an acrosstheboard ratification 
constance miller of the international dalkon shield victims 
education in seattle who opposed the plan said she believes the 
reorganization does not provide adequate compensation 
i feel very disappointed ms miller said were not being 
treated fairly in this whole business 
she said the ruling means women who have not yet filed claims or 
gotten medical records together need to do so before time runs out 
sandy reina a claimant who leads a victims association in baton 
rouge la said the decision is important for women awaiting 
payments before they can undergo reproductive surgery or attempt in 
vitro fertilization 
a lot of the women here are about to fall apart from wondering 
what was going to happen ms reina said i think most of us are 
ready to go forward and get this thing over with 
ms reina said she had a total hysterectomy after years of pain 
from wearing the dalkon shield 
for me personally its time to let the manufacturers wake up 
and tell them dont put any more things out there and use us as 
guinea pigs she said 
robins distributed about 45 million dalkon shields in the united 
states and abroad before taking the device off the market in 1974 
robins paid about 520 million to settle 9400 of some 15000 dalkon 
shield lawsuits before seeking bankruptcy protection in 1985 
ms hightower said she has received calls daily and nightly 
from claimants worried because the appeals decision had taken since 
december to be handed down 
so many of them believed they had been used by ah robins and 
were beginning to doubt the court system she said now they can 
see theres a light at the end of the tunnel 
ms hightower who became pregnant in 1972 while using the dalkon 
shield and gave birth to a braindamaged child said approval of the 
plan will help ease some of her anger toward ah robins 
once these women get a check in their hands it wont 
compensate for their injuries or the children they dont have but 
its proof that they did something about it she said

four groups said friday they remain in the 
running to buy northwest airlines parent nwa inc a major takeover 
firm also was rumored to be a frontrunner and one former suitor 
dropped out 
pan am corp oil billionaire marvin davis northwests 
machinists union and a group led by los angeles investor alfred 
checchi said they met fridays deadline for revised bids for the 
owner of northwest airlines the nations fourthlargest carrier 
two of those bidders who asked not to be identified said they 
believed the new york takeover firm kohlberg kravis amp roberts co 
also submitted an offer kohlberg kravis would not comment 
analysts have said the winning northwest bid could be as high as 
120 a share or 35 billion 
nwa stock closed up 12 cents at 10762 friday on the new york 
stock exchange 
mei diversified inc of minneapolis led by minnesota twins owner 
and banker carl pohlad and including financier irwin jacobs said it 
would not revise its initial offer mei president donald benson did 
not return telephone calls seeking comment on why mei was dropping 
out 
a fourmember committee of the nwa board announced june 5 it had 
rejected all firstround bids it asked for enhanced revisions 
saying it would favor a high price low level of debt and an ability 
to complete a deal quickly in lieu of takeover scrutiny by federal 
regulators 
nwa has declined to identify the bidders or say when a decision 
would be made 
nwa chairman steven rothmeier has said the board may decide not 
to sell the company possibly opting instead for a special dividend 
payment to shareholders acquisition of another company liquidation 
of the airline or sale of more than 20 percent of nwa stock to a 
friendly third party 
i dont think the bidding will go a third round and i think 
youll get a decision next week said mike hamilton an analyst 
with piper jaffray amp hopwood of minneapolis 
kkr which specializes in buying companies with borrowed money in 
deals known as leveraged buyouts completed the largest deal in 
history with the 2453 billion takeover of rjr nabisco inc earlier 
this year 
checchi a former marriott corp executive has been described by 
rothmeier as a friendly suitor his group includes gary wilson a 
former nwa board member and frederic malek an unsuccessful 
candidate for the presidents job at united airlines who once headed 
marriotts hotel group 
klm royal dutch airlines is an equity partner in the checchi 
group which also has backing from elder ixl ltd an australian 
investment holding company 
a source in the checchi group confirmed it met fridays bidding 
deadline but declined to elaborate 
pan am chairman thomas plaskett said his companys revised bid 
includes 200 million in equity from corporate partners an 
investment fund organized by lazard freres amp co and managed by 
lester pollack and ali e wambold 
that brings the total amount of equity in the pan am proposal to 
600 million plaskett said 
no other details of the offer were disclosed but spokeswoman 
pamela hanlon said the bid still includes bank financing and 
subordinated debt placed with private institutions the earlier pan 
am bid included 27 billion in bank financing 
analysts said pan am has an uphill battle for northwest because a 
merger probably would result in more debt than any other proposed 
deal 
pan am the nations eighthlargest carrier is more than 900 
million in debt and plaskett has said the company needs to acquire 
another airline or be acquired 
a spokesman for davis who opened the bidding for northwest on 
march 28 with a 90ashare or 27 billion offer said davis has 
submitted a new and very full offer 
no details were disclosed but the spokesman said it was davis 
final bid 
guy cook president of the international association of 
machinists district lodge 143 would not disclose details of the 
unions revised bid the machinists account for about 20000 of 
northwests 35000 employees

the nation the 125yearold weekly magazine 
jumped into the takeover fray for time inc on friday but its 
buyout proposal offered more in the way of wry commentary than cash 
or stocks 
ever since the reagan administration abandoned its enforcement 
of the antitrust laws and the congressional democrats abandoned 
their plan to put a cap on conglomerate size weve been looking for 
a way to do our part to protect the free enterprise system wrote 
editor victor navasky 
now we have found it 
navasky said he made his overture in a letter to time chairman j 
richard munro that is being reprinted in the july 3 issue of the 
nation due to appear on newstands next week 
a white knight is coming to your rescue navasky wrote munro 
who heads the time board that on friday rejected a 107 billion 
buyout offer from paramount communications inc 
mimicking the lingo of investment bankers and casting a 
broadside at the debtfinanced buyout trend of the 1980s navasky 
wrote that his company was highly confident it could do better than 
paramounts 175 a share bid 
like other potential suitors our plan is to pledge the assets 
of time inc as collateral on the loan we take to buy you out so 
cash will be no problem he wrote 
in support of the bid navasky noted that the nation which has 
been published continuously since 1865 and lost money for all but 
three of those years our taxloss carryforward is staggering 
he said 
he also pointed out that delays in completing the deal should be 
no problem for the weekly because nothing we do takes more than a 
week 
once the deal was complete navasky said the nation would give 
times bookofthemonth club home box office cable service people 
and time magazines and all the companys other properties their 
independence 
as a magazine founded by abolitionists we believe in 
freeing the corporate slaves he wrote 
he said that idea should appeal to shareholders who would retain 
proportionate shares in all of the enterprises and the editors and 
publishers of times various enterprises who wouldnt have 
paramount or the nation looking over their shoulders 
we are even prepared to consider having the various sections 
of time nation world milestones etc spun off as 
independent entities navasky wrote 
but all of that is subject to negotiation

the house passed a 157 billion savings and 
loan bailout thursday night supporting president bushs demand for 
tough industry reforms but rejecting his plan to prevent the costs 
from swelling the federal deficit 
on a 32097 vote the house approved the biggest financial rescue 
in history from a crisis caused largely by risky and often 
fraudulent lending of federally insured deposits primarily in 
texas california and florida 
fiftyone democrats and 46 republicans voted against the bill 
voting for the bill were 196 democrats and 124 republicans 
the american taxpayers won a major victory today when the house 
voted for strong tangible capital requirements said treasury 
secretary nicholas brady they have taken a very positive step 
toward ensuring the resolution of the savings and loan crisis 
at the white house white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said in a conference call to news organizations we are pleased by 
this bipartisan step toward final passage we applaud the house 
leadership for moving this bill rapidly through the house 
the vote on final passage occurred after rep jim leach of iowa 
the leading republican crusader against sampl abuses in the house won 
an amendment to eliminate several specialinterest provisions 
benefitting specific companies 
among the provisions eliminated were those aimed at helping 
sears chemical bank of new york first interstate bank of los 
angeles citicorp merrill lynch paine webber and other brokerage 
houses citizens federal savings bank of miami and great western 
savings bank one of the largest sampls in california 
bush had threatened earlier thursday to veto the measure if the 
house adopted an industrysought amendment by rep henry hyde 
rill to give 241 thrift institutions a mechanism to escape having 
to raise 6 billion in new capital as a hedge against future loan 
losses 
the amendment was defeated by a 32694 vote after bush issued his 
veto threat and democrats repeated assertions that it would gut the 
reforms needed to prevent an recurrence of the crisis 
this amendment would have allowed weak institutions to delay 
and delay and delay the day of reckoning said rep charles 
schumer dny and while they delay and delay and delay the 
taxpayers pay and pay and pay 
the bill next goes to a conference committee of lawmakers who 
will iron out differences from a senate version approved two months 
ago with sampl losses mounting at a rate of nearly 40 million a day 
the administration wants the bill enacted into law before congress 
takes its august vacation 
before enacting the bill the house rejected on a largely 
partyline 280146 vote bushs plan to finance the bailout through 
highcost 30year offbudget bonds rather than new borrowing 
directly through the treasury 
this is a vote to save the taxpayer 5 billion in interest 
costs said rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
taxwriting house ways and means committee 
only democrats carroll hubbard of kentucky tommy robinson of 
arkansas and ralph hall of texas supported bushs plan also 
rejected by a similar margin was an effort to force a tax increase 
or massive spending cuts to pay for the bailout 
however the house amended bushs original proposal on a 208206 
vote to make the industry subsidize lowincome housing by 75 
million to 150 million a year and outlaw sampl investments in junk 
bonds 
the house also adopted a amendment opposed by the administration 
as well as the sampl and banking industries to make lenders disclose 
data on their lending by race and locality in an effort to wipe out 
socalled redlining discrimination 
basically the bill calls for spending a total of 285 billion 
including interest over the next 30 years to close or merge 
between 450 and 600 of the nations 2938 sampls whose estimated 
losses total about 100 billion 
of the total spending about 157 billion would come from 
taxpayers and the balance from the industry according to the 
general accounting office 
only 56 of the houses 175 republicans ended up supporting hydes 
measure after gop leader bob michel reluctantly switched sides in 
response to a strong letter from bush appealing for support 
democrats voted 21238 to reject the amendment 
hydes measure would have required federal regulators to grant 
hearings to marginally healthy sampls before phasing out exemptions to 
capital requirements granted by regulators in the early 1980s for 
supervisory good will 
in a letter to michel just before the vote bush said approval of 
the hyde amendment would render this bill unacceptable to me 
the president said that giving recognition to good will as capital 
is not justifiable 
there should be no mistake bush wrote this matter goes to 
the very heart of my determination to clean up the abuses of the 
past among the savings and loans about which every voter is 
entitled to be outraged 
in april the senate defeated by a 5048 vote an effort by 
democrats to make the bailout part of the deficit and sen phil 
gramm rtexas has collected signatures from 40 colleagues over the 
last week pledging to support bushs financing plan 
hyde said his good will amendment was intended only to grant 
the constitutional right of a hearing to the 8 percent of the 
industry that took over failing thrifts in the early 1980s and saved 
taxpayers 13 billion then 
the sampls who find themselves victimized by this legislation are 
not the bad guys the high flyers he said the only sin theyre 
guilty of is trusting the federal regulators they deserve a hearing 
before the sword falls before the scarlet letter is placed on their 
forehead 
critics however said hydes amendment would have gutted the 
chief reform elements of the bailout assuring that every sampl owner 
puts up some of it own money as a buffer between risky loans that 
may go bad and the federal deposit insurance fund 
the fund is now running an estimated deficit of 55 billion that 
is growing by at about 40 million a day because the government 
lacks the money to close some 450 insolvent sampls and pay off their 
depositors

state gaming regulators friday approved 
donald trumps 63 million offer for the elsinores atlantis casino 
hotel ending a struggle over new jerseys first failed casino 
the commission said it was not convinced trump was gaining too 
much power in atlantic city and voted to approve the billionaire 
developers purchase of the closed casino which trump plans to turn 
into a luxury hotel 
i am satisfied that the proposed acquisition of atlantis 
would not unacceptably affect the competitive climate that exists in 
atlantic city commission chairman walter read said before the 50 
vote 
the commission rejected recommendations by the division of gaming 
enforcement to impose several major conditions on the deal 
including a ban on future trump acquisitions of casinozoned real 
estate 
trump representatives told the commission the conditions would 
end the deal trump already owns two atlantic city casinos and has a 
third under construction 
over objections from two commissioners the panel did require 
trump to gain commission approval before building more hotels or 
buying more land zoned for casinos 
the atlantis acquisition leaves trump with control of 34 percent 
of the citys casino hotel rooms 31 percent of casino floor space 
and revenue and 48 percent of casino meeting and exhibition space 
according to the commission 
commissioners frank dodd and david waters said the restrictions 
amounted to meddling into trumps affairs which they said could 
inhibit further investment in the resort city 
we want atlantic city to develop but were stifling the 
potential dodd said 
trump did not attend the meeting his brother robert executive 
vice president of the trump organization said he was delighted 
by the vote and did not object to the conditions 
trump plans to keep the hotel open and more than 600 employees 
working while refurbishing begins elsinore had warned its 
increasingly bleak finances threatened to close the hotel in coming 
days 
the commission this spring denied atlantis owners a new license 
citing elsinores chronic and worsening debt it was the first time 
a new jersey casino lost a bid for relicensing since casino gambling 
was established more than a decade ago 
elsinore and trump struck a deal in april shortly before the 
license expired and a stateappointed conservator was to take title 
trump then announced plans to end gambling at the boardwalk property 
and remake it into a luxury hotel 
conservator joseph nolan and a lawyer for the gaming division had 
said they suspected elsinore ignored offers from others who would 
revive the gaming hall to the benefit of casino competition 
approval of the trump sale came at the end of a threeday hearing 
john l white the conservators lawyer argued the trump deal 
would harm competition in atlantic city and give the new york 
developer a dangerous level of control over the states gaming 
industry 
the minute this organization does something to increase or 
decrease prices the competition is going to have to fall into line 
or face going out of business white said 
trump representatives denied the accusation saying trumps 
holdings are not large enough to give him unusual influence in new 
jersey gaming

cracks have been found on the engines of new 
boeing co 737400 jets operating in britain the british civil 
aviation authority said friday 
caa spokeswoman anne noon in london said she didnt know the size 
of the cracks their precise location or which airlines operated the 
planes with engine cracks 
but she said the cracks were not found on planes involved in 
incidents last weekend in which fan blades broke and severe 
vibration occurred prompting the caa to ground 12 737400s in 
britain 
the planes built at renton wash a seattle suburb had been in 
commercial service since october 
the times of london on friday reported that the cracks in engines 
of grounded 737400s were more serious than the breaking of fan 
blades in two engines which occurred during two flights last week 
it said the new cracks were found on previously untested engines 
officials at the general electric cos aircraft engine plant in 
suburban cincinnati said friday they could not confirm the newspaper 
report 
ge spokesman david lane said he had no other information about 
the newspaper report 
our people are continuing to look very closely at this 
situation he said to this point its just premature to come 
to any conclusion 
jack gamble spokesman for boeing commercial airplanes said the 
seattlebased company could not confirm or deny the report either 
we know of some cracking found in suspect engines sent to paris 
for repair but we cant confirm it he said friday 
the london newspaper said detailed reports on the cracks have 
been sent to the french manufacturer snecma which makes the 
engines in conjunction with general electric under the joint name 
cfm international 
on monday the department of civil aviation grounded the 12 
britishoperated boeing 737400 aircraft powered by cfm563c 
engines two of those engines have been taken to the snecma factory 
near paris and stripped down for inspection noonan said 
in the united states boeing commercial airplanes and cfm 
recommended tuesday that 737400s with the 3c engines and some 
other engines that had been operated at high thrust levels be 
grounded for engine modifications 
the federal aviation administration followed with its own 
grounding order wednesday 
the five us planes with affected engines all operated by 
usair were back in service thursday gamble said usair exchanged 
the planes engines for ones with lesser maximum thrust he said 
the other 28 affected 737400s are all operated by airlines 
outside the united states 
in the british incidents a danair 737400 returned to londons 
gatwick airport and a british midlands 737400 made an emergency 
landing at east midlands airport after engine vibrations both 
airlines said the turbofan blades had been damaged 
boeing planes have had other crackrelated problems but not with 
engines instead the cracks have occurred in fuselages and have 
been blamed on metal fatigue and other problems of aging jets

the new york board of regents on friday 
unanimously banned the channel one news service containing 
commercials from being beamed into the states high schools 
the regents rejected whittle communications program saying they 
were worried the active commercialization of the programs would 
send the wrong message to high school students 
its a very tempting package that has a flaw said state 
education commissioner thomas sobol in opposing the plan that 
flaw is that its wrong its wrong legally educationally 
financially and morally 
some regents also expressed anger with whittles aggressive 
lobbying in support of channel one 
the decision is a blow to the tennesseebased whittle which has 
said it wants to sign up 40 percent of the nations 20000 high 
schools 
earlier this month california officials threatened their schools 
with a loss of funding if they signed contracts with whittle that 
means whittle has been rejected in the nations two largest states 
laura eshbaugh a whittle executive said she was disappointed 
with the decision by the new york board but said channel one would 
be able to survive the rejection 
we certainly would regret if this action means the students of 
new york state would not have the opportunity to participate in the 
program we are offering eshbaugh said 
whittle had taken its case to the public in the days leading to 
friday mornings board meeting the company ran two fullpage 
advertisements in the new york times and meyer said some regents 
were bombarded by junk fax messages in support of whittle 
in return for an agreement to show the daily programs whittle 
had offered to wire high schools with complete closed circuit 
television systems including satellite dishes televisions and 
videocassette recorders 
the most controversial aspect of its daily 12minute news program 
was trhat it contained two minutes of commercials for candy jeans 
acne cream and other products aimed at teenagers 
sobol said hes not sure its good for society that while many 
parochial school students pause for a moment of prayer in the 
morning public high school students were being asked by whittle to 
stop for two minutes of commercials 
what it says to children is we dont care much about you 
sobol said but we care what we can get out of you 
several regents said they worried the commercials could cause 
poor students who couldnt afford items advertised to feel 
inadequate they also said the program seems geared to suburban 
white students instead of the more troubled city schools that are in 
dire need of the technology whittle could provide 
but eshbaugh noted that schools contain many other forms of 
advertising such as wall posters advertisements in yearbooks and 
magazines and brand names emblazoned on the clothing students wear 
commercialization is there she said however any of us 
might not like it there its there to stay 
the regents said the discussion with whittle has caused them to 
examine the extent of other advertising in school the education 
department will also look into other ways of getting more technology 
and television programs into school sobol said 
some education officials also criticized the quality of whittles 
news program sobol said if the state government tried to produce a 
daily news program for distributionalmer 1b3011 mtngly dh2

chinesebritish declaration signed in 1984 china has pledged to 
maintain hong kongs way of life for 50 years after the takeover

one country two systems 
speaking to reporters before the speech chan said he was 
confident china would abide by the agreement because it has an 
excellent record for honoring international commitments

agreement he said

government was in the united states for an official visit scheduled 
prior to chinas june 34 military crackdown on prodemocracy 
protesters in beijing
