the senate appropriations committee on thursday 
approved a 144 billion foreign aid bill that would slap 
restrictions on us aid to el salvador and give poland more aid 
than president bush has sought 
the panel also voted to reverse a fouryearold reagan 
administration policy that barred us aid to the united nations 
population fund and killed an effort to cut aid to greece 
the committee sent the measure to the full senate which is 
scrambling to complete work on the 13 appropriations bills needed to 
run the government before the new fiscal year begins on oct 1 
el salvadors 85 million in aid for the coming year would be 
divided into three slices to be sent at fourmonth intervals only if 
the new rightist government of president alfredo cristiani makes 
progress toward curbing death squad activity and making peace with 
leftist rebels fighting his government 
the final installment would be in effect subject to a veto by 
congressional committees with jurisdiction over foreign aid money 
sen patrick leahy dvt sponsor of the provision was able to 
prevail over the objections of the bush administration because he 
won the support of sen dennis deconcini dariz considered a 
swing vote on the issue but republicans were confident they had the 
votes to remove the restrictions when the measure comes to the 
senate floor as early as next week 
bush already has managed to eliminate restrictions on salvadoran 
aid from a house version of the foreign aid bill passed in july 
cristianis government is involved in peace talks in mexico with 
the leftist fmln rebels aimed at ending a decade of fighting that 
has cost more than 70000 lives death squads linked to cristianis 
arena party have been blamed for most of the deaths 
the committee also removed from the bill a provision that would 
have let the president cut aid to greece so long as military aid 
money previously sent remains unspent greekamerican groups had 
lobbied hard to eliminate the provision 
and it scaled back from 85 million to 45 million a fund to 
support private enterprise in poland even the scaledback amount 
was far more than the 10 million bush promised during his trip to 
eastern europe in july 
the election of a new noncommunistdominated government in 
poland has made that country an irresistible object of praise and 
reward for us lawmakers but the panel apparently backed down from 
the figure leahys subcommittee had adopted a day earlier in the 
face of budget realities 
sen barbara mikulski dmd prevailed 1512 on her amendment to 
earmark 15 million for the united nations population fund which 
manages population control programs worldwide 
the reagan administration had banned money to the organization in 
1985 contending that the agency was supporting forced abortions and 
sterilization in china mikulskis amendment would require the 
agency to keep us funds in a separate account which cannot be used 
for any programs in china 
as usual the largest recipients of us foreign aid in the 
measure are israel with 18 billion in military aid and 12 
billion in economic aid and egypt which gets 13 billion in 
military and 815 million in economic aid 
the bill also includes 160 million for the multilateral 
assistance initiative for the philippines together with authority 
for the president to send an additional 40 million to meet his full 
request for 200 million the house voted 160 million for the 
program

methane gas ignited and flashed like a 
flame thrower through a coal mine wednesday killing 10 miners in 
the nations worst coal mine disaster in five years 
there were conflicting reports of the number of injuries in the 
930 am fire at the william station mine in western kentucky but 
its parent company costain coal inc said no one had been trapped 
underground 
the mine run by costains subsidiary pyro mining co had been 
cited by the federal mine safety and health administration for high 
levels of methane gas about two months ago costain president 
charles schulties acknowledged at a news conference wednesday night 
it was the fourth fatal accident at the mine since it opened in 
february 1983 including a 1986 death that may have been related to 
methane according to state and federal safety records nearly a 
year ago three miners were hurt in a blasting accident 
methane the major ingredient of natural gas is found naturally 
in coal seams mine ventilation systems normally keep it below 
explosive concentrations 
early in the day the kentucky state police and the msha reported 
three miners had been burned in the fire a document the company 
submitted to state officials included the names of two miners who 
were listed as being injured 
schulties however told a news conference about six hours after 
the fire that there were no injuries and officials at area 
hospitals reported receiving no injured miners webster county 
deputy coroner paul tompkins also said late wednesday that no miners 
had been injured 
there was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy 
the death toll made it the nations worst coal mine disaster 
since 27 miners were killed in 1984 in a mine in utah said msha 
spokesman frank ogorman 
the ignition point of the fire apparently was near part of a 
mining machine that was being dismantled to be moved ogorman said 
the exact cause of the fire was not immediately known but msha 
spokesman sam stafford said such fires are usually caused when a 
piece of metal equipment hits stone and causes a spark 
stafford said such fires are small but like a flame thrower 
company officials said the miners who died were about 1000 feet 
underground when the explosion occurred jim greenlee an executive 
vice president of costain coal said 14 to 15 miners were in the 
immediate area when the jet of flame erupted and another 15 workers 
within 1000 feet 
there was smoke in the area and it took some time to locate all 
the individuals greenlee said 
rescue teams were sent into the shaft to remove the bodies said 
state trooper ed brady 
theres an indication that some of them had survived the 
initial explosion and succumbed to the smoke and dust schulties 
said well know more about that when the coroner issues his 
report 
ogorman said the dead were believed to have died of carbon 
monoxide poisoning 
officials believed some of the dead miners survived initially 
because some of them were found wearing selfrescuing units which 
provide a source of fresh air for miners in emergencies schulties 
said he did not provide additional details 
public protection secretary teddy colley identified the dead as 
lynn ashmore and kenneth reed of slaughters roger clifford and mark 
hedges of morganfield rick ferguson and curtis scott of 
madisonville terry harris and anthony mcelroy of providence warren 
stewart of mortons gap and and james tinsley of marion no ages were 
immediately available 
police sealed off the area around the mine and families of the 
dead miners were directed to a company headquarters building just 
outside wheatcroft a town of about 300 people 
all employees were immediately pulled out of the mine and all 
workers had been accounted for schulties said kathy snyder an 
msha official who attended the news conference said her agency and 
the kentucky department of mines and minerals would begin an 
investigation on thursday 
the mine which schulties said employs 367 miners on three 
shifts is about 140 miles southwest of louisville and 40 miles 
southwest of evansville ind 
in 1986 a foreman died in an explosion at the mine a federal 
investigation determined that methane or dust had been set off by 
the improper use of explosives during blasting excessive 
accumulations of loose coal and coal dust were also blamed 
last sept 22 a blasting accident ignited gas or coal dust 
burning three miners according to state mine department records 
state inspectors ordered the mine closed that day but allowed it to 
reopen the next day 
in 1984 a worker was run over by a vehicle at the mine in 
separate accidents in 1985 a worker was crushed against a wall 
while working on a machine and a mechanic was electrocuted 
mayor larry cowan who worked 23 years in mines said most people 
of the town earn their livings in the coal industry 
we know invariably it could happen but its always supposed 
to be someone else cowan said 
the mine was described as a highly mechanized longwall operation 
in longwall mining a mining machine continuously moves a cutter 
from side to side along a long exposed coal face 
as the cutter is moved forward with conveyors which remove the 
loosened coal hydraulic jacks are positioned to support the newly 
exposed mine roof behind the jacks the layers of rock that form 
the roof are allowed to collapse 
before longwall mining techniques and machines were developed 
pillars of coal had to be left in the mine to support the overlying 
rock layers

prison rather than pay 200 in fines for refusing to be 
fingerprinted under japans alien registration law an official said 
the priest debion maxime 47 was jailed in yokohama prison an 
official from the yokohama district public prosecutors office said 
on condition of anonymity 
he said maxime who has lived in japan since 1974 was a resident 
of sagamihara city south of tokyo 
maxime refused to be fingerprinted when he applied for a 
registration card his refusal was a sympathy protest over the 
arrest of a south korean resident who refused to be fingerprinted in 
may 1985 
a local court subsequently ordered maxime to pay 684 but the 
priest refused to paye in june the fine was reduced to 200

a good idea despite her being under indictment 
maj david benson head of the honolulu police departments 
juvenile division said the former philippine first lady has a

percent are filipino benson said wednesday many are involved in 
drugrelated and violent crimes 
mrs marcos said she wanted to meet with gang members mostly 
teenage boys individually or in groups and listen to their 
problems 
i dont have to be their role model but everybody would like a 
friend everybody needs love she said

city opera officials canceled wednesdays season 
opener of the barber of seville after the musicians announced 
they will picket in full dress in a wage dispute with the company 
we will not perform while they are on strike said martin 
oppenheimer the companys attorney and board vice chairman future 
performances will be canceled until the strike is resolved he said 
the sad part about this is we will never have the 
performances that have to be canceled because of the strike he 
said 
judy west a spokeswoman for local 802 of the associated 
musicians of greater new york said a strike is always 
difficult especially on the musicians and is not welcomed by the 
union 
the 69 musicians voted in favor of the strike tuesday night after 
extensive negotiations west said the union served the company with 
a sevenday strike notice last week 
theyve gotten nowhere in climbing over two stumbling blocks 
west said 
the union wants wage parity with the lyric opera in chicago 
union officials say city opera musicians get 755 for 19 hours of 
work and chicago musicians get 1048 for a 21hour work week 
the union also wants guaranteed work weeks restored to the 
contract under the old contract the union says the orchestra was 
guaranteed 23 full weeks of work plus six weeks of added employment 
called supplemental employment benefits 
the company is offering only the 23 weeks of work 
oppenheimer said the lyric opera charges twice what city opera 
does and is the only game in town 
we have our own economics here in new york where costs are 
higher and competition more intense he said 
no negotiations were scheduled oppenheimer said

three weeks ago lothar klein asked 
his frail and aging mother if he should head to hungary in search of 
eventual freedom in the west 
she had tears in her eyes and gave me a hug said the burly 
27yearold electrician from weimar she told me son youve got 
to try it now while you have a good chance 
klein is among thousands of east germans who seized the 
opportunity to flee their communist homeland after hungary agreed to 
allow them passage to the west 
frequently the decision was difficult and painful 
even though i knew i had to go it was hard to leave klein 
said his voice choked with emotion i might never see her again 
the east german exodus comes amid widespread pressures for 
democratic reforms across the east bloc poland has become the first 
warsaw pact nation to install a government led by noncommunists 
hungary also is on the road to major reforms but east germany 
remains one of the east blocs most rigidly controlled states and 
has rejected calls for change 
refugees said they left because they no longer could bear the 
conditions 
for many the reality of their successful flight is just taking 
hold in a jumbled emotional mixture of joy wonder and longing for 
those left behind 
its hard to leave everything behind your family friends and 
possessions but then you look at your children and you say to 
yourself no im not going to let this happen to them im not 
going to let the perverse system ruin them said manfred lutz a 
35yearold electrical engineer from jena 
lutz said he was ostracized increasingly at his research 
institute after criticizing several of its management policies 
the system is so rigid if you speak out youre branded as a 
troublemaker and shuttled off to a less desirable job 
outside a crowded refugee center in downtown passau young east 
german couples wait impatiently in line to call home from a bank of 
public telephones 
inside the booth the wait will be longer still as constant busy 
signals remind them of the frustrating lack of phone lines in their 
homeland 
weve been trying for hours to call home sobbed a woman in 
her early 20s our parents still dont know we left 
most refugees left with only a few hastily packed belongings 
we didnt really want for any material comforts said sabine 
schoenborn an outgoing mother of two who instructed athletes in 
leipzig but life there becomes intolerable when you finally 
realize with horror that the system is not going to change not in 
your lifetime and probably not in your childrens 
her husband juergen said the family lived comfortably because 
of their careers in sports a major source of international prestige 
for the nation of 166 million 
i helped train some of our best athletes but you cant live 
without hope and that fades quickly when you recognize how 
impenetrable the system really is said schoenborn wearing a 
faded jeans jacket over a new jogging suit bought in passaus 
teeming shopping mall 
even before they left leipzig the shoenborns said they could see 
the growing impact of the exodus 
neighborhood shops had been forced to close because all the 
workers had left he said and their nearby medical clinic was left 
with only a few overworked doctors 
frank kuhnert a 29yearold stagelighting technician who worked 
at east berlins deutsches theater said the frustration of not 
being able to travel abroad and unnecessary daytoday hassles 
prompted him to give up a prestigious job 
i simply got tired of having to crawl to petty officials for 
every little thing youre treated like a child by goons with 
privileges whose job it is to see that you dont get any he said 
his request to join the stage crew that went abroad on company 
tours repeatedly was denied he said 
so you end up listening to other peoples stories about how 
great it was outside beyond the berlin wall 
many refugees expressed concern that their departure could make 
things worse for those who stay behind 
some people told us we would just make it harder for those who 
cant or dont want to leave said katrin albrecht a 24yearold 
music student from dresden 
but you have to do what you think is right even if its 
painful i just hope that what i and others have done will force the 
government to wake up and listen to the people clamoring for change 
for a little dignity in their lives she said

for hondurans in this isolated valley 
where a nicaraguan contra army has been camped the last 
yearandahalf has meant prosperity 
business is good well sell it all krystela rodriguez 
exulted she runs a shop crammed with everything from cologne and 
shampoo to powdered fruit drinks and baby shoes 
perhaps most remarkable for her 10 by 20foot shack 80 miles 
from the nearest paved road is the refrigerator which runs on 
electricity from a diesel generator that also provides power for a 
nearby contra encampment 
a cloud is on her horizon however the accord reached by central 
american leaders aug 7 calling for the contra army to disband by 
dec 8 she still has a lot of shampoo to sell and is concerned 
about being overstocked 
theres no future here after the contras leave said vladimir 
valenzuela who runs a bustling restaurant in danli 80 miles to the 
west 
eastern honduras has always been poor and sparsely populated the 
average agricultural worker earned 3 lempiras a day less than 1 
at the black market exchange rate farms were few small ranchers 
had no way to get their products to market 
the yamales area which has no more than a few hundred residents 
in normal times was almost completely abandoned in the mid1980s 
at the height of the contra campaign to topple the sandinista 
government in nicaragua 
the nicaraguan border is less than 10 miles away and the 
sandinista army swept through more than once in search of contras 
but when thousands of contra fighters began moving out of 
nicaragua after the united states cut off military aid early in 
1988 the impact was immediate on yamales 
the united states has kept up nonlethal aid contra fighters and 
their families began to find work and there was a market for 
practically everything 
the people of eastern honduras went to work 
las trojes 18 miles to the west and danli 60 miles away 
became boomtowns where many fighters relatives settled cheap 
hotels and restaurants served truck drivers and las trojes even had 
a small casino with rudimentary versions of craps and roulette 
a lot of them are doing real well theyve got a road now 
noted israel galeano the contra chief of staff known as commander 
franklin 
the contras built and maintain the road in from las trojes now 
more roads branch off that one many ranchers in the area are 
building wood corrals to replace old barbed wire ones 
the corral started getting too full and the animals starting 
cutting themselves on the wire said mercedes martinez she and 
her husband mario have cattle and chickens and sell milk meat and 
eggs to the contras 
nicaraguans have established small businesses and farms of their 
own as well especially in the roadless mountains that stretch 100 
miles northeast along the nicaraguahonduras border to bocay jungle 
has been cleared for cattle or corn crops 
paula zentena whose husband is a contra soldier found she could 
make money by altering usprovided fatigue uniforms for the contra 
soldiers 
theyre usually too baggy for the boys she said as she ran 
off a seam on her new treadlepowered sewing machine she rents 
space in a honduran house and has two nicaraguan fighters working 
for her charging 3 lempiras to alter a pair of pants 
balancio blandon a honduran who started out with a small shop 
has been able to build a new brick store and home for himself his 
wife and their five children he also bought a canon camera and now 
runs a photo service 
he doesnt see the boom coming to an end soon especially with 
us aid continuing until february and probably longer for contra 
families and wounded fighters in the area

a secret directive in president bushs 79 
billion drug program may allow a greater role for the us military 
in the cocaineproducing countries of bolivia colombia and peru 
here is a report on us efforts in those countries so far 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the us military presence is small but slowly spreading in the 
heart of south americas cocaine country 
expansion is most evident in peru where about 20 us army 
special forces members quietly arrived three months ago and are 
providing paramilitary training to national police in their battle 
against a fearsome alliance of cocaine traffickers and maoist 
guerrillas 
in bolivia where the fight is less dramatic but equally 
entrenched about a dozen green berets have been conducting training 
and support operations from lowprofile jungle base camps for years 
the confidential white house directive giving the american 
military more leeway in the drug war was crafted with peru and 
bolivia in mind according to officials in washington 
in colombia home to the biggest cocaine cartels us officials 
deny any military intentions beyond those associated with the 
delivery of hardware 
about 200 soldiers including advisers trainers and technicians 
accompanied the recent arrival of two c130 transport planes a37 
observation and attack jets uh1h huey helicopters and other 
equipment in an emergency us aid package for colombias 
antinarcotics offensive 
but us ambassador thomas mcnamara told reporters the us crews 
would get the gear working give some instruction and then get out 
most of them within a few hours or days 
colombian president virgilio barco repeatedly has insisted his 
country wants us money and equipment not troops 
direct american military action would almost inevitably produce a 
wave of antius nationalism and would certainly embarrass the 
barco government which has pressed for the united states to get out 
of central american conflicts 
peru and bolivia much poorer countries also oppose major us 
troop involvement but have allowed some training and support 
personnel to operate 
in peru about 20 bilingual green berets began instructing 
antinarcotics police at a special base near the central jungle town 
of satipo officials from the us embassy in lima told the 
associated press 
its intensive training almost oneonone said embassy 
spokesman gene bigler theyre taking small groups of 40 to 50 
policemen and training them five weeks at a time 
theres one whole section on entering and leaving helicopters 
under fire 
he said the policemen also are taught map reading battlefield 
first aid jungle patrols and night patrols 
its the same kind of paramilitary training that dea agents are 
now getting before they arrive in peru bigler said 
the training program is designed to last two years with 
peruvians then taking over the instruction 
bigler said us authorities hoped the trained peruvian officers 
would be assigned to a newly built heavily fortified police 
garrison at santa lucia 
several former green berets on contract to the us government 
for antinarcotics efforts in peru designed the santa lucia base 
which includes an airstrip big enough for c130s three helicopter 
pads and nine buildings ringed by barbed wire and mines 
it is the centerpiece in a new militarized strategy in peru 
where most of the worlds coca is cultivated much of it is grown in 
jungle areas controlled by the shining path a maoist guerrilla 
organization 
santa lucia is probably better fortified than most military 
bases in peru said craig chretien the drug enforcement 
administration chief in peru 
pistolpacking dea agents have been seen routinely accompanying 
bolivian colombian and peruvian police in raids on cocaine 
processing laboratories and traffickers jungle hideouts about six 
us border patrol agents assist in interdiction efforts they are 
all under strict orders to avoid armed clashes 
dea agents are among the us militarys harshest critics 
speaking privately they contend that us soldiers lack 
political sensitivity they fear an increased american military role 
would bruise latin egos and ruin relations with local authorities 
and sources 
if the special forces come down here on raids i am pulling out 
of here they are going to come down here thinking this is a war 
zone and start shooting at farmers when what you need here is 
another kind of presence said one dea agent in bolivia 
when green berets accompanied bolivian police on a raid in april 
a us soldier walked off with a confiscated shortwave radio 
insulting a police commander who told him the radio had to be 
properly registered sources said dea agents had to intervene in 
the dispute 
nonetheless about a dozen green berets have worked with the 
bolivian police forces elite antinarcotics division called the 
leopards for more than two years it is widely acknowledged that 
disclipine among the leopards has improved 
the us embassy in la paz the bolivian capital said it is 
ready to extend the instruction program 
us troops will not seek out conflict or combat but we are 
prepared to expand our training role embassy spokesman bruce 
wharton said 
the biggest us military splash in the drug battle was made in 
july 1986 when 175 us soldiers descended on bolivia and helped 
the leopards raid laboratories in the countrys tropical lowlands 
the threemonth operation drove traffickers underground and 
paralyzed cocaine processing operations in bolivia the source of up 
to 30 percent of the worlds cocaine 
but officials reported no noticeable effect on the flow of the 
potent white powder from south america to the united states

speed limit has been flashing on about half a dozen of the lighted 
signs in northern new jersey because of a computer programming 
error the legal limit is 55 mph 
gordon hector a spokesman for the turnpike authority said 
technicians were trying to track down the problem meanwhile 
workers are adjusting the errant signs manually 
some motorists find it funny 
it was kind of strange to see everybody below the speed limit 
for a change joked casey raskob an attorney from springfield

result but i dont think any judge is gonna buy that excuse for 
speeding he said

lawmakers have launched an inquiry into 
reports of american israeli and british mercenaries operating 
freely in colombia to train scores of paramilitary groups including 
drug traffickers 
colombian congressmen along with minister of defense gen oscar 
botero watched a film wednesday night at the congress building of 
alleged paramilitary training in colombia 
scenes included men firing guns from moving vehicles practicing 
assaults on houses and taking explosives training the film was 
made available by the bogota television news program noticiero 
nacional 
a colombian police general who appeared at the hearings wednesday 
said in a televised interview he had told lawmakers a month ago that 
foreign mercenaries were training the paramilitary groups 
the general miguel daza marquez heads colombias administrative 
security police which handles national criminal investigations 
foreign minister julio londono paredes told the lawmakers 
however that the ministry had no proof foreign mercenaries had 
actually trained colombian drug traffickers or paramilitary groups 
but he acknowledged there were no restrictions on many foreigners 
who want to travel to this south american republic 
british german and israeli nationals in accordance with 
agreements with the respective countries dont need a visa to enter 
this country said the foreign minister as for nationals of the 
united states they only need a tourist card 
colombian media reported last month that former israeli army 
colonel yair klein and other foreign mercenaries trained drug 
traffickers hit squads in colombia 
the traffickers have used their private armies to recruit 
rightwing death squads that have killed more than 1000 colombian 
leftists in the last four years 
the congressional investigation comes amid a usbacked war that 
president virgilio barco declared on the worlds most powerful drug 
cartels after the assassination aug 18 of sen luis carlos galan a 
popular presidential candidate and foe of the drug barons 
in medellin home of a leading drug gang mayor juan gomez on 
wednesday lifted a nighttime curfew imposed two weeks ago in an 
attempt to stem a rash of bombings killings and arson blamed on the 
traffickers 
motorists still must drive at night with their inside lights on 
however and there is a ban on motorcycles from 630 pm to 6 am 
most firebombings in the city are the work of speeding motorcyclists 
gomez said he lifted the curfew because his city had returned to 
absolute normalcy no bombs had exploded in medellin for three 
days 
the lifting of the curfew highlights the mayors disagreement 
with the government about how to deal with narcoterrorism 
gomez favors negotiating with the drug barons a tactic barco 
rejects 
also wednesday the government reinforced security in the 
medellin region sending hundreds of additional police and soldiers 
to antioquia state 
medellin a city of 2 million people is the capital of antioquia 
the measures followed the assassination monday of former medellin 
mayor pablo pelaez gonzalez by unidenfied gunmen pelaez was an avid 
drug fighter 
the government vows to continue its crackdown but colombias 
most wanted trafficking suspects have so far eluded the manhunt 
barco said he will extradite those traffickers who are arrested 
and wanted in the united states 
the only alleged drug cartel member extradited in the crackdown 
so far is eduardo martinez romero charged with laundering more than 
a billion dollars of cocaine money

hugo became a hurricane wednesday evening as it sped 
westward toward the caribbean but forecasters said it was too early 
to determine whether it was a threat to land 
the longer it heads west the more concern it is to us said 
hal gerrish a forecaster for the national hurricane center but 
were not sure yet where it will go there are too many things that 
can happen 
hugos most recent predecessors hurricanes dean erin and 
gabrielle turned north into the open atlantic before reaching the 
caribbean gerrish noted but last years killer hurricane gilbert 
remained on the westward course wreaking havoc on the caribbean and 
mexico 
at 1030 pm edt hugos center was located near 129 north 
latitude and 463 west longitude or about 965 miles east of the 
easternmost lesser antilles and was moving west at 20 mph 
sustained winds reached 75 mph just over the hurricane threshold 
and further strengthening was expected 
meanwhile gabrielle was downgraded to an extratropical storm as 
it moved through the north atlantic and the center stopped issuing 
bulletins on it its last position was about 225 miles southeast of 
cape race newfoundland canada moving northeast at 20 to 25 mph 
with winds of 55 mph 
gabrielle and hugo are the seventh and eighth named storms of the 
1989 atlantic hurricane season they become storms when sustained 
winds reach 39 mph and are classified as hurricanes when the 
strength increases to 74 mph

william f buckley jr says the presidents 
drug plan is doomed to failure and the nation might have better 
luck fighting drugs by legalizing them 
if bushs plan could work then i would favor it the 
conservative pundit told reporters wednesday at the university of 
mississippi before a broadcast of his tv talk show firing line 
our borders are indefensible he said explaining the 
legalization rationale the overhead cost for penetrating the us 
borders is only 3 percent of the street value of imported illegal 
drugs we should attack what we can legalize drugs and concentrate 
on drug education 
thats not to say buckley is soft on drug abusers hes 
especially ready to crack down on those who sell drugs to minors 
in my case i would support capital punishment

the president of the european jewish congress has 
disputed a french colleagues claim that the organization has backed 
a call for freezing all formal contacts between jewish groups and 
the roman catholic church 
they have not been frozen this is not my interpretation of 
what was said or wanted lionel kopelowitz british president of 
the 17nation organization said wednesday 
but french delegate theo klein the congress past president and 
chief jewish negotiator in a dispute over a carmelite convent at the 
nazi death camp at auschwitz in occupied poland reiterated that the 
congress backed freezing formal highlevel contacts 
kopelowitz and klein commented in interviews on questions arising 
from a news conference they held monday after the congress twoday 
annual meeting 
the london meeting largely behind closed doors was dominated by 
the issue of the convent which many jews regard as offensive of 
the 4 million people killed at the auschwitz death camp in world war 
ii 25 million were jews 
klein led an international jewish negotiating team that in 1987 
reached an agreement with a polish catholic representative to 
relocate the convent by feb 22 
but the convent remains and the polish primate cardinal jozef 
glemp has said the accord was not negotiated by competent people 
at mondays news conference klein said that on july 20 he told 
french cardinal albert decourtray in a letter that all dialogue 
and official meetings were frozen until the carmelite convent 
dispute was resolved 
klein added that the european jewish congress meeting had 
endorsed this position because this decision was the decision of 
the jewish delegation and all the work of the jewish delegation was 
approved by the conference 
kopelowitz seated beside klein on monday did not contradict 
this statement although he referred several times to the formal 
resolutions passed by the meeting these made no mention of a freeze 
in catholicjewish relations although they did endorse the position 
of the jewish negotiating team 
hayim pinner secretarygeneral of the board of deputies of 
british jews said wednesday that kleins interpretation of this as 
endorsing a freezing of formal contacts was reasonably fair but 
perhaps he went a bit far 
my sensitivity in interpretation would be that without having 
specifically discussed this or specifically endorsed it there was 
an undercurrent of feeling that we couldnt engage in major 
negotiations have business as usual said pinner 
european jewish congress sources said on condition of anonymity 
wednesday that kopelowitz did not intervene because he felt that if 
he had headlines will appear in all the papers saying jewish 
leaders are in disagreement 
the sources said that instead kopelowitz tried gently to 
draw attention to the formal resolutions 
the sources also said kopelowitz had not invited klein to join 
him at the news conference 
klein in a telephone interview from paris said the congress 
approved the freezing of catholicjewish relations as set out in his 
july letter he said the letter was not a personal position but 
had been approved by the jewish negotiating team and other jewish 
organizations 
reiterating that the congress had supported the letter klein 
said because it was not the important point of our deliberations 
you have no mention of that in the resolutions we took 
the conflicting views appear to reflect differences about the 
repercussions of the dispute on jewishcatholic relations 
both kopelwitz and klein agreed that informal contacts continue 
these include kleins contacts with european cardinals who want the 
1987 accord honored and the convent removed 
but klein argued that all formal contacts are frozen and he said 
catholics understand this because the convent dispute overshadows 
catholicjewish relations

political analysts view ed kochs defeat in new 
yorks mayoral primary as sweet revenge for jesse jackson and 
are speculating whether it will spur the twotime presidential 
candidate into a race for mayor of the nations capital 
he really does need to get his hands on an office somewhere 
said robert beckel manager of walter mondales 1984 presidential 
campaign a role in which he had frequent and often frustrating 
dealings with jackson 
ann lewis a close jackson adviser in the 1988 presidential 
campaign said black politicians such as david dinkins the winner 
of the democratic mayoral primary in new york were encouraged 
and in some cases empowered by jacksons presidential bids 
their success she added raises more and more the suggestion 
that he should be doing the same for all the reasons he encourages 
them and voters to put their energies into the immediate political 
process are the same reasons why he might be encouraged to do the 
same 
jackson is described by associates as strongly interested in 
running for mayor of washington even if it requires challenging the 
incumbent marion barry an old friend from the days both were active 
in the civil rights movement 
barry has been forced repeatedly to deny rumors of cocaine use a 
federal grand jury is investigating barrys alleged ties to a 
convicted drug dealer 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown another jackson 
associate was less willing to read too much about jackson into the 
new york election results 
i think it is really truly purely a david dinkins victory 
said the party chairman 
asked if the results would have any impact on jacksons future 
brown replied i dont see it he pointed out that he took the 
same view when a jacksonbacked candidate was defeated in the race 
for mayor of chicago earlier in the year 
i think we tend to maybe overplay those things when they 
happen he said 
but there could be little doubt that the defeat of koch who said 
during the 1988 new york presidential primary campaign that jewish 
voters would have to be crazy to support jackson was satisfying 
to the former presidential candidate 
it settled the score he had with koch said beckel 
it is sweet revenge said bill schneider a political analyst 
at the american enterprise institute who has written extensively on 
democratic party affairs one of his jacksons top priorities 
was getting rid of ed koch 
schneider called jackson the spokesman for movement politics of 
the left 
it was not a personal victory for jackson he went on it 
was a victory for his model of politics in which the democratic 
party is led by the left the question is is this a winning 
strategy even in new york 
dinkins still faces republican rudolph giuliani in the november 
general election 
i dont want to call it revenge said lewis who went on to 
say that kochs defeat clearly had its roots in that 1988 new 
york primary 
she said the mayor never recovered in the eyes of a 
substantial number of the citys white voters exit polls indicated 
dinkins received up to a third of the white vote against koch and 96 
percent of the black vote

evangelist oral roberts the faith healer who 
built a religious empire on the credo expect a miracle says he 
cant wait for divine intervention to save his ministrys hospital 
and medical school 
because of 25 million in debts the hospital will be closed by 
the end of the year and the medical school next year roberts said 
wednesday his home four other ministryowned houses and a 
university housing complex will be sold to pay off the debts he 
said 
i hope we can look back at this and say this wasnt a 
failure the 71yearold pioneer of television evangelism told 
reporters i dont think its as bad a day as it seems i think 
well look back on this and think its the right thing 
roberts said the action would help keep the 4300student oral 
roberts university financially secure 
mayor rodger randle agreed adding that the city of faith 
hospital which opened in 1981 was born in controversy and was a 
big gamble on the proposition that a national medical market could 
be created 
roberts built the hospital with a 777bed capacity but state 
regulators only approved filling 294 beds and the highest average 
occupancy was 148 in 1984 still roberts said i would do it 
again 
the ministrys financial problems were compounded by a drop in 
monthly contributions that roberts blamed on a spirit of 
skepticism in the wake of scandals involving fellow evangelists 
jim bakker and jimmy swaggart 
roberts himself caused a furor in 1986 when he announced he 
needed 8 million for his medical school by april 1 1987 or god 
would end his life the money was raised 
on wednesday roberts raised the possibility of some miracle 
providing a 50 million endowment he says is needed 
who knows that when this is known across america that someone 
we might have been dealing with or someone we havent been dealing 
with might say ive got the 50 million roberts said but he 
is not waiting for a benefactor 
integrity means we have to tell our students now roberts 
said we feel that integrity demands that we give them a full 
years notice 
dr larry edwards dean of the medical school said its charter 
will become inactive when classes end next may but its 
accreditation could be reactivated later 
the hospital part of a futuristic complex with 60story 
30story and 20story goldtiled towers will be leased and the 
revenue generated dedicated to the ministrys endowment roberts 
said 
the ministrys five homes and an 830unit apartment complex will 
be sold said chief fiscal officer mark swadener oral roberts 
6328squarefoot fourbedroom home was valued at about 500000 in 
1987 his son richards 7091squarefoot twostory home was valued 
at 547000 that year 
swadener did not have an estimate of how much money the actions 
announced wednesday would generate 
after the dust has settled well take a look at it he said 
roberts said he had an emotional meeting with students faculty 
and ministry workers to explain the crisis 
i asked the lord to not let me cry because ive cried all the 
tears i thought i could cry and sure enough i didnt cry he 
said 
edwards said 600 hospital staff members would be affected 
many will be able to find work at one of the citys five other 
hospitals predicted ira schlezinger vice president of hillcrest 
medical center in tulsa 
edwards said 147 students are enrolled in the medical school and 
about 100 faculty members are on contract until the end of the 
school year nongraduating students will be assisted in obtaining 
transfers to other medical schools he said 
students expressed optimism 
its not going to stop me from being a doctor and its not 
going to stop me from being a medical missionary said david 
chorley 
if the 50 million doesnt come in god will provide me with 
another medical school said doug rober

if you think a fastfood chicken sandwich is a 
healthy alternative to a hamburger think again a report today says 
typical fastfood chicken and fish is just as bad and sometimes 
worse than burgers and fries by the time they are cooked coated 
and fried they are loaded with fat 
the report by the massachusetts medical society notes that folks 
often choose a chicken sandwich or nuggets in the mistaken belief 
that these foods are better for them than beef 
many people are quite surprised to find that the total fat in a 
single hamburger may be 13 grams but six chicken nuggets may have 20 
grams of fat said connie roberts 
in contrast a fish sandwich by the time its coated and has a 
slice of cheese and sauce is up to 25 grams of fat 
put another way a fastfood chicken patty sandwich contains as 
much fat as 1 pints of ice cream 
roberts a brigham and womens hospital dietitian who wrote the 
report said fastfood chains should give consumers more information 
about what they are eating her report published in the new england 
journal of medicine recommends that the chains 
reveal the type and quantity of fat in food as well as the 
amount of protein vitamins and minerals 
provide printed menus for people who want to restrict their 
intake of salt calories or fat 
identify the nutrient content of items on salad bars 
especially such selections as potato salad and dressings 
offer such alternatives as lowfat or skim milk margarine 
lowfat salad dressings and wholegrain buns 
i find that my clients and patients are very well aware of the 
recommendation to include more fish and chicken in their diets 
she said in their natural state they are indeed much lower in 
saturated fat and total fat than red meats unfortunately what we 
forget when the order is placed is the method of preparation that 
goes into chicken sandwiches and chicken nuggets 
in fairness to the fastfood industry the report notes that 
nutrientpoor fatfilled food also can be found at home in 
highpriced restraurants and in school cafeterias however because 
so many people eat fast food onefifth of all americans every day 
the medical profession should be concerned about its effect on 
health and nutrition the report said 
the report noted that in general fast food is high in fat salt 
and protein but low in fiber vitamins and other nutrients 
among specifics gathered from a variety of research 
between 40 and 55 percent of calories in most fastfood meals 
come from fat several health organizations recommend that no more 
than 30 percent of the days calories come from fat 
chicken nuggets and chickenpatty sandwiches often are made 
with chicken skin which is high in fat they also may be cooked in 
beef tallow or in vegetable oil thats high in saturated fat 
six chicken nuggets have 310 calories and nearly 60 percent of 
the calories are from fat 
a double hamburger with sauce milkshake and regularsize 
french fries contain 1275 calories thats between half and 80 
percent of the recommended daily calories for a woman under age 50 
a typical fastfood sandwich contains between 700 and 900 
milligrams of sodium some of them such as a cheeseburger with 
bacon may exceed the entire recommended daily allowance 
roberts said many doctors and other health workers are reluctant 
to simply tell patients to stay away from fast food 
they realize thats impractical advice she said we do 
better if we train our patients about what to order when they go 
into a fast food restaurant

legislation reforming the commodity futures 
trading industry will strengthen the authority of federal 
regulators say lawmakers 
the commodity futures improvements act which passed the house 
420to0 on wednesday makes sweeping changes in trading practices 
exposed in last months indictments of 45 brokers and traders and a 
clerk at the chicago mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade 
the bill also would give extra muscle to the commodity futures 
trading commission which congressional critics have called too 
gentle a watchdog of the nations futures markets 
with this action the house makes clear that the integrity of 
futures markets will be maintained and that the publics interest 
will be protected said rep glenn english dokla who 
cosponsored the bill with rep thomas coleman rmo 
this bill is an attempt to restore public confidence to these 
markets said coleman 
the bill if passed by the senate and signed by the president 
would 
ban insider trading on the nations 13 active futures exchanges 
require floor traders those who trade only for themselves and 
not for outside customers to register with the cftc 
limit trading among broker associations that could conflict with 
customers accounts and 
severely restrict the practice of dual trading 
in dual trading floor traders on an exchange can trade for 
themselves as well as their customers on the same day while not 
illegal the practice has raised questions about whether traders 
take care of themselves ahead of their customers supporters of the 
practice say it helps maintain market liquidity when there are few 
customer orders 
the house also added an amendment that would require that future 
presidential appointees to the cftc have some demonstrated 
knowledge of futures trading its regulation or the production 
merchandising processing or distribution of goods subject to 
futures contracts 
we can no longer afford to conduct onthejob training for the 
agencys commissioners said english the amendments sponsor 
president bush has nominated margot machol a member of the 
federal trade commission with little experience in commodity futures 
matters to a spot on the fivemember cftc 
the senate has yet to take up the cftcs reauthorization but 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the agriculture nutrition 
and forestry committee said last week he was asking staffers to 
draw up legislation to correct gaps in the agencys surveillance of 
trading activities 
the house bill also requires exchanges to maintain accurate 
trading records so investigators can reconstruct any given 
transaction 
the chicago indictments included numerous charges of customers 
defrauded through falsified trading records transactions on the 
chicago exchanges as well as others around the country use 
handwritten paper cards to record sales and purchases with the 
trader entering the information 
within weeks of the indictments the two big chicago exchanges 
announced they were working to develop handheld computer terminals 
to record floor trading 
one year after enactment the bill would require exchanges to 
develop systems that would pinpoint the time of a trades execution 
to within one minute of its occurrence 
that standard would be tightened to 30 seconds within three years 
of enactment 
the bill also would make permanent the cftc which congress has 
reauthorized on a temporary basis every three or four years since it 
was created in 1974

a senior kgb official says the fourman british spy 
ring that betrayed western secrets to moscow for more than three 
decades was aided by a fifth man a london newspaper reported today 
the independent quoted yuri modin as saying in moscow wednesday 
when asked by its reporter rupert cornwell if there was a fifth 
member yes there was 
there has been repeated news media speculation in britain over 
the years about the existence of a socalled fifth man 
the independent identified modin as the soviet intelligence 
agencys key contact with one of the ring kim philby and the 
controller of three other members anthony blunt guy burgess and 
donald maclean 
cornwell reported that he spoke with modin following a news 
conference given in moscow wednesday by kgb officers and attended by 
foreign reporters 
the news conference was held after the screening of a film called 
the kgb today made by the soviet government news agency novosti 
and billed as the first soviet documentary about the organization 
cornwell said the film identified modin who was an attache at 
the soviet embassy in london in 1951 as a kgb colleague who had 
worked with kim philby abroad 
but cornwell said reference works on the spy ring showed that 
modin was no mere friend of philby during the last 25 years of his 
life in moscow 
he reported that modin had been controller of anthony 
blunt and of guy burgess and donald maclean when they fled in 1951 
for years after that he would remain the key soviet contact of 
philby himself 
cornwell added i inquired of mr modin after the press 
conference well then was there really a fifth man yes there 
was said the person better placed to know than anyone 
cornwell continued and so the obvious question who was he 
british counterintelligence has been trying to work that one out 
without success for nearly 30 years now was all mr modin would 
answer 
cornwell gave no other details on this 
philby became a soviet agent in 1933 when he ran the soviet desk 
of britains mi6 agency responsible for gathering foreign 
intelligence he told the soviets who was spying on them 
he served in washington as liason officer with the us central 
intelligence agency fled to moscow in 1963 while posing as a 
journalist in beirut and died in moscow in may 1988 at age 76 
art historian blunt recruited spies for moscow in the 1930s and 
spied for the soviets during world war ii while working for 
britains mi5 counterintelligence service 
he was unmasked in 1964 but was granted immunity in return for 
information about soviet spying he was publicly exposed in 1979 and 
stripped of his knighthood awearded for his services as art adviser 
to queen elizabeth ii he died in london in march 1983 at age 75 
burgess became a soviet agent in the 1930s he worked as a 
british diplomat in washington and looked after far eastern affairs 
during the korean war 
maclean was posted to washington as a british diplomat in 1944 
but was recalled home because of heavy drinking he worked with 
americans and canadians on the combined policy committee for joint 
atomic development and gave the soviets documents on nuclear 
planning 
burgess and maclean fled to moscow in 1951 when tipped by philby 
that they were about to be arrested burgess died in moscow in 1963 
at age 52 maclean died there in 1983 at age 69 
veteran defense correspondent chapman pincher and former mi5 
officer peter wright whose book spycatcher the british 
government failed to suppress after lengthy court battles have both 
alleged that the late sir roger hollis was almost certainly a soviet 
spy hollis was head of mi5 from 1956 to 1965 
but prime minister mrs thatcher told parliament in 1981 
following publication of pinchers book their trade is treachery 
that investigators probing allegations against hollis had found no 
evidence incriminating him they therefore concluded he was not been 
a soviet agent she said

commercial banks could be headed toward a 
record oneyear gain in earnings with the government reporting their 
highest sixmonth earnings ever and 7 billion in profits in the 
second quarter of 1989 
i think the industry has a chance to beat last years alltime 
record earnings chairman l william seidman of the federal 
deposit insurance corp said wednesday as the agency posted the 
apriljune earnings report 
but seidman cautioned that the years earnings figures could be 
dampened by troubles involving third world debt real estate loans 
and the state of the economy 
commercial banks recorded profits of 251 billion in 1988 
the fdic which insures bank deposits said profits at the 12944 
commercial banks in the second quarter were down from the record 
73 billion in the januarymarch period but both quarters 
combined totaled 143 billion topping all previous sixmonth 
records 
banks increased their real estate lending by 128 percent while 
boosting commercial lending by only 22 percent the fdic report 
said 
second quarter profits rose in 39 states the district of 
columbia and puerto rico but fell in 11 states according to john 
j quinn iii fdic senior banking analyst 
among those states reporting falling profits were connecticut 
massachusetts new york and rhode island 
overall were seeing a shift of problems from the southwest to 
the northeast but the northeast has nowhere near the kind of 
problems the southwest has experienced in recent years following 
the decline in oil prices seidman said at a briefing 
the fdic report said the increase in nonperforming assets in 
the eastern regions has come from troubled loans to developing 
countries and real estate 
the report added recent trends in southwest bank performance 
suggest that the prolonged deterioration of that regions banking 
sector may have finally ended 
but it pointed out southwest banks still have the highest 
percentage of nonperforming assets more than twice the national 
average as well as the highest percentage of banks on the fdics 
problem list 
and despite the profits banks continued to fail at a high rate 
the fdic said 101 banks have failed or required government 
assistance this year the same number as in the first half of 1988 
for all of last year a postdepression record of 221 failed 
the fdic said the 12944 banks operating at the end of june was a 
record low since the agency was created in 1934 in addition to the 
bank failures it attributed the low number to fewer new banks and 
the conversion of multibank holding company subsidiaries into 
branches 
but it said the number of problem banks has slipped to 1356 
the lowest level in four years and down from 1455 a year ago

in a venture thats part history 
and part high technology scientists are scanning the bottom of lake 
champlain for the last missing boat of benedict arnolds sunken 
fleet 
in the cabin skipper dick furbush and a crew of 
sailorscientists are keeping track of two sonars one to show the 
depth of the water below the other a stateofthe art sidescanner 
that looks for underwater objects 
on the deck of the university of vermont research vessel 
historian art cohn from the lake champlain maritime museum regales 
listeners with tales of arnolds exploits on the lake during the 
revolutionary war 
that was before frustration with a stalled career and financial 
woes drove arnold to treason his plot to betray the rebels post at 
west point ny was discovered and foiled but he escaped and 
joined the british 
from 1775 to 1777 benedict arnold was one of the best field 
commanders the americans had cohn said that story is 
frequently forgotten because of his later treason 
while it isnt the only purpose of the twoweek lake exploration 
most of those aboard the melosira are hoping for a prize find the 
providence it is the last unaccounted for vessel of five that 
arnold ordered burned in ferris bay now called arnolds bay to 
prevent their capture by the british 
the torpedoshaped sidescan sonar searches a 600footwide swath 
of lake bed by bouncing sound waves off of the bottom and whatever 
may lie on it electrical impulses carry the findings through 
hundreds of feet of cable back to the cabin of the melosira where 
marine scientist story fish interprets spots and squiggles that 
appear on a roll of special graph paper 
if the providence were to appear it would be about that big 
fish said plopping the plastic cap of a ballpoint pen on the paper 
divers and sonar have been used with increasing frequency in the 
lake in recent years in an attempt to piece together details on the 
crucial role lake champlain played as a naval theater in the 
revolutionary war 
the goal cohn said is not to bring historic ships up but to 
examine them as closely as possible and leave them in the cold 
fresh water that has preserved them for more than 200 years 
its a good stable environment cohn said you bring them 
up and they start to deteriorate if we leave them there future 
generations will have the same opportunity to study them but with 
better technology 
lake champlain the nations sixth largest body of fresh water 
has what is widely regarded as the best collection of historic 
shipwrecks in the united states he said 
the one exception to the leaveitonthebottom rule was another 
of the ships in arnolds original fleet the philadelphia which was 
raised in 1935 and is now on display at the smithsonian institution 
in washington the lake champlain maritime museum in the vermont 
village of basin harbor is working on an exact replica of the 
54foot 29ton philadelphia 
cohn said the aim of the research is to learn more about the 
motives and methods of the british and americans as they prepared 
for and then met in the battle of valcour island on oct 1113 1776 
the americans had held fort ticonderoga at the southern end of 
the lake since it was taken by arnold ethan allen and the green 
mountain boys in may 1775 just three weeks after the war began 
with battles at lexington and concord 
the british had amassed a large and powerful fleet on the 
northern end of the lake at st johns quebec 
when the forces met near valcour island the british easily 
outgunned the smaller revolutionary navy on oct 11 and were ready 
to finish it off the next day one of the ships sunk on that first 
day of battle was the providence 
in a move still admired for its daring arnold led his tattered 
fleet singlefile through the british blockade under cover of 
darkness the british were left to chase the americans against the 
wind the next day 
arnold knew he was defeated so he destroyed most of what 
remained of his own fleet 
he and his troops fled overland to ticonderoga ny and the 
battleweary british returned to canada for the winter 
the delay gave the americans a chance to prepare for a series of 
engagements that ended with the british defeat at the pivotal battle 
at saratoga ny on oct 17 1777

the bush administrations agreement to share 
us technology with japan for a new 6 billion jet fighter will go 
forward after the senates failure by one vote to restrict the deal 
the congress has lost this struggle the president has 
prevailed said sen alan dixon dill after the senate on 
wednesday sustained presidents bushs veto of legislation aimed at 
shortcircuiting the technology transfer the 6434 roll call vote 
fell one short of the twothirds majority required to override a 
veto 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said bush was very 
pleased at the result which came after the white house and some 
lawmakers accused the legislations supporters of trying to 
monopolize power over trade regulation 
dixon and other senators opposed to the fsx fighter deal vowed to 
oppose similar agreements with other nations including one now 
under consideration between the united states and south korea 
i think the administration will come to regret what has 
occurred here dixon said this is a very unsound unfavorable 
agreement for us 
the vote means the 6 billion codevelopment coproduction 
agreement with japan will go forward with the aim of producing an 
advanced high technology japanese fighter by the end of the 1990s 
rep terry l bruce dill one of the leading opponents of the 
fsx deal in the house said the senate gave away the technology in 
the one industry where we have worldwide preeminence 
i hope the president can negotiate a better agreement with 
south korea bruce said it would be tragic to give away the 
technology a second time 
the agreement calls for development by general dynamics and 
mitsubishi heavy industries of an advanced version of the f16 
fighter named fsx 
the senate legislation would have barred japan from transferring 
us aerospace technology to third parties or to its own civilian 
aerospace industry 
administration supporters said those concerns already had been 
satisfied 
in vetoing the fsx resolution on july 31 bush tried to shift the 
debate to constitutional grounds a theme adopted by senators on 
both sides of the issue 
i cannot accept binding provisions that would tie my hands 
in the exercise of my constitutional responsibilities to conduct 
foreign policy he said 
bush said the legislation would inject the general accounting 
office an agency of the legislative branch into the administration 
of the jet program in a highly intrusive manner trespassing on 
the constitutional powers of the president 
and he said it would require the reopening of negotiations 
damage the prospects for a successful agreement and damage the 
usjapanese security relationship 
speaking immediately before the vote senate republican leader 
bob dole of kansas urged colleagues to forego meddling and 
micromanagement 
but senators seeking to overturn including a number of 
republicans said the veto represented a direct threat to the power 
specifically granted congress by the constitution to regulate trade 
if we agree with the veto then there has been a very 
substantial rollback in the authority of the congress of the united 
states on issues related to international trade said sen john c 
danforth rmo 
this is trying to muscle the other fellow off the beach

workers finished scrubbing the last 
stretches of prince william sound shoreline that exxon plans to 
clean this year as valdez prepares for a raucous weekend to mark the 
summer cleanups end 
the party comes even though the cleanup from the nations worst 
oil spill remains uncompleted 
major tasks for today and friday included treating the shoreline 
with fertilizer to stimulate microorganisms into attacking the oil 
exxon spokesman joe tucker said wednesday 
at the height of the cleanup exxon had about 12000 people 
working on the effort with about a quarter on the sullied shores 
exxon has been scaling back for two weeks with the goal of ending 
the cleanup friday 
friday also marks the 25week anniversary of the wreck of the 
exxon valdez which dumped nearly 11 million gallons of alaskan 
crude when it struck a reef south of valdez 
the final 700 shoreline workers will be returned to valdez 
through saturday tucker said they will be joined by about 400 
sailors and marines who will arrive next weekend for three days of 
leave in the busy oil port an estimated 100 reporters and 
photographers also have arrived 
the expected deluge of tired workers and servicemen combined 
with plans for a huge party sunday sponsored by exxons two major 
cleanup contractors has city officials worried 
our little police department will have its hands full said 
gary hennigh acting city manager we hear about the 20 to 25 kegs 
that have been ordered and that its just going to be a grand old 
time 
that many people with that much free beer after being out in 
the boondocks for a few months could be pretty wild and wooly 
police chief bert cottle said he is concerned his 14officer 
staff may be overwhelmed 
theyre talking anywhere from 500 to 1000 people at that 
party cottle said this might be the biggest weekend we ever 
had 
hennigh fears the prospect of hundreds of men descending on 
valdez with fat cleanup paychecks could have another side effect 
i suppose if there are any entrepreneurial unemployed hookers 
up in anchorage and they knew that there was going to be such a 
massive onslaught of men with money in their pockets they might 
show up in valdez he said 
the streets of valdez were relatively quiet wednesday as 
residents enjoyed the first sunshine in several days clouds as 
large as the mountains that tower over prince william sound hovered 
near town however warning of the end of summer 
exxon decided to end the cleanup in midseptember because of the 
prospect of increasingly severe weather state officials have 
criticized the pullout arguing that the weather may allow efforts 
to continue into november 
gov steve cowper on friday will announce what the state will do 
this winter to monitor spillaffected areas and to protect resources 
threatened with further damage said steve provant of the state 
department of environmental conservation 
provant said the state does not plan to take over the cleanup on 
a large scale during the winter provant said we dont have the 
resources to do it he said 
exxon says it has done all it can to clean up more than 1000 
miles of shoreline but state authorities say much of the job is 
unfinished 
us environmental protection agency administrator william reilly 
said sunday that the federal government will have the final say on 
the adequacy of the cleanup next spring when a new survey will be 
made 
reilly defended exxons withdrawal of workers this week saying 
my sense is that the weather is such there that it would be very 
risky to leave a lot of those folks in that exposed position

government population figures show rural 
america continues to gain people but some experts say new urban 
maps in 1990 may show a different picture 
about 648 million people or 25 percent of the us population 
lived in rural areas in 1988 an increase of more than 900000 from 
1987 the government reported 
the total included approximately 495 million living on farms or 
2 percent of the population that marked a decrease of 35000 from 
the previous year 
the report issued wednesday was prepared by the agriculture and 
commerce departments using estimates from the census bureaus 
monthly current population survey 
since 1986 when a new census procedure began the rural 
population has grown more rapidly than the urban population 
averaging 264 percent compared with 167 percent for urban 
residents 
the 1988 farm population estimate of 4951000 is not 
significantly different from the 1987 estimate which may reflect a 
leveling off in the longterm decline in the number of farm 
residents the report said 
but the report added more than one year of data showing 
stability would be needed to confirm this pattern between 1983 
and 1984 the decline in farm population also appeared to halt but 
was then followed by a resumption of loss 
the us farm population peaked in 1916 when it was about 325 
million it has generally declined ever since 
one of the reports authors judith kalbacher of the usdas 
economic research service said the rural figures overall have shown 
significant changes but cautioned the growth pattern since 1986 may 
be illusory 
when the urban areas are redefined after the 1990 census some 
of these growing rural areas will be reclassified as urban she 
said in a telephone interview some of the growing areas are going 
to be taken out of rural groups and that will make it look like 
there was less rural growth than is now being reported 
in the report rural areas include open countryside and places of 
fewer than 2500 people that are not in the suburbs of large cities 
the large cities and their suburbs plus places of 2500 or more 
are considered urban 
the farm population consists of people living on farms in rural 
areas but it does not include the relatively few who live on farms 
located in urban areas the report said a farm is defined as a 
place that sold agricultural products worth 1000 or more during 
the previous year 
kalbacher said urban sprawl and a willingness of city workers to 
commute greater distances have been important factors in the growth 
families moving to distant suburbs for example have helped boost 
the annual readings for rural areas 
it probably means that a lot of the rural growth that were 
seeing in the middecade of the 1980s is mostly fringe development 
around urbanized areas she said 
the report said the largest share of the rural population 44 
percent is in the south which has been the case since the first 
census was taken in 1790 little change in the regional 
distribution of rural people has occurred in the last 40 years 
however the farm population has shown marked change over the 
same period in 1950 for example the south accounted for 516 
percent of the farm people but only 296 percent in 1988 the 
midwest meanwhile accounted for 506 percent last year compared 
with 323 percent in 1950 
other observations in the report included 
farm residents are older with a median age of 38 years in 1988 
compared with 322 years for all nonfarm people in 1920 the 
median age of farm people was less than 21 years nonfarm refers to 
urban plus rural nonfarm people 
last year 971 percent of farm residents were white and 22 
percent were black compared with 842 percent white and 124 
percent black in the nonfarm population the rest were described as 
other races 
about 69 percent of the farm residents 15 years and older were 
married and living with a spouse in 1988 compared with 56 percent 
of the nonfarm people 
farm women also had lower proportions of being single widowed 
married with spouse absent and divorced 
this probably reflects a tendency toward increased outmigration 
of young farm women as they reach maturity and outmigration or 
cessation of farming activities for older women upon loss of their 
husbands the report said 
the fertility rates of farm women of childbearing age were a 
little higher than nonfarm women data for june 1988 showed the 
number of children who had been born to farm women 18 to 44 years 
averaged 1533 per 1000 women nonfarm women averaged 1337 
children per 1000

when sam pierce told congress in may he was not 
a hands on manager at the department of housing and urban 
development lawmakers probing scandals at the agency responded with 
dismay but not disbelief 
after all pierces account fit with the public image of the only 
cabinet member to serve the entire reagan presidency at hud 
silent sam was known as a man who arrived late and left early 
traveled often knew little about hud programs and sometimes had the 
office television tuned to soap operas 
then shirley wiseman a former top hud official opened the 
floodgates 
pierce she said in later testimony personally ordered her to 
approve funding for a north carolina project that had been opposed 
by several hud officials 
the project it turned out was backed by a former pierce law 
partner suddenly pierces image changed to that of a man who had 
been more involved in hud decisions than he let on 
wisemans testimony brought intense congressional and media 
scrutiny of pierces role at hud and led to report after report of 
his intervention on behalf of prominent republicans james watt 
carla hills and former sen edward brooke among them jazz musician 
lionel hampton and a prominent black gop couple also got help from 
the secretary as did attorneys at his former law firm hud records 
show 
pierce returns as a witness on friday before the house 
subcommittee that originally questioned him to tell his own story 
and field questions about the apparent contradiction between what he 
said and what wiseman and others have said since 
i believe that the vast majority of huds employees served me 
well pierce told time magazine in an interview published this 
week but there were rotten apples in and out of the hud barrel 
unlike the first appearance this time pierce will be accompanied 
by an attorney 
im not going to prejudge him said subcommittee member 
barney frank dmass who had a heated exchange with pierce during 
his may testimony 
hes entitled to his say and hes shown that hes willing to 
testify frank said wednesday obviously there are some 
contradictions that need to be explained 
in two recent interviews pierce has contended that his earlier 
testimony was misunderstood and that by saying he was not a hands 
on manager he did not mean he never took a personal interest in 
hud projects or proposals but he insists that politics played no 
role in his decisions 
no request was to be given any special advantage because it was 
submitted by a republican or was in some way associated with a 
republican he told time my decisions were based on fact law 
and logic not on political party 
hud secretary jack kemp has laid blame for the agencys problems 
on pierce saying it is obvious that the secretary did not keep tabs 
on the department the bush administration has tried to distance 
itself from the agencys problems with promises to flush politics 
out of its decisions 
several friends and associates say pierce faces an unfair end to 
a public career that includes appointments to judgeships in his 
native new york and jobs in the eisenhower and nixon administrations 
his associates say the 67yearold pierce left himself open to 
his current problems because of his habit of delegating authority to 
others 
if hes not interested in something he didnt want to be 
bothered said roy englert a washington attorney who served under 
pierce at the treasury department in the 1970s 
pierce has said his former top aide deborah gore dean and 
others violated his trust congressional testimony and hud records 
show that dean was often contacted by developers seeking money and 
wielded considerable influence over which projects received approval 
ms dean through her attorneys counters that whatever actions 
she took were done at pierces request

forget notions of neanderthal man as a 
giant hairy brute who stumbled about managing utterances no more 
sophisticated than an occasional ugh or duh 
neanderthal man could talk researchers say he couldnt 
pronounce the letters e or i and he probably sounded a bit 
nasal and hard to understand but he could communicate 
neanderthals even may have spun yarns whispered gossip and told 
a few oneliners says terrence deacon assistant professor of 
anthropology at harvard university 
whats more they may have talked with early humans and if they 
did remnants of neanderthal language could be found in modern 
speech says deacon 
about 50000 years ago neanderthals living in europe and israel 
were invaded by a race of smaller folk modern humans who had 
migrated from africa for thousands of years the two cultures 
mingled and quite possibly communicated before neanderthals died 
out 35000 years ago deacon said 
neanderthals had every bit of the intellectual and linguistic 
capability that our direct ancestors did deacon said wednesday 
they could have conversed with modern humans 
deacon bases this contention on his studies of monkey and human 
brains his research showed that an area called the ventral 
prefontal cortex which grew dramatically in modern human brains 
serves as a link between speech centers controlling socalled 
automatic vocalizations laughter and crying and those areas 
controlling more sophisticated speech 
the development of this large cortex distinguished humans from 
primates which use automatic vocalizations like shrieks and hoots 
to communicate since neanderthal brains also had a large ventral 
prefrontal cortex it is reasonable to assume they could talk 
deacon said 
neanderthal man was a big guy to be sure he had larger bones 
and muscles a sloping forehead and more menacing jaws and teeth 
than todays average human but his brain was much like ours there 
is no reason he wouldnt have the gift of gab deacon said 
he couldnt utter some of the vowels we do though because his 
larynx was higher in his throat than ours so he couldnt ooh if 
he spied a beautiful full moon for example 
philip lieberman professor of cognitive and linguistic sciences 
at brown university agreed with some of deacons argument 
but lieberman said that while hed be astonished if they didnt 
talk whether they spoke anything like humans is an unsettled 
issue 
the difference in the vocal tract means the neanderthal 
couldnt close his nose off lieberman said noting this would 
make neanderthal speech very nasal which added errors to any 
language 
lieberman added that neanderthal speech also would be hampered by 
not being able to say e or i the most common sounds found 
in modern languages 
deacon said much of what an anthropologist believes about 
neanderthal mans capacities depend upon what is considered crucial 
to speech 
it all comes down to what you think is more important for 
speech the brain or the larynx deacon said i believe it is 
the brain 
deacons argument may have gained strength recently with the 
discovery of a humanlike hyoid bone from which the larynx is 
suspended in the 60000yearold skeleton of a neanderthal on mount 
carmel in israel 
if neanderthals and modern humans talked there also may be some 
aspects of neanderthal speech left in modern languages deacon said 
its an open question but its not impossible that our 
language was affected deacon said 
so what did neanderthals talk about they were hunters and 
gatherers much like the bushmen of the kalahari desert in africa 
so they probably talked about the animals they hunted and the 
berries they gathered for food 
but not all neanderthal communication was shop talk 
they didnt just talk about their jobs deacon said i 
think they could have told jokes and there were issues of family

the chairman of the senate committee hearing 
evidence in the impeachment case against us district judge walter 
nixon says he expects the trial before the full senate to begin next 
month 
the parties should be prepared to proceed by oct 17 sen 
wyche fowler dga said wednesday 
during four days of testimony from five witnesses the committee 
heard evidence concerning allegations that nixon lied about his 
involvement in a marijuana smuggling case against the son of a 
wealthy oil man with business connections to the judge 
nixon 60 the chief federal judge in mississippis southern 
district is serving a fiveyear prison sentence after being 
convicted of perjury in a federal trial in 1988 
hell lose his judgeship and its 89500 annual salary if the 
senate reaches the same conclusions as the trial jury 
the house which acts as prosecutor in impeachment cases 
contends nixon lied when he told federal investigators he had never 
discussed the drug case with anyone or influenced its outcome 
the senate committee will prepare a report of the undisputed 
facts of nixons case and a summary of the disputed facts with 
evidence from both sides but will not make a recommendation on 
whether nixon should be impeached 
all senators will get copies of the documents a transcript of 
the hearings and the evidence presented at the hearings before they 
hear final statements from both sides of the case in public session 
they will then lock themselves in a closed session similar to jury 
deliberations to debate the case 
the vote on three articles of impeachment which were approved 
unanimously by the house will take place in public session 
in his closing statement wednesday nixons lawyer said the judge 
had no reason to lie because there was nothing improper about his 
only contact with the narcotics case in question 
but rep james sensenbrenner rwis in closing arguments for 
the house said nixon fixed the narcotics case for drew 
fairchild because he had made a lucrative investment in oil 
properties with his father wiley fairchild and wanted more 
obviously there are two versions of the events here said 
sensenbrenner judge nixons version is certainly more benign 
than the collective picture painted by the other witnesses 
the articles of impeachment allege 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case 
against drew fairchild with holmes 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do 
officially or unofficially with the fairchild case and never 
influenced anyone in the case 
nixon undermined the integrity of the judiciary and 
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during 
an interview with the federal investigators and in his sworn grand 
jury testimony

animal welfare activists are opposing attempts 
to train capuchin monkeys to provide small tasks and companionship 
to quadriplegics because they say the animals are subjected to cruel 
government treatment and never become fully tame 
it simply is not possible to use monkeys in this type of 
program and still be humane the committee for humane legislation 
an umbrella group for several animal welfare groups told a house 
panel wednesday 
the testimony came before the veterans affairs subcommittee on 
hospitals and health care which is considering legislation 
introduced by rep joseph p kennedy dmass that would set up a 
program providing helper monkeys for 20 disabled veterans and helper 
dogs for 10 
although veterans groups are pushing the idea the animal rights 
activists said attempts to domesticate the monkeys are misguided 
monkeys are wild animals and no amount of training will ever 
change that said leslie fain of the committee for humane 
legislation 
according to the activists monkeys trained as helpers have their 
teeth removed and are subjected to electric shock that causes them 
to have diarrhea fain said the monkeys natural curiosity could 
cause them to harm people they are supposed to help 
quadriplegics have lost caretakers who quit because of monkey 
attacks she said driving controls on the quadriplegics 
wheelchairs have been used in some cases by monkeys to drive their 
owners into walls 
the humane group and the american society for the prevention of 
cruelty to animals say other mechanical devices can be used 
but the paralyzed veterans of america one of the groups favoring 
the legislation disputes such claims 
at the present time there is no effective technology which can 
imitate the simple routine tasks which humans perform said john 
c bollinger associate legislative director of the paralyzed 
veterans group 
dr mary joan willard professor of medicine at the boston 
university school of medicine and director of the nonprofit helping 
hands group said the use of the simians saves 3777 a year by 
reducing never eliminating the need for a human attendant 
she said the monkeys can be trained and that after several months 
they treat the owner attendant and family as part of a troop 
tooth extraction is necessary to control biting she said and 
this is done without any deleterious effects on their health or 
subsequent behavior it has been done for years with organgrinder 
monkeys she said 
about 220000 people in the united states have spinal cord 
injuries and about half of those are quadriplegics about 28000 
veterans are quadriplegic according to va

the battle against graffiti can be won with a 
little sweetness a master cleaner says 
walls can be protected from spraycan scrawls with a simple sugar 
solution said glyn howard head of a british cleaning company 
after that the efforts of any graffiti artist can be hosed off 
in a moment with hot water he told officials wednesday at a 
conference on battling vandalism 
among his clients are 15 train stations of staterun british rail 
whose woes are only the tip of a titanic vandalism problem across 
britain 
it is hundreds of millions of pounds a year police chief 
philip veater told the conference organized by a construction 
industry group called the building center 
we put questions to 12000 households for a crime survey and 
discovered that crimes were five times more numerous than had been 
reported while vandalism was 12 times greater than we thought 
people dont report all crimes to the police but they hardly 
ever report vandalism because they think nothing can or will be done 
about it said veater deputy director of a government crime 
prevention center 
for his part howard showed one way of fighting back he 
demonstrated his secret to architects and city hall officials by 
having one of his workers hose away red and black paint from a 
treated wall 
the paint peeled away under the jet of water 
howard said he is the first person in britain to employ the 
patented solution invented by a swedish scientist professor sigfrid 
svensson of lund university 
the carbohydrate derivative which costs roughly 8 a square 
yard is nontoxic colorless and odorless he said 
so if you drink it by mistake it wont poison you as it 
contains carbohydrates of the type which is part of your everyday 
diet and it wont hurt your skin or give you a headache when you 
put it on howard said 
british stations and trains are regularly vandalized mostly with 
aerosol sprays 
however the problem extends well beyond eyesores last month a 
speeding express was derailed near london by a concrete tie placed 
across the track wrecking the locomotive the 100 passengers 
escaped with slight injuries 
the london underground spends nearly 15 million annually 
removing graffiti 
there are no statistics on what vandalism costs the country 
among veaters suggestions to combat vandalism use 
damageresistant materials in construction put prickly plants at 
the bottom of walls cover walls with creepers make sure there is 
nothing around a building to climb on and clear up damage and 
graffiti quickly 
the vandal wants his work to be seen he said 
desmond williams an architect said his firm designs or remodels 
schools and other buildings to resist vandal attacks 
we reduce entrances shut off alcoves which can be used as 
hiding places eliminate anything providing handholds to reach roofs 
and put in lights triggered by sensors vandals dont like to have 
their profiles shown in a bright light he said

an energy department report showing last years 
domestic oil discoveries were the secondsmallest on record suggests 
the trend toward greater us reliance on imported oil is continuing 
the report wednesday by the departments energy information 
administration also said known reserves of us crude including the 
newly discovered oil fell last year for the eighth time in the last 
10 years 
the report underscored a trend of declining us oil resources 
that accelerated in the mid1980s when prices dropped sharply and 
oil exploration tailed off 
the slower exploration combined with rising energy demand has 
resulted in a rapid increase in oil imports which in july supplied 
more than half the nations petroleum needs for the first time in 
more than a decade 
the report said drillers added 553 million barrels of oil last 
year to us reserves either by discovering new fields extending 
those already in production or finding new reservoirs in existing 
fields that is a 20 percent drop from the 1987 discovery total and 
is the second lowest on record the agency said 
domestic proved oil reserves defined as crude oil that could be 
pumped from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions 
totaled 268 billion barrels as of dec 31 1988 the report said 
that is a drop of 431 million barrels or 16 percent from a year 
earlier 
a barrel equals 42 gallons 
the reserves total has dropped in each year during the past 
decade except in 1984 when a gain of 711 million barrels was 
reported and in 1987 when the total rose by 367 million barrels 
the 1988 total oil reserves would disappear in about nine years 
at current rates of consumption if additional oil were not found 
the interior department reported last month that undiscovered us 
oil resources totaled about 49 billion barrels indicating a further 
16 years life expectancy for oil in this country 
proved reserves of natural gas plunged by 10 percent last year to 
168 trillion cubic feet the report said because of a major 
revision of gas reserves for the north slope of alaska the major 
companies operating on the north slope agreed that 246 trillion 
cubic feet of gas should be removed from the reported total because 
the prevailing gas prices are too low to make it marketable the 
report said

the white house is considering dropping its 
widely criticized nomination of a former department store buyer to 
head an energy department office responsible for monitoring safety 
at nuclear weapons plants an official said 
diane kay morales is a very competent accomplished person 
but may not be the right choice for the sensitive position of 
assistant secretary for environment safety and health deputy 
secretary henson moore said in an interview wednesday 
diane morales is reconsidering what she wants to do and the 
white house is reconsidering what it wants her to do moore said 
adding the requirements of the job have grown as more problems have 
been uncovered at the weapons plants 
he cited as an example a new energy department investigative 
report on the fernald nuclear weapons plant in ohio a summary of 
the report released wednesday listed dozens of environmental 
problems at the uranium processing plant although it said none of 
the shortcomings posed an imminent threat to the public 
energy secretary james d watkins in an internal memorandum 
obtained wednesday said he was dispatching a team of environment 
safety and health experts to fernald to beef up the staff there 
until he can hire permanent additions 
moore said the investigations results showed we have to get 
this department into a serious highgear mode of operation to come 
into compliance with federal and state environmental and health 
and safety standards 
the departments office of environment safety and health was 
created in 1985 to monitor the nuclear weapons facilities 
including 17 major installations in 12 states which have fallen 
into disrepair and in some cases contaminated soil and groundwater 
with improperly stored hazardous wastes 
moore said no decision had been made on whether to resubmit the 
morales nomination to the senate which sent it back to the white 
house in late july after putting off a hearing the senate energy 
and natural resources committee said it wanted more information 
about watkins plans for reorganizing the department before 
considering ms morales 
we now realize that the demands of the job are much more severe 
than we had seen previously moore said he said there had been no 
effort so far to look for another nominee 
moore said however the administration is ready to fight for the 
controversial nomination of victor stello as assistant secretary for 
defense programs the office responsible for weapons production the 
senate energy panel is expected to consider the stello nomination in 
october 
stello came under renewed fire this week from environmental 
groups that claim his record at the nuclear regulatory commission 
shows a lack of commitment to nuclear safety 
we havent seen anything to cause us to review or reassess 
this moore said the choice of victor stello sends a signal 
that for the first time in the history of these nuclear facilities 
we have chosen a regulator to lead this program rather than a 
producer 
the morales nomination drew fire from environmental and labor 
groups soon after the white house announced it april 12 the main 
objection is that ms morales previous experience lends little to 
the demands of an office seeking to improve the weapons plants 
compliance with environmental health and safety laws 
ms morales worked from 1971 to 1980 for neimanmarcus the 
department store chain managing two departments and assisting in 
buying for 14 stores 
she held several government jobs from 1981 to 1986 including 
membership on the civil aeronautics board and she later founded an 
environmental consulting company

defense secretary dick cheney is attempting to 
get his former colleagues on capitol hill to show the willpower he 
admits he lacked at times as a congressman 
i think its important for people to remember that as a member 
of congress i voted for every single defense program that was ever 
put in front of me you cant name a defense program i didnt like 
i loved them all cheney said in a speech wednesday before a 
conservative forum 
but now as the top man at the pentagon cheney says he has a new 
perspective 
now ive got to figure out how to pay for them he said 
in remarks before the hudson institute cheney conceded he may 
have made mistakes in some of his votes on capitol hill and he tried 
to use some introspection to convince his former colleagues that 
hed learned a lesson 
the former wyoming representative said that as congress makes key 
budget decisions lawmakers must show they have the willpower to cut 
entire programs in order to hold the line on the nations defense 
budget 
attempts to cut overall spending while leaving programs intact 
with less money will not solve the budget problem cheney said 
in presenting president bushs fiscal 1990 budget to capitol 
hill cheney recommended killing the v22 osprey a vertical 
takeoff plane and canceling the f14d jet fighter he called the 
requests a whole new concept in this town 
the house voted to restore funds to both programs and the senate 
has authorized research and development funds for the osprey 
the secretary said congressmen love to vote to reduce the top 
line to cut back on the overall amount on spending to solve 
budget problems 
then its my task to keep all the programs alive and the bases 
open because they dont want to cancel anything he said 
cheney said members of congress who have voted against defense 
programs for the past decade are now coming down to my office 
saying i hope you wont cut out my base or shut down my production 
line 
but the former congressman admitted hed done the same thing 
i will not argue here today that i was above on occasion 
trying to have it both ways on an issue thats a normal human 
desire cheney said but these decisions are far too important 
for us to allow that to happen this time around congress must make 
some choices 
he praised the senate for coming closer to the administrations 
wishlist in its work on the pentagons budget although he 
criticized the senate appropriation defense subcommittee for voting 
tuesday to slash funding for the trident 2 the navys newest and 
most supposedly most deadly weapon

the number of major oil spills this year 
is not unusual despite the exxon valdez grounding and four other 
tanker accidents during the first six months of 1989 according to 
an industry watchdog study 
there have been 79 tanker spills of more than 10000 gallons of 
oil in united states waters since 1978 an average of more than six 
each year according to richard golob publisher of golobs oil 
pollution bulletin 
seven of the spills involved more than 1 million gallons golob 
said 
between 1978 and 1988 the volume of oil spilled each year ranged 
from 92000 gallons in 1983 to 10 million gallons in 1979 
and during the first six months of 1989 more than 117 million 
gallons spilled including about 109 million alone from the exxon 
valdez golob said 
even though the exxon valdez has received so much publicity 
and even though we had a record three major spills in one 12hour 
period in june which once again reinforced the perception that major 
oil spills take place frequently the statistics still show that 
major spills are still low probabilty events golob said wednesday 
the study also reports that more oil was spilled during the first 
six months of 1989 than in any of the last 10 years he said 
since 1978 the gulf coast suffered 37 tanker spills the 
atlantic coast 29 and the pacific coast 13 
two major tanker spills occurred during the weekend of june 23 
one at the mouth of narragansett bay off rhode island the other on 
the delaware river near claymont del 
a third major spill occured that weekend in the houston ship 
channel near galveston but was not included in golobs statistics 
because a barge leaked not a tanker 
a separate study by the center for study of responsive law a 
public interest group published wednesday in usa today said that 68 
percent of all spills were caused by mechanical failure 20 percent 
were caused by human error 4 percent by weather and less than 1 
percent by vandalism the centers study excludes 1989

el salvadors marxist rebels say they would 
lay down their arms and reorganize as a political party if the 
nations rightist administration would agree to broad political and 
social reforms 
the guerrillas made the proposal wednesday in their first talks 
with the government in two years 
both sides said they hoped to reach an agreement today on a plan 
for negotiating an end to nearly a decade of civil war that has 
claimed 70000 lives 
the problem is if were just going to talk or if were going to 
talk about negotiating rebel commander joaquin villalobos said 
wednesday night 
he said the salvadoran people are tired of fighting we are 
conscious the war has to end 
the usbacked salvadoran government did not present a peace 
plan but the fiveman delegation arrived with a proposal for 
negotiating procedures that called for two days of talks every two 
months 
rebels leaders called that unacceptable and said they wanted a 
fasterpaced negotiating plan 
there were also differences on whether there would be a mediator 
or observers and who might play that role 
despite the differences both sides said the first day had been 
fruitful and that an accord on a negotiating plan was possible 
we feel satisfied justice minister oscar alfredo santamaria 
told reporters 
he refused to comment on the rebel peace plan it is a proposal 
that needs analyzing he said 
the meeting is the first between the rebels and the elected 
republican nationalist alliance government of president alfredo 
cristiani who took office june 1 
santamaria said the fact that cristiani had agreed to these 
preliminary talks with the rebel farabundo marti national liberation 
front was proof it is serious about peace 
we are here to put an end to the war he said 
the rebels peace proposal calls for a ceasefire by nov 15 in 
exchange for broad including appointing a new supreme court and 
justice minister and moving up legislative and municipal elections 
now scheduled for 1991 
the guerrillas also said a truce was conditional on reforms in 
the military expanded land reform and the prosecution of death 
squad members 
the founder of cristianis party roberto daubuisson has long 
been accused of playing a key role in rightist death squads that 
have murdered thousands of leftists suspected leftists and other 
government opponents 
if its conditions were met the rebel group said it would move 
toward becoming a political party 
under the final stage of their proposal the guerrillas call for 
constitutional and electoral reforms and agreement by the united 
states to replace military aid to the salvadoran government with 
economic aid 
el salvador is the largest recipient of us aid in the 
hemisphere 
the rebel plan contains many proposals made and rejected before 
but the wording was much milder this time and the rebels have 
dropped a longstanding insistence on merging their army with the 
goverment armed forces 
their offer to change from a guerrilla force to a political party 
is also new the rebels have boycotted regular elections since 1982 
saying the balloting offered only a veneer of democracy 
the government has said it will not negotiate a reduction in the 
military and that if the rebels want reform they should pursue it 
through the political process 
rebel and government called a temporary ceasefire for the 
twoday peace talks negotiations in 1984 and 1987 failed

house democrats saying they respect freedom 
of expression arent going along with sen jesse helms effort to 
bar federal subsidies for sexually explicit or blasphemous art but 
the fight is far from over 
the house voted 264153 wednesday to reject helms proposed 
restrictions on the national endowment for the arts 
were telling jesse we respect freedom of expression rep 
don edwards dcalif said afterward 
however the chief house supporter of helms measure predicts at 
least one more vote on the highly charged battle over the 
endowments awarding of 45000 this year to help finance two 
controversial exhibits 
the debate now shifts to the hinterland said freshman rep 
dana rohrabacher rcalif i believe sen helms has a few rabbits 
up his sleeve 
for two months a coalition of christian conservative and 
republican groups have campaigned for helms amendment to the senate 
version of a 1990 appropriations bill for the endowment the 
interior department and several other agencies 
organizations supporting the arts also mobilized a campaign 
casting the issue as a battle over artistic freedom 
helms measure would ban federal subsidies of obscene or 
indecent material including depictions of sadomasochism 
homoeroticism the exploitation of children or individuals engaged 
in sex acts 
it also would prohibit taxpayer funding of art that denigrates 
the objects or beliefs of a particular religion or nonreligion 
or a person group or class of citizens on the basis of race 
creed sex handicap or national origin 
rep sidney yates dill the endowments chief supporter in the 
house said it erred in awarding grants for the two exhibits one 
including a photograph by andre serrano of a picture of christ on a 
cross submerged in a jar of urine and the other a show by the late 
photographer robert mapplethorpe that included explicit photos of 
homosexual acts and a nude boy 
but yates said two mistakes out of some 4000 annual grants do 
not warrant imposing a lingering death on an agency whose 
subsidies are used to foster cultural enrichment across the country 
yates said helms measure establishes a broad and sweeping 
pattern of censorship this is the start of george orwells big 
brother its the communist approach to art 
the endowments critics questioned whether the government should 
be using tax dollars at all to subsidize art 
the question is sponsorship not censorship said 
rohrabacher artists can do whatever they want on their own time 
and with their own dime 
democrats united behind yates rejecting helms measure by a 
margin of 21238 house republicans whose campaign committee 
already has used the issue against selected incumbent democrats 
supported the ban by 11652 
before the vote democratic leaders thwarted an attempt to 
display on the house floor copies of the offending photographs rep 
george brown dcalif who was presiding over the house at the 
time denied the request by assistant gop whip robert walker of 
pennsylvania saying the exhibit would upset the decorum of the 
house 
the corcoran gallery of art in washington fearing a cut in its 
funds from the endowment in june canceled a planned show of 
mapplethorpes photos 
the secondranking officer of the corcoran and the organizer of 
the mapplethorpe show jane livingston resigned wednesday saying 
she planned to complete a book she said that though she was 
appalled at the cancellation done without consulting her her 
resignation very well may have happened now without any of the 
other events 
yates who chairs the house subcommittee responsible for the 
endowments annual funding tried to halt the arts funding 
controversy two months ago by cutting its 1714 million budget for 
next year by 45000 the amount of federal grants that went toward 
the mapplethorpe and serrano exhibits

getting emergency room treatment in some 
hospitals can be as stressful these days as the emergency itself 
say physicians who warn another healthcare crisis is looming 
in some cities ambulances roam the streets trying to find an 
emergency room that has space and patients can wait hours even 
days in the emergency department for a hospital bed to become 
available 
this is the future health care crisis said dr charlotte s 
yeh a board member of the american college of emergency physicians 
and chief of emergency medicine at the newtonwellesley hospital in 
newton mass 
we are the safety net she said when youre sick and dont 
have anywhere to go and youre scared and dont know what youve 
got our doors are open 24 hours a day seven days a week but were 
becoming overloaded 
the net is being stretched so thin were worried about the 
future of the health care system she said 
emergency physicians described the problems wednesday as they 
released a draft report based on a survey of the colleges state 
chapters 
the pressure on hospital emergency rooms is coming from the 
growing aids epidemic increased illegal drug use and an estimated 
37 million americans who have no health insurance and who get health 
care only through emergency rooms 
adding to the burden are medical staff shortages financial 
pressures that are leading a growing number of hospitals to close 
their doors and an inadequate number of nursing home beds they 
said 
some patients in new york city emergency rooms have waited for 
hospital beds for more than a week said dr stephan g lynn 
director of emergency medicine at st lukesroosevelt hospital 
center in new york city 
frequently we admit people to the hospital with a diagnosis 
like heart attack and we do cardiograms and blood tests and three or 
four days later they leave never having seen an intensive care 
unit or a cardiac care unit never having left the emergency 
department lynn said 
the harbor ucla medical center in los angeles emergency room is 
so crowded it is closed to ambulance traffic 25 percent of the time 
said dr robert hockberger chairman of the department of emergency 
medicine 
the problem is most critical in the northeast and on the west 
coast but the survey found emergency rooms across the country are 
backed up fortyone state chapters of the college reported 
overcrowding in emergency rooms in their states nine reported no 
backups idaho minnesota nebraska new hampshire new mexico 
north dakota oregon utah and wyoming 
chapters in west virginia north carolina alabama and alaska 
noted overcrowding is not simply a problem of this nations 
cities according to the draft report 
the physicians said it is not known whether long emergency room 
stays have led to more patient deaths but they said these patients 
often receive only marginal care 
the lights never go out the noise never turns off meals are 
served but on an irregular basis and rarely are as palatable or 
warm as they are on the inpatient side lynn said 
patients spend their entire stay lying on a stretcher with a 
mattress that is two inches thick 
that level of care is inadequate he said emergency 
departments were not designed and are not equipped or staffed to 
provide intensive care services or inpatient services

a survey of social security administration 
employees depicts a discontented and overworked work force but the 
agencys new chief says she is confident morale is improving 
i am absolutely confident that the problem of low morale is one 
that were going to spend a lot of time paying some attention to and 
making some changes in those numbers social security 
administration gwendolyn king said wednesday 
according to the survey conducted in april 51 percent of social 
security employees say their morale is poor or extremely poor up 
from 43 percent in 1987 seventyfour percent said they were often 
or very often overworked 
the share of supervisors who said the ssa was doing a poor or 
very poor job of providing the best possible service to social 
security recipients rose to 37 percent up from 26 percent in the 
1987 poll 
the survey conducted by the institute for behavioral research in 
creativity in salt lake city utah was released by mrs king who 
took office last month 
the april survey came toward the end of a sixyear period in 
which the ssa work force was slashed by 20 percent to 65000 as part 
of a campaign to modernize and streamline operations 
downsizing the introduction of new technology and the 
inevitable difficulties in managing change could be expected to lead 
to a rise in employee discontent the report said 
mrs king said workers would be encouraged to take the time 
necessary to provide quality service more would be done to reward 
good performance and more equipment and personnel might be shifted 
to areas in need 
among other findings in the survey 
68 percent of workers said there was quite a lot or some signs 
of employee discontent 
46 percent of supervisors said they were given encouragement and 
opportunities to learn and improve their job skills up from 40 
percent in 1987 
the reports recommendations included improved communication 
with lowerlevel employees about the agencys longterm goals more 
discussion among employees and management paying increased 
attention to worker contributions and providing more flexibility to 
solve problems at lower management levels

family men who spend almost as much time fighting scourges of 
humanity like terrorism and drug trafficking as they do keeping 
tabs on cia agents 
but officials deny that they routinely eavesdrop on foreigners in 
moscow or that they have done anything illegal in pursuing 
dissidents since the 1960s 
the feared soviet secret service is trying to build a new image 
of openness in keeping with president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms and on wednesday premiered the first soviet documentary 
film about the kgb 
officials fielded questions from reporters for more than an hour 
afterwards but their answers indicated glasnost only goes so far 
the officers told the news conference that the kgb had done 
nothing illegal in pursuing dissidents since the 1960s 
the 55minute film the kgb today and a short film of an 
interview with kgb chairman gen vladimir a kryuchkov painted a 
portrait of what the secret police chief called the modern cheka 
man a welleducated professional whose work increasingly 
encompasses the struggle against smuggling organized crime and drug 
trafficking 
cheka was the name of the original bolshevik secret police 
organization 
at present were trying to create an objective image of our 
organization in the soviet union and abroad kryuchkov said in the 
film which was shot by the government news agency novosti 
novosti officials billed the film as the first documentary about 
the kgb they said they hoped it and more to follow would be seen 
widely in the soviet union and distributed outside the country 
kryuchkov who took over from viktor m chebrikov as kgb chief 
last year has opened up the topsecret organization somewhat during 
his almost one year as chairman he has granted interviews to 
foreign reporters and said the feared organization should be subject 
to legislative oversight 
but he was greeted with snorts of laughter when he told national 
legislators at his confirmation hearing in july that the kgb does 
not tap telephones of soviet citizens 
in the spirit of openness the kgb gave filmmakers elena 
kovalieva and stanislav belianinov access to kgb martial arts 
training target practice and the interior of kgb headquarters and 
of lefortovo prison in northeast moscow 
the film devoted several minutes to kim philby the british 
secret service officer who spied for the kgb and included a 
recreation of the apprehension of a us diplomat on spying charges 
six years ago 
the diplomat vice consul lon david augustenborg of the leningrad 
consulate was expelled sept 12 1983 
officials said the kgb had agreed to cooperate in a britishmade 
film about philby who fled to the soviet union in 1963 and died in 
may 1988 in moscow 
kryuchkov and other kgb officials acknowledge that the kgbs 
predecessor stalins nkvd broke laws in the 1930s 1940s and 1950s 
but they said the kgb did not violate any laws in pressuring 
dissidents virtually every soviet dissident of the past quarter 
century has stories of kgb harassment ranging from searches and 
seizure of manuscripts to interrogations and beatings 
the number of such reports has dropped in recent years under 
gorbachevs reforms many dissidents have left the country and 
others have found that the critical viewpoints that once made them 
pariahs now are well within official bounds those still active in 
dissident activities say the kgb is less active but still 
unmistakeably present 
in the 1960s 1970s and 1980s the kgb did not violate the law 
it abided by the letter and the spirit of the law said kgb 
spokesman col igor prelin its not us who adopted the laws we 
made decisions based on the laws 
westerners and many dissidents in moscow assume that their 
telephones and apartments are bugged 
pressed by one western reporter to discuss bugging kgb chief of 
investigations col oleg dobrovolsky said i dont think youre 
right saying we tap telephones that we listen to what you say over 
telephones youve got to prove that first before you ask that 
question 
sometimes if it is in the interest of state security we may 
listen to telephones but thats not an established practice you 
know he said

the nato allies should not extend trade and 
arms control concessions to the soviet union until president mikhail 
gorbachevs reforms take permanent root says deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger 
in a major foreign policy speech eagleburger credited the soviet 
leader wednesday night with proposing the first realistic hope for 
a transformation in the nature of the soviet system and for a 
qualitative improvement in eastwest relations 
but eagleburger told an audience at georgetown university that 
gorbachev was driven by severe economic problems threatening to make 
the soviet union incapable of competing with the western democracies 
we are hearing we need to take measures to ensure the success 
of gorbachevs reforms eagleburger said this however is not 
the task of american foreign policy nor should it be that of our 
western partners 
he continued our task after all is to devise policies which 
will serve our interests whether mr gorbachev succeeds or fails 
in the audience was soviet ambassador yuri dubinin next week 
secretary of state james a baker iii will meet in jackson hole 
wyo with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze to make 
preparations for a superpower summit 
gorbachev is no anticommunist eagleburger said and he 
intends to make the soviet union as strong as he possibly can 
the us official also warned against extending trade and arms 
control concessions to moscow without the kind of systematic 
reforms which alone can make for a stable and confident relationship 
between east and west 
delivering a lecture to memorialize the late american diplomat 
samuel berger the deputy secretary of state also 
sketched a gloomy picture of cambodias future he said the 
united states does not have it within its power to determine the 
future government and that all rival factions must be represented 
this would appear to include the khmer rouge which was accused of 
murdering some 1 million cambodians while ruling the south asian 
country a peace conference in paris collapsed in late august 
predicted optimistically that the new government in south 
africa may begin dismantling the system of racial segregation known 
as apartheid the chances for change over the next few months are 
substantial eagleburger said 
in the speech eagleburger concentrated on the future of the 
western alliance and its stance toward the soviet union under 
gorbachev 
he has made hopeful pronouncements on arms reductions and has 
slowed the overseas adventurism which did so much to galvanize 
western solidarity in the early 1980s eagleburger said 
and yet the us official said herein lies a danger to 
western interests that with the perception growing among the 
western public that the soviet threat has diminished there will be a 
tendency among the member states of the nato alliance to compete in 
expanding their relationships with the east 
already eagleburger said without offering any specifics some 
western nations are showing tendencies toward unilateralism in 
trade matters 
he added obviously it is in the europeans interest as much 
if not more than our own to avoid bankrolling merely cosmetic 
soviet reforms or reach arms control agreements which undermine 
natos ability to deter aggression

elderly hispanics suffer more financial 
hardships and serious health problems than older americans in 
general but are less likely to benefit from social security and 
private pensions a private study shows 
the commission on elderly people living alone said wednesday its 
study of americas 1 million older hispanics shows they generally 
are not sharing in the economic prosperity enjoyed by other elderly 
americans 
the commission established in 1985 by the commonwealth fund 
philanthropic foundation said the problems confronting hispanics in 
later years reflect cumulative deficits throughout life 
for example it said 73 percent of elderly hispanics received an 
eighthgrade education or less and 39 percent speak only spanish 
these handicaps have consigned many elderly hispanics 
throughout their lifetimes to jobs that offered low pay and no 
pension or health insurance benefits the commission said 
despite having worked for most of their lives many hispanics find 
themselves in old age without the means to maintain their 
independence 
higher levels of education and english fluency may help younger 
hispanics get better jobs and retirement benefits but schoolage 
hispanics have high dropout rates and many may already be on their 
way to lives of lowpaying jobs and poverty the report said 
advocates for the elderly were to discuss the federal 
commissions report at a hearing today of the house select committee 
on aging 
the study based on a national survey of 2299 older hispanics 
found 22 percent of elderly hispanics live below the federal poverty 
line compared with 12 percent of all elderly americans fiftyfour 
percent of older hispanics report poor or fair health compared with 
35 percent of all elderly 
fortyeight percent of hispanic elders are very satisfied with 
their lives compared with 64 percent of all elderly the survey 
found 
hispanics currently make up 3 percent of the us elderly 
population but are the fastestgrowing segment of the senior 
population their ranks are expected to quadruple to 4 million by 
the year 2020 when they will make up 8 percent of the elderly 
population the commission said 
it attributed lower percentages of social security and private 
pension beneficiaries among todays elderly hispanics to the 
immigration of some later in life and to their work in service 
unskilled and farm jobs with few benefits 
seventyseven percent of elderly hispanics receive social 
security compared with 92 percent of all elderly 19 percent of 
older hispanics receive a pension compared with 45 percent of all 
elderly the survey found 
because of their lower incomes 30 percent of poor elderly 
hispanics receive benefits under supplemental security income a 
government program providing minimum income to poor people who are 
elderly blind or disabled sixtyseven percent of poor older 
hispanics are eligible for the benefits but many dont know they 
qualify the report said 
although the report found poverty and health problems throughout 
the elderly hispanic population there were differences among 
different ethnic categories 
for example because elderly mexicanamericans were the most 
likely to have been born in the united states and work there longer 
85 percent received social security benefits but 74 percent of 
puerto ricans living in the continental united states and 66 percent 
of cubanamericans receive the benefits 
cubanamericans were the best educated and had the lowest poverty 
rate 35 percent compared with 42 percent for puerto ricans and 
43 percent for mexicanamericans

advocacy groups for the retarded charge that a 
report saying the use of pain as part of medical treatment to 
prevent the retarded from hurting themselves can be beneficial is 
biased and unscientific 
a panel of experts convened by the national institutes of health 
issued the report wednesday saying that although the techniques may 
seem distasteful its possible to control selfdestructive acts 
like headbanging biting and eye poking 
experts have been unable to explain why some people do such 
things or why the pain involved does not halt the action and 
prevent a recurrence 
some techniques involving pain include an electrical shock device 
that is sold for use in private homes and the use of foultasting 
chemicals or smells 
while the panel did not oppose the use of pain to modify 
selfdestructive behavior its report said it should only be used 
in the context of a comprehensive and individualized behavior 
enhancement treatment package 
most successful approaches involve multiple types of therapy 
said dr r rodney howell a university of miami school of medicine 
professor who chaired the committee he acknowledged certain of 
these techniques have a negative impression to the public even 
though they might be beneficial 
but dr ralph maurer a professor of medicine at the university 
of florida attacked the finding as bad medicine 
if a medical student used the kind of logic used here you 
would fail him maurer said the use of these procedures is bad 
medicine and its being carried off as good medicine 
the nih panel was convened to consider the appropriate methods of 
treating mentally disabled patients mostly children who habitually 
hurt themselves the committee said about 160000 patients in the 
united states exhibit destructive behavior and the cost of caring 
for them last year was about 3 billion 
some doctors and parents control the behavior through aversion 
techniques that use pain or discomfort to cause the patient to 
change actions these techniques include delivering a mild 
electrical shock forcing lemon juice or bitter tastes into the 
mouth blowing air on the face or forcing the patient to smell 
strong ammonia salts 
officials from several organizations representing the mentally 
retarded presented testimony in opposition to the use of painful 
therapy and held a news conference after the nih panel report was 
presented 
marcia d smith a psychologist for a maryland organization 
called community services for autistic adults and children said 
for the last 10 years we have not used painful methods and our 
techniques have worked 
she said the panel ignored the great body of work that has 
shown painbased therapy to be flawed and as a result the report 
by the committee is biased and onesided

mayor tom bradley insists a lengthy 
investigation exonerated him of wrongdoing as a paid consultant to 
two banks even though the probe resulted in a lawsuit against him 
i would never do anything to harm los angeles the fifthterm 
mayor said in a televised speech wednesday i will not let you 
down 
hours earlier city attorney james hahn said bradley had stepped 
into a gray area of the law for his dealings with the banks that 
do business with the city hahn said the evidence was insufficient 
to prosecute bardley 
still hahn filed a superior court lawsuit that alleges six 
failures to report investments two of them in excess of 100000 
the lawsuit was timed with the release of a 1613page report on 
a fivemonth investigation by hahns office into bradleys ties with 
far east national bank and valley federal savings and loan 
association 
while hahns report cleared the 71yearold mayor of prosecutable 
offenses no vindication of the mayors conduct is intended 
implied or should in any way be inferred the report said 
bradley acknowleged a perceived conflict of interest with his 
tenure as a paid director of valley federal the city attorney found 
no evidence bradley was aware he was acting on zoning for 
subsidiaries of valley federal 
bradley also acknowledged that his role as a paid international 
trade adviser to far east and the deposit without bidding of 2 
million in city funds there had created regrettable 
misperceptions but he said he was not involved in the city 
treasurers decision to make the deposit 
when all is said and done the inquiry confirms what i have 
said all along i did not engage in conflicts of interest i did not 
violate the publics trust he declared 
after the speech city councilman zev yaroslavsky said bradley 
had some more explaining to do this is not a speech that is going 
to close the door on this yaroslavsky said 
councilman michael woo said the days events should prompt the 
council to write new laws that will prevent these types of 
conflicts from taking place in the future 
bradley still faces possible state and federal investigations of 
his ties to a cityfunded task force for africa and to the 
investment banking firm of drexel burnham lambert inc and of an 
alleged coverup by the city treasurers office 
hahn said it was apparent that a march 22 telephone call from 
bradley to city treasurer leonard rittenberg did influence 
rittenberg to deposit 2 million with far east bradley was paid 
18000 as a consultant to the bank which he returned when media 
attention fell on the case 
it was also obvious hahn said that someone altered financial 
bid sheets following a reporters inquiry about the deposit 
bradley however insisted that the reports failure to find any 
wrongdoing by him was the bottom line the mayor also expressed 
confidence his attorneys and hahn would settle the lawsuit 
the errors i made were not deliberate they only show that i am 
not an accountant and that i shouldnt have tried to be one he 
said smiling 
citing his 47 years as a police officer councilman and mayor 
bradley tried to put the investigation behind him and look ahead 
the issue is im going to put it to rest put it behind us 
and i think the people are going to do the same he said let me 
enjoy for a moment my fifth term

massagli hes offered his services in whatever way hes needed to 
help settle this thing 
newton who on tuesday canceled a scheduled threeweek engagement 
at the hilton because of the strike previously had held an informal 
meeting between massagli and hilton executives 
hes got a lot at stake personally in terms of his contract 
which is for a lot of money said owen daley a hilton spokesman 
but hes also a community activist and he knows people on both 
sides in this thing 
massagli said no role for newton was defined in the meeting with 
the unions executive committee but that newton a las vegas 
resident who spends much of his time performing before packed 
showrooms could provide a spark to get talks moving 
the two sides last met monday no new talks were scheduled 
the dispute centers over the insistence of the hotels to replace 
musicians in production shows with live music and their 
unwillingness to guarantee work for musicians who work the main 
showrooms

of the polluted areas for the winter no further cleanup activity is 
planned until next spring if at all and exxon claims that most of 
the contaminated beaches have been environmentally stabilized

the northeast and midwest are faring poorly in 
the scramble for federal dollars a situation likely to worsen after 
the 1990 census records the sunbelts growth leaders of a rust belt

the demographics are moving against us and representation in 
congress is moving against us william s woodside chairman of 
the northeastmidwest leadership council said wednesday at the

the federal government returned to the 18state region only 87 
cents for every dollar its citizens paid in taxes over the past 
eight years shortchanging it by 359 billion said rep howard 
wolpe dmich 
at a time when our states are short of funds for muchneeded 
investments in education public infrastructure and environmental 
protection we can ill afford such massive disinvestment in our 
region said wolpe cochairman of a bipartisan coalition of more 
than 100 house members from the northeast and midwest 
three developments suggest the trend probably will continue he 
said 
first programs that have pumped large sums into the region in 
recent years are likely victims of deficitreducing cuts 
secondly the 150 billion savings and loan bailout will shift 
money from programs in the northeast and midwest to the southwest 
where most of the troubled sampls are located wolpe said 
third the northeast and midwest will likely lose up to 14 seats 
in the house of representatives as a result of the 1990 census said

wheat farmers will be permitted to increase 
production for 1990 to allow the government to replenish its wheat 
reserves agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
the agriculture department will dip into its reserve for some 35 
million metric tons of wheat for this year and next to meet us 
commitments for international food aid a department statement said 
wednesday 
the change in the wheat program will cause a slight increase in 
the overall income of wheat farmers the statement said 
because of the program change acreage of harvested wheat will 
increase from an estimated 675 million acres to 696 million acres 
under the 1990 wheat program farmers are required to idle 5 
percent of their wheat acreage to qualify for federal supports 
farmers now will be allowed to plant more than 95 percent of the 
farms wheat base rising to a limit of 105 percent the statement 
said 
the action today does not suggest that we expect another year 
of less than average wheat yields nor will it boost stocks 
significantly yeutter said but it will help restore stocks to 
safer levels in view of the tight us and world supply and demand 
situation we should give wheat producers the option to increase 
plantings if they wish to do so

the defense department should look into 
environmental problems at us bases in europe as those countries 
continue to emphasize cleaning up the environment a georgia 
congressman says 
rep richard ray chairman of the house armed services 
environmental restoration subcommittee said wednesday that his 
12day tour of bases in europe last month convinced him that there 
is a changing environmental consciousness in europe 
ray a democrat said the united states should begin cataloging 
environmental problems at its european bases to determine if each 
problem was caused by the united states or already existed 
we need to know in advance the cause of these problems he 
said many of them could have been there since world war ii 
ray said he intends to hold hearings next year on defense 
department environmental programs outside us borders 
changing environmental laws throughout europe could require 
large expenditures of funds in order to comply with the new laws or 
to clean up past disposal storage or spill problems he said 
ray said he will focus the hearings initially on us bases in 
europe but that the department also should be preparing an 
assessment of environmental problems at its bases throughout the 
world 
anywhere we are located in the world we need to be a good 
citizen and we need to be practicing good environmental policies 
he said 
ray said us military bases abroad generally operate under much 
less stringent environmental standards than do domestic bases 
covered by american environmental laws 
ray visited us bases in germany great britain and italy during 
his european trip he also visited the headquarters of the north 
atlantic treaty organization in brussels and met with government 
leaders in bonn west germany

it was just a big boom the ears popped and that was it the 
dirt flew said tony hawkins who was installing support timbers 
in the mine about a half mile from the explosion wednesday morning 
it was just scary my knees started shaking 
hawkins said he and others helped to evacuate some miners who 
scrambled out of the smoky blast site about 1000 feet underground 
in the pyro mining cos william station mine 
by late wednesday rescue teams had removed 10 bodies which were 
taken to the state medical examiners office for autopsies and all 
other miners were safely accounted for authorities said 
fourteen to 15 miners were in the immediate area when a jet of 
flame erupted said jim greenlee an executive vice president of 
pyros parent company costain coal inc 
officials believe some of the victims survived the explosion 
and succumbed to the smoke and dust costain president charles 
schulties said some of the miners were found wearing selfrescuing 
units devices miners carry on their belts to filter out poisonous 
carbon monoxide in emergencies he said 
paul tompkins webster county deputy coroner noted that four of 
the 10 victims sustained firstdegree burns the rest were not 
burned 
schulties said it was reasonable to believe that something 
sparked a buildup of methane an explosive gas that occurs naturally 
in coal seams and that mine operators are required to ventilate he 
acknowledged that the us mine safety and health administration 
cited the mine about two months ago for high levels of methane 
state and federal investigators entered the mine wednesday but 
kathy snyder an msha spokeswoman who was in this town about 140 
miles southwest of louisville said the investigation would not 
begin formally until today 
theres no way to tell you anything about the cause until the 
investigation takes place she said a report will be released in 
several weeks she said 
the accident claimed the highest death toll since 27 miners died 
in a utah coal mine on dec 19 1984 said frank ogorman an msha 
spokesman 
kentucky and federal records show four previous fatal accidents 
at the pyro mine since it opened in february 1983 including a 1986 
death that may have been related to methane less than a year ago 
three miners were hurt in a blasting accident 
ogorman said the explosion occurred as the miners dismantled 
longwall mining machinery which continuously moves a cutter from 
side to side along a long exposed coal face 
the mine which schulties said employs 367 miners on three 
shifts is in rural western kentucky about 40 miles southwest of 
evansville ind 
at union county methodist hospital in the adjacent county a 
disaster plan was implemented calling in offduty doctors and 
nurses and ministers to help counsel family members 
all i could do was just listen to them and let them cry said 
the rev brad whistle of st anns catholic church in morganfield 
despair is despair i just listened to them 
we always live under the danger that there is something there 
that could take us out of this world said the rev bobby joe 
williamson pastor of the new harmony rock springs baptist church in 
wheatcroft 
all we could do now was pray for the families that they be 
sustained and well taken care of we cant change anything said 
williamson 
one of the victims foreman roger clifford 32 of morganfield 
left a wife and two small sons said his brother randy 
all of his men respected him he said they thought a lot of 
him his voice faltering he added you just couldnt beat him 
the other victims were lynn austin ashmore 31 and kenneth 
edward reed 32 of slaughters mark steven hedges 31 of 
morganfield rick dale furgerson 34 and curtis scott 47 of

william fishbait miller who during 
his three decades as the folksy doorkeeper of the us house once 
said howdy maam to the future queen elizabeth ii has died he 
was 80 
miller died tuesday night at his greensboro home said sherrill 
bumgarner director of haneslineberry funeral home the cause of 
death was not given 
miller arrived in washington dc from his native pascagoula 
miss in 1933 from his job as a clerk in the house post office he 
rose to become the official doorkeeper 
his knowledge of the workings of capitol hill led to his book 
fishbait which included accounts of the drinking and sexual 
exploits of several members of congress 
millers job involved more than guarding doors he supervised 357 
employees and an annual budget of 35 million he oversaw 
messengers pages barbers and janitors 
miller was first named minority doorkeeper in 1947 when the 
democrats lost control of the house he had competition for the job 
in 1949 when the democrats regained majority status but he wrote 
personal notes to each member while his opponent sent a mimeographed 
letter 
miller said he helped democratic house members get their choice 
of offices by sanding his fingertips so he could identify by touch 
the metal disks drawn to determine office assignments 
miller who got his nickname as a child for being so small had 
several stories he loved to tell

president corazon aquino said today 
that she will decide whether to allow us military bases to stay 
after 1991 primarily on filipino interests rather than regional 
security concerns 
in an interview with the associated press mrs aquino said she 
was waiting to hear what washington was prepared to offer before 
making her decision on the bases whose lease expires in september 
1991 
us and filipino officials are expected to begin talks late this 
year on the future of clark air base the subic bay naval base and 
four smaller installations 
us officials claim the bases are essential for maintaining 
security in the far east including the sixmember association of 
southeast asian nations to which the philippines belongs 
i will decide this based on what i believe will be in the 
interest of the filipino people mrs aquino said while it is 
true we are of asean my first consideration naturally is for the 
interest of the filipino people and after that what will benefit the 
asean region 
singapore has offered air and naval facilities in case the 
philippines closes the us installations but american officials 
say singapores facilities cannot match the size and location of 
those in the philippines 
last october the united states agreed to pay 461 million a year 
in aid to keep the bases until 1991 
us officials warn that washington is not prepared to pay 
substantially more for the bases because they contribute to 
philippine defense 
during the interview mrs aquino refused to say whether she 
believes the bases guarantee regional security she noted however 
that the presence of american bases did not prevent japanese forces 
from invading this island nation during world war ii 
if you are referring to the second world war they didnt as 
you know contribute too much she said in fact there are 
people who think that perhaps we were the first to be attacked 
simply because of the presence of us bases 
vice president dan quayle is expected to discuss the bases issue 
when he arrives sep 26 for a threeday visit the issue is also 
expected to be raised when mrs aquino visits the united states in 
november 
any new bases agreement must be ratified by twothirds of the 
23member philippine senate last month 12 senators called for the 
bases to be closed in 1991 that would be enough to block any 
extension of the agreement 
mrs aquino also refused to say whether she personally believes a 
new agreement would be in the national interest 
i dont think this is the time to be defining it because we 
dont know first of all do the americans still want to use these 
facilities she said 
and secondly what are they wanting in the matter of the use of 
these bases and also what are they prepared to do this has to be 
discussed lengthily if and when we start talks on the bases 
regardless of the outcome mrs aquino said she wanted to retain 
close ties with the united states the philippines former colonial 
ruler 
i am hoping that both the americans and the filipinos can 
maintain a very friendly relationship because we filipinos would 
like to believe that there is more to the relationship than just 
the matter of the bases she said 
i think sometimes some of us believe that maybe where some 
americans are concerned the only thing that probably ties the two 
nations together is the presence of the us facilities in our 
bases

a jury declared operation rescue founder 
randall terry and four members of the radical antiabortion group 
innocent of misdemeanor charges stemming from blockades of womens 
health clinics 
jurors indicated wednesday after delivering their verdicts that 
they had accepted terrys necessity defense in which he and his 
codefendants claimed laws can be broken to prevent a greater harm 
the municipal court judge had told the jury to disregard this 
defense because abortions are legal 
terry who represented himself praised the jurys decisions 
thank god that the jurors had the courage to declare that our 
efforts were to save children and not a deliberate attempt to commit 
a crime terry said in a statement 
the acquittals were greeted with dismay by the california 
abortion rights action league 
i am flabbergasted that the jury did not convict the defendants 
of trespassing and conspiracy said robin schneider the groups 
executive director 
after four days of deliberation the jury found the activists 
innocent of five misdemeanor charges including trespassing and 
resisting arrest 
the jury also deadlocked 84 for conviction on conspiracy counts 
against terry 30 of binghamton ny michael mcmonagle 36 of 
philadelphia and jeff white 31 
judge richard paez declared a mistrial on those counts meaning 
they could be refiled prosecutors said a decision on refiling would 
be made by oct 2 
the others on trial were don bennette 36 of mission viejo and 
andrew eppink 41 of palmdale 
the case stemmed from the blockade of a los angeles womens 
clinic on march 25 the demonstrations were held as the us supreme 
court considered a missouri law it eventually upheld broadening the 
role of states in regulating abortions 
the five were on trial for allegedly ignoring a federal 
injunction barring activists from blocking entrances to abortion 
clinics terry denied he ever was served a copy of the injunction 
juror priscilla ramos agreed with terry saying the men were 
trying to save lives and we were for that too id love to shake 
randall terrys hand 
juror edmond bleavins 43 said he hoped the verdict would send a 
message to the police department the police just brutalized these 
people in my opinion he said 
bleavins said he did not intend to give operation rescue the 
message they could keep on doing what theyve been doing he 
said the jury deadlocked on conspiracy because at least one juror 
believed the defendants intent was not to break the law but to save 
babies 
the judge had admonished terry and the other defendants for 
repeatedly drawing the jurys attention to their stance against 
legal abortions 
during the trial terry frequently referred to abortion clinics 
as aboratorium killing centers and abortion mills 
prompting paez to rebuke him for using inflammatory language 
the issue at trial was not abortion but trespassing the judge 
said ruling the defendants motives for their actions were not 
legitimate defenses in the case

most new humanities graduate students will have to 
take a year off to work in factories or rural areas to improve their 
political understanding an official report said today 
the china youth news daily said firstyear graduate students will 
be sent to work in grassroots units for training 
the announcement by the state education commission applies to 
students studying philosophy economics history law education and 
literature 
it was the latest effort by the government to increase student 
exposure to work programs and political education following 
authorities violent crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in june 
the government claims students joined the movement because they 
were politically and socially naive 
the daily quoted the education commission as saying working in 
grassroots units is good for reforming graduates thinking it 
helps to correct their problems of lacking practical experience and 
ignorance of the country and the masses 
it said the training will help ensure that students remain 
faithful to socialist principles and oppose bourgeois 
liberalization or support of western ideas 
the students can only go back to school after they complete their 
training the newspaper said 
the government has denied the work programs are a throwback to 
the cultural revolution when millions of students and intellectuals 
were sent to the countryside to work as manual laborers for up to 10 
years 
last month the government announced that civil servants who 
graduated from college in 1985 or later must work one or two years 
in grassroots units to improve their political understanding 
many young government workers joined the demonstrations or 
expressed support for their democratic goals 
the civil servants were warned that their residence permits 
required for living and working in beijing will be switched to 
their new locations and they will only be allowed to return to the 
capital if they perform well 
beijing university a hotbed of protest during the spring 
prodemocracy movement has had its freshman class cut from 2100 to 
800 and has been told that the majority of new students must spend a 
year studying at a military school in another city before coming to 
beijing 
students at all beijing universities are being required to start 
the school year with a month of political education classes in which 
they must study government documents justifying the crackdown on the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion and the need to fight bourgeois 
liberalization

a nursing home aide smothered five 
patients because it relieved tension and enjoyed cleaning the 
body of one victim her alleged coconspirator in a lovers death 
pact testified 
testimony began wednesday in the trial of gwendolyn graham who 
is charged with five counts of firstdegree murder and one of 
conspiracy to murder in the 1987 deaths of female patients at alpine 
manor nursing home in subruban walker 
graham and her former lover catherine wood allegedly formed a 
pact to kill patients 
we were supposed to take turns killing so we could never leave 
each other said wood who also worked as an aide at the home 
wood 27 has pleaded guilty to one count of seconddegree murder 
and one count of conspiracy to murder in exchange for her plea and 
testimony against graham two counts of firstdegree murder were 
dropped 
the grand rapids woman testified she lacked the nerve to kill any 
patients though she acted as a lookout while graham suffocated them 
with washcloths she also said she and graham would select patients 
by pinching their noses to see if they would struggle 
wood said graham told her she enjoyed killing patients because 
it relieved tension she was always real happy afterwards and i 
wanted her to be happy she said graham seemed to enjoy bathing 
her first victim in preparation for the funeral home 
she said she never tried to stop graham i never told her no 
i never loved anybody the way i loved her 
she said graham took souvenirs such as anklets and earrings 
from each victim 
i didnt think it was right a lot of those people had a lot of 
life left in them and we were there to care for them not to abuse 
them wood said 
wood said she witnessed graham suffocating the first victim 
marguerite chambers she had a washcloth over her nose and mouth 
and chambers was making noises she was jerking wood 
testified 
she said she and graham told some other aides at the home about 
the slayings but that no one took the confessions seriously 
defense attorney james piazza opened by calling wood a 
spiteful aggressive vindictive manipulator who made up the 
story he said graham went along with it thinking it was a mind 
game a big joke 
he said wood concocted the story to get back at graham who had 
left town for her native tyler texas with another nurses aide 
after police began investigating woods alleged confession to her 
exhusband wood needed a sacrificial lamb piazza said she 
offered up gwen graham because she feared of going to prison for the 
rest of her life firstdegree murder carries a mandatory life 
sentence without parole while wood has a chance of parole in 10 
years on the lesser charges 
when the five patients died between jan 18 and april 7 1987 
their deaths were listed as natural and no autopsies were performed 
two bodies were exhumed but showed no definitive signs of 
suffocation

former president carter says he is trying to move 
peace negotiations between ethiopia and eritrea toward compromise 
but both sides seem satisfied that they were even able to get 
together 
carter said during a college forum wednesday that he wont give 
the ethiopian government and the eritrean peoples liberation front 
a deadline on reaching an agreement he just wants to move them 
beyond the excitement over their first negotiations after 28 years 
of fighting 
i spent very frustrating hours this morning with the eritreans 
and ethiopians trying to get them to agree on a compromise 
carter said theyve been in the same room eating at the same 
table exchanging ideas and information 
both sides are so proud of what theyve done so far that they 
are inclined to look upon this partial success as adequate 
the talks continued through a sixth day wednesday without carter 
carter center spokeswoman beth carpenter said talks broke off 
late wednesday and were expected to continue today 
carter said he had cautioned both sides against negative 
reports to the press saying such statements make it doubly 
difficult for them to go back into negotiations the next day 
about 1 million people have died in fighting and famine related 
to the war over the independence of eritrea a northern province 
that contains the east african countrys only direct access to the 
red sea 
the eritrean front in the past has demanded the people of eritrea 
be allowed to vote on whether they want independence federation 
with ethiopia or autonomy the government has proposed a greater 
measure of autonomy for the province but has unequivocally ruled out 
any referendum 
carter has said the delegates had agreed to 13 items but he has 
not said what those items were he also has said that agreeing on an 
agenda for future talks would be the most difficult issue 
the college forum wednesday was carters eighth annual town hall 
meeting for students and faculty of emory university 
carter called for more funding for drug treatment a strong 
commitment to the coast guard in stopping drugs from reaching the 
country and for encouraging international cooperation in the drug 
war he also called for the bush administration to monitor the 
transfer of funds between us and foreign banks to help monitor the 
flow of drug money 
the crowd roared when one student asked what carters favorite 
latenight tv program was and he replied he only watched latenight 
television when his daughter amy was on david lettermans show 
wed watch to see if amy had been arrested lately he joked 
of his daughters four civil disobedience arrests which letterman 
has parodied but so far weve been proud of her every time

attraction when it opens in 1991

ralph nader americas leading consumer crusader 
said today that information is the root of all consumer protection 
and urged a national freedom of information law for japan 
nader said such a law should be patterned after the us freedom 
of information act which he called the strongest guarantee of 
information access in the world 
japan has no national freedom of information law although some 
states or prefectures possess weak ones nader told reporters at a 
luncheon 
he said access to information about government spending and 
standards is crucial to challenging policies in such areas as 
asbestos in public buildings auto safety air quality and nuclear 
power 
access to information also would serve as a tonic to japans 
lifeless consumer movement he said 
now the ability to turn civic voices into civic success just 
isnt here he added 
for instance he said a movement to rid public schools of 
asbestos cant get off the ground because citizens are unable to 
obtain information on what school buildings contain insulation or 
roofing made with asbestos 
japans consumers pay among the highest prices in the world for 
housing food and services and its consumer movement has been 
relatively weak 
big business has had the ear of the governing liberal democratic 
party for the past 34 years 
consumer groups and analysts say however that with the partys 
flagging popularity resulting primarily from a 3 percent sales tax 
imposed in april consumer interests are commanding the attention of 
the highest levels of government 
nader whose nonprofit congress watch is based in washington 
dc said both the united states and japan aid selected domestic 
industries with subsidies and use trade policies and barriers to 
keep competitive products out of their markets 
subsidies to japanese rice farmers cost consumers 18 billion 
annually according to us estimates 
since citizens pay for these subsidies and pay higher prices 
because of such trade policies nader proposed a consumer trust 
fund paid for by protected industries to support consumer 
protection activities 
he also urged stronger health and safety standards and rigorous 
enforcement of antimonopoly laws and said citizens should have the 
right to file class action lawsuits

actress zsa zsa gabor on trial for 
slapping a beverly hills cop says she doesnt want to go to jail 
because shes afraid of lesbians 
the municipal court jury that could put the flamboyant actress 
behind bars were sworn in wednesday opening arguments were to begin 
today 
on the steps of the courthouse wednesday miss gabor confided in 
reporters her fears of being convicted a conviction carries a 
maximum two years in jail and 4000 fine 
mother is so worried miss gabor said in a deathly voice 
she phoned me this morning and asked me dahling are they going to 
book you in jail 
i told her i hoped not i have claustrophobia and would be very 
unhappy in jail 
and besides they are all lesbians in jail and im so scared 
of lesbians can you imagine being in jail with all those women 
miss gabor is charged with misdemeanor battery on a police 
officer disobeying a police officers orders driving with an 
expired license having an open container of alcohol in her car and 
having an expired car registration 
she was arrested june 14 after a policeman stopped her for having 
expired registration tags on her 215000 rollsroyce corniche 
convertible while the officer was checking for other infractions 
miss gabor allegedly drove away only to be caught again two blocks 
away 
at that point the officer said she slapped him 
the former miss hungary pleaded innocent july 12 and maintains 
she was verbally and physically abused by the officer paul kramer 
the defenses strategy in the trial which is expected to last 
about two weeks is to show that kramer had a history of harassing 
celebrities 
prosecutors have said they would try to prevent the testimony 
from being heard some of the past incidents involving kramer are 
too old or different from miss gabors to be pertinent to her trial 
prosecutors said 
miss gabor denied she savored the publicity accompanying her 
trial 
the beverly hills police started this it was two days later my 
press agent called and said zsa zsa you have to protect 
yourself i dont need this publicity she said 
whether she needs it or not the press has hounded miss gabor and 
her eighth and current husband prince frederick von anhalt 
germanys duke of saxony 
he wore dark sunglasses in court wednesday the third day of 
tedious jury selection reporters were watching closely to see if he 
would fall asleep as he had been reported doing the previous two 
days 
court documents reveal miss gabor was born june 6 1923 making 
her 66 although she has been extremely secretive about her age

was towed to a dock where a second barge arrived early today to 
take on the remaining gasoline from a damaged 315000gallon tank 
said crawley 
refloating the 300foot barge took only 15 minutes said another 
coast guard spokesman lt cmdr paul mulligan 
the triborough bridge and a railroad bridge that had been closed 
to avoid igniting fumes were reopened 6 hours after the morania 440 
struck bottom about 150 to 200 feet offshore in a rocky channel 
crawley said the tugboat east coast which was towing the barge 
apparently took a curve too tight or got too close to the bank

an alleged crack dealer has been arrested in the 
slaying of a woman who crusaded against drugs in her brooklyn 
neighborhood and police said they were investigating whether 
higherups had put out a contract on her 
the arrest of william figueroa 26 came after police made the 
case a top priority and after a crackdown on drug dealers got some 
of them to talk police said 
figueroa also known as willie bundles was charged wednesday 
with murder and reckless endangerment in the slaying aug 8 of maria 
hernandez a 34yearold mother of three said chief of detectives

through her bedroom window she and her husband carlos had tried 
to keep drug dealers off their street and he had received numerous 
death threats 
after seeing news pictures of figueroa hernandez said he 
believed the man was a drug dealer with whom he had argued however 
police said the only drug charges against figueroa were brought in 
massachusetts 
inspector richard mayronne described figueroa as a lowlevel 
crack dealer and said he also apparently had sold heroin police 
said they were seeking two other people believed to be with figueroa 
when mrs hernandez was killed 
the investigation is continuing to determine whether there was 
a broader conspiracy and whether or not some groups in effect put 
out a contract colangelo said

kill mrs hernandez or just frighten the couple the result is the 
same an innocent woman dead fighting drugs

a billiondollar deal for the worlds tallest 
building has hit a high hurdle 
neither sears roebuck and co nor canadian developer olympia amp 
york developments ltd would say wednesday whether the deal was 
dead but its condition was clearly critical 
the chicago tribune today quoted sources as saying sears had set 
a friday deadline for any deal with olympia amp york sears is 
prepared to meet with other parties next week if there is no 
agreement the paper said 
the roadblock sources said is a dispute over which party should 
pay the increased property taxes stemming from an expected 
reappraisal of the 110story 1707foot building after the sale 
there is a major impasse over the tax situation said kevin 
haggarty an executive vice president of cushman amp wakefield a new 
york real estate firm that was advising olympia amp york its a 
serious situation 
the wall street journal quoted unidentified sources tuesday as 
saying the parties were prepared to sign an agreement tuesday for 
about 1 billion when the reappraisal issue arose 
haggarty said he could not confirm those details 
olympia amp york confirmed the talks were stalled but would not 
elaborate 
sears spokesman douglas fairweather declined to comment 
another sticking point sources told the associated press was 
the difficulty of finding tenants for the 2 million square feet of 
office space that sears will vacate in the 37millionsquarefoot 
building when it moves its retailing division to a new complex in 
suburban hoffman estates beginning in 1992 
olympia amp york reportedly considered signing british publisher 
maxwell communications corp as its anchor tenant but maxwell has 
been eyeing sites in the suburbs according to a source who 
described office space in the 15yearold tower as incredibly 
obsolete 
maxwell spokesman david adler declined comment on the companys 
plans 
sears had agreed to continue paying rent for six years on the 
space it plans to vacate but was unwilling to shoulder any increased 
taxes according to the journal 
the nations biggest retailer announced last october it would 
sell the chicago landmark as part of a corporate restructuring it 
reportedly began serious talks with olympia amp york earlier this 
summer 
at least three other parties reportedly bid for the building 
although olympia amp york has been the only one to confirm its 
interest

three men recently discharged from a state 
mental hospital have drowned in the past two months and state 
officials have asked for an investigation 
the body of joseph c thomas 58 was recovered tuesday from a 
creek after he was reported missing from a boarding home he had 
been discharged from the philadelphia state hospital in january as 
part of the states effort to close the outdated 77yearold 
institution known as byberry 
two other former byberry patients tyrone gainey 37 and joseph 
gutgesell 31 drowned last month in the schuylkill river in 
separate incidents a third patient leaped into the river but 
survived 
state welfare secretary john f white jr on wednesday said he 
would ask district attorney ron castille to investigate 
is it merely a coincidence that these three managed to find 
their way to water and meet their deaths in the same way white 
said there very well may be something else at play here 
gov robert p casey indefinitely postponed the hospital closing 
which had been scheduled for sept 30 after the first two deaths 
because of questions over whether the patients discharged can live 
on their own 
white said the latest death further proved the need to review the 
closing 
all three patients had been assigned to treatment teams that were 
supposed to watch over them closely as an alternative to 
hospitalization and white said officials were trying to get gainey 
back into a hospital at the time of his death white would not say 
why 
an autopsy on thomas showed he drowned but the circumstances 
were listed as undetermined gutgesells death was ruled an 
accidental drowning as of last month there had been no ruling on 
how gainey drowned 
thomas had been living in his own apartment until friday when he 
was moved into a personalcare boarding home because of heart 
problems

a palestinian accused of slaying 16 jews by 
forcing a crowded bus into a ravine pleaded guilty to murder today 
but innocent to a separate charge that the crime was premeditated 
the july 6 bus plunge in which an american and two canadian 
tourists died along with 13 israelis was the worst attack on jews 
during the 21monthold palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation 
abdel hadi ghanem 23 from nusseirat refugee camp in the 
occupied gaza strip entered the pleas in jerusalem district court 
authorities maintain ghanem acted out of palestinian nationalism 
and rode the bus route repeatedly to find the most dangerous spot to 
attack 
he reportedly told investigators he wanted to avenge the beating 
of a friend by soldiers 
defense lawyer jonathan kuttab brought to court thursday a 
paralyzed palestinian in a wheelchair radwan abu shamsah whose 
injury he said motivated ghanems attack 
the court agreed to kuttabs request for an independent 
psychiatrist to examine ghanem it postponed the trial for three 
months 
we are pleading not guilty as far as the planning and the 
intent kuttab told israel radio outside the court we are going 
to get full evidence later to try and see what in fact motivated him 
to do something like this when he was not a politicized person at 
all 
police say ghanem grabbed the steering wheel of a jerusalembound 
bus on the main highway from tel aviv forcing it into a deep ravine 
as he shouted allahu akbar a religious call meaning god is 
great that has become a battle cry of the palestinian revolt 
it was reported later that ghanem may have instead screamed the 
name of his friend who was beaten kuttab said on thursday that the 
defendant shouted radwan radwan as he wrenched the steering 
wheel from the bus driver 
militant israelis responded to the bus attack by stoning cars 
driven by palestinians one palestinian was killed in such an attack 
near the gaza strip

while some soviet emigres may one day want to 
go back to the soviet union the united states will not turn away 
any who have already left their country and wish to come here a 
bush administration official said today 
jewel lafontant us coordinator for refugees said reporters 
had misunderstood her comment at a hearing wednesday that nearly 
5000 soviet emigres in italy and austria who have been denied entry 
to the united states can always go to israel or return to russia 
in these days of glasnost thats not an impossible thing 
all those stranded in rome and vienna will be admitted to the 
united states whether as fully funded refugees or as parolees with 
private funding lafontant said today as she resumed testimony 
before the house subcommittees on europe and on immigration 
rest assured they will not be stranded in europe or forced to 
go elsewhere she said 
lafonants comment wednesday drew immediate criticism from some 
in congress who said returning to the soviet union could subject 
emigres to persecution 
her remarks reflect the administrations quandary about how to 
reconcile the rising tide of soviet emigres with shrinking us 
budgets for years us demands that the soviets allow free jewish 
emigration were a cornerstone of us foreign policy 
several congressional committees are holding hearings this week 
on the administrations proposal to admit 50000 soviets as refugees 
in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 the allocation announced 
wednesday is part of the overall us refugee allotment of 125000 
worldwide 
more than 17000 soviets are waiting in italy for permission to 
enter the united states and about 4700 have been denied refugee 
status 
today the administration told congress it is phasing out refugee 
processing centers in rome and vienna and beefing up the us 
embassy staff in moscow to deal with the flood of applications 
rep bruce morrison dconn the immigration subcommittee 
chairman rejected lafontants suggestion wednesday that jews might 
return to the soviet union he said they are still subject to 
persecution in the soviet union 
rep hamilton fish rny said i dont think this is an 
appropriate response to someone whos been languishing outside his 
country with the expectation of being allowed to come here you 
cant turn around and send them back 
while few seriously expect soviet emigres to return to the soviet 
union lafontants proposal reflects an increasingly accepted view 
that since the united states cannot take in the flood of applicants 
some should consider going to israel 
while most jewish emigres leave on israeli visas they opt for 
the united states once they reach vienna or rome for economic and 
cultural reasons 
soviet citizens most of them jews are applying to leave their 
country for the united states at a rate of about 4000 a month this 
has created a backlog of about 35000 applicants in moscow and 
another 17000 or more in italy and austria 
if the trend continues jewish groups expect at least 72000 
applicants next year and possibly more than 100000 the 
administration knows its proposed slots are insufficient 
with no sign of decline in applications from soviet citizens 
seeking admission to the us we judge that 50000 is if anything 
a conservative estimate of the potential admission requirements 
said princeton lyman the state departments director of the office 
of refugee programs 
he pledged that top priority would be given those soviets who 
have already applied 
jewish groups say this means most of the 50000 slots will be 
taken up with people who have already applied and that new 
applicants will mostly have to wait 
under the proposed system that will conduct all processing in 
moscow applicants will have to wait in the soviet union rather 
than in rome or vienna at a time when antisemitism is rising 
jewish groups say 
this raises great concern for the applicants safety said arnold 
leibowitz of the hebrew immigrants aid society people will be 
reluctant to come forward and apply tell you their tales of 
persecution and then wait around for years glasnost or not said 
the washington counsel for the organization that helps resettle 
soviet jews 
other jewish activists worry that at the current rate of denial 
for refugee status which stands at between 20 and 56 percent many 
soviet jews will be afraid to apply 
the denials stem from a change in policy which no longer 
automatically grants refugee status to soviets on the assumption 
that they suffer from persecution as a group under the new 
directive each applicant must prove a wellfounded fear of 
persecution

announcement by the state education commission applies to students 
studying philosophy economics history law education and 
literature 
it was the latest effort by the government to increase student 
exposure to work programs and political education following the 
crackdown in beijing 
chinas state council accused liang of allowing his wife and 
children to amass personal wealth and of abusing his power by having 
his son settle in hong kong the prosperous british colony on the 
south china coast according to the official account 
the probeijing wen wei po newspaper of hong kong today quoted 
the governors son liang ming as saying beijing approved his 
coming to hong kong and that neither he nor his mother had gone to 
hainan to do business 
liang xiang was appointed governor of the southern island of 
hainan last year after it was elevated to provincial status and made 
a special economic zone to attract foreign investment 
zhao was a major supporter of the rapid development of hainan and 
is believed to have been instrumental in having liang appointed the 
islands leader 
liang also reportedly supported a tolerant stance toward the 
islands students participating in the prodemocracy movement which 
the central government accused zhao of backing 
hainan communist party chief xu shijie was quoted as telling the 
provincial congress wednesday that liangs firing was a personal 
matter it was not related to factional struggle and it was not 
related to the fall of zhao ziyang the china news service said in 
a report on xus remarks 
but a foreign diplomat based in hong kong who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said he thought politics was involved in the firing 
noting that liang has been linked in the past to zhao ziyang 
the diplomat said the dismissal probably indicated an intent by 
the central government to reassert some control over the nations 
southern coastal provinces which have enjoyed much autonomy while 
leading chinas economic reform and modernization drive 
the diplomat said it was unclear how many more dismissals might 
follow in the region 
liang xiang was vice mayor and party boss in canton then vice 
governor of guangdong province before becoming the head of shenzhen 
in march 1981 he took up his post in hainan after temporarily 
retiring in 1986 
wang ruowang 71 the shanghai writer reported under arrest is 
one of modern chinas most famed and prolific commentators noted 
for his attacks on the abuses of the party system 
ming pao said wang only recently was detained but that since the 
june 4 military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement police had 
been stationed in front of his house and his telephone bugged 
wang had participated in movement demonstrations and complained 
to senior leader deng xiaoping the newspaper said 
he was expelled from the communist party in 1987 during the 
campaign against antibourgeois liberalization or liberal western 
influences

a drug addict convicted of killing prime 
minister olof palme told an appeals court today that he wept when he 
read of palmes death and denied he shot the popular swedish leader 
nothing of what will be said here can make me into olof palmes 
killer said christer pettersson it can only make me a suspect 
for the killing but never into the killer he said during two 
hours of questioning 
the 42yearold swede with a long criminal record was convicted 
by a lower court on july 27 of slaying the fourterm premier in 1986 
as he walked home from a movie with his wife lisbeth 
pettersson appealed the conviction and life sentence imposed by 
the district court the prosecution made a counterappeal seeking 
to upgrade a second charge from endangering mrs palme to attempted 
murder 
pettersson said he learned of palmes death from a newspaper the 
day after the feb 28 killing 
i get the paper i see a picture of olof palme and read the 
headline olof palme killed i think my god and go into the 
kitchen and sit down i am so sad that i shed a tear no i shed 
several tears he told the court 
i really liked and admired that man i always have done he 
said adding that he voted for palmes social democrats every time 
but once 
pettersson who has a previous manslaughter conviction and has 
undergone courtordered psychiatric treatment said he did not hate 
palme or anyone else hate blinds you i have a short temper but 
i have never felt hatred he said 
prosecutors have suggested pettersson loathes authority and 
offered this alleged hatred as a motive for the killing 
the convicted man admitted he threatened or assaulted drug 
dealers about 600 times to steal amphetamines during a sixyear 
period in the 1970s when he was not in jail or a psychiatric 
institution 
but he said he never used a gun never attacked anyone from the 
back and was violent only in acute situations 
repeating his alibi pettersson said he came into stockholm from 
his suburban home to get amphetamines and went to a gambling club 
before catching a 1046 pm commuter train home he fell asleep and 
missed his station but still returned to his apartment by midnight 
he said palme was shot at 1121 pm 
during the lowercourt trial mrs palme identified pettersson as 
the man she saw standing a few feet away immediately after the 
shooting when her husband fell to the ground fatally wounded by a 
shot in the back she saw no gun and the murder weapon never was 
found 
the six laymen on the eightmember jury voted pettersson guilty 
on the basis of mrs palmes testimony two professional judges on 
the jury voted for acquittal citing lack of forensic evidence 
the svea court of appeals consisting of four judges and three 
laymen is expected to conclude petterssons case on oct 9

fw de klerk was elected today to 
a fiveyear term as president and pledged to ensure that the 
voteless black majority becomes part of the decisionmaking 
process 
the electoral college dominated by parliament members of the 
governing national party cast a unanimous vote for de klerk a day 
after the largest legal protest march in south africas history took 
place with his approval 
the brief meeting of the electors took place in a parliamentary 
chamber near st georges cathedral starting point for wednesdays 
march by more than 20000 people 
accepting the outcome of the vote de klerk described the next 
five years as a decisive period and promised to be a leader for all 
south africans not just the white voters who kept the national 
party in control of parliament in elections last week 
we are committed to lead south africa through peaceful means to 
a new dispensation he said it will be a tremendous privilege 
to lead this country to this goal 
de klerk 53 has served as acting president since aug 15 a day 
after he and other cabinet ministers pressured pw botha into 
resigning after 11 years in power de klerk is to be inaugurated 
wednesday in pretoria he is expected to expand on the brief remarks 
he made today in a major inauguration speech 
in the past four weeks de klerk has pledged repeatedly to seek a 
new south africa in which racial tensions will be defused and 
the disenfranchised black majority will receive some form of 
political rights 
black leaders have received his proposals with skepticism but de 
klerk depicted his approval of the protest march in cape town as 
proof of his sincerity a wide range of commentators today commended 
his decision 
the sowetan the countrys largest blackoriented daily 
newspaper said de klerk scored a public relations coup it said 
the lives of hundreds of black protesters could have been saved if 
previous white rulers had thought as de klerk thought 
beeld a progovernment newspaper said de klerk took a 
bighearted and meaningful step by allowing the march it said the 
government has shown radical groups in south africa and the 
whole world that its door really is open to discussions over 
reform 
de klerk was harshly criticized by the farright conservative 
party which sought an urgent debate in parliament to discuss the 
security situation a conservative spokesman moolman mentz said 
approval of the march was a knife thrust in the back of the 
security forces 
police stayed out of sight as marchers followed anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu and cape town mayor gordon oliver from st 
georges cathedral to city hall two weeks earlier police broke up 
protest marches in cape town with whips batons and a water cannon 
that sprayed purple water 
the main reason for the march was to denounce police violence 
against protesters during a 6weekold campaign to defy apartheid 
activists say police were responsible for the deaths of at least 
23 people in cape towns black and mixedrace townships during 
protests of the sept 6 elections which excluded blacks 
their claims were supported by lt gregory rockman a mixedrace 
policeman who accused white police officers of brutally suppressing 
an election protest in his neighborhood of mitchells plain 
today rockman who has become a folk hero in the townships 
peacefully dispersed a demonstration in mitchells plain in his 
honor 
the government originally rejected the activists accounts of the 
violence and death toll but police now say they know of 19 unrest 
deaths in the area on election night including nine in which police 
may have been responsible 
the cape times said de klerks decision to allow the march was 
statesmanlike overriding the conventional wisdom of the security 
establishment and demonstrating a cool ability to act quickly and 
sensibly under pressure 
it seems the de klerk era may be different the cape town 
newspaper said lets hope so

east german refugees streamed across the 
hungarianaustrian border today after a threeday lull apparently 
spurred by fears that budapest may slam the door shut to the west 
austrias interior ministry in vienna reported that 100 east 
germans were arriving at the border each hour 
west german border authorities said more than 700 new refugees 
arrived overnight 
on wednesday hungarys deputy foreign minister ferenc somogyi 
said his country will grant east germans unfettered passage to the 
west only temporarily he did not elaborate 
hungary has not made clear how long it will allow east germans to 
leave for west germany without permission from east berlin 
austrian officials said the number had exceeded 13150 by midday 
today aid workers in budapest said another 500 east germans were 
waiting for passage westward from international aid camps in hungary 
somogyi said in an interview on wednesday that hungary will 
renegotiate agreements with its warsaw pact allies restricting 
travel to the west by east bloc citizens to reflect its new 
commitment to the rights of refugees 
but budapest will only allow citizens from other east bloc 
nations to cross its border with austria if it determines they are 
refugees under un guidelines somogyi said 
the official mti news agency reported a second day of talks in 
east berlin between a senior hungarian communist party official 
maria ormos and an east german politburo member in charge of 
ideology kurt hager 
mti described the talks as friendly and open but made clear 
that the two warsaw pact allies remain far apart over hungarys role 
in the exodus 
in berlin the east german communist party daily neues 
deutschland called the meeting businesslike and open it also 
made no critical remarks about the budapest government for the first 
time since the refugee wave began suggesting some mending of the 
rift created by the affair 
somogyi insisted wednesday that the east germans were not 
refugees and they did not request asylum as refugees because 
west germany grants citizenship on request to any east germans 
in west germany officials said wednesday that refugee camps were 
emptying quickly as thousands left to join west german relatives and 
look for jobs 
east germany has bitterly accused its warsaw pact ally of 
breaking an agreement and undermining its sovereignty by allowing 
east germans to flee to the west 
hungarys official mti news agency carried a terse note wednesday 
night from the foreign ministry promising to extensively 
contradict accusations contained in a formal protest by the east 
german government 
the rebuttal would come soon the ministry said without 
elaboration 
hungarys role illustrates the dramatic changes sweeping eastern 
europe especially in poland and hungary poland is the first warsaw 
pact nation to install a government led by noncommunists while 
hungarys reformist communist leadership has promised free elections 
by june 
a polish foreign ministry spokesman today confirmed there were 
east german refugees holed up in the west german embassy in warsaw 
about 50 east germans were in the embassy polish television 
reported 
the vatican newspaper today praised hungary for permitting the 
exodus and lauded its recently introduced political and social 
reforms in hungary 
hungary began removing barbed wire and other barriers from its 
westernmost border in may permitting more than 6000 east germans 
to escape over it 
it then allowed thousands more to flee beginning sunday after 
thousands of east german crammed makeshift camps to wait for passage 
to west germany they said they were tired of political repression 
and economic stagnation in their country one of the most rigidly 
controlled in the communist world 
to resolve the crisis hungary suspended a 1969 accord with east 
germany agreeing no east germans could leave for the west from 
hungary without east berlins permission 
somogyi said similar agreements with other warsaw pact countries 
are no longer in line with our newly assumed international 
responsibilities such as our having signed the geneva convention on 
refugees 
we are working to bring these various agreements into harmony 
with the new foreign policy of our country he said 
as part of its reforms hungary became the first soviet bloc 
nation to join the un convention on the rights of refugees 
it has accepted about 17000 fleeing hungarian ethnics from 
romania and hungarian officials acknowledge that tensions over the 
situation contributed to its decision to join the un convention

the success of strategic arms reduction talks 
with the soviet union will hang in the balance during the next month 
as congressional conferees draw up military spending plans for next 
year the chairman of the senate armed services committee said today 
sen sam nunn dga said the vast differences between the house 
and senate over us strategic programs must be negotiated into a 
consensus if the strategic arms reduction talks start are to 
succeed 
i think the start talks are at stake in the next 30 days 
nunn said in a breakfast speech at the us chamber of commerce 
if we do not come out with a sensible strategic nuclear program 
that the president himself has confidence in and the joint chiefs 
of staff have confidence in start talks are going to be a long 
long time coming he said 
the house cut 502 million from the 11 billion president bush 
had sought for the railbased mx nuclear missile system and 
eliminated all 100 million the president had sought for the 
midgetman nuclear missile program 
the senate endorsed bushs request in both missile programs and 
nunn argued today that congress must give bush the tools to do the 
job in the arms negotiations in geneva 
if we are going to have any kind of successful outcome in arms 
control weve got to have consensus at home nunn said if 
we dont develop consensus at home were not going to be able to 
develop one with the soviets 
in a separate area nunn said the united states should provide 
whatever military assistance is requested by the government of 
colombia in its war against drug cartels 
my view is the government of colombia is not going ask the us 
to come in and fight all their battles with military forces he 
said they have a very large military force 
i think they can handle it if we give them help equipment 
assistance and training he said i would view us primarily in 
that role if they want further help then we should consider it 
very carefully 
for the longterm nunn said he favors jamaican prime minister 
michael manleys proposal for the creation of an interamerican drug 
squad where the us would participate but not be the only 
participant

educators are voicing high hopes for president 
bushs education summit with the nations governors but warn of a 
tremendous letdown if the politicians fail to find ways to improve 
americas schools 
bush on wednesday held the first of several listening 
sessions with education leaders leading up to his sept 2728 
summit with the governors in charlottesville va 
the educators who are being excluded from the summit itself 
said afterward they urged bush to use the conference to help forge a 
new national consensus on what children should learn 
the white house indicated that is in fact what bush has in mind 
bush wants the governors to help develop a set of realistic 
goals for the nation in education said spokesman marlin fitzwater 
but fitzwater said that bush is likely to propose such goals not 
at the summits end but at a later date 
responding to reports that some governors are upset the summit 
working sessions will be closed fitzwater said today the governors 
told the white house they wanted it that way so they were free to 
tell the president what they really thought 
the only sessions that are closed are the working sessions and 
i think they prefer them that way he said 
he promised ample media access to the plenary sessions and 
press conferences backtoback every minute of the morning 
american federation of teachers president albert shanker one of 
17 education leaders at the brainstorming session with bush and 
secretary of education lauro f cavazos warned afterward 
there will be a tremendous letdown if the summit takes place 
and turns out to be a mere media event and doesnt come up with 
anything thats substantive 
keith geiger his counterpart at the national education 
association said i dont think any of us are looking for another 
report 
geiger called it an excellent freewheeling discussion 
and said the educators overriding message was that the president 
could lead in a national role of setting educational goals for 
this country 
that could include spelling out what youngsters need to know in 
order to graduate from high school he added 
shanker said washington doesnt need to establish a national 
curriculum but must do something about the paucity of graduates 
able to read and write at advanced levels 
earlier fitzwater told reporters the president believes that 
the nations education system needs more accountability in terms of 
student achievement he will suggest the need for a resultsoriented 
education system and ask the governors for their ideas to make 
education meet those goals in a more effective manner 
cavazos noted that many governors were holding their own 
presummit meetings to canvass experts for advice and he emphasized 
that the charlottesville meeting was only a start 
its the beginning of an opening dialogue not only with 
the governors but with all of the people with the teachers with 
the educators with the students parents said cavazos 
bush campaigned on a pledge to be the education president 
cavazos said the administrations aim is to move education back to 
the forefront of national attention 
cavazos has complained that school reform has produced only 
meager improvements everyone in that room knows what it takes 
the fundamental question is why hasnt it happened he said 
meanwhile the national governors association held a daylong 
hearing to allow educators business leaders and others to offer 
ideas for the summit 
arkansas gov bill clinton said that by convening the summit 
bush is going to have to assume some personal responsibility for 
the future of the quality of education 
once you pick up this ball you pretty well got to run with it 
if you try to put it down after the summits over then i think you 
have dashed expectations disappointed people a divided country 
people disoriented said clinton a democrat 
south carolina gov carroll campbell said i dont think that 
we have any magical cure but i do think that when we finish this 
process of pouring all the thought and ideas into the funnel that 
at the other end we will be able to come out with a little clearer 
focus of where we want to go as a nation and in the states

a small bomb shattered the window of a york 
bookstore owned by the publisher of salman rushdies novel the 
satanic verses and bombs were found at three of the publishers 
stores in other towns police say 
the viking penguin bookstore in the center of this northern city 
was closed wednesday night when the blast occurred causing minor 
damage and no injuries police said 
in holland four teenage students were arrested for threatening 
to bomb stores belonging to a retail chain if it did not stop 
stocking the controversial novel which many moslems consider 
blasphemous 
york city police inspector ron johnson said the bomb at the 
penguin bookstore was spotted by a member of the public and the area 
was evacuated he said it exploded before an army bomb squad could 
arrive 
three other bombs found outside penguin bookstores in three other 
cities and towns were defused or otherwise made safe before they 
could explode 
no group claimed responsibility for planting the bombs in york 
in guildford 30 miles southwest of london in nottingham in central 
england and in peterborough 75 miles north of london 
but the british broadcasting corp said in a radio news bulletin 
that it seemed likely the bombs were the latest in a series of 
attacks by moslem extremists angered by rushdies novel 
the bbc reported that the bomb found in nottingham made from a 
length of metal pipe filled with explosives seemed almost identical 
to one that exploded outside a store in central london earlier this 
month 
in amsterdam dutch police today reported the arrest of four 
schoolboys for threatening to attack a prominent department store 
chain unless it removed the satanic verses from its shelves 
the four aged 17 and 18 confessed to mailing an aug 31 letter 
threatening the vroom and dreesman chain the retail branch of the 
dutch trade and retail conglomerate vendex international according 
to amsterdam police spokesman klaas wilting 
in response to the threat vroom and dreesman withdrew dutch and 
english versions of the novel from its 60 department stores around 
the nation 
the four schoolboys called themselves followers of the 
revolutionary justice organization wilting said 
it all began as kind of hoax but they never realized this 
could be the effect he said 
the four who were not identified in line with dutch police 
practice were charged with threatening the use of force he said 
rushdie has been in hiding since feb 14 when ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini irans former spiritual leader called on moslems to kill 
him and moslem clerics placed a multimillion dollar bounty on the 
authors head 
rushdie is an indianborn naturalized british citizen based in 
london

barring a lastminute hitch the united states 
and the soviet union will announce next week a landmark agreement to 
disclose their stockpiles of chemical weapons and permit inspection 
of their production facilities 
the emerging accord extends the principle of verification 
established in a 1987 ussoviet treaty to scrap all nuclear 
missiles with a range of 300 to 3400 miles 
but the united states must first gain the cooperation of west 
germany on whose territory some us chemical weapons are stored 
us officials said wednesday 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze would sign the agreement at their sept 2223 
meeting in jackson hole wyo while making preparations for a 
superpower summit 
president bush will see shevardnadze in washington on sept 21 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the president would want to reassure him on support for the 
reforms in the soviet union and make sure theres no 
misunderstanding about our intention to move as fast as we can on 
arms control fitzwater said 
he said it was uncertain whether the bakershevardnadze meeting 
would produce a date for a summit between bush and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
us officials who disclosed the latest arms control moves said 
final details first must be ironed out by us and soviet experts 
they will meet here next monday and tuesday and try to determine 
exactly how much information is to be exchanged under the agreement 
we are close one official said 
the other key provision calls for shortnotice inspection of each 
others stockpiles and plants it is designed as a model for an 
international treaty now under negotiation by 40 nations in geneva 
the major sticking point in completing that accord is that the 
united states believes the soviet union has more chemical weapons 
than it is willing to acknowledge 
we dont believe the soviets but we dont know how to find out 
how many more they have an official said its very difficult 
but he said the ussoviet memorandum is designed to serve as a 
confidencebuilding measure that could improve prospects for a 
40nation treaty 
the two superpowers the only countries to admit possessing 
chemical weapons began their negotiations four years ago and have 
had 12 rounds of talks in geneva 
besides the imminent accord they recently agreed on two 
provisions that could be part of the 40nation treaty the official 
said 
one sets the procedures for destroying chemical weapons and the 
other for conducting inspections at suspect sites 
the two sides would reduce their arsenals to equal levels over 
eight years with the aim of eliminating the remaining weapons later 
on 
only this week shevardnadze accused the bush administration of 
timidity and failing to take full advantage of arms control 
channels opened by former president ronald reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
administration spokesmen rejected the allegations and cited 
bushs proposal in the spring for wholesale reductions in nato and 
warsaw pact troops and nonnuclear armories in europe 
some 20 nations are believed to either possess chemical weapons 
or the capability to manufacture them the danger they might be used 
is considered by many analysts to at least equal the threat of 
nuclear war 
one of the main worries is that chemical weapons smaller even 
than a pack of cigarettes could be concealed by a terrorist and used 
for political extortion or set off in a violent rampage 
describing verification of chemical weapons as even more 
difficult than keeping track of nuclear arms an official said 
many of these weapons are small and can be produced in a small 
room but the agreement would help us along the path to a treaty 
also on baker and shevardnadzes agenda is preparing for 
president bushs first summit meeting with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
the two superpowers in 1987 signed an unprecedented treaty to 
eliminate all their intermediaterange nuclear missiles it featured 
the firstever program for reciprocal inspection of bases where the 
missiles are deployed as well as manufacturing plants 
it apparently has worked without a hitch and set the two sides on 
a path for cooperating on the chemical weapons treaty

congressional democrats squabbled among 
themselves today over how to finance their proposal for a 22 
billion increase in president bushs antidrug program 
house democrats emerging from a leadership meeting said they 
oppose the plan of sen robert c byrd dwva the senate 
appropriations committee chairman to get the added money through a 
halfpercent acrosstheboard cut in all federal programs 
we will not accept that option offered by senator byrd said 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select commmittee 
on narcotics abuse and control he said the plan would eviscerate 
domestic programs that already have been cut to the bone 
rangel said house democratic leaders would instead seek to find 
savings in other areas likely to be defense programs 
my constituents believe the drug war is more important than 
say the mission to mars or a couple of extra stealth bombers 
added rep ron wyden dore 
on the senate side of the capitol democrats said wednesday they 
would seek to work with republicans toward a compromise antidrug 
program 
the presidents plan is wholly inadequate said majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine adding that the white house is 
failing in its effort to paint the democrats as big taxers and 
spenders for wanting to do more 
the democrats who hold a 5545 majority in the senate united 
wednesday behind byrds proposal to expand bushs 79 billion drug 
program by 22 billion with more money for drug education and 
treatment programs 
mitchell contended the white houses quick threat of a veto for 
the democratic plan and its claim that democrats just want to raise 
taxes show that the administration knows its plan is in trouble 
but william bennett the presidents point man on drugs defended 
the administration plan as our best assessment of what is needed 
the administration after the chestthumping earlier in the week 
on the issue was noticeably more subdued working with senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas to set up talks with the 
democrats 
instead of raising taxes byrds plan would pay for the extra 
spending by cutting other programs acrosstheboard by about 
onehalf of one percent 
if we cant find that cut in everybodys department were 
not serious about fighting the war on drugs said rep john 
breaux dla chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee 
while they hold a majority in the senate democrats would need 
republican votes to push any plan past gop opposition mitchell 
announced wednesday that he and dole would each appoint negotiating 
teams and the democrats would hold back their plan as long as the 
talks were progressing 
despite the veto threat the white house has made overtures to 
the democrats to seek a compromise 
my own view is that the bush plan does not need any changes 
but if there are good suggestions and if we get some agreement 
between the president and congress then obviously that is fine 
said dole 
bush held a ceremony to honor a los angelesbased antidrug 
program called dare drug abuse resistance education and found 
himself being lectured by a 13yearold about his support of the 
death penalty 
to me killing someone that has committed a very serious crime 
is wrong said chantee charles a seventh grader from nearby 
arlington va said at the rose garden event it does not solve 
anything all it does is take someone elses life 
bush complimented chantee and two other students invited to speak 
for doing a good job expressing whats on your heart without 
worrying if people agree with you or not 
bush has advocated the death penalty for drug kingpins and for 
those who kill law enforcement officers 
also on wednesday a former worker in a colombian drug cartel 
warned a senate subcommittee that embattled south american drug 
dealers might lash out with terror attacks in the united states 
some of you may be the victims of attacks and maybe the 
president of the united states would be the victim of drug 
traffickers diego viafara salinas told the permanent subcommittee 
on investigations he testified behind a screen to shield his 
identity while bodyguards scanned the hearing room 
another witness testifying from behind a screen david wheeler 
the washingtonborn son of a us foreign service officer said 
wealthy bolivians have a cocaine cartel that rivals those of 
colombia

sam nujoma leader of the swapo guerrilla 
movement received a heros welcome today as he ended 30 years in 
exile to compete for political power in soontobeindependent 
namibia 
tight security measures were in force because of threats on 
nujomas life and the assassination tuesday of anton lubowski the 
only white with a leadership post in the southwest africa peoples 
organization 
we return in the spirit of peace love and national 
reconciliation nujoma told a news conference at his new home in 
katatura the black township on the outskirts of windhoek 
no words may express my happiness at joining my family friends 
and comrades he said the years spent abroad have at times been 
characterized by loneliness at other times there was great 
happiness when we achieved successes we never lost sight of our 
principal objective freedom and independence for namibia 
the 60yearold nationalist kissed the tarmac at windhoeks 
airport embraced swapo colleagues and his 89yearold mother 
thousands of cheering supporters kept out of the terminal by 
police gathered at the airport gates to greet nujoma who reached 
out of the car wavingand shaking hands most wore the red blue and 
green colors of the independence movement 
black trade unions urged their members to skip work in order to 
join in welcoming nujoma who arrived aboard an ethiopian airlines 
jet after a flight from luanda angola 
trucks and buses loaded with cheering supporters waving banners 
and raising clenched fists followed the car through windhoek to 
katatura people on the street joined in the cheers while others 
jeered and raised their fists in obscene gestures as the motorcade 
passed 
earlier today police announced the arrest of a suspect in the 
assassination of lubowski police inspector kierie du rand said the 
suspect was a 50yearold white man with an irish passport arrested 
in windhoek on wednesday he reportedly came to namibia from cape 
town south africa 
his name was not released and du rand said additional arrests 
were expected the south african press association said police were 
investigating a possible link with the irish republican army but 
did not elaborate 
lubowski 37 was killed by automatic rifle fire outside his 
windhoek home tuesday night a civil rights lawyer he was a member 
of swapos election directorate and helped direct its campaign for 
unsupervised elections scheduled for early november as a prelude 
to independence next year 
swapo said the assassination of lubowski was intended to create 
instability prior to the elections which swapo is widely favored to 
dominate and to frighten whites at a time when racial unity is 
growing 
asked about fears for his own security nujoma said whenever i 
move about i am concerned about my own safety all swapo leaders 
have unarmed bodyguards and say they have received no answer to 
their request to form a registered security company they said they 
have applied for police protection but they want un forces to 
monitor the police guards 
south africa which has ruled namibia 74 years has agreed to 
independence for the territory under un supervision as part of a 
regional peace accord also calling for withdrawal of cuban troops 
from angola 
on wednesday posters appeared in windhoek with a photograph of 
nujoma and a target superimposed on his face 
a local newspaper editor gwen lister said she received two 
phone calls wednesday from men saying they belonged to the white 
wolves and that the white supremacist organization killed lubowski 
men identifying themselves as whites wolves have carried out 
several attacks on blacks and antiapartheid activists in south 
africa police say they have not been able to prove the organization 
exists 
fighting between swapo guerrillas and the south africanled 
security forces ended in april since then there have been only 
isolated violent incidents in this territory whose 13 million 
population is 84 percent black with the rest nearly equal parts 
white and mixedrace people 
lubowski died only hours after namibias nine largest political 
parties including swapo signed a code of conduct for the elections 
that prohibits violence he was widely known abroad and his killing 
was condemned by the united states britain west germany norway 
sweden amd zambia among others 
nujoma is not considered a rigid ideologue although his 
organization is leftistleaning and favors a socialist economy he 
is viewed as a shrewd instinctive politician maintaining the 
presidency of swapo since 1960 despite occasional challenges 
under his leadership the movement was recognized by the united 
nations as the sole and authentic representative of the namibian 
people although the territory had dozens of political parties 
the united nations dropped that designation before its contingent 
came to namibia this year to monitor the independence process

richard c breeden president bushs nominee to 
head the securities and exchange commission said today that 
vigorous securities law enforcement was good for market integrity 
and could help us markets compete globally for foreign investment 
breeden also told the senate banking committee at his 
confirmation hearing that criminal sanctions are a helpful adjunct 
to a civil enforcement program 
breedens testimony followed opening remarks by committee 
chairman sen donald w riegle jr dmich that the next sec chief 
must be the strongest chairman to date in enforcement of 
securities law 
the senator contended that current securities laws have an 
inadequate ability to deter serious and flagrant violators 
when asked by sen christopher dodd dconn how he squared his 
reputation as a freemarket advocate with the need for strong 
enforcement breeden said it was a perfectly legitimate role for 
government to keep the markets clean 
breeden also said that while decadesold securities laws do not 
address the current global competition against domestic markets i 
think that can be attractive to foreign investors if us markets 
are considered free of corruption 
breeden was the white house point man on the savings and loan 
bailout he did not speak with reporters about his views on the 
issues facing the securities industry after his nomination was 
announced aug 14 instead issuing a statement that he would speak 
only to the committee considering his nomination 
reigle has suggested that breeden lacks the background to handle 
issues such as leveraged buyouts insider trading that face the sec 
mr breeden is highly intelligent and did fine work on the sampl 
reform package and in other governmental assignments riegle said 
earlier in a statement after breedens nomination yet he brings a 
limited direct market experience to this critical assignment and 
that is a matter of some concern when the sec faces a time of epic 
challenge 
among the issues before the sec that breeden was expected to 
address were leveraged buyouts insider trading and the programmed 
trading that has led to uncontrolled stock market fluctuations 
breeden was also expected to answer questions about whether the 
sec should have a say in overseas takeover battles such as the 
ongoing fight for the british bat industries plc that involve us 
jobs and shareholders 
the sec is also going through internal upheaval as it faces 
pressing financial market issues 
in addition to ruder two of the other four commissioners have 
indicated they are leaving theres also a vacancy in the post of 
enforcement division head 
a banking attorney before he joined the white house staff 
breeden helped write the bush plan for bailing out the sampl industry 
and then shepherded the bill through congress 
he also worked for thenvice president bush in the reagan 
administration

east germans hoping to emigrate west have 
taken refuge in the west german embassy in warsaw the foreign 
ministry said thursday it said the government hopes to resolve the 
problem in a few days 
the east germans are following the course of thousands of their 
countrymen who crowded the west german embassy in hungary they were 
allowed to go west after the reformist government of hungary opened 
its border 
polish television reported wednesday night that there were about 
50 east germans in the warsaw embassy they reportedly began 
arriving several weeks ago 
ministry spokesman stefan staniszewski confirmed thursday that 
east germans were in the embassy but said he did not know how many 
were there 
one 9yearold boy interviewed on television said there were 
about 60 people housed inside a large room laundry could be seen 
hanging in the embassy yard and the youngster said a hotel was 
providing food for the east germans 
several young men lounged and read in the embassy courtyard one 
raised his fingers in a v for victory sign 
the 9yearold said he traveled to warsaw with his 13yearold 
brother and their parents about 10 days ago from goerlitz an east 
german city near the polish border 
the other refugees mainly come from goerlitz dresden and east 
berlin the boy said before he was called away by his father 
soon we are going to deal with this matter and we will try to 
solve it probably in a few days staniszewski said in a report 
carried by the official pap news agency 
the prosolidarity daily gazeta wyborcza said that because poland 
is a much bigger country and is in a more difficult geopolitical 
situation than hungary it should be cautious 
hungarys attitude may evoke sympathy but as a state we should 
not follow their example or even praise them loudly the 
commentary said 
poland is bordered by communist east germany czechoslovakia and 
the soviet union while hungary shares a border with noncommunist 
austria 
both hungary and poland are at the forefront of reforms in the 
east bloc poland this week approved the east blocs first 
government not led by communists 
falko schreiber press spokesman for the east german embassy in 
warsaw said the embassy had not been authorized to hold talks with 
west german diplomats the west german embassy in warsaw refused 
comment on the situation 
pap reported that talks between top representatives of the polish 
and west german government opened in warsaw on thursday it did not 
say if the refugee situation was raised 
in addition to warsaw and budapest east germans also holed up in 
the west german embassy in prague czechoslovakia hoping to go 
west about 250 agreed to return home after promises they would not 
be punished but 150 reportedly remain in the embassy

a strike by azerbaijani railroad workers to press 
nationalist demands has cut fuel supplies into the neighboring 
soviet republic of armenia and left ambulances trucks and cars 
without gas pravda said today 
because of the halt on the azerbaijan railroad armenia is 
practically in a state of economic blockade armenian deputy 
premier y khodzhamiryan told the communist party daily 
the official said armenia gets 87 percent of its freight 
including fuel supplies from azerbaijan 
since february the two southern republics have been locked in a 
bitter dispute about control of the nagornokarabakh region the 
mountainous territory is part of azerbaijan but its predominantly 
armenian population and the armenian republic demand that it be 
transferred to armenian control 
the azerbaijani peoples front political movement called a 
general strike last week demanding azerbaijan reassert control over 
nagornokarabakh moscow moved in to directly administer the enclave 
after ethnic violence flared 
cutting supplies to armenia was not one of the stated aims of the 
general strike which was called off on monday 
pravda did not make it clear whether some azerbaijani rail 
workers who took part in the general strike were still on a walkout 
or whether the current rail paralysis was caused by an earlier 
strike the newspaper said that on sunday 250 trains had been 
abandoned on lines leading to yerevan armenias capital 
the dispute between armenian and azerbaijan has killed about 100 
people in the past 18 months and caused hundreds of thousands of 
people to flee their homes in armenia and azerbaijan 
official soviet newspapers have said the situation remains tense 
pravda said the 19mile road from the armenian city of goris to 
the boundary of nagornokarabakh is so dangerous that it is 
impossible to pass even with a military escort 
the national youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported on 
wednesday that there were few cars on even the main streets of 
yerevan the armenian capital and there were long delays in public 
transportion service 
pravda said gas stations did not have enough fuel to fill the 
tanks of even ambulances 
the lack of fuel and supplies was particularly threatening in 
northern armenia where workers are trying to reconstruct cities 
devastated by the earthquake dec 7 that killed 25000 people 
the coming winter is putting people under the real threat of 
being without shelter pravda said

an unannounced highlevel contact between us 
and nicaraguan officials last weekend is not a prelude to a 
resumption of direct dialogue between the two countries according 
to state department officials 
the weekend meeting in managua the first such contact between 
the two countries in almost five years involved president daniel 
ortega and a us delegation consisting of members of congress and 
assistant secretary of state janet mullins the american delegation 
stopped in managua as part of a tour of central america 
officials of the nicaraguan contras expressed disappointment over 
the meeting but state department officials said wednesday night 
that no diplomatic signal to the sandinistas was intended 
the officials insisting on anonymity said the administration 
believes the sandinista government should work out its differences 
with the nicaraguan opposition including the contras without 
direct us participation 
in managua today nicaraguan foreign ministry spokesman david 
silva confirmed the weekend but said he had no details 
asked if he could ask for more information from higher officials 
at the foreign ministry silva declined saying it looks like 
they want to conduct this with some caution 
the reagan administration carried on a sixmonth dialogue with 
the sandinista government that ended in january 1985 when us 
officials accused nicaragua of negotiating in bad faith highlevel 
contacts with nicaragua were barred afterward but that policy 
apparently did not carry over into the bush administration 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said wednesday 
there have been no guidelines on official discussions with 
sandinista authorities even so there were no highlevel contacts 
until the sunday meeting in managua 
in addition the state departments top official for latin 
america bernard aronson rebuffed a nicaraguan vice ministers 
efforts several weeks ago to engage in a substantive discussion at a 
social gathering according to us officials 
during the meeting with ortega ms mullins reaffirmed the us 
view that the electoral process now beginning in nicaragua should be 
monitored by observers of many countries including the united 
states ms tutwiler said ms mullins heads the state department 
office of congressional relations 
national elections are scheduled to be held in nicaragua on feb 
25 the bush administration and other governments have been pressing 
the sandinistas to allow opposition forces a fair chance to win the 
balloting 
at the white house today spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration was still examining the possibilities with 
congress of whether to channel money to the campaign of opposition 
presidential candidate violeta chamorro through an independent us 
foundation 
officials have suggested helping mrs chamorro through the 
national endowment for democracy which receives most of its funding 
from congressional grants to support democratic efforts around the 
world 
asked if such intervention which could also include the 
foundations more typical activities such as voter registration 
might be used by ortega as proof of us meddling in internal 
matters fitzwater said thats always a concern 
but he also praised mrs chamorro saying she has been a leader 
in the struggle for democracy for many years i think shes a 
very good candidate for the opposition 
a spokesman for the nicaraguan resistance bosco matamoros said 
the rebel movement was not consulted in advance about the weekend 
meeting in managua 
he also complained that the bush administration has refused to 
have contact with representatives of the contra political 
leadership no replies have been received to contra letters sent to 
aronson and to secretary of state james a baker iii he said 
meanwhile paul reichler a washingtonbased lawyer who 
represents the sandinistas saw the weekend meeting as a positive 
step and expressed hope that it will lead to a normalization of 
relations 
ms tutwiler said the meeting with ortega was not scheduled until 
ms mullins and the congressional delegation arrived in nicaragua 
ms tutwiler was uncertain whether ms mullins had sought prior 
approval from washington before agreeing to take part in the meeting 
in another development wednesday the nicaraguan embassy said it 
had denied the application of the privately funded commission on 
free and fair elections in nicaragua for visas for a delegation to 
monitor preparations for the february national elections 
our elections are not something to be manipulated by 
individuals and groups interested in furthering conflict said 
charge daffairs leonor arguella de huper 
the nicaraguan electoral process was the subject of meetings 
tuesday among baker and senators and house members 
among other subjects baker stressed the importance of us 
financial assistance to ensure nicaraguas democratic process is 
free and fair ms tutwiler said 
congress has the option of suspending the assistance at the end 
of november the central american presidents have called for the 
voluntary demobilization of the contras by dec 5

a commuter railroad has drafted regulations for 
public conduct on trains and in stations including rules banning 
nudity and sexual actvities 
the rules given preliminary approval wednesday by metronorth 
could lead to confrontations with the homeless especially at grand 
central terminal critics argued 
the long island rail road drafted similar regulations tuesday 
the draft outlines penalties for offenders such as summonses or 
ejection and fines of 50 and 30 days in jail 
the proposals prohibit bathing at a drinking fountain washing 
clothing in restrooms or at any other source of water changing 
clothes or remaining undressed in a metronorth station or 
property and lying on floors platforms stairs or landings 
regulations for such activities as specific forms of sexual conduct 
were spelled out 
the proposals came days after metronorth closed the large 
waiting room at grand central long a haven for the homeless the 
coalition for the homeless estimates that 500 to 1000 people stay 
in the terminal or the streets and subway stations around it on a 
given night 
metronorth president peter stangl said the draft was part of a 
continuing effort by the metropolitan transportation authority to 
make all its agencies codify quality of life regulations 
stangl said he did not foresee the regulations creating 
unnecessary confrontations with the homeless 
but there are also people pretending to be homeless who are 
selling crack and committing other crimes in grand central and we 
want them out of there stangl said 
norman siegel executive director of the new york civil liberties 
union said confrontations were inevitable these rules would 
transform a social and economic problem into a criminal problem 
he said 
he said metronorth should continue efforts to help the homeless 
into city shelters and enroll in drug or alcohol treatment programs 
the proposals were unanimously approved with minor discussion at 
a monthly meeting of metronorths board they must be discussed at 
public hearings and require the approval of the full mta board

retail sales rose a moderate 07 percent in 
august because of strong automobile sales the government reported 
thursday but analysts foresee growing sluggishness in the remainder 
of the year 
the commerce department said sales increased to a seasonally 
adjusted 1443 billion in august following a 05 percent gain in 
july sales had remained flat in june after rising 08 percent in 
may 
analysts said the report was consistent with the socalled 
softlanding scenario sought by the federal reserve as it moves 
to keep inflation under control while permitting continued but 
slower economic growth 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
august figure was an indication of continued but slow growth in 
the current economic expansion which is now in its 82nd month so 
its good news 
auto sales which represent about 20 percent of retail sales 
advanced 26 percent last month driven by endofmodelyear sales 
incentives and the threat of steep price increases for 1990 models 
those sales had risen 17 percent in july 
but michael k evans of evans economics inc a washington 
consulting firm said auto sales have peaked they came in low 
in early september october will be way down so total retail 
sales will be down 
i think we will see a decided weakness in auto spending in the 
fourth quarter agreed allen sinai chief economist of the boston 
co 
excluding the automobile category retail sales edged up only 02 
percent in august 
sales of durable goods bigticket items including autos that are 
expected to last more than three years rose 24 percent on top of 
an 08 percent gain in july on the other hand sales of nondurable 
goods fell 04 percent after rising 04 percent a month earlier 
this is just the opposite of the pattern of many previous 
months sinai said 
evans and william k macreynolds director of forecasting for the 
us chamber of commerce attributed the strength in durable goods 
sales to lower interest rates and discount prices 
consumers are willing to spend money but they have to be 
enticed evans said 
in the durable goods category building materials advanced 22 
percent and furniture and other home furnishing sales gained 16 
percent reflecting in part analysts said both increased home 
sales and remodeling 
the only advances in the nondurable goods category were apparel 
sales up 11 percent in part because of backtoschool clothes 
shopping and drug stores up 14 percent 
but general merchandise sales including department stores did 
not benefit as much from the backtoschool spending analysts said 
and fell 09 percent 
other declines in the nondurable categories included food 
stores down 02 percent service stations down 15 percent 
reflecting falling gasoline prices and restaurants and bars down 1 
percent 
for the three months from june through august overall retail 
sales were up 58 percent over the same period in 1988 retail sales 
so far in 1989 were 59 percent above those in the first eight 
months of 1988

a palestinian accused in the bombing of a 
pan am jet asked thursday to be released from prison while greece 
decides on a us extradition request his lawyer said 
mohammed rashid 39 has been held in greece since his may 1988 
arrest on charges of planting a bomb on a pan am jumbo jet in 1982 
a japanese teenager was killed and 15 people were injured in the 
blast over hawaii 
the athens supreme court upheld a us request for his extradition 
in may but the final decision rests with the justice minister 
greeces conservativeleftist government said in july that 
rashids extradition will not be decided until new elections are 
held by nov 5 
american officials say rashids case is a test of greeces 
willingness to fight terrorism 
the palestinian asked prosecutor dimitris evthimiadis to take up 
his petition if the prosecutor decides it has merit rashid can 
seek a hearing before the appeals court council which rules on 
requests for temporary releases 
evthimiadis is expected to make a decision in the next few days 
the lack of any final decision being taken by the justice 
minister for such a long time period clearly violates basic tenets 
which call for the swift processing of extradition cases and it 
stretches out my detention indefinitely thus violating basic human 
rights lawyer spyros fytrakis quoted rashids petition as saying 
rashid first was held for entering greece on a false passport 
his detention was extended after homemade knives were found in his 
cell

explorers who found the wreck of a 
19thcentury steamboat off south carolina two years ago have begun 
hauling up a trove of gold coins and bars that could be worth up to 
1 billion a spokeswoman said today 
the booty aboard the ss central america includes fortunes made in 
the california gold rush said judy conrad a historian with the 
columbus america discovery group which is excavating the wreck 
i never dreamed it would be like this thomas thompson a 
director of the columbus america discovery group said in an 
interview in todays washington post 
the paddlewheel steamer carrying passengers to new york from san 
francisco went down sept 12 1857 in a hurricane of the 
approximately 575 people aboard only about 150 survived 
the wreck is 200 miles east of charleston just inside us 
waters the ocean is about 8000 feet deep there 
the ship was carrying a regular monthly shipment of gold from the 
san francisco mint to new york banks the gold was valued at the 
time at 12 million based on the price of gold of about 90 cents 
an ounce in 1857 
the value of the government shipment has been estimated at 
todays bullion prices about 360 a troy ounce at up to 450 
million 
in addition the haul appears to include riches belonging to 
passengers returning east after making their fortunes in california 
said barry schatz another columbus america director 
the ship was located two years ago and its bell recovered last 
summer said pamela adkins a spokeswoman for the group the first 
artifacts including gold bars and rare 19th century coins were 
recovered last month she said 
the expedition has been at sea since july and will remain off the 
coast as long as the weather holds ms adkins told the associated 
press in a telephone interview from washington the explorers will 
return to the site next summer 
among the treasures found were thousands of gold double eagle 
coins which an auction consultant valued at about 8000 each 
thompson said 
at such values it isnt out of the realm of possibility that 
the overall value of the ss central americas cargo could swell to 
1 billion thompson said 
thompson 37 a specialist in underwater mining and robotics 
could receive 40 percent of income from the cargo the columbus 
ohio dispatch reported today 
the treasure hunters are using a computerbased imaging system 
that allows searchers to see objects far below the surface he said 
the columbus america discovery group reported finding the 
wreckage of the central america in july 1987 a week after a federal

jim bakkers former chief aide today said 
he objected to bakkers use of the word investment in a brochure 
offering free hotel rooms to 1000 contributors but the tv 
evangelist got his way 
the rev richard dortch who pleaded guilty to fraud and drew 
eight years in prison and 200000 in fines for his role in the ptl 
scandal said bakker insisted on keeping the word to entice 
contributions 
bakker considered the fundraising idea an inspiration from 
god dortch said 
bakker is accused of overbooking his ministrys hotels and 
diverting for his own use nearly 4 million raised from ptl 
lifetime partners 1000 contributors who were promised three 
nights lodging a year for life at ptls heritage usa theme park 
near fort mill sc 
a parade of witnesses have said they paid the 1000 only to be 
told there was no room at the inn 
if found guilty of all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy bakker 
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than 5 
million 
dortch today testified that bakker was told at least daily about 
the ministrys contributions and got updates even when he was on 
television raising money dortch said bakker kept a notebook with 
daily listings of contributions and the number of lifetime 
partnerships sold 
dortch said that he first heard of the partnerships about three 
weeks after joining ptl in 1983 and that he was concerned with 
brochures that called the partnerships an investment 
i had concern about the word because i had some experience in 
the use of that term and i objected to the use of it in the 
brochure dortch said 
dortch testified a week after being released from a florida 
hospital where he had been held for several days for treatment of 
an undisclosed ailment 
earlier today the rev don george a former ptl board member 
said bakker kept the board in the dark about the ministrys 
financial straits and his sixfigure bonuses and gave a rosy report 
months before his 1987 downfall in a sex and money scandal 
i was concerned about the endless fundraising projects said 
george who resigned over the ministrys fundraising practices 
there never seemed to be a balance period in the ministry when 
large amounts of money were not being raised on tv 
george of irvine texas joined the board in 1985 and quit in 
february 1987 the month before bakker resigned he said bakker gave 
the board a financial overview at a meeting in january 1987 
he gave a positive report it was upbeat and encouraging 
george said 
on wednesday jurors were told that bakker and his wife tammy 
were given more than 3 million in bonuses as the ministry narrowly 
avoided financial collapse in the mid1980s 
former ptl finance director peter bailey read from more than 70 
memos he had sent the evangelist between 1983 and 1987 detailing the 
tv ministrys chronic cash problems 
we are continuing to operate far in excess of what is coming 
in bailey read from a memo dated april 16 1986 two weeks after 
bakker got a 200000 bonus the contributions are flat we can 
have all the financial controls in the world but if we dont live 
within our means it doesnt mean anything 
in testimony today george said the largest bonus he ever voted 
for bakker was 150000 despite minutes from a november 1986 
meeting at which bakker was given a 500000 bonus the amount of 
the bonus as well as 150000 for bakkers wife are in a memo 
added to the board minutes 
did you ever vote for a 500000 bonus for the rev bakker 
prosecutor deborah smith asked 
no george responded

people around here still talk about the 
day jeff gaertig socked it to the hemingford school board 
gaertig the student council president at hemingford public 
school went before the board recently to ask members to drop a 
dress code requirement that the schools 176 students wear socks 
gaertig said shoe designs and fashions have changed in the 20 
years or so since the board developed the dress code 
there are the boat shoes and tennis shoes with better 
ventilation he said i didnt think it would be a distraction 
to learning whether students wore socks or not 
his presentation impressed school board members they agreed 
unanimously monday to give the boot to the sock rule at the western 
nebraska school which ranges from kindergarten to 12th grade 
it was nice that he had the determination to come before the 
school board said board secretary ken sestak a lot of times 
students get a little intimidated by authority 
sestak said the policy had become difficult to enforce 
it got to be where the principal would have to pull up pant 
legs to tell or some students were wearing halfsocks sestak 
said it wasnt a problem with learning

the government would come out ahead if it 
repealed or relaxed a law that reduces the social security benefits 
of senior citizens who earn more than a limited amount of outside 
income a group of house republicans said thursday 
gop critics of social securitys earnings test released a private 
study concluding that at least 700000 retirees would rejoin the 
labor market if the law were scrapped the new workers would 
generate more in income and payroll taxes than the government would 
pay out in increased social security benefits 
the retirement earnings limit is a cruel penalty imposed on 
elderly workers said aldona robbins a former treasury department 
economist who coauthored the study it punishes the elderly but 
doesnt save the government any money 
the study was sponsored by two conservativeoriented research 
groups in dallas the institute for policy innovation and the 
national center for policy analysis and released by a task force of 
the house republican research committee 
rep dennis hastert chairman of the committees task force on 
the social security earnings test said the study bolsters the case 
for legislation to d repeal the limits and deflects arguments the 
change would be too costly 
thats the importance of this study that we can start to tell 
the white house listen there isnt a revenue cost here said 
hastert whose bill to eliminate the earnings test for those aged 65 
and above has more than 130 cosponsors eliminating the earnings 
limit is sound policy its basically a winwin situation 
under current law workers aged 65 to 69 lose 1 in social 
security benefits for every 2 they earn above 8880 the limit is 
6480 for workers under age 65 there is no limit for those 70 or 
older 
starting in 1990 benefits for those age 6569 will be reduced by 
1 for every 3 earned above the limit which rises with growth in 
average wages 
almost 1 million social security beneficiaries lose some or all 
of their benefits each year and an additional 100000 people in the 
6569 age group do not file for social security benefits because of 
the limit according to the social security administration 
the researchers said their best estimate was that if the earnings 
limit were scrapped for those aged 65 and above there would be a 
net revenue gain of 140 million for the government while expanding 
the earnings limit just to the optimal level of 39360 would cut 
the deficit by 32 billion a year 
workers earning more than that amount most likely havent dropped 
out of the work force so that exempting them from the earnings test 
would not bring in new tax revenue but would still cost more in 
social security benefits 
short of abolishing the earnings test virtually any increase 
in the earnings limit would lead to an increase in federal revenue 
that would more than offset the increase in social security benefit 
payments the researchers reported 
rep dick armey a texas republican who also is chairman of the 
institute for policy innovation said the earnings limit drives 
older americans from the workforce prematurely at a time when their 
skills and experience are needed to help us employers compete 
internationally 
because the penalties for working are so high many elderly 
workers are simply dropping out of the system and becoming more 
dependent on government instead armey said that hurts all of 
us 
a variety of proposals are pending in congress to relax or repeal 
the earnings limits including a plan approved by the house ways and 
means committee to raise the earnings limit for those aged 6569 to 
approximately 10440 by 1991 the senate also has gone on record in 
favor of a higher earnings limit 
the ways and means proposal would increase federal revenue by 
700 million according to the study 
the earnings limit was imposed as part of the original social 
security act in 1935 which barred benefits to anyone still earning 
wages before the first pension check was paid that was modified to 
bar benefits in any month in which a person earned 15 or more in 
wages 
the limit has been amended several times in recent years as more 
people work past a retirement age of 65

hospitalized with a heart attack

involved there mayor jerry abramson said after touring the 
threestory building next to the courierjournal newspaper offices 
police searched every floor for victims because of the 
standardgravure co buildings many nooks and crannies chief

shuddering in fear abramson said he hadnt been shot but he 
was in shock 
wesbecker entered the building at 830 am with a duffel bag an 
ak47 rifle and a 9mm semiautomatic pistol and randomly fired at 
people with the rifle which had ammunition clips of about 25 
rounds dotson said the man had six to eight clips but it was 
unclear how many shots were fired 
it started on the first floor dotson said by the time our 
officers arrived he had gone up to the third floor and he 
eventually ended up in a pressroom in an annex area which is where 
he killed himself 
wesbecker was approached by fellow employee john tingle during 
the rampage i said rocky what are you doing here tingle 
said he said i told them id be back get out of my way john 
i told them id be back 
this guys been talking about this for a year said joe 
white whom a tv station identified as a standardgravure employee 
hes been talking about guns and soldier of fortune magazine hes 
paranoid and he thought everyone was after him

standardgravure which prints newspaper inserts and sunday 
newspaper supplements he was on permanent disability although the 
nature of his disability was not immediately known 
the police chief said an officer who knew wesbecker told him the 
man had been argumentative and confrontational for a number of 
years 
after the shootings the gunman lay facedown in a pool of blood 
on the floor of a pressroom the pistol was discovered under his 
body and the ak47 was a few feet away the gunman apparently shot 
himself with his pistol dotson said 
the newspaper building was evacuated following the shooting at 
about 830 am at least two blocks were sealed off and about a 
dozen ambulances lined the streets

other weapons killing five children and wounding 29 others and one

house lawmakers warmly greeted a new federal 
communications commission on thursday saying they hoped for a new 
era of cooperation with the agency 
during the reagan administration the fccs style most often 
reflected that of the hard rock group the clash said rep edward 
j markey chairman of the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
it is my hope that the workings and relationships of the new 
commission will more closely resemble the modern jazz quartet 
bringing with it an appreciation of tradition accompanied by both 
creativity and innovation 
at a hearing on a bill to authorize 1098 million in spending 
for the fcc in fiscal 1990 and 1215 million in fiscal 1991 
democrats and republicans alike expressed pleasure at seeing former 
missouri broadcaster alfred sikes as chairman of the agency 
sikes who has been on the job five weeks was accompanied by 
three commissioners 
energy and commerce committee chairman rep john dingell 
dmich said sikes predecessors somehow didnt have a full 
awareness of this committee and of congress 
he urged sikes along with incumbent commissioner james quello 
and newcomers sherrie marshall and andrew barrett not to conduct 
fcc business based on ideology or administration policy 
under the leadership of mark fowler and dennis patrick the fcc 
significantly loosened its regulation of the broadcasting and 
telephone industries 
it repealed the fairness doctrine for broadcasters ended a 
20yearold regulatory scheme for american telephone amp telegraph co 
and made other changes in broadcast licensing and ownership rules 
sikes and the commissioners fielded a long list of 
nottoodifficult questions at the hearing generally repeating 
earlier statements that indicate theyll take a more moderate 
freemarket regulatory stance than did patrick or fowler 
the public needs a firm basis to believe that its fundamental 
interests are being adequately safeguarded sikes said 
those striving for commercial success in the marketplace 
moreover need adequate assurance that their success or failure will 
depend chiefly on their own talents and endeavor and not be 
affected significantly by the actions of unconstrained monoploy 
power 
sikes commission still one member short will face a number of 
thorny issues including moves in congress to deregulate the local 
bell telephone companies how best to ensure that a us 
highdefinition television industry emerges and how to reallocate 
scarce space on the airwaves 
there was no opposition expressed during the hearing to the fccs 
spending request which is about 10 million more than this years 
appropriation the senate is considering the same level of spending

the american civil liberties union has sued the 
chicago transit authority alleging it arbitrarily rejected an aids 
prevention ad as too explicit 
the federal classaction lawsuit was filed wednesday on behalf of 
all groups wanting to put ads on public trains and buses it charges 
the agency with violating the constitutional rights of the kupona 
network the only black community organization in chicago devoted 
entirely to educating blacks about aids said john hammell aclu 
illinois director of the aids and civil liberties project 
apparently one person or two persons at the cta decided the 
graphics were inappropriate hammell said they have policies 
which are applied arbitrarily capriciously and in an invidious 
discriminatory manner 
the ad features a drawing of two eyes one reflecting the image 
of a naked man and woman holding a condom package the other an 
image of a youth using drugs with a hypodermic syringe drawn 
diagonally across the scene 
the caption says sex without condoms plus drug abuse aids 
aids in the black community is very real 
cta spokeswoman rosemarie gulley said the ad was turned back 
because the graphic art was far too explicit she declined to 
comment on the lawsuit

the bush administration has banned import of 
ak47 assaultstyle rifles such as the one used in a shooting 
rampage thursday in louisville ky but similar weapons are still 
available from us companies 
the administration imposed a temporary import suspension in march 
after a public outcry over the jan 17 stockton calif schoolyard 
killing of five children by a man wielding an ak47 
however the ban made permanent in july doesnt affect guns 
already owned by americans or similar weapons produced by us 
companies 
joseph t wesbecker who opened fire at louisvilles 
standardgravure co printing plant appeared to be using 
halfbanana clips of about 25 rounds each in an ak47 said 
louisville police chief richard dotson 
such clips are curved and stick out the bottom of the weapon 
wesbecker who committed suicide after the rampage also had a 
9mm semiautomatic pistol dotson said 
president bush announced a crime package in may that would limit 
the size of ammunition clips to 15 rounds but the senate judiciary 
committee hasnt voted on it 
the committee has approved a measure by sen dennis deconcini 
dariz that would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic 
assaultstyle weapons five already covered by the administrations 
import ban and four others produced domestically 
deconcinis bill which would provide up to 10 years additional 
prison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms would 
go off the books in three years under a sunset provision 
the senate leadership hasnt brought the bill to the floor for a 
vote 
on monday american bar association president l stanley chauvin 
jr urged bush to end the export of usmade assaultstyle weapons 
to colombia where 50 percent of sophisticated military equipment 
seized from colombian drug lords in the last 18 months was made in 
the united states 
the ban on imports of 43 styles of guns including the popular 
chinesemade ak47 and israelimade uzi carbine followed a 
fourmonth study by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms on 
whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the gun control act 
of 1968 which barred importation of weapons not used for legitimate 
sporting purposes 
the study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in 
the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of 
their use in violent crime atf director stephen e higgins said 
the 43 models banned were not being used for sporting uses 
the agency said 
higgins said the atf annually traces 35000 to 40000 guns used 
in crimes and that about 10 percent are semiautomatic assault 
weapons he estimated that slightly more than half of those assault 
weapons are domestic makes not subject to atf control

a judge has agreed to decide whether the 
hourly tolling of the bell in the town clock in this little farming 
community is a melodious new england tradition or a noisy nuisance 
richard and pamela carnall who moved next door to the 
centuryold clock last year sued the town claiming the bell keeps 
them awake at night 
they failed in an effort to get selectmen to silence the clock 
from 9 pm to 7 am and the couple lost their bid for a 
preliminary injunction silencing the clock in april but judge 
george c keady jr said he will hear arguments on the nuisance 
issue oct 5 in hampshire superior court 
both sides have already made their case loud and clear in court 
and on main street in this 319yearold community of 3200 people 
the carnalls contend they have been unable to adjust to the 
bonging of the 1800pound bell on the first congregational church 
50 feet from their home 
carnall maintained he puts off going to bed until after midnight 
when the bell tolls 12 times and said in a deposition that the 
lack of sleep has made him more impatient more argumentative and 
less tolerant of others 
dr donald b rogers of northampton said he has prescribed 
sleeping pills for mrs carnall and maintained in a letter to the 
judge that the bell is affecting her work and wellbeing 
but hatfield town counsel william oneil contended that the sound 
of the bell is simply part of life in a new england village and the 
carnalls both born and raised in the area should have noticed the 
bell tower and considered that before buying their house 
when the carnalls bought their house in august 1988 the bell and 
clock werent working and they maintain they were unaware the bell 
would resume tolling five months later 
selectmen contend the only previous complaints they have received 
is when the bell hasnt sounded and more than 200 townsfolk signed 
petitions in support of the clock 
selectman george b zagrodnik who grew up with the tolling and 
still lives in the family home across the street from the church 
said some of his constituents have tartly pointed out that if the 
town was to bow to the carnalls they just might decide that its 
a nuisance to have the town landfill by their place

former hud secretary samuel pierce should stop 
defending his tenure and admit he made mistakes the chairman of a 
house panel investigating the agency said thursday 
if he continues to claim he has done nothing wrong and that 
everything at hud was right for the last 10 years he will be very 
lonely said rep thomas lantos dcalif 
lantos comments came on the eve of pierces return to testify 
before a subcommittee investigating allegations of mismanagment and 
influencepeddling at the department of housing and urban 
development during his stewardship 
i would hate to see an individual with a distinguished public 
career prior to his service at hud to sort of fade into american 
memory in such an unfavorable light as he has done thus far 
lantos said 
but he will have to do this for himself he has not yet 
said mea culpa mea maxima culpa i have made horrible mistakes 
lantos and other panel members stopped short of accusing pierce 
of perjury during a may appearance before congress but said the 
former secretary faced a formidable task in explaining his 
involvement in a number of hud decisions 
obviously we have sworn testimony that contradicts secretary 
pierces sworn testimony lantos said 
rep donald e buz lukens of ohio the panels ranking 
republican said the committee wanted to hear pierce address the 
apparent inconsistencies 
lukens said he was not prepared to judge whether pierce had 
perjured himself 
it appears to me that while there has been greed and a great 
deal of unfair and unethical favoritism that the only law that may 
have been broken may be in the area of conflicting testimony 
lukens said 
pierce spent the day huddled with his lawyer paul perito 
preparing for the hearing the first by the subcommittee since 
congress returned from a summer recess 
perito did not immediately return a telephone call seeking 
comment 
fridays hearing was to focus on pierces may testimony and his 
decisions to fund a north carolina project supported by a former law 
partner and to lift restrictions on a mortgage company after he was 
lobbied by former hud secretary carla hills now the bush 
administrations trade representative 
pierce had said he was not a handson manager and took no 
direct role in hud funding decisions 
a former deputy however later told congress that pierce 
personally ordered her to fund a 15 million durham nc housing 
project that was opposed by several career hud officials 
pierce in a time magazine interview published this week 
acknowledged overruling staff and ordering the project funded it 
was supported by then durham mayor charles markham who practiced 
law with pierce in the 1960s 
pierce likely will be questioned about his decision to lift 
restrictions on washingtonbased drg funding corp whose hud loan 
portfolio includes more than 538 million in defaults 
mrs hills met with pierce after her lobbying of other hud 
officials failed and he agreed to lift restrictions that required 
drg to get hud approval before making any loans 
sam pierce overruled the career people and now you and i and 
the rest of american taxpayers are looking at a 538 million 
portfolio which is in default lantos said

the bush administration yielding to 
congressional pressures was set today to announce a 50 million 
increase in us food aid to poland administration and 
congressional sources said 
the aid to be made available during the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 is to include shipments of beef pork corn butter butter 
oil cotton and rice according to the sources who declined to be 
identified 
the aid is in addition to the 119 million aid package president 
bush announced earlier this summer nearly half of which was 
earmarked for food assistance 
the new infusion of aid will bring the total food aid component 
of the package to 100 million 
poland is obliged to repay the 50 million in this years aid in 
local currency but the 100 million for fiscal 1990 which begins 
oct 1 will be mostly in the form of grants or gifts said a us 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said the increase had been in the works for some time but 
that the announcement was sped up in light of congressional calls 
for giving poland more help 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas broached the subject 
of additional food aid to poland following talks with leaders of 
polands new government in warsaw last month 
dole met with bush at the presidents kennebunkport maine home 
to urge additional assistance as a signal of support to the new 
governement and continued to press the administration on it as 
recently as today 
several other house and senate members also have called on the 
administration to increase aid to poland or have introduced 
legislation outlining their own assistance plans 
as the white house prepared the announcement state department 
officials extended assurances to poland and its congressional 
supporters 
the polish government can count on our continued support 
said department spokesman richard boucher he said the emergence of 
the solidarity labor movement as in control of the government was a 
key factor in a situation that he described as evolving 
we felt that additional measures might be appropriate and we 
are seriously considering some boucher said 
some members of congress are pushing the white house to increase 
us assistance in order to help the warsaw government cope with its 
adjustment to a new economic system that has some elements of 
capitalism 
the president and his advisers are eager for the economic and 
political changes in poland and bush traveled to warsaw and gdansk 
this summer to symbolize us support but the predominant view 
within the administration is that poland should demonstrate its 
ability to make the transition and to hold down inflaion before more 
us aid is committed 
lech walesa the solidarity leader whose noncommunist trade 
union movement commands a dominant role in the warsaw government is 
due to visit washington in november 
walesa has called for 10 billion in emergency assistance 
including 27 billion from the international monetary fund 3 
billion from the world bank and 41 billion in new bilateral 
credits

in mississippi a rape victim reporting the 
crime to the sheriffs office could end up talking to a dispatcher 
doing time for rape himself 
and because state law doesnt spell out what jobs felons are 
allowed to do in jail someone arrested on a drug charge could 
discover the man with custody of the keys on that shift is serving a 
sentence for peddling dope 
although it is uncertain how many convicted felons actually 
perform important duties such as dispatcher or jailer 
unsupervised rep jb van slyke says he plans to introduce a bill 
next legislative session to make the practice illegal 
i do not favor an inmate taking care of the jail or being a 
dispatcher not at all van slyke said 
lafayette county sheriff fd east president of the mississippi 
sheriffs association said he informally polled about 20 sheriffs on 
their policies on assigning felons after the issue was raised he 
said there were some counties that use felons for responsible jobs 
but he declined to identify them 
most counties regularly use inmates for traditional work such as 
cleaning up and cooking he said 
in the 1970s a federal court ordered major reforms of the state 
prison system including a ban on convicted murderers serving as 
armed guards but the law does not ban state prisoners who are 
serving their time in county jails from serving as unarmed jailers 
officials said 
ken jones a spokesman for the state corrections department said 
more than 1200 of mississippis roughly 8000 state prisoners are 
being held in county jails because of overcrowding at state 
facilities 
we know of no ruling or any law that prohibits the use of 
inmates for instance as jailers jones said it really falls 
back to the sheriff to use his good judgment in the assignment of 
inmates to work details 
the issue came to van slykes attention after wiggins mayor 
ferris oneal recently accused stone county sheriff eldon ladner of 
using inmates as jailers and dispatchers sometimes unsupervised 
i feel it is a threat and danger to the citizens of wiggins and 
stone county oneal said i am 100 percent in favor of inmates 
working but there are a lot of other things they can do than man 
the communication system unsupervised 
ladner has declined to comment on oneals accusations but van 
slyke said ladner told him he used inmates as dispatchers but not 
as jailers 
the legislator said he wasnt aware of any problems in the past 
caused by inmates holding such positions of responsibility but hes 
concerned about the potential for tragedy 
lauderdale county chief deputy mike vick said his county is among 
several which have used inmates to assist jailers and dispatchers 
when the regular staff was stretched tight prisoners never have 
served on a daily basis in such responsible roles and do not work 
unsupervised he said 
they have been used in the past to assist dispatchers if there 
was a major situation going on like a gasoline spill or train 
derailment vick said 
basically if youve got inmate labor theres always a 
potential for problems vick acknowledged but being a trusty is 
a privilege not a right so if you have problems with an inmate 
you lock him up 
east said if any sheriffs use convicted felons in positions of 
responsibility it is only because tight finances have forced them 
into a corner 
if they pass any law they should pass a law saying you have to 
have enough deputies and people to run the jails east said the 
bottom line is we dont want state inmates anyway 
no money is why we have state prisoners in county jails 
anyway he added

thirtyfour white men turned down for firefighting 
jobs though they had perfect scores on a civil service exam sued 
thursday to force the department to adopt a colorblind hiring 
policy 
spurred by a recent us supreme court decision paving the way 
for such lawsuits the plaintiffs said they were seeking a court 
ruling allowing them to be hired 
were not trying to deprive anybody said plaintiff larry 
mackin we just want the best man to win 
its not as if were asking for positions of power or money we 
just want to do a very dangerous job that weve always wanted to 
do he said 
boston has long been under a federal consent decree requiring it 
to hire one minority for every white to ensure the police and fire 
departments reflect the citys ethnic makeup 
the hiring policy is important to quality of life in the 
city city councilor bruce bolling argued the citys fire and 
police departments are about 20 percent minority and 80 percent 
white according to bolling who is black and has been a longtime 
proponent of affirmative action programs 
the consent decree addresses the issue of ensuring that there 
would be a more equitable process in which minorities have access to 
these critical jobs he said 
but mackin said the policy has foiled his efforts to become a 
firefighter for 12 years he said he always scored well on the civil 
service exam but not well enough for a white candidate 
in 1987 he scored perfectly on the exam the last the 
32yearold could take because of an age limit and thought for 
certain hed realized his dream 
again he was passed over because he says of the citys efforts 
to hire minorities 
michael powers an attorney for the plaintiffs said he would not 
have been able to bring the suit were it not for the supreme court 
rulng in june allowing white men to challenge courtapproved 
affirmative action programs 
the ruling widely criticized by civil rights groups revived a 
challenge to a program to promote more blacks in the birmingham 
ala fire department 
to mackin and the other plaintiffs the boston policy 
discriminated against them by allowing minorities with lower scores 
to join the ranks while theyve been left behind 
theyve not only leaned over backwards but theyve twisted and 
perverted the whole system so a white kid doesnt stand a chance 
mackin said 
the lawsuit charges the city the department mayor raymond 
flynn fire commissioner leo stapleton and david haley the state 
personnel administrator with violating the white applicants civil 
rights and seeks to halt the hiring policy 
powers a former legal adviser to the boston police department 
said he is confident hell be able to get the men positions with the 
fire department and also plans to file a similar lawsuit against the 
police 
attorneys for the city said they could not immediately comment on 
the suit 
mackin said that if he isnt hired he hopes to at least to force 
the department to adopt a colorblind hiring policy 
if my son chooses to become a firefighter or a police officer 
and he can take the exam and be judged on his merits and be judged 
on his competence then thatll be enough he said

a bush administration official and the american 
civil liberties union took a nearly identical stance thursday 
against proposed legislation to establish federal boot camp 
prisons for young offenders 
j michael quinlan director of the bureau of prisons told a 
house justice subcommittee that the administration supports the 
concept on the state level but contends it wouldnt work on a 
federal level 
the success of these programs is yet undetermined he said 
referring to the nine states with special programs for nonviolent 
youthful first offenders in which rigorous military discipline and 
physical training play a role 
claudia wright associate director of the aclu national prison 
project agreed 
a good deal more thought and research should be done before 
deciding that the boot camp concept will be a viable alternative 
form of incarceration for the federal prison system she told the 
panel 
president bush was often at odds with the aclu during his 1988 
campaign accusing the group of being out of the mainstream of 
american values 
subcommittee chairman charles schumer dny who introduced the 
bootcamp legislation said the camps could be a powerful new 
weapon in the war on drugs 
the bill calls for any ablebodied firsttime offender with a 
prison term of 12 months to 16 months to be eligible with each day 
in camp counting as four days in prison the program would be open 
to all prisoners not just drug offenders 
quinlan said only 60 of 50000 federal prisoners would meet the 
criteria however quinlan said that could change as a result of the 
administrations desire to arrest more drug users and that the 
bureau might then reconsider its opposition 
he also indicated support for sending federal prisoners to state 
boot camps under contract 
ms wright called it grossly inappropriate to compare the 
effects of prison boot camps with those of military basic training 
to serve in the military provides young people with a sense of 
pride and achievement which remains with them throughout their 
lives she said that sense of pride comes not from having 
survived a demeaning experience but from the patriotism esprit de 
corps and sense of purpose that is instilled by serving ones 
country as part of a proud tradition 
commissioner thomas coughlin of the new york department of 
correctional services said his states 2yearold program includes 
drug treatment and education not just military routine

east germans made a lastminute dash for 
the border thursday with more than 100 per hour reported crossing 
into austria in fear the iron curtains hole to the west might close 
again soon 
hungarian authorities said they had no plans to stop the exodus 
which has prompted east germans in poland and czechoslovakia to seek 
refuge in west german embassies in hopes they too will get to go 
west 
polands foreign ministry confirmed that some east germans were 
at the west german embassy in warsaw about 150 east germans were 
reported in the west german embassy in prague czechoslovakia 
the vatican newspaper praised hungarys move but a 
prosolidarity newspaper in poland cautioned against warsaw 
following hungarys example 
after a brief letup in the refugee flow wednesday austrias 
interior ministry reported thursday that 100 east germans an hour 
were arriving en route to west germany 
west german border officials said more than 700 new refugees 
arrived overnight aid workers in budapest where wouldbe emigrants 
register before going west said at least 13000 people had crossed 
since early monday 
the east germans are automatically granted citizenship in west 
germany and have been put up in camps and given assistance finding 
housing and jobs 
the reformminded communist government in hungary opened its 
border to austria at midnight sunday ending a weekslong standoff 
that began when thousands of east germans flooded the west german 
embassy in budapest seeking legal emigration 
many had come to hungary in may after the country began 
dismantling barbed wire and other barriers along its westernmost 
border and had been caught trying to cross to the west illegally 
they feared they would be punished if they returned to their 
homeland 
west germanys ard television network reported rumors hungary 
would close the border soon but government spokesman zsolt bajnok 
said he knew of no such plans 
bajnok quoted foreign minister gyula horn as saying thursday that 
no decision has been made on stopping the flow of east germans 
east germany accused hungary of breaking an accord prohibiting 
unauthorized departures to the west of residents of the warsaw pact 
countries and it filed a formal protest 
hungarys foreign ministry said the government let the east 
germans go in accordance with a un human rights accord that 
outweighed its agreement with east germany 
the ministry in a statement carried by the official mti news 
agency also said the 1969 east germanhungarian accord contained a 
secret article invalidating the agreement if conditions change 
fundamentally 
the conditions had changed fundamentally it said referring 
to the influx of east germans it indicated the borders would remain 
open to east germans as long as masses of them want to cross 
considering that the causes underlying the decision of the 
hungarian peoples republic have not changed the hungarian party 
cannot consider rescinding the decision at present it said 
mti quoted a senior hungarian communist official maria ormos as 
telling politburo member kurt hager that hungary opened its borders 
because it was unable to cope with the thousands of east german 
citizens 
emotions in east berlin appeared to cool thursday with the 
communist party daily neues deutschland refraining from criticism of 
hungary for the first time since the refugee flood began 
but several east germans in budapest said their countrymen at 
home feared the east german leadership was planning to crack down on 
travel to hungary which has been relatively unrestricted 
i know four people who are weighing whether to apply for 
visas said a woman in her 30s from dresden but theyre scared 
that even applying could get them into trouble 
many of those fleeing have said theyre doing so out of 
frustration with political rigidity and repression others have 
expressed hopes of earning a better living in west germany 
east germans reportedly began arriving at the west german embassy 
in poland several weeks ago 
one 9yearold boy interviewed on polish television said there 
were about 60 people housed inside a large room of the embassy 
laundry could be seen hanging in the embassy yard and several young 
men lounged and read in the embassy courtyard one raised his 
fingers in a v for victory sign 
ministry spokesman stefan staniszewski said thursday officials 
hoped to resolve the problem in a few days 
the prosolidarity daily gazeta wyborcza said that because poland 
is a much bigger country and is in a more difficult geopolitical 
situation than hungary it should be cautious 
hungarys attitude may evoke sympathy but as a state we should 
not follow their example or even praise them loudly the 
commentary said 
poland is bordered by communist east germany czechoslovakia and 
the soviet union while hungary shares a border with neutral austria 
the vatican newspaper losservatore romano said hungary had 
recently introduced political and social reforms that were inspired 
by the demands of the fundamental rights of man and by the 
inalienable dignity of the human person

masoud khalili a spokesman for the jamiatiislami guerrilla 
group said in islamabad pakistan that insurgents sent two 
government resupply convoys limping back to charikar the provincial 
capital of afghanistans central parwan province

the salang highway this area includes one of the governments 
largest military air bases at bagram six miles southeast of 
charikar and about 30 miles north of the afghan capital of kabul 
successive rebel attacks against the kabul airport have increased

the pentagon said thursday that seven us 
military teams are training local forces in the andean nations 
antidrug battle but insisted the americans will not be sent 
where there is great risk 
pentagon spokesman pete williams also announced that defense 
secretary dick cheney plans to outline a forward leaning role 
for the pentagon next week under president bushs plan for fighting 
the nations drug problem 
revealing additional details about the role of us military 
forces in latin america williams said there are three us military 
training teams in peru and two each in colombia and bolivia helping 
training local forces 
those are the counternarcotics training teams under the andean 
strategy williams said 
there are no such teams in any other south american nation he 
said 
williams described the teams as providing specific equipment 
training but they also provide tactical training as well 
a secret national security directive signed by bush last month 
has allowed for an expansion of the training role for the us 
forces allowing them to leave their bases and train local forces in 
socalled secure areas in the region 
williams declined to offer a definitive number of persons in the 
three nations saying the number would vary depending upon the type 
of training mission under way at any given time 
he would say only that currently there are fewer than 50 persons 
involved 
theres no magic number no magic ceiling he said adding 
that each team may number anywhere from two to 12 persons each 
the spokesman emphasized as he has for weeks that the teams 
have been sent to the nations at their request and that the 
decision to deploy is made on a casebycase basis 
no military training teams are going to be sent into an area in 
which they would face great risk that is part of the assessment 
that would be made in these casebycase judgements williams said 
bush and other top administration officials have repeatedly 
denied that the us forces sent to aid the latin nations would 
enter combat 
williams said the pentagon did not want to say where the units 
were coming from or their exact locations in the host countries 
because of security reasons 
the spokesman also said cheney planned to discuss details of the 
pentagons role in the presidents antidrug battle on monday and 
said the secretary has described it as a forward leaning type of 
plan 
pentagon sources who spoke on condition that they not be 
identified said a preliminary draft indicated that the secretary 
wants to beef up radar and commications efforts along us borders 
to monitor drug traffickers and increase the number of naval and air 
patrols in the caribbean 
theres a lot of holes out there that need to be patched the 
official said speaking on condition he not be identified

the bush administration on thursday opposed a 
house bill that would exempt farmers from paying royalties on 
patented animals created by genetic engineering 
one official said his department would license others to use an 
enginereed chicken even though it wasnt patented 
a bill sponsored by rep robert kastenmeier dwis is intended 
to respond to concerns among farmers that corporate control of 
patents will lead to corporate control of agriculture creating a 
modern version of sharecropping 
a similar bill by kastenmeier passed the house last year but the 
senate took no action 
representatives of the agriculture commerce and health and human 
services departments told kastenmeiers house judiciary subcommittee 
on courts intellectual property and the administration of justice 
that patents on socalled transgenic animals are the only way to 
guarantee that anyone will invest in research on the technique 
the genetically engineered animals are necessary for biomedical 
research development of resistant crops and farm animals and 
ultimately for international competition the three said 
the exemption in kastenmeiers bill would allow farmers to 
reproduce a patented animal through breeding or sell a patented 
animal or its offspring without paying a fee or royalty to the 
patent holder in effect an automatic license for farmers 
the sale of germ cells semen or embryos from a patented animal 
would remain prohibited as patent infringements 
daniel jones deputy director for biotechnology at the 
agriculture department said the department has applied for a 
statutory invention registration with the patent office for a 
strain of transgenic chickens it developed resistant to the poultry 
disease avian leukosis 
such registration preempts others from obtaining patents but does 
allow others to use the invention 
this arrangement may provide a useful opportunity to gather 
data on the potential economic demand distribution and performance 
of a transgenic animal before livestock and poultry producers are 
faced with an onslaught of new strains and varieties whose economic 
impacts cannot now be predicted he said 
donald j quigg assistant commerce secretary and commissioner of 
patents and trademarks told the subcommittee neither the 
imposition of compulsory licensing nor a moratorium on the patenting 
of inventions pertaining to the field of transgenic animals is in 
the national interest 
compulsory licensing is an idea advanced by a number of third 
world countries who say they can use an invention a drug for 
instance for which a patent exists but the holder does not wish to 
produce 
those licenses however would involve some royalty payment 
the worlds first animal patent was issued in april 1988 to 
researchers at harvard medical school for a mouse genetically 
engineered for use in cancer research

the march in cape town it was the largest legal protest march in 
south africas history 
moolman mentz spokesman for the conservative party the largest 
parliamentary opposition said approval of the cape town march was 
a knife thrust in the back of the security forces mentz called 
for immediate parliamentary debate 
in a rare move the antiapartheid democratic party voted with 
the nationalists to defeat the conservatives motion 
in carrying out his stated policy to allow peaceful protest de 
klerk faces opposition not only from rightwing parties but from the 
security establishment that enjoyed wide powers under former 
president pw botha 
as de klerk addressed the electoral college antiapartheid 
organizations announced that more demonstrations and marches were 
planned in pretoria and johannesburg on friday

11 years in power de klerk is to be inaugurated wednesday in a 
pretoria church 
de klerk whose party was elected by white voters declared 
himself the leader of all south africans not only those 
represented in parliament 
our goal is that all south africans in a just and equitable 
manner become part of the decisionmaking processes of south 
africa de klerk said 
south africas 28 million blacks the majority have no vote 
emergency regulations imposed to quell racial unrest have allowed 
police to ban all outdoor rallies antigovernment meetings in 
churches universities or private homes speeches they consider 
subversive and news coverage of protests and police action they 
also permit police to detain anyone without charge 
newspapers say there is division in the cabinet on how to handle 
peaceful protests

unrest over the past six weeks and no one else were to blame for 
the deaths of innocent people during the election but he 
acknowledged police action had resulted in injuries and deaths

police misconduct in mixedrace and black areas around cape town on 
election day 
police were ordered to stay away from the center of cape town 
during the march wednesday which was held to protest police 
brutality 
the star the nations largest daily newspaper said it had 
learned the decision was made over objections from security 
officials

march was an important signal to the security establishment that the 
excessive influence in enjoyed during the pw botha era was on the 
wane the newspaper said 
the rev allan boesak president of the world alliance of 
reformed churches appeared optimistic about de klerks election 
at last we have someone who is more pragmatic than ideological 
this may herald something better for the future he said

academics and community residents marched from rhodes university to 
the police station thursday to protest the state of emergency the

more and more children are dropping out of school

percent of the countrys illiterates are women official newspapers 
say 
the illiteracy rate has dropped from 80 percent to 22 percent 
since the communists took over 40 years ago said a recent series in 
the legal news daily 
but the nations educational level is deteriorating again as more 
students abandon their classrooms 
legal news daily said 1332 middle school and elementary school 
pupils dropped out over a twomonth period in one county of coastal 
fujian province about 1 million students have quit in the past year 
in sichuan chinas most populous province 
the peoples daily reported about 25 million village children in 
henan province are not attending school there are about 180 million 
primary and middle school students in china 
children leave school to work in the fields be maids or factory 
workers in the city or help in relatives private enterprises the 
report said 
china has compulsory education through the ninth grade but many 
students are defying the regulation often with encouragement from 
parents 
economic reforms including the return of the family farm and the 
phenomenal growth of rural industries in the past decade have 
fueled the need for labor 
in fujian authorities found 2322 children younger than 16 in a 
days raids on factories among them 164 could not read 
in a textile factory in bobai county in southern guangxi 
province all 40 workers were children 
legal news quoted a school administrator as commenting on a job 
advertisement this is the chance to get a good job if the kids

about 20 percent of the adult population some 
33 million americans are significantly overweight giving the 
united states one of the highest populations of fat people in the 
world an obesity expert said thursday 
its clear that significant obesity appears to be more 
prevalent in the united states than elsewhere said dr george a 
bray a professor of medicine at louisiana state university and a 
leading researcher in obesity 
significant obesity is a major health problem only in europe and 
north america and bray said the problem is more severe in the 
united states than in europe 
why so many american adults are fat isnt clear he said but the 
effects are showing up among the obese as more heart attacks more 
high blood pressure more diabetes and more gall bladder disease 
being extremely fat said bray is only slightly less of a health 
risk than smoking two packs of cigarettes a day 
bray presidentelect of the north american association for the 
study of obesity said doctors consider significant obesity to be a 
weight about 30 percent above what would be ideal for a persons 
age height and gender 
thus a man whose ideal weight should be 170 to 180 pounds would 
be signficiantly obese if his weight was 221 to 234 at that 
point his weight would make him almost twice as likely to develop a 
life shortening ailment bray said 
the greater the excess weight the greater excess risk he 
said 
but the numbers on the weight scale dont tell the full story 
its not just how fat you are but where the fat is located 
that will determine your risk said bray 
it is now widely believed by researchers that fat located within 
the abdominal cavity surrounding the viscera poses an greater 
hazard to health than fat located in the extremities or just under 
the skin 
the reasons for this are not clear said bray the most 
widely accepted explanation is that when youve got more fat in your 
belly around your organs it is that fat that is released when you 
eat fatty acids 
because of its proximity such fat is thought to go directly to 
the liver he said where it sets up risk factors that we 
associate with heart disease diabetes hypertension and gall 
bladder disease 
adult men said bray seem to be most at risk of developing this 
unhealthy deposit of abdominal fat age also plays a factor he 
said because few children or young adults seem to develop this type 
of fat deposit 
for women the visceral fat doesnt seem to increase until 
there is a lot of total fat he said women are protected 
against visceral fat to some degree for some reason 
smoking affects visceral or central fat said bray and 
stopping smoking tends to cause this fat to dissolve away even 
though the former smoker may gain fat in other areas again why 
this is so is not well understood but he said this is another 
good reason to stop smoking 
elsewhere a decladelong study of american youth showed that 
they are becoming more muscular but that their evermore sedentary 
lifestyles have also made them fatter and triggered an ominous 
loss of cardiovascular health 
the chrysler fundamateur athletic union testing program which 
studied samplings of 12000 youths from 1980 to 1989 said that 
with no perceptible increase in height for the various age groups 
studied the weight gains can be attributed to poorer dietary and 
physical habits

construction of the navys new 12 billion 
destroyer has become a procurement nightmare of cost overruns 
and schedule delays a lawmaker charged in a letter released on the 
eve of the ships launching 
bath iron works which the navy contracted to build the ddg51 
destroyer is 18 months behind schedule on the program and will 
launch a ship saturday that is only 38 percent complete said rep 
john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee on oversight and investigations 
the ship will be named the arleigh burke after the world war ii 
naval hero and later chief of naval operations 
the ship has suffered huge overruns with the design costs 
increasing by about 120 percent and construction costs have 
increased by more than 60 percent dingell said in a twopage 
letter to navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii 
the letter dated sept 12 was obtained thursday by the 
associated press 
design costs have increased from the original contract estimate 
of 111 million to 247 million while construction costs have grown 
from 157 million to 252 million dingell said 
the michigan democrat based his charges on a draft report from 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
which is conducting an inquiry into the program the gaos final 
report is expected later this year 
the acquisition of the ddg51 has turned into a procurement 
nightmare dingell said in the letter 
at the pentagon navy cmdr mark baker said bath iron works is 
on schedule in accordance with their contractural requirements the 
navy considers the program well under control in both cost and 
schedule 
baker said the production schedule calls for the ship to be 
delivered to the navy in february 1991 the original delivery date 
of october 1989 had been changed due to a 99day strike at bath iron 
works in july 1985 a requirement of additional navy testing of the 
combat system and problems with computeraided design the navy 
spokesman said 
william e haggett chairman and chief executive officer of bath 
iron works called dingells assessment a distortion of the 
overall picture on the destroyer program as well as factually 
incorrect 
according to the executive at the 105yearold shipyard which 
built 83 destroyers during world war ii the destroyer is ready in 
every respect for launching 
its 47 to 51 percent complete a higher level than we launched 
our previous prototype ship haggett said in a telephone interview 
from bath maine

thousands of cheering people lined the 
streets thursday to greet namibian guerrilla leader sam nujoma as he 
ended 30 years of exile to compete in preindependence elections 
we never lost sight of our principal objective freedom and 
independence for namibia nujoma said 
supporters of nujomas southwest african peoples organization 
mobbed his motorcade as it left the airport on the 25mile drive 
through the empty and arid countryside into windhoek the capital 
we return in the spirit of peace love and national 
reconciliation said nujoma whose fighters waged a 23year war 
against south african rule of namibia 
tight security measures were in force because of threats on 
nujomas life and the assassination tuesday of anton lubowski the 
only white with a leadership post in nujomas movement 
south africa which has controlled namibia since 1915 agreed to 
grant the territory independence under un supervision elections 
are set for november and independence is expected early next year 
nujomas return will undoubtedly boost the fortunes of his 
independence movement which already is favored to capture the most 
votes nujoma arrived a day before the deadline to register for 
election to the constituent assembly that will write a constitution 
no words may express my happiness at joining my family friends 
and comrades said nujoma who kissed the tarmac and hugged his 
89yearold mother when he got off the ethiopian airlines jet from 
luanda angola 
nujoma predicted his organization would win an overwhelming 
majority at the polls the nationalist movement needs to capture 
twothirds of the seats to draw up the constitution by itself 
his boisterous supporters crammed into trucks vans station 
wagons and buses brought traffic to a halt as they followed nujoma 
from the airport through town they honked horns sang songs 
chanted slogans gave clenched fist salutes and waved the red blue 
and green movement flag 
people left their offices and homes to see the parade and some 
joined in others shouted obscenities 
nujoma when asked about the death threats said whenever i 
move about i am concerned about my own safety 
he said lubowski will be remembered for for his dedication to 
the sacred code of peace justice and freedom lubowski 37 a 
civil rights lawyer was killed by automatic rifle fire outside his 
windhoek home tuesday night 
earlier thursday police inspector kierie du rand said a 
50yearold white man with an irish passport had been arrested in 
the killing du rand said the man reportedly came to namibia from 
cape town south africa and was arrested wednesday in windhoek 
du rand did not identify him and said additional arrests were 
expected 
all the movement leaders have unarmed bodyguards they said they 
have applied for police protection but they want un forces to 
monitor the police guards 
the guerrilla group has received some bad publicity as some 
people said they were captured by the group and tortured they said 
up to 2000 other detainees were still being held 
nujoma denied anyone was still being held 
fighting between the guerrillas and the south africanled 
security forces ended in april since then there have been only 
isolated violent incidents in this territory 
nujomas organization is leftistleaning and favors a socialist 
economy he is viewed as a shrewd instinctive politician 
maintaining the presidency of swapo since 1960 despite occasional 
challenges

jesse jackson said thursday that president 
bushs plan to fight drugs underestimates the power of drug cartels 
and should be combined with a war on poverty 
if you woke up tomorrow morning sober and drug free and rain 
falling through your roof youd still have another war to fight 
the war on poverty jackson said 
speaking at one of the forums sponsored by the congressional 
black caucus during its threeday legislative weekend the 
twotime candidate for the democratic presidential nomination said 
bushs drug program is insufficient to combat drug suppliers 
the drug plan underestimates the viciousness of the drug lords 
they have better weapons than our state militia theyve got ak47s 
theyve got uzis automatic weapons theyre better equipped 
theyre willing to kill and be killed jackson said 
theyre more dangerous than the drug plan assesses they are 
he said the drug plan underestimates their troop strength the 
drug users are more desperate than the plan recognizes 
he also said poor people are being exploited on the other end of 
the drugproduction chain and that a war on drugs should include an 
effort to ease poverty in rural south america where drugs are grown 
youve got the very poor on both ends growing and consuming 
and the very wealthy wheeling and dealing jackson said 
jackson spoke at a youth forum during the first full day of 
events sponsored by the congessional black caucus the organization 
of black members of congress

one speaker said that there has been an escalation of racial 
violence linked to a deepening economic crisis 
leah wise executive director of the southerners for economic

racial incidents over the past decade in the south can be linked to 
plant closings and other economic threats felt by whites

states wants quick action on nuclear arms talks and supports reforms 
in the soviet union the white house said thursday 
announcing the bushshevardnadze talks white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said the president wants to have a summit 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev but that theres no hurry 
theres no pressing reason to push for a meeting if were not ready

talks in jackson hole wyo between shevardnadze and secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
baker and shevardnadze are expected to discuss prospects for a 
superpower summit barring a lastminute snag they also are 
expected to sign a landmark agreement governing disclosure of 
stockpiles of chemical weapons and permitting inspection of their 
production facilities

meeting would produce a summit date two administration officials

the presidents view is that he is certainly willing to have a 
summit with president gorbachev at any time that we feel that its 
right and both sides have substantive issues to discuss 
fitzwater said 
while acknowledging the possibility of an agreement on chemical 
weapons fitzwater said he did not want to tie the possibility of a 
superpower summit to any single particular issue

reforms in the soviet union and make sure theres no 
misunderstanding about our intention to move as fast as we can on 
arms control 
last week shevardnadze accused the bush administration of 
dragging its feet on arms negotiations he said the united states 
and soviet union could lose a lot from what he called the 
cautious and indecisive position taken by the bush administration 
fitzwater said the united states rejects the foreign ministers 
criticism 
we feel weve moved rather quickly and in a leadership fashion 
in terms of a wide range of arms control issues fitzwater

a plan for wider distribution of a promising 
experimental aids drug known as ddi is expected to be approved 
shortly food and drug administration sources said thursday 
bristolmyers co which is licensed to manufacture the drug has 
said it will distribute ddi or dideoxyinosine at no cost to aids 
patients when the next round of clinical trials begins later this 
month 
the drug has so far been available only to about 90 patients in 
phase one clinical trials the initial safety studies 
the company has asked the fda to approve distribution of the drug 
to patients who do not qualify for the upcoming round of research 
trials which will compare ddi to azt the only approved antiaids 
drug patients who cannot tolerate azt would be ineligible for these 
trials 
fda officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said no 
decision has been made on precisely who would be eligible to receive 
the drug though one source said it would include certain patients 
outside clinical trials 
researchers say that like azt ddi appears to reduce replication 
of the human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids and controls 
the disease by enabling the body to recover some ability to fight 
infection 
scientists say one important advantage ddi has compared with azt 
is that it is less toxic and better tolerated by patients

dealing with soviet diplomats has undergone 
kind of a remarkable change as a byproduct of that countrys 
new openness and negotiations have become much easier the us 
ambassador to the united nations said thursday 
dealing with soviet diplomats has become something quite 
different than it was 10 15 30 years ago thomas pickering told 
a national press club audience you can now begin a process of 
sitting down and not only exploring where the issues will go but 
also sitting down and trying to put the pieces together 
while that occurred from time to time in many areas over the 
past couple of decades it was nowhere occurring as universally as 
it is now nor i think nearly as enthusiastically as it is now he 
said 
pickering was named to the un post by president bush and is 
only the second career officer to hold the job since it was 
established 43 years ago 
todays soviets pickering said are much more interested in 
finding ways to put things together and its a fascinating 
exploration because indeed as the soviet union has moved it has 
moved not away from us but in a direction of what has worked in our 
society 
there is a fascinating interest on the part of the soviets 
about how does our society tick what makes it work what are the 
features of success where have the failures been and how and in 
what way can they possibly incorporate those in the sort of system 
they hope to build he said

in addition to accusing papandreou of taking bribes thursdays 
panel report also said he had committed breach of faith and received 
stolen material from fugitive banker george koskotas according to 
committee chairman nikos katsaros he announced the findings to 
journalists 
the report said a special court should be set up to investigate 
the reports that panpandreou and the other ministers were involved 
in embezzling funds 
parliament speaker athanassios tsaldaris said a twoday debate 
will be held on the scandal which centers on koskotas and his 
privatelyowned bank of crete at the end of september 
a debate on the reported wiretaps will also be held but no date 
has been set 
if parliament accepts the proposals of the two committees the 
supreme court president will preside over two special investigating 
tribunals they will be made up of 12 supreme court or appeals court 
judges 
if formal charges are filed as a result of the inquiries the 
former government officials would be tried by these same courts 
koskotas chairman and owner of the bank of crete was removed 
from his post by the government last october amid press reports he 
was embezzling the bank a later audit showed 210 million was 
missing 
since then the scandal has continued to make headlines and 
political waves the scandal hurt papandreou in his failed bid to 
lead his party to victory in national elections in june 
the political opposition and most of the press have accused 
papandreou and several of his ministers of complicity with koskotas 
most of the charges originated with koskotas himself who fled 
greece in november and later gave interviews to the media after he 
was arrested and held in salem mass 
he was quoted as saying papandreou had blackmailed him into 
embezzling funds and that the money supported papandreous party 
koskotas is awaiting extradition to greece 
katsaros committee was formed in july to look into any 
involvement by papandreou and the other ministers the former 
members are deputy premier agamemnon koutsogiorgas national economy 
minister panayotis roumeliotis finance minister dimitris tsovolas 
and transport minister george petsos 
members of papandreous panhellenic socialist movement or pasok 
walked out of parliamentary proceedings on the scandal last week 
charging that they were attempts to slur the former premier 
papandreou has accused the political opposition of attempting to 
destroy him politically however he has refused to testify before 
the two parliamentary committees instead he sent messages 
questioning the legality of the inquiries and denying guilt 
it is considered virtually certain that parliament will agree to 
more investigations because 173 seats in the 300seat chamber are 
held by conservative and leftist parties that united to form a 
government 
the coalition administration succeeded the socialists after no 
party won a clear majority in junes national elections it has 
pledged to make major steps to clean up greek political life and 
hold new elections by nov 5

dogs cause more deaths and injuries in the united 
states than most people believe claiming 18 to 20 lives a year and 
scarring hundreds of thousands of people federal researchers say in 
a study 
seventy percent of deaths occur among children less than 10 years 
old including many less than a year old who are sometimes attacked 
while sleeping or after wandering into fenced areas where dogs are 
kept the study found 
the occurrence of dog biterelated fatalities has been 
underestimated the authors from the national centers for disease 
control in atlanta said in their report in fridays journal of the 
american medical association 
many of these bites and deaths are potentially preventable 
they added 
pit bull breeds were involved in 42 of the 101 deaths in which 
dog breed was reported almost three times more than german 
shepherds the next most commonly reported breed the researchers 
said 
that finding was questioned by american kennel club vice 
president alan j stern who said information on breeds was not 
meaningful we have legendary cases of misidentification of 
breeds he said 
twentyseven breeds have been variously labeled as bull 
types many erroneously including dalmatian mixes and chesapeake 
bay retrievers stern said in a telephone interview thursday from 
new york 
people dont know what they are he said the dogs attack 
so theyre pit bulls 
but ann joly a research assistant with the washingtonbased 
humane society of the united states said pit bulls do represent a 
disproportionately high number of animals involved in dogbite 
fatalities 
she said however that news accounts of pit bull attacks 
helped fuel the fire by prompting weird kinds of people who 
want a mean dog to look for pit bulls to train into vicious 
animals 
to curb the dogbite problem the cdc researchers recommended 
stronger animalcontrol laws better public education on dog bites 
and more responsible dog ownership 
joly and stern agreed with the recommendations stern stressed 
the need for animalcontrol laws that go after the deed not the 
breed 
besides deaths dog bites cause a tremendous injury problem 
said the researchers dr jeffrey j sacks dr richard w sattin 
and sandra e bonzo more than 2 million persons are bitten yearly 
half are left scarred onetenth require sutures stitches and 
onethird suffer lost school or work time the researchers added 
citing previous research 
the authors identified 157 dog biterelated fatalities that 
occurred in the united states from 1979 through 1988 based on data 
from the national center for health statistics and a computer search 
of news stories during the period 
in addition there were four dog biterelated deaths recorded by 
the humane society and 17 other deaths at least partly attributed 
to dog bites by data from the health statistics center they said 
since center statistics were missing for two years the researchers 
estimated that 26 deaths were unaccounted for judging by data from 
previous years 
taken together the total for the period was 204 deaths or about 
20 a year the authors said only one rabiddogbite fatality turned 
up and it was not included in calculations the researchers said 
the main victims of fatal dog bites were the very young and 
very old those least able to protect themselves the researchers 
said 
the death rate for newborns less than a month old was 370 times 
higher than that for adults ages 30 to 49 they said and the rate 
for infants less than a year old was 85 times higher than for 
adults in that group 
for people 70 or over the rate was almost 11 times higher than 
for the 30to49 group 
the three states with the largest number of fatal attacks were 
texas with 17 california with 16 and ohio with 10 western 
states in general had higher death rates said the researchers who 
offered no explanation for the finding

an angry chief justice william h rehnquist 
said thursday a new book on robert h borks illfated supreme court 
nomination incorrectly states rehnquist broke a promise to keep 
justice lewis f powells impending retirement a secret 
in the book battle for justice author ethan bronner says 
powell told rehnquist on june 25 1987 that he would announce his 
retirement the following day and asked for a solemn promise to 
keep it a secret overnight 
the chief justice expressed his sincere regret agreed to keep 
it to himself and called white house chief of staff howard h 
baker with the news the book said it said baker immediately told 
president reagan 
that statement is in error rehnquist said thursday i 
notified howard baker of the retirement shortly before we went on 
the bench on the morning of friday june 26 1987 
bronner however stuck by his story thursday and said his 
taperecorded interview with baker supports his account of 
rehnquists action 
privately rehnquist has told people at the court he is offended 
by an account that portrays him as a man who cannot be trusted to 
keep his word the chief justice decided to go public with his anger 
shoftly after the passage in the book was called to his attention 
powells announcement of his retirement on the last day of the 
courts 198687 term stunned those in the courtroom that june 26 
morning and touched off an epic battle to fill the court vacancy 
borks nomination was defeated by the senate after a bitter fight 
in which the nominee was attacked as an extreme conservative outside 
the mainstream of american politics 
federal judge douglas h ginsburg reagans second choice 
withdrew as a nominee after admitting he smoked marijuana while a 
harvard law professor the president then nominated anthony m 
kennedy who was confirmed by the senate and joined the court in 
february 1988 
rehnquists version of when the white house was told of powells 
retirement was supported by baker in an interview with the 
associated press 
i talked to him rehnquist minutes before powell made a 
public announcement said baker now a washington attorney 
baker said his office received a telephone call from rehnquists 
office the evening of june 25 alerting the white house something was 
up the message from a rehnquist aide was that the chief justice 
intended to call baker the following morning 
baker said he was ready for a call from rehnquist on june 26 but 
had no idea of what the chief justice wanted to tell him 
baker a former republican senator from tennessee said he 
promptly told reagan the news at their regular morning meeting that 
took place shortly before powell announced his retirement publicly 
baker said 
bronner told the ap on thursday he interviewed baker for the 
book and baker said he was told by rehnquist of powells decision 
to retire a day before the public announcement 
a transcript of that taperecorded interview has baker saying he 
told reagan about the powell retirement right after hearing from 
rehnquist on june 25 
it was the day before that rehnquist called me baker told 
bronner baker provided details of the conversation including 
rehnquists admonition that the advance word on powell was for 
your ears only 
asked by bronner when he informed reagan baker said i did it 
the second i got the call 
baker now says if he told bronner he had advance knowledge i 
misspoke myself i did not know 
powell asked for his recollection said he believes rehnquist 
lived up to his promise theres no question in my mind the 
white house was not informed until shortly before the courtroom 
announcement powell said

president corazon aquino said thursday 
that she will consider filipino interests more than regional 
security concerns in deciding whether to allow us military bases 
to stay after 1991 
also thursday several hundred leftists rallied in front of the 
us embassy to demand the bases be closed they promised bigger 
rallies when vice president quayle visits the philippines later this 
month 
in an interview with the associated press mrs aquino said she 
was waiting to hear what washington was prepared to offer before 
making her decision on the bases whose lease expires in september 
1991 
us and filipino officials are expected to begin talks late this 
year on the future of clark air base the subic bay naval base and 
four smaller installations 
us officials claim the bases are essential for maintaining 
security in the far east including the sixmember association of 
southeast asian nations to which the philippines belongs 
i will decide this based on what i believe will be in the 
interest of the filipino people mrs aquino said while it is 
true we are of asean my first consideration naturally is for the 
interest of the filipino people and after that what will benefit the 
asean region 
singapore has offered air and naval facilities in case the 
philippines closes the us installations but american officials 
say singapores facilities cannot match the size and location of 
those in the philippines 
last october the united states agreed to pay 461 million a year 
in aid to keep the bases until 1991 
us officials warn that washington is not prepared to pay 
substantially more for the bases because they contribute to 
philippine defense 
during the interview mrs aquino refused to say whether she 
believes the bases guarantee regional security she noted however 
that the presence of american bases did not prevent japanese forces 
from invading this island nation during world war ii 
in fact there are people who think that perhaps we were the 
first to be attacked simply because of the presence of us bases 
she said 
quayle is expected to discuss the bases issue when he arrives 
sept 26 for a threeday visit 
at the embassy rally several speakers said they would organize 
large demonstrations during quayles visit to protest the us 
military presence 
any new bases agreement must be ratified by twothirds of the 
23member philippine senate last month 12 senators called for the 
bases to be closed in 1991 
mrs aquino also refused to say whether she personally believes a 
new agreement would be in the national interest 
regardless of the outcome mrs aquino said she wanted to retain 
close ties with the united states the philippines former colonial 
ruler 
i am hoping that both the americans and the filipinos can 
maintain a very friendly relationship because we filipinos would 
like to believe that there is more to the relationship than just 
the matter of the bases she said

communist authorities will rebury the 
last king of montenegro who died in exile in 1921 in the city that 
served as capital of his kingdom a newspaper reported thursday 
for many years officials harshly criticized the yuguslav 
monarchy after it was abolished and communism proclaimed in 1945 
the decision to allow reinterment reflects growing liberalization 
and swelling nationalist sentiments during economic hardship and 
ethnic strife 
the remains of king nikola petrovic and queen milena will be 
exhumed from their tomb in the italian mediterranean resort of san 
remo on sept 29 according to the politika ekspres daily 
after being transferred back to yugoslavia they will be reburied 
on oct 1 in an orthodox church at cetinje former capital of the 
kingdom of montenegro the daily said montenegro is now one of six 
yugoslav republics 
according to sources close to those organizing the reburial 
yugoslavias crown prince aleksandar karadjordjevic a businessman 
living in london and a distant relative of king nikola will be 
invited to come to yugoslavia to attend the ceremony 
if he accepts it will be the first time that a direct descendant 
of the royal family has gained permission to enter the country since 
communist rule began 
montenegro was an independent state for centuries before it was 
incorporated into the kingdom of yugoslavia in 1918 under the rule 
of the rival serbian karadjordjevic dynasty 
king nikola who had fled to italy to escape advancing 
austrohungarian troops in 1916 never returned home

widespread antisemitism in the lower ranks of 
soviet government and among the general populace has increased 
greatly under glasnost according to an internal state department 
report presented thursday at a congressional hearing 
statesponsored antisemitism official policy for hundreds of 
years has abated although many cases are still reported the 
report said 
the report is designed to provide information about soviet 
treatment of jews armenians and pentecostals the three groups 
with the largest number seeking seek to emigrate to the united 
states 
soviet jews estimated to number at least 25 million comprise 
the largest group of emigres seeking entry into the united states 
under the opendoor policies of president mikhail gorbachev 
as many as 150000 soviets the majority jews are expected to 
apply to leave for the united states next year 
but while the government is allowing increased jewish emigration 
and limiting harassment of religious and cultural activities 
widespread antisemitic discrimination is still encountered at the 
lower levels of government and in the general russian 
population the report said 
leaders of five american jewish organizations calling on deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger registered concern over 
antisemitism in the soviet union 
shoshana s cardin chairman of the national conference on soviet 
jewry said it is creating tremendous apprehension 
concerns are mounting there is a wave of emotion that is being 
appealed to that is dangerous cardin said 
the findings presented by rep howard berman dcalif at a 
hearing about the administrations proposal to admit 50000 soviet 
refugees next year appear to clash with a justice department 
directive that has removed the presumption of persecution for soviet 
jews 
the directive issued by former attorney general edwin meese 
requires each applicant to prove a wellfounded fear of 
persecution to be granted refugee status 
as many as 50 percent of those applying this year in moscow have 
been turned down for refugee status that is despite the fact that 
immigration and naturalization service officials use the report to 
help them process soviet applicants according to ins chief of staff 
gerald coyle 
the new type of soviet antisemitism has increased markedly in 
the context of glasnost as prior governmental controls on speech 
assembly media etc have been loosened the report said 
popular groups such as pamyat frequently express antisemitism 
as a social theory to explain economic hardships or to oppose 
gorbachevs reforms it said 
many jews have reason to fear not only that the fall of 
gorbachev and the reformers allied with him would bring back the 
kind of official antisemitism that was in vogue prior to 1987 
but that it would be augmented by the new brand of discrimination 
the report said 
official discrimination against jews has also continued the 
state department said persons identified as jews have great 
difficulty being accepted into universities and other institutions 
and despite some significant efforts to appear to provide 
facilities for the study of jewish religion and culture in fact 
very little improvement has occurred

rep john d dingell the chief house 
democratic sponsor of president bushs clean air bill signaled 
thursday he propose relaxing the administrations stringent curbs on 
acid rain 
dingell chairman of the energy and commerce committee said he 
had problems with a section of the acid rain plan that environmental 
protection agency administrator william k reilly this week called 
the most crucial part of the proposal 
the move would place the michigan democrat in the unusual 
position of opposing a key provision of the bill he is sponsoring 
it also would change what environmentalists call the strongest 
portion of the bush legislation 
reilly said the administration opposed any attempt to weaken the 
provision which would cap emissions of sulfur dioxide a key 
component of acid rain the chief republican sponsor of the 
legislation rep norman f lent rny said he favors retaining 
the administrations language 
the cap would prevent sulfur dioxide emissions from growing 
again after they are steadily reduced by a total of 10 million tons 
over the next decade 
sulfur dioxide combines with nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere and 
travels for hundreds of miles before falling to earth killing 
aquatic life in lakes and streams damaging trees decreasing 
visibility and possibly harming human lungs 
speaking before the energy and commerce environment subcommittee 
dingell said keeping the cap would prevent utilities from growing to 
serve new customers it also would harm the highsulfur coal 
industry which is cheap but fuels the dirtiestburning utilities 
he told the panel which will begin considering amendments to the 
bush bill next week 
but loosening the cap dingell said would reduce sulfur 
dioxide emissions without a severe impact on growth or on the use 
of coal in the next century 
power plants burning highsulfur coal would bear the brunt of the 
sulfur dioxide reductions under the bush legislation the united 
mine workers union fears the utilities would reduce emissions the 
cheapest way by switching to other fuels the epa estimates that 
could cost 17000 jobs in the highsulfur coal industry 
i am greatly concerned that unemployment in appalachia will 
rise by enacting this bill dingell said clearly that 
should not be an environmental utility industry or federal goal 
a bush administration official speaking only on condition he not 
be named said well defend the presidents position well also 
work with the sponsors well wait for specific changes and figure 
out how well react 
while the cap would make it difficult for electric utilities 
to serve additional customers after the year 2000 there is a 
provision to permit some growth utilities could accomplish this by 
buying credits from utilities that exceeded their required 
reductions 
dingell a longtime champion of the auto industry said 
meanwhile that he would vigorously fight any attempts to toughen 
bushs antipollution requirements for motor vehicles 
i would point out that all of the country does not have the air 
pollution problems of california dingell said yet some 
particularly in the northeast suggest that we should extend the 
entire california auto emissions program nationwide 
i would hope that my colleagues resist the temptation to single 
out for punishment an industry that with its suppliers from the 
glass steel aluminum plastics rubber and mining industries 
among others employs millions in all the states

president bush in less than eight months in 
office has chosen more women for top jobs than any previous 
president in a full year his personnel chief said thursday 
chase untermeyer said bush recently eclipsed jimmy carters old 
record of 72 women appointees in 1980 with his 73rd presidential 
appointment and has already raised that mark to 77 
and were not stopping there untermeyer said in a lecture at 
the heritage foundation were going to name more and more 
untermeyer said 20 percent of bushs appointees to the jobs 
requiring senatorial confirmation have been women and 13 percent 
minorities 
untermeyer did not say how those percentages compared with those 
of previous presidents 
while smaller than the percentage of the women and minorities in 
the entire population the bush administrations figures are about 
double the comparable percentage of women and minorities in the top 
ranks of the civil service he claimed 
untermeyer the director of presidential personnel sought to 
rebut criticism from congressional democrats that the bush 
administration is riddled with vacancies 
in the cabinet departments the vacancy rate for the highest 
positions is less than 12 percent 36 jobs out of 312 he said 
a few of the 36 are important jobs including the 
undersecretary of commerce for technology but most of those 36 
are positions that are clearly of lower priority said untermeyer 
im not trying to ridicule these positions or the industries or 
sectors of the american economy that they are involved with but 
among those vacancies that we dont have a candidate in process yet 
is to be the deputy commissioner of patents and the deputy 
commissioner of trademarks said untermeyer 
the federal grain inspector is also one of those positions 
many of these jobs make me wonder why they are presidential 
appointments at all but the congress has decreed that they should 
be presidential appointments so they are he said 
elsewhere we have 88 percent of the positions that count 
either on the job or awaiting confirmation he said 
the democratic study group in a blistering report released aug 
29 charged that 160 of 394 senior positions more than 40 percent 
had been left vacant by bush as of early august it said it 
appeared a significant portion of the government is on automatic 
pilot 
the democratic study group said the vacancies include five 
assistant secretaries of education a deputy attorney general and 
an undersecretary of state as well as the commerce post 
the white house has complained that its nominees were facing 
slowgoing in the democraticcontrolled senate 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine last week said 
bush had no grounds to complain because he has failed to make 
nominations for nearly half of the fulltime positions in executive 
departments and independent agencies which require senate 
confirmation 
untermeyer said there is always about a 12 percent at the top 
of the executive branch as people resign retire move on or out of 
their office for other reasons 
i describe my job as rather like painting the golden gate 
bridge once you finish it you have to start in at the other end 
and start painting it again said untermeyer 
he scoffed at the impression left by the critics that the bush 
administration is somehow still in the starting blocks that it 
was gulliver tied down by strings of red tapes this is not true 
this administration has been enormously even historically 
successful in establishing itself and when faced with a congress 
that is in the hands of the opposition it is most impressive the 
bush assistant said 
the 73rd female presidential appointee was margaret machol who 
bush said he will nominate to be a commissioner of the commodity 
futures trading corporation

oaklands school district has been plagued 
by charges of corruption and thievery and faces a fiscal crisis that 
could force it to accept a 10 million bailout and a stateappointed 
overseer 
the california assembly on thursday approved the bailout measure 
and sent it to the governor for signing if approved oakland would 
become the states first district taken over by the state without 
the school boards approval 
in the past six months police have arrested eight school 
employees on charges ranging from grand theft to forgery the entire 
sevenmember school board has been subpoenaed by a county grand 
jury and a threemonth newspaper investigation uncovered a 
mafiastyle patronage system allegedly run by top officials known as 
the family 
in addition the district has been unable to hire a 
superintendent to take over stewardship of californias 
fifthlargest school district since the previous chief administrator 
left in december 
angry residents responding to the turmoil have launched a 
recall drive to oust school board members 
the district with a 14 million deficit in the current 228 
million budget is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy the school 
board on wednesday approved a financing plan that uses school 
property as collateral but state schools chief bill honig and 
alameda county schools superintendent william berck oppose the 
arrangement as fiscally unstable 
honig called the budget plan hokey and said district 
mismanagement has created problems that are now bursting out all 
over 
nobodys running the show he said they have no longterm 
plan to get out of the problems they need fiscal policies they 
need personnel policies and they need management policies 
state assemblyman elihu harris sponsored the legislation to 
provide a 10 million loan and put in place a state monitor to 
oversee the districts financial operations and make sure they 
develop and adhere to a longterm plan 
these are not problems that just surfaced in oakland harris 
said thursday some have been around for 15 or 16 years if the 
problems were new id suggest they could be solved internally but 
theyre not new 
more than 50000 residents signed a petition in support of 
harris proposed law now awaiting gov george deukmejians 
signature 
as the crisis grows police estimate as many as 50 district 
employees may be arrested before their investigation is completed 
worried parents are enrolling their children in private schools in 
record numbers 
critics blame top leaders for the crisis in the 50000student 
district they say a looseknit system of close friends working to 
protect each others jobs has eroded authority and cleared the way 
for illegal activity 
several school officials many of whom will speak only on the 
condition of anonymity say senior school board member darlene 
lawson is at the center of the alleged patronage system 
lawson who did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
thursday has denied that she heads the family and has accused 
critics of launching a racist drive to purge the district of many 
black administrators 
the firstever grand jury probe of the schools began in 1984 one 
year after a black majority was elected to the board for the first 
time lawson wrote in the tribune of oakland following the 
newspapers twoday report 
lawson who is black said educational problems have been ignored 
as politicians pursue an elitist and undemocratic political 
agenda 
honig described the districts crisis as just a sick 
situation and rejected the charge of racism 
the last refuge of scoundrels is the false claim of 
racism he said nobody wants to take over oakland weve got 
enough to do they should do their jobs eventually the people 
there who are claiming a plot are going to have to realize that they 
are the problem

the air force has moved toward correcting 
communications problems in the system responsible for alerting the 
united states and canada if north america is under attack but 
deficiencies still remain says a report released thursday 
the general accounting office last november reported on five of 
29 serious problems that if ignored could affect the communications 
system segment replacement program which relays messages from 
various missile air and space sensor systems to mission centers at 
the cheyenne mountain air force station 
the station located in colorado springs colo is a data 
processing and communications center designed to monitor about 
10000 manmade objects in space provide warnings of any military 
attack in space and protect satellites from attack 
according to the gao the investigative arm of congress the air 
force has taken steps to correct three of the deficiencies delayed 
action on a fourth and is in the process of obtaining information on 
the fifth problem before resolving the issue 
the lack of uniform wiring standards cabling congestion and 
the need for a standardized message set are being resolved the 
gao said however selection and implementation of a standard 
communication protocol and use of consistent message loading 
assumptions have not been resolved 
a message set is the form in which data is transmitted from the 
sensors or radars to computer subsystems a communication protocol 
is a set of rules that govern communications among computer systems 
message loading assumptions involve the number of messages a 
subsystem is capable of processing 
the system is part of the north american aerospace defense 
command or norad which is responsible for alerting the united 
states and canada if north america is under air missile or space 
attack 
the gao is recommending that if the defense acquisition board

hispanic elected officials who account for 171 percent of the total

the senate tentatively approved a ban on 
cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights on thursday as 
outnumbered tobaccostate lawmakers abandoned their fight against 
the broadened restrictions 
on a showdown 7721 vote senators forced a halt to delaying 
tactics their prosmoking colleagues had hoped would wear out 
advocates of the ban and lead to a compromise the senate then 
formally adopted the restrictions on a unanimous voice vote 
we didnt undertake that vote in the belief we could defeat 
the proposed ban sen wendell ford dky who fought the proposal 
conceded afterward 
sen frank lautenberg dnj who sponsored the ban proposal and 
who cited health concerns about lingering cigarette smoke in airline 
cabins said the issue itself carried the day 
the measure was part of an 119 billion spending bill for next 
years transportation programs that was nearing final passage 
on aug 3 the house approved legislation making permanent the 
current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less the two 
chambers will have to hammer out a compromise before sending it to 
president bush for his signature 
spokesman gary miller of the tobacco institute the cigarette 
industry trade group predicted that the two chambers would produce 
a less extreme piece of legislation 
but jo ellen deutsch who as lobbyist for the association of 
flight attendants worked for the restrictions said she thought the 
total ban would get final congressional approval 
the senate showed very clearly that they do worry about the 
health of people who come in contact with cigarette smoke she 
said 
the senate version would extend the ban to all us routes 95 
days after the bill becomes law the current restrictions which 
cover fourfifths of all flights will otherwise expire next april 
as under current law passengers caught smoking would be subject 
to 1000 fines and people found to have disabled smoke detectors in 
aircraft restrooms would face penalties of up to 2000 paper 
stored in lavatories makes that part of an airliner the riskiest 
spot for a fire 
tobaccostate senators seeing the numbers were against them had 
said wednesday that they would accept a permanent smoking ban on 
routes of two hours or less when lautenberg and his supporters 
refused to make the concession ban opponents threatened to use 
procedural delays to slow the senates work to a crawl 
that effort was ended by the 7721 vote shortly afterward 
another procedural vote went 6534 for ban supporters and the battle 
was over 
opponents of the ban had argued that there is no scientific proof 
that cigarette fumes harm the health of nonsmokers and that the 
smoke is merely one of many chemicals adrift in the recirculated air 
inside airliners they called on supporters to await a 
transportation department study on airliner air quality expected by 
early next year 
they also said the restriction would hurt tobacco growers 
but supporters cited several studies concluding that nonsmokers 
risk cancer and other diseases by inhaling cigarette smoke and said 
there was no reason to wait for a total prohibition 
the american people are overwhelmingly in support of this 
suspension of smoking on airliners lautenberg said 
the bill allows 119 billion in new spending for transportation 
and the expenditure of 159 billion in previously collected fuel 
and passenger taxes 
the measure includes 122 billion for highway projects 73 
billion for aviation programs and 3 billion for mass transit 
assistance

the agriculture department said thursday that 
the alaska pulp corp and the forest service have agreed to major 
changes in the companys longterm timber contract for the tongass 
national forest in alaska 
the contract revisions address concerns expressed by congress 
and the public over the last few years forest service chief f 
dale robertson said in a statement the most significant change is 
that the federal government and the taxpayers will get full market 
value for the timber sold 
robertson said changes include 
an upward rate provision that is expected to boost the price of 
timber harvested to as much as 80 or 90 per 1000 boardfeet from 
147 per 1000 boardfeet depending on market value 
much closer conformity with other timber sale contracts 
forest service selection and designation of timber to be 
harvested harvesting must be completed on existing units before new 
areas will be made available 
robertson said the contract with alaska pulp was initiated in 
1956 as part of an effort to promote economic development in 
southeast alaska and to provide stable employment for residents 
it is one of two remaining longterm timber sale contracts that 
have been questioned by congress and the public particularly for 
the value received for tongass timber he said 
the other longterm contract is with ketchikan pulp co it has 
been renegotiated and rates for timber already have been adjusted in 
line with current market conditions robertson said

solidarity leader lech walesa said thursday 
he will likely tour poland in an effort to persuade poles to give 
the new noncommunist government the time it needs to combat 
economic ills 
in washington president bush announced he will double to 100 
million next years us food aid to poland bush has been under 
congressional pressure to increase aid in order to bolster polish 
reforms 
the food aid is separate from a 119 million package of economic 
assistance to poland previously announced by the white house 
in his remarks walesa rejected a suggestion that poles might 
prove unwilling to accept the hardships imposed by radical economic 
reform 
there is nothing to be given up for the market is already 
empty he said in a reference to polands severe shortages of food 
and other basic supplies long lines for many commodities are common 
however walesa said there is a need to repeat his appeal for a 
sixmonth moratorium on strikes to give the new government a chance 
to put its policies to work 
there is a need to talk and give arguments he said during a 
news conference at solidarity headquarters in the baltic port of 
gdansk 
that is why i will probably now make a tour around poland 
meeting with people talking directly walesa said polish 
society is bright and if issues are explained well it will 
understand what poland needs 
thursday was the second day in office for the ministers of the 
new solidaritycontrolled government 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a solidarity newspaper editor 
until he took on his historic mission aug 24 held only one 
publicly reported meeting thursday it was a session with austrian 
vicechancellor josef riegler 
mazowiecki who had been an adviser to walesa is leading the 
east blocs first noncommunist government since the communists 
consolidated power after world war ii 
many of the new governments plans to introduce westernstyle 
economic reform to combat tripledigit inflation its 39 billion 
foreign debt and other economic ills are likely to further undermine 
a lagging standard of living mazowiecki has said 
the new political leadership has declared that the sacrifices 
will be needed for longterm gains but they are clearly worried 
about public patience and support 
no details were offered on the trip suggested by walesa 
on two previous occasions this year he has used his tremendous 
personal influence with poles 
he traveled around poland to urge workers not to strike while 
talks were under way last spring that resulted in the 
relegalization of his labor movement 
he also made stops around the country to advocate support for 
solidarity campaigns during the unprecedented democratic 
parliamentary elections in june solidarity won a sweeping victory 
and then successfully bargained to lead the government 
in his comments thursday walesa also looked ahead saying 
political divisions between solidarity and the communist party are 
now following a new confrontational model not by means of 
force but a peaceful confrontation 
after pluralisms victory there will not be a need for a 
confrontational structure he said predicting the advent of other 
political parties and other trade unions 
the official pap news agency reported thursday that communist 
parliament deputies have put forward a proposal to revise the law on 
political parties to create the legal conditions for founding 
parties and establishing their equal rights 
in his remarks walesa also said he wants to internationalize 
the polish economy turning to countries like france and the 
scandinavian nations as economic allies 
us commerce secretary robert a mosbacher will begin a 
threeday visit to poland on tuesday as part of a trip that also

several lawmakers accused the bush 
administration thursday of failing to take a strong enough position 
against the khmer rouge faction in cambodia with one declaring 
im angry as hell about this 
when the khmer rouge headed by pol pot controlled cambodia in 
the early 1970s their forces killed as many as 2 million people a 
devastation portrayed in the wellknown movie the killing 
fields 
rep chester g atkins dmass told a top state department 
official that the united states was not vocal enough about opposing 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge at an international conference on 
cambodia held in paris over the summer 
the conference held to work out a political solution for the 
future of cambodia foundered because various factions could not 
agree 
in the united states there is increasing concern about the 
prospect of continuing conflict in cambodia if the vietnamese 
occupation troops withdraw as hanoi has pledged from the 
neighboring country at the end of the month 
rep stephen solarz dny chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs said the failure 
of the conference and the withdrawal of troops creates the very 
real possibility that the genocidal khmer rouge could battle its way 
back to power in phnom penh 
richard solomon the assistant secretary of state for east asian 
and pacific affairs told the hearing that the bush administration 
wants no role for the khmer rouge in a future cambodian 
government 
the unites states would like to see an interim cambodian 
government headed by its ally former cambodian leader prince 
sihanouk washington provides open and secret aid to sihanouk 
despite the us position on the khmer rouge the united states 
agreed with sihanouk china and asian allies that the changes for 
longterm peace in cambodia would be enhanced if the khmer rouge 
were part of a coalition government solomon said 
in other words total exclusiion of the khmer rouge is seen by 
those most directly involved as a sure formula for civil warfare 
while their inclusion holds out some prospect that the struggle can 
be contained within a political process monitored by the 
international community he said 
atkins and other attacked the administration for not being tough 
enough on the khmer rouge im angry as hell about this atkins 
said complaining of the us position 
he accused the bush administration of remaining silent about the 
khmer rouges past activities in conference working sessions and 
said it was part of a pattern in the administration of publicly 
professing distrust of the khmer rouge but not carrying through 
with actions 
rep jim leach riowa the subcommittees ranking republican 
said the united states does not have the luxury of recusing 
itself on moral issues such as the past genocidal practices of 
the khmer rouge 
leach suggested pol pot be bought before an international court 
charged with war crimes 
at solarz request the hearing was moved behind closed doors so 
solomon could explain the us position on the khmer rouge 
solarz acknowledged the united states sometimes had to make 
alliances with unsavory groups such as the ussoviet pact with 
joseph stalin in world war ii the two were allied against adolf 
hilter 
at the same time he pressed solomon on whether the united states 
characterized the khmer rouge as having practiced genocide under the 
senateratified genocide treaty the khmer rouge object to the word 
solomon said that at the paris conference the united states 
supported language referring to the groups genocidal practices

the head of the international monetary fund 
said thursday that imf resources need to be doubled so that the 
multinational lending agency can provide more help to poor countries 
the request by imf managing director michel camdessus will likely 
be the main topic of discussion when finance officials from 151 
nations gather in washington later this month for the annual 
meetings of the imf and its sister organization the world bank 
the imf is owned by the 151 countries with the largest share 
236 billion coming from the united states the us share is out 
of total imf resources of 118 billion 
the imf resources called quotas are provided by member 
countries which pledge to keep a certain level of their financial 
reserves with the imf 
in making his request camdessus said that 19 of the 22 members 
of the imf board had indicated that they supported an increase of at 
least 66 percent but he said a boost in resources of at least 80 
percent was needed to keep the imf from being forced to limit the 
access of member countries to our help 
the imf and the world bank have been key players in the bush 
administrations new debt reduction strategy unveiled by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady on march 10 
the brady plan seeks to reduce the 13 trillion third world debt 
burden by getting commercial banks to voluntarily write off a 
portion of the debt in exchange from guarantees from the two lending 
agencies that a portion of the reduced debt will be repaid 
in another development wednesday john reed chairman of 
citicorp the countrys largest bank said that he was concerned 
that the brady debt plan was being viewed solely as an effort reduce 
debt at the exclusion of new loans from commercial banks 
our purpose after all is to restore economic and financial 
health to these economies which are important markets for the 
united states not to cut them off totally from the banking 
system reed said at a news conference in washington 
some countries have already endorsed a doubling of imf resources 
but some us officials have said they are not yet convinced that 
any increase is needed 
in recent years the funds money has gone for new loans to third 
world countries many of them heavily in debt in return for pledges 
of policy changes to put them in better financial condition 
sen bill bradley dnj said on wednesday that congress would 
likely give a cool reception to any request from the president 
unless the administration agreed to boost government resources by 
raising raxes 
rep jim leach riowa said that while congress would initially 
be reluctant it would eventually go along with the administration 
critics of the imf have been questioning the value of its efforts 
jeffrey d sachs professor of international trade at harvard 
university said that the imf has a record of failure in debtor 
countries 
he said that of 39 or so countries that have been wrestling with 
debt problems few have been able to meet their obligations without 
undermining their national prosperity 
the world bank announced meanwhile that afghanistan has 
restored itself to good standing with a payment of 755000 
it was made ineligible for new loans in june because it was 
overdue on about 26 million worth of debt afghanistan owes the 
bank about 79 million on 20 lowinterest loans amounting to 230 
million that it received in past years

railroad armenia is practically in a state of economic blockade 
he told the paper that the southern republic of armenia gets 87 
percent of its freight including fuel supplies from azerbaijan 
the two caucasus mountain republics have been in a fierce dispute 
since february over who should control nagornokarabakh region 
which lies in azerbaijan but has a population that is 75 percent 
ethnic armenian 
the azerbaijani peoples front political movement listed as one 
demand in calling a general strike last week that azerbaijan 
reassert control over nagornokarabakh in place of direct rule from 
moscow 
the strike was called off last monday it was not among any 
stated aim of the walkout that supplies to armenia be cut 
the armenianazerbaijani dispute has led to violence that killed 
about 100 people since last year and forced hundreds of thousands to 
flee their homes 
soviet newspapers say the situation remains tense and that the 
region is a powder keg 
pravda said the 19mile road from goris in armenia to the 
nagornokarabakh boundary is so dangerous it is impossible to pass 
even with a military escort 
on wednesday the national youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
said few cars were operating on even the main streets of yerevan 
the armenian capital and large gaps intervened in public transport 
service 
pravda said even ambulances could not fill up at service stations

the senate responding to a growing wave of 
drugrelated violence in the nations capital thursday approved a 
bill to finance the hiring of 700 additional district of columbia 
police officers 
the 23 million package already approved by the house comes on 
top of the citys plan to hire 300 extra officers the two measures 
will bring the force to about 5000 officers 
we need to send a signal that we are retaking the streets of 
washington sen brock adams dwash said after an 
appropriations committee hearing tuesday this will not solve the 
drug problem but we certainly hope that it will help 
the move which passed without debate on a voice vote likely 
will provide some relief to officers who have been working 12hour 
shifts since august to help combat drugrelated violence 
in march most officers were assigned to sixday weeks with 
officers from all parts of the city assigned to patrol druginfested 
neighborhoods on their sixth tour of duty that plan was abandoned 
when the crime rate slowed but the 12hour shift plan was created 
when the crime wave rose again 
police have blamed crack cocaine for an explosion of drugrelated 
violence in washington 
through thursday 318 people had been killed in the district of 
columbia in 1989 compared with 228 at the same time last year a 
record 372 people were killed in the district in 1988 
the money to hire extra officers will come from special use of a 
lumpsum water and sewer payment the federal government provides the 
city the city will be reimbursed for those funds by directly 
billing federal agencies in the city

the house ways and means committee reversed 
itself thursday voting to keep for at least two years a tax 
deduction for health insurance premiums paid by farmers and other 
selfemployed people 
the committee voted to kill the 25 percent deduction earlier this 
year because of the cost of the 3yearold tax break 23 billion 
for the next five years 
however rep byron dorgan dnd won approval of an amendment 
thursday to extend the deduction for two years and make up for the 
lost revenue by limiting a tax break used by companies bought 
through leveraged buyouts 
the 25 percent tax deduction is very important to farmers and 
others on main street who are unincorporated dorgan said 
the amendment to a budget reconciliation bill was approved on a 
voice vote 
dorgan had originally proposed increasing the healthinsurance 
deduction to 100 percent 
a coalition of organizations as diverse as the american farm 
bureau federation the us chamber of commerce and amway contended 
it was unfair to allow corporations to deduct all their health 
insurance costs while selfemployed people can write off only a 
portion 
administration officials argued against extending the tax break 
saying it represented a significant revenue loss and doesnt 
provide sufficient incentive for uninsured selfemployed people to 
buy health policies 
rep dan rostenkowski dill dropped his opposition to the tax 
break when dorgan came up with a way to make up for the lost 
revenue about 600000 over the next two years 
dorgans amendment would prevent companies acquired in a 
leveraged buyout from going back to previous years and claiming 
operating losses because of their new higher interest payments 
dorgan says he expects the senate to approve extending the tax 
break 
sen dave durenberger rminn is sponsoring a similar proposal 
in the senate

egyptian president hosni mubaraks efforts to 
bring together palestinians and israelis for peace talks exposed 
political rifts within the israeli government thursday 
in violence stemming from the palestinian uprising israeli 
forces killed a suspected activist and reportedly wounded 25 
palestinians in clashes 
in separate interviews prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc and its leftofcenter coalition partner the 
labor party debated mubaraks plan 
shamir speaking in herzeliya urged the government to remain 
loyal toward its initiative for elections in the occupied west 
bank and the gaza strip 
the official israeli plan calls for elections in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip of palestinian representatives for talks 
with israel the 10point plan proposed by mubarak also urges 
elections but it differs by backing the idea of trading land for 
peace and by saying arabs in annexed east jerusalem should vote 
palestinians have so far rejected the official israeli 
initiative and us officials say mubaraks plan could help revive 
the stalled peace process 
in remarks thursday shamir said any free initiative within 
the israeli government could endanger its unity the national news 
agency itim reported 
he also scheduled a second government meeting friday on mubaraks 
proposals after a first session wednesday reportedly ended in 
division between his likud bloc and the labor party 
according to reports from cairo mubarak is trying to form a 
palestinian delegation acceptable to both israel and the palestine 
liberation organization israel considers the plo which is helping 
to organize the uprising a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate 
with its members 
the top labor leaders finance minister shimon peres and defense 
minister yitzhak rabin have said israel should support egypts 
efforts toward finding negotiators from the occupied territories 
labor parliament member benjamin beneliezer said on army radio 
thursday that shamirs plan and mubaraks move together can be a 
solid enough basis to start negotiations 
both israeli and palestinian hardliners attacked mubaraks plan 
thursday 
the islamic fundamentalist movement hamas or zeal said in a 
leaflet distributed in the occupied lands that the plan should be 
rejected as a usbacked initiative 
two leading members of likud industry minister ariel sharon and 
housing minister david levy criticized shamir and other top leaders 
for even discussing mubaraks proposal as an alternative to the 
israeli plan 
sharon told israel radio there is no other plan and there is 
no need for another plan 
in thursdays violence a 28yearold man wanted as an activist 
in the 21monthold palestinian uprising was shot and killed by 
israeli soldiers in the deir balah refugee camp in the occupied gaza 
strip 
the army said troops opened fire on the victim mohammed arafat 
alakra when he ignored orders to halt 
his death raised to 568 the number of palestinians killed in 
clashes with soldiers and israeli civilians in the revolt another 
114 palestinians were slain by fellow arabs as suspected 
collaborators with israel forty israelis also have been killed 
twentyfive other palestinians were shot and wounded thursday in 
clashes with soldiers in the occupied lands arab hospital officials 
said 
the army command only confirmed three injuries 
in jerusalem district court a palestinian accused of slaying 16 
jews by grabbing the steering wheel of a bus and forcing it into a 
ravine pleaded guilty to murder 
however abdel hadi ghanem 23 entered a plea of innocent to a 
separate charge that the crime was premeditated 
authorities say he was motivated by palestinian nationalism but 
he reportedly told investigators he was avenging a beating of a 
friend by soldiers 
the july 6 attack was the worst against jews in the palestinian 
uprising

the senate appropriations committee on thursday 
approved a 2882 billion military spending bill that slashes 
president bushs request for the troubled trident 2 missile and 
trims the budget for star wars 
without dissent the panel adopted legislation that eliminates 
all of the 18 billion for procurement of the missile but adds 70 
million to bushs request of 216 million for research and 
development of the submarinelaunched weapon 
the senate action comes almost one month after a trident 2 
missile exploded seconds after being launched from the nuclear 
submarine tennessee about 200 miles off the coast of florida 
members of the appropriations subcommittee on defense which 
recommended cutting the program said two successive failures in 
undersea test firings prompted the panels action 
it was an obvious necessity sen dale bumpers dark said 
earlier this week 
its time to regroup said sen ted stevens of alaska 
ranking republican on the subcommittee 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said thursday that the navy is 
not yet yet ready to cite the exact cause of the lastest test 
failure of the trident 2 d5 missile but it is expected to do so 
soon 
the navy is confident that technical resolution of the 
problem will not require a major redesign of the missile 
williams said adding that corrects may still make possible 
deployment on schedule in march 1990 
a delay williams said is not anticipated 
in addition to reducing funds earmarked for the trident 2 the 
appropriations committee agreed to cut research and development 
money for the star wars antimissile shield to 37 million which 
when added to the 355 million in energy department money and 
military construction funds leaves a total of about 41 billion 
bush had requested 49 billion for star wars formally the 
strategic defense initiative in his budget for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 the senate authorization bill put the sdi amount 
at 45 billion while the house authorization and appropriations 
legislation both provide 31 billion 
differences in the house and senate appropriations bills will 
have to be resolved by a conference committee 
while agreeing to the cut the appropriations committee also 
adopted an amendment requiring that 820 million of the 37 billion 
be used for research on lasers and particle beams the vote was 
1611 
the purpose and architecture of sdi has been a constantly 
changing ball game said sen bennett johnston dla sponsor of 
the amendment with this bill we will have spent over 20 billion 
on sdi still without a purpose still without an architecture 
johnston expressed concerns that the bush administration will 
sacrifice longterm research on directed energy weapons such as 
lasers and particle beams in favor of a quick fix or a phase 1 
deployment that would favor minimissiles fired at incoming enemy 
missiles along the lines of the socalled brillian pebbles 
scheme favored by many in the bush administration 
the spending bill which mirrors the authorization package 
approved by the full senate leaves most of bushs programs such as 
the b2 stealth bomber and the mx and midgetman nuclear missiles 
relatively intact 
the panel also approved 255 million for the marine corps to test 
the v22 osprey a verticaltakeoff plane and accepted the 
presidents decision to kill the navys f14d jet fighter 
after some discussion sens johnston and bumpers withdrew an 
amendment calling for bush to withdraw 3000 of the 43800 us 
military personnel now stationed in south korea and requiring the 
president to study and report to congress on troop levels there 
we are not reneging on our committment to defend south korea 
said bumpers arguing that south korea can afford to foot more of 
the bill for defense 
the appropriations panel also approved a 77 billion military 
construction bill that makes wholesale cuts in spending in the 
philippines and south korea 
the bill is 13 billion below this years level and about 300 
million less than bushs request

former hud secretary samuel pierce claiming he 
has not had time to prepare on thursday abruptly canceled his plans 
to testify before a house subcommittee investigating scandals at the 
agency he led for eight years 
i have fully and completely cooperated with the subcommittee 
right up until today but its refusal to allow me an additional two 
weeks preparation time when numerous other witnesses have been 
granted even longer postponements simply is unfair pierce said 
in a statement the day before his scheduled appearance 
he stressed that he is willing to testify voluntarily later 
one would think that common courtesy and basic fairness demand 
that the subcommittee grant to any citizen sufficient time to 
consult counsel and prepare testimony said pierce 
rep thomas lantos the subcommittee chairman characterized 
pierces dramatic decision not to appear as deceitful misleading 
and a betrayal of the good faith with which this subcommittee has 
dealt with him 
lantos said that if pierce did not appear friday he would ask the 
panel to issue a subpoena forcing him to appear procedural rules 
would prevent such a vote until next week and pierces lawyer said 
he hoped lantos would reconsider and simply agree to reschedule 
pierces appearance 
but a republican member of the subcommittee rep christopher 
shays of connecticut said the decision tells me hes got 
something to hide if he doesnt show up we are going to subpoena 
mr pierce for a series of hearings we obviously cant trust him 
pierce has emerged as the central figure in the subcommittees 
investigation of mismanagement and influence peddling at hud during 
the reagan administration 
the former secretary informed the panel last week that he had had 
trouble retaining legal counsel and requested a twoweek delay in 
his appearance but lantos who had previously agreed to push back 
pierces testimony by a month denied the request 
i initially delayed obtaining counsel because i believed the 
investigation was being conducted in a nonadversarial manner that 
did not require counsel pierce said in his statement after it 
became apparent that this situation had changed i undertook 
exhaustive efforts to local experienced counsel 
pierce last week settled on washington attorney paul perito who 
said in an interview thursday that he and his colleagues have not 
had enough time to weed through boxes of documents that pierce would 
need to review 
i did not think i could be a responsible lawyer if in fact we 
went forward friday perito said 
the subcommittee is eager to question pierce about a number of 
controversial decisions he made including his lifting restrictions 
on a lender after he was lobbied by former secretary carla hills and 
his overruling career experts in favor of financing a project backed 
by a former law partner 
several members including lantos have said they want to 
question pierce about contradictions in his testimony to the panel 
in may and the accounts of other former hud officials 
perito in a letter to lantos informing him of pierces decision 
said 
in order for mr pierce to be completely prepared the full 
record must be reviewed regrettably the subcommittees refusal 
to allow him an additional two weeks forced us to conclude 
reluctantly that continued voluntary cooperation does not afford him 
adequate procedural safeguards and guarantees of fairness for this 
reason among others he has authorized me to inform you that he 
will not voluntarily appear 
perito said the subcommittee has not informed pierce what 
portions of his may testimony are considered to be inconsistent 
this is of particular concern where as here there appears to 
be no separate legislative purpose for inquiring about 
inconsistencies other than to invite potential charges of 
perjury 
a few hours before pierce refused to appear lantos said he hoped 
the former secretary would use his testimony to accept blame for 
some of the agencys problems 
he has not yet said mea culpa mea maxima culpa i have made 
horrible mistakes lantos said 
obviously we have sworn testimony that contradicts secretary 
pierces sworn testimony lantos said 
fridays hearing was to focus on pierces decisions to back the 
north carolina project supported by a former law partner and the 
lifting of restrictions on the drg funding corp after being lobbied 
by mrs hills now the bush administration trade representative 
pierce had said he was not a handson manager and took no 
direct role in funding decisions 
a former deputy however later told congress that pierce 
personally ordered her to approve a 15 million durham nc 
housing project that was opposed by several career officials 
pierce in a time magazine interview published this week 
acknowledged overruling staff and ordering the project forward it 
was supported by charles markham then mayor of durham who practiced 
law with pierce in the 1960s 
drg the biggest lender under a departmental coinsurance 
program has a hud loan portfolio that includes more than 538 
million in defaults mrs hills met with pierce after her lobbying 
of other officials failed and he agreed to lift restrictions that 
required drg to get departmental approval before making any loans

climbed into a police car and sped away 
several rocks were hurled striking a police officer and a

present on the street can be charged with murder

4300student university financially secure 
dr larry edwards vice president for health affairs at the

medical and research center will be the first of many steps taken to 
shut the 777bed hospital 
the citys five other medical centers will have no problem 
handling the patient load from the city of faith which has never 
reached its stateapproved capacity of 294 and in absorbing its 600 
employees tulsa hospital officials said

more than a third of the millions of americans who 
suffer from serious sleep disturbances may also have psychiatric 
difficulties including depression and panic attacks a study 
indicates 
researchers who analyzed data on 7954 people found that 40 
percent of those with insomnia and 465 percent of those who sleep 
excessively a condition called hypersomnia also had psychiatric 
problmes 
psychiatric problems included major depression anxiety disorders 
such as phobias and panic attacks and alcohol abuse the researchers 
reported in fridays journal of the american medical association 
about 6 percent of the general adult population suffers from 
serious sleep disturbances the lead researcher dr daniel e ford 
of johns hopkins hospital in baltimore said in a telephone 
interview thursday ford was with the national institute of mental 
health which did the study 
ford said it was not always clear whether the psychiatric 
disorders caused the sleep disturbances or vice versa 
however followup interviews a year after the initial screeding 
indicated that subjects with sleep disorders were much more likely 
to develop new mental disorders especially depression than 
nonsleep disturbed subjects the researchers said 
for example people who had insomnia at both the first and second 
interviews were almost 40 times more likely to develop major 
depression than those who didnt the study found 
insomniacs also were more than six times as likely to develop 
anxiety disorders and more than twice as likely to start abusing 
alcohol as peaceful sleepers 
ultimately answering the question of which comes first will 
require an intervention trial in which you try to see if treating 
the sleep disorder reduces the number of people with anxiety or 
depression ford said 
the 7954 subjects were adults over 18 chosen from representative 
households in baltimore los angeles and durham nc of that 
number 102 percent were insomniacs and 32 percent had hypersomnia 
the researchers used a fairly severe definition of sleep 
disturbance ford said 
the disturbance must have been present for two or more weeks it 
must have prompted the subject to seek professional help or to take 
medication and it must have interfered with the subjects life a 
lot he said 
ford said the connection between sleep disorders and psychiatric 
disturbances isnt appreciated 
only about 30 percent of the people that had sleep disturbances 
that saw a general physician said they discussed their mental health 
condition he said 
an editorial accompanying the study in the journal agreed saying 
the high prevalence of psychiatric problems among people with sleep 
disorders was a surprising result 
the editorial written by dr charles f reynolds iii of the 
university of pittsburgh school of medicine commended the study as 
being probably one of the most scientifically rigorous of its 
type 
it is important because it may give doctors a new way to try to 
head off some psychiatric problems before they develop reynolds 
said 
he encouraged healthcare professionals to teach principles of 
sleep hygiene to people with sleep problems including keeping a 
daily log and adhering to a regular sleep schedule teaching 
patients how some medications can disrupt sleep and even training 
some insomniacs to limit their sleep hours to create a sleep 
deficit that will promote continuous sleep after they do doze off

the main opposition presidential 
candidate violetta barrios de chamorro said thursday that a 
sandinista cabinet member once offered to have her husbands 
suspected killers assassinated 
she told foreign reporters the incident involved interior 
minister tomas borge and took place while she was a member of the 
junta that took power after dictator anastasio somoza was overthrown 
in 1979 
the 1978 killing of la prensa newspaper publisher pedro joaquin 
chamorro by gunmen believed to be in somozas pay helped ignite the 
sandinista revolution 
tomas borge came to my house when i became part of the 
junta said mrs chamorro the presidential nominee of an 
opposition coalition of 14 parties taking part in elections next 
february 
he told me why dont you give me permission to assassinate 
all those boys referring to the suspects in chamorros killing 
i said look tomas i am not an assassin mrs chamorro 
said 
no immediate response came to mrs chamorros accusation 
thursday was independence day in nicaragua people who answered the 
telephone at the interior ministry press office said capt nelba 
blandon was the only person authorized to talk and was not in 
on other subjects mrs chamorro denied she was merely a front 
candidate for the opposition or that her newspaper publishes 
ciainspired articles she said demobilization of rebels fighting 
the government should be made along with democratization 
central americas five presidents signed a peace accord on aug 7 
that calls for the 12000man rebel force now in southern honduras 
near the nicaraguan border to be dismantled by middecember the 
rebels are known as contras 
in exchange president daniel ortega moved national elections up 
to feb 25 and promised that campaigning and voting will be free and 
fair with no restrictions on the press 
ortega will probably be the sandinista national liberation front 
candidate to face mrs chamorro publisher of the opposition 
newspaper la prensa 
mrs chamorro denied sandinista accusations that her newspaper 
recently published articles generated by the central intelligence 
agency we dont publish articles by the cia or by employees of 
the cia she said 
on the other hand i do see articles in barricada from the 
soviet union she added referring to the official sandinista 
party newspaper 
carlos fernando chamorro mrs chamorros son and director of 
barricada did not return repeated telephone calls from the 
associated press 
asked if she has forgiven her husbands killers she replied 
of course i do i am a catholic i dont hate i forgive 
three men and one women are serving prison terms for the

the senate ignoring an abortionrelated veto 
threat voted 5643 wednesday to provide more money to help the 
district of columbia fight a growing army of drug pushers and 
drugrelated violence 
the chamber acted after being told the overall 35 billion 
appropriations bill in which the money is contained is certain to be 
vetoed by president bush because it permits abortions 
this bill is dead sen gordon humphrey rnh one of the 
chambers leading opponents of abortion told the senate it may 
be warm but its not breathing its done for 
humphrey acknowleged that an amendment to deny the district the 
authority to use its own money for abortions likely would be 
rejected as it was when the house considered the appropriations 
measure in june 
he said he had decided not to try to remove abortion language 
from the bill in the belief that bush will veto the measure and 
that congress would not be able to muster the twothirds majorities 
needed to override it 
he predicted a new bill would be drafted with the offending 
language removed and would zip right through 
as it stands both house and senate versions of the bill for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 permit the district government to use 
local funds to pay for abortions the measures permit federal funds 
to be used when the life of the mother is threatened or in cases of 
rape or incest 
the bill includes 23 million to hire 700 new policemen 48

jim bakker authorized the 265000 payoff 
in ptl funds to jessica hahn to keep her quiet about their sexual 
tryst bakkers former top executive testified thursday 
richard dortch former ptl executive vice president said the 
television evangelist told him i have not raped anyone or 
assaulted anyone but there is a problem do what you have to do 
to get it solved 
dortch told us district court jurors at bakkers fraud and 
conspiracy trial that he told bakker about calls from ms hahn 
threatening a lawsuit over a 1980 sexual encounter she had with 
bakker in a florida hotel room 
earlier dortch testified that bakker oversold lifetime 
partnerships that had become the ministrys primary source of income 
used for operating expenses but did not build lodging as promised 
dortch who pleaded guilty in august to four fraud and conspiracy 
counts in a pleabargain exchange for his testimony against bakker 
said he paid ms hahn 2000 from his own pocket and later borrowed 
10000 from another ptl employee for ms hahn in 1984 
dortch arranged a february 1985 meeting in los angeles with ms 
hahns lawyer and handed over 265000 the money came from roe 
messner ptls contractor who later billed the ministry for work 
never completed on ptls passion play amphitheater 
after the los angeles meeting dortch said he saw bakker at 
heritage usas main street shopping arcade and told him about the 
payoff he testified bakker said i dont want to know and i dont 
want to hear about it 
during a meeting in palm springs calif dortch said bakker told 
him i hate to give them anything i hate to give them a dime 
he said he believed bakker when he said he hadnt assaulted ms hahn 
during the testimony bakker looked briefly at dortch but spent 
most of his time staring at papers dortch avoided eye contact with 
bakker except for one brief glance 
dortch earlier said bakker pushed the partnerships because he 
needed the money 
we had come to the point where the primary income to the 
ministry were the lifetime partnerships 
the trial included testimony from former partners who said they 
sent bakker 1000 for lodging but were turned away when they tried 
to claim their rooms 
dortch also said bakker knew daily the amount of money raised at 
all ptl operations and that only a few insiders knew the real 
financial and partnership figures 
dortch who was indicted for fraud and conspiracy along with 
bakker testified he first heard of the partnerships about three 
weeks after joining ptl in december 1983 ptl promoted 11 different 
partnership programs between 1984 and 1987 offering supporters four 
days and three nights of free lodging each year for life in exchange 
for 1000 
dortch also testified that he once asked bakker about salaries 
paid to ptl executives and bakker told him as long as he paid 
income taxes hed take whatever he needed 
dortch said he should have told the ptl board that the ministry 
couldnt afford the bonuses given the bakkers 
dortch released a week ago from a hospital where he was treated 
for an undisclosed ailment said he once objected to using the word 
investment in a brochure advertising the partnerships but 
bakker insisted on it to lure contributors 
bakkers secretary every day listed in a notebook contributions 
and the number of partnerships sold dortch testified during 
telethons to sell partnerships bakker was given the latest figures 
while on the air 
bakker and dortch on ptl television shows told viewers that a 
limit of 30000 partnerships would be sold but more than 65000 
eventually were sold from 1984 to 1987 prosecutors contend 
dortch said the ministry kept two sets of figures for the number 
of partnerships sold a secret set with the actual numbers and a 
second set of lower numbers to be used on the television show 
prosecutors contend bakker took for his own use nearly 4 million 
raised through partnership sales at ptls heritage usa theme park 
and religious retreat near fort mill sc if found guilty of the 24 
counts of fraud and conspiracy he could be sentenced to 120 years in 
prison and fined more than 5 million

colombia announced on thursday the arrest 
of two men wanted in the united states as cocaine traffickers and 
said they were in a highsecurity prison awaiting extradition 
the government also decreed a new state of emergency in two 
cities believed under the influence of drug lords sending an 
undisclosed number of military advisers officials say the area 
around puerto boyaca and pacho is a haven for cocaineprocessing 
laboratories and drug cartel terrorism 
gen miguel maza marquez head of the administrative security 
department and the man in charge of colombias antidrug war 
earlier described one of arrested men bernardo pelaez roldan as 
among the major drug figures in the medellin cartel 
maza said pelaez roldan was much bigger than eduardo martinez 
romero an economist who was flown to atlanta sept 6 martinez is 
charged there with money laundering for the medellin cartel one of 
the worlds largest cocaine organizations 
pelaez roldan and guillermo bueno delgado were paraded before 
news photographers thursday at the administrative security 
department colombias equivalent of the fbi where officials said 
they had been held since their arrests this week 
a department communique said pelaez roldan would be extradited to 
detroit where he is wanted for conspiracy and distribution of 
cocaine 
the justice department in washington said pelaez roldan was 
convicted of drug trafficking charges five years ago in detroit and 
faces 15 years in prison 
he was not however on the us drug enforcement 
administrations list of the 12 mostwanted colombian cocaine 
traffickers 
the associated press has learned that the justice department has 
a wanted list of 82 lesser colombian drug figures that has never 
been made public 
authorities said bueno delgado is wanted in tallahassee fla 
and san francisco for introducing 5740 kilos of cocaine 12628 
pounds and money laundering 
the communique said pelaez roldan was arrested wednesday north of 
bogota and bueno delgado was captured in cali on monday it gave no 
arrest details 
the department said the two were in a high security prison 
while legal extradition proceedings are under way and said us 
officials were notified of the arrests 
only photographers and no other members of the news media were 
allowed to view the men photographers said pelaez roldans forehead 
was gashed and that he threatened them with a walking stick 
diva rojas the departments press officer said reporters could 
not see the two for human rights reasons 
they dont want to talk and we have to respect that she 
said 
pelaez roldan was indicted in november 1983 on us charges of 
conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine justice 
department spokesman david runkel said in washington he was 
arrested in florida and taken before a us magistrate in detroit in 
january 1984 
the trial was set to begin that march but pelaez roldan was 
released on bond and never seen again said runkel 
pelaez roldan was tried in absentia and convicted in april 1984 
and a warrant for his arrest was issued a month later said frank 
shults of the dea 
us attorney stephen j markman in detroit said thursday that 
pelaez roldan skipped bail of 200000 
the case against pelaez roldan and more than two dozen 
codefendants involved a conspiracy that distributed 50 to 200 kilos 
110 to 440 pounds of cocaine per month in the detroit area from 
1975 to 1983 markman said 
he was the middleman for the medellin cartel and his part of the 
conspiracy involved more than 300 kilos 660 pounds of cocaine the 
prosecutor said 
in the process he earned over 6 million markman said 
president virgilio barco launched a major crackdown on colombias 
drug traffickers after sen luis carlos galan the leading 
presidential candidate was assassinated on aug 18 allegedly by 
drugbacked terrorists 
under special emergency powers barco announced he would 
extradite traffickers wanted in the united states by the 
administrative method this bypasses the courts traditionally 
slowmoving and subject to bribes and intimidation 
on thursday the minister of defense gen oscar botero restrepo 
called a news conference to deny recent reports of american troops 
in colombia to help in the drug war 
there are no foreign troops in colombia and we dont plan on 
having any the minister said 
he said there were 17 north american technicians helping 
colombians operate us military equipment including helicopters 
and planes that the bush administration donated in a 65 million 
aid package 
botero was responding to an open letter from former presidents 
misael pastana borrero and belisario betancourt published in 
colombian newspapers thursday it asked barco to respond to reports 
of us troops in the country 
the pentagon has said up to 200 military advisers could come to 
colombia to train and help operate the us equipment 
in another part of the crackdown barco evoked the state of 
emergency thursday in puerto boyaca and pacha cities in the 
magdalena medio region the measure allows him to send military 
personnel 
during the crackdown thousands of people were rounded up and 
millions of dollars worth of properties said to belong to drug 
dealers were confisccated 
the topechelon drug lords have escaped so far however they are 
apparently in hiding and authorities do not seem close to finding 
them a bounty of 250000 is out for pablo escobar and gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha said to be the top two bosses of the medellin 
cartel

senate leaders split over money for the war on 
drugs agreed thursday to fresh negotiations and drug coordinator 
william j bennett came under intensified fire from democrats upset 
with details of the plan 
the presidents plan is wholly inadequate senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine said he agreed to talks friday by 
a task force of nine members from each party in an effort to reach a 
compromise 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan threatened to freeze 
floor action on a dozen money bills unless fresh talks produced 
funds for the drug war 
in the house a democratic caucus broke up with a number of 
members cool toward a proposal to get an additional 22 billion for 
the 79 billion drug war by making a halfpercent acrosstheboard 
cut in federal programs but party leaders said they were ruling out 
nothing except a tax increase 
elsewhere the head of the federal bureau of prisons backed the 
concept of sending youthful drug offenders to boot campstyle 
shock incarceration but said more study was needed before 
carrying out the idea on the federal level 
dole met for much of thursday afternoon with bennett and the 
white house budget director richard darman dole told reporters 
afterward that republicans dont believe we should proceed with 
appropriations until this is done 
only one of the 13 annual money bills has gone to president 
bushs desk for his signature with the start of fiscal 1990 two 
weeks away republicans are in the minority in the senate but could 
still conceivably use senate rules to block action on the 
appropriations measures 
dole said republicans also would like to expand the negotiations 
to include such matters as bush administration anticrime 
legislation which he said has been resting in peace in the 
judiciary committee for months 
he named nine republican senators to take part in negotiations 
and said administration officials also would be available mitchell 
was attending a funeral and not immediately available for comment 
following a house democratic caucus rep charles rangel dny 
told reporters the concept of an acrosstheboard cut was being 
opposed because domestic programs have already been cut to the 
bone 
he said democrats would seek to find savings in other programs 
such as defense 
my constituents believe the drug war is more important than 
say the mission to mars or a couple of extra stealth bombers 
added rep ron wyden dore 
bennetts fireworks with lawmakers at a house government 
operations committee session were the first such eruption since he 
began lobbying lawmakers last week 
the explosion came as rep barbara boxer dcalif was preparing 
to ask about the administrations plan to finance the drug war by 
cutting existing programs such as juvenile justice grants 
if were critical she said its because there are some 
problem areas here that have to be discussed and i think if its 
healthy dialogue and debate today maybe we can resolve some of the 
problems 
it hasnt been healthy so far bennett said it has been 
petty and micromanagement i dont appreciate it 
in this committee sir or do you mean generally interrupted 
chairman john conyers dmich bennett sai he was referring to 
repeated questioning of his chief of staff john walters by rep 
glenn english dokla about the possible use of p3 radar planes 
in the skies over colombia to scout for airborne cocaine cargoes 
im sorry you feel that way about it mr bennett english 
said adding that he had been within his rights to question walters 
its the publics right english said its public 
information 
under repeated questioning from english walters said he could 
not now say whether he would recommend using the p3s he offered to 
brief english in private 
english told reporters the customs service has two of the 
radarequipped planes he said that a source he declined to name had 
told him the colombian government wants the planes used in the fight 
against the cartels 
he acknowledged that he had discussed the matter with a 
representative of a company involved in the p3 program but declined 
to name the company he said he understood sending the planes was 
being held up by a turf fight in the federal bureaucracy 
minutes after the exchange over the p3s bennett became 
embroiled in a sharply worded dispute with mrs boxer after she said 
california would face drastic cuts in its federal aid under the 
administration finaning plan 
i think this is the phoniest war that ive ever seen 
launched she said 
meanwhile bureau of prisons director j michael quinlan told a 
house judiciary subcommittee that more study is needed before 
implementing boot camptype punishment for youthful drug offenders 
at the federal level 
the success of these programs is yet undetermined quinlan 
said he did say that the administration backs the general concept 
but added that under a boot camp bill sponsored by rep charles 
schumer dny only 60 of the 50000 inmates in federal prisons 
would be eligible 
the bill calls for any ablebodied firsttime offender with a 
prison term of 12 to 16 months to be eligibile for the program each 
day in camp would count as four days in regular prison

the man who shot seven people to death and 
wounded 13 before killing himself at a printing plant thursday was a 
quiet hard worker whose forced leave for mental problems led to 
dreams of revenge former coworkers said 
he said before he left he would get even i remember that 
former coworker george oswine said after 47yearold joseph 
wesbeckers rampage at the standard gravure corp plant 
although friends and former coworkers who described him as quiet 
and hardworking police said wesbecker had been argumentative and 
confrontational for years and was being treated for mental disorders 
some people at standard gravure said hed become obsessed with 
guns over the past year he was carrying several semiautomatic 
weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition when the killing began 
thursday 
wesbeckers friend john tingle worked with him for 17 years at 
standard gravure before wesbecker was put on permanent disability 
two years ago 
he was always levelheaded funloving thrifty ive never 
known him to carry a gun or use a gun said tingle we always 
usually had a good laugh at work 
tingle said wesbecker became upset when management at standard 
gravure which prints magazines and newspaper inserts refused to 
accept a doctors recommendation that wesbecker stop operating 
machines that had caused him stress 
they forced him back to work but the doctor said he couldnt 
work the folder anymore that was too much stress and tension 
tingle said after a weeks hiatus wesbecker returned to work but 
management again told him he must continue in his former job 
thats when his mental problems began tingle said its 
terrible that they could push a man that far 
the episode left wesbecker with a big grudge oswine said 
standard gravure president michael shea said he did not know the 
reason wesbecker left the company and said personnel information on 
the man was unavailable 
after he went on disability wesbecker began collecting guns 
oswine said 
another former coworker joe white said conversations with 
wesbecker centered on guns and soldier of fortune magazine white 
said wesbecker thought of himself as a soldier and seemed obsessed 
with guns 
this guys been talking about this for a year white said 
i guess nobody believed him said don frazier president of 
the graphics union at the printing plant 
frazier said wesbecker had become more upset recently because he 
thought his disability benefits were about to be cut off 
police sgt carl yates said police knew little about wesbecker or 
where he obtained his guns a 9mm handgun an ak47 assault rifle 
two mac11 semiautomatic machine pistols a 38caliber revolver and 
a bayonet as well as the ammunition 
i wouldnt think it would be real difficult to obtain an 
ak47 yates said wesbecker did not have a police record or any 
record of military service yates said 
lt jeff moody said wesbecker had been treated for apparent 
mental disorders but did not have any specifics 
yates said wesbecker and his second wife brenda had two boys in 
their 20s but he did not know their names mrs wesbecker works at 
a louisville beauty school 
employees of roys academy of beauty inc declined to comment on 
the shootings or mrs wesbecker the phone at the wesbeckers 
residence has been disconnected and the family did not return home 
thursday night 
neighbors said wesbecker purchased the small splitlevel house in 
south louisville about three years ago for 56000 they said 
wesbecker kept to himself 
a neighbor paul danahy said he did not know wesbeckers name 
until he heard about the shootings and said he had only seen him 
once or twice while he was mowing the yard he described him as 
cocky and standoffish a hard guy to approach

egyptian tugboat crews and rescue teams on 
thursday refloated a cargo ship that ran aground and ended the 
danger of polluting the red sea or fragile coral reefs with oil or 
phosphate spills authorities said 
a small area of reefs was reported damaged 
red sea coral lines the shores of the sinai peninsula along the 
gulfs of aqaba and suez creating spectacular reefs that harbor 
rainbowcolored fish and attract tourists and divers 
the panamanianregistered sapphire glory was transporting 14700 
tons of phosphates from aqaba jordan to india when it rammed a 
reef early wednesday the crash tore a hole in an empty tank and 
partially submerged the 19279ton freighter 
no injuries were reported among the ships 24 crew most from 
south korea

spill caused slight damage to the corals and that the vessel damaged 
around 240 square yards of coral reef when it ran aground it was 
not immediately clear if rescue work did further damage 
an officer at the committee for oil pollution an environmental 
agency responsible for preserving egypts waters had said the reef 
was damaged in the accident but no phosphates or fuel leaked because 
the punctured tank was empty

a house committee on thursday approved 
legislation aimed at improving the prevention of oil and chemical 
spills and their handling when they do occur in coastal and inland 
waters 
the measure endorsed by the merchant marine and fisheries 
committee requires the maintenance of seven cleanup response teams 
around the country and makes it easier for the federal government 
to take over cleanups 
it would also mandate the establishment of a computerized 
inventory of cleanup resources around the world 
the legislation was written as a response to the exxon valdez 
disaster in alaskas prince william sound six months ago and was 
approved one day before exxon is supposed to wind up its cleanup 
efforts in alaska 
environmentalists complained that the bill did not go far enough 
the sierra club said it hoped backers could add a provision on the 
house floor giving states the right to impose tougher standards than 
the federal government 
the exxon valdez disaster in which 11 million gallons of crude 
oil were spilled prompted many members to introduce bills of various 
kinds and the measure sent to the house floor on thursday was a 
distillation of many of them 
the senate has approved its own version of oil spill legislation 
and if the house passes a bill the two versions will have to be 
reconciled 
the merchant marine committee earlier this year approved a bill 
that would among other things give the federal government power to 
determine damages to be paid by those responsible for spills 
thursdays bill has provisions aimed at 
increasing the ability of the coast guard to uncover alcohol and 
drug abuse by permitting the use of information in the national 
driver register in licensing mariners the captain of the exxon 
valdez had been drinking and was not on the bridge when his ship ran 
aground 
states could require the use of their own pilots in state waters 
if the federally licensed pilot aboard were not specifically 
qualified for those waters 
evaluating the staffing training qualification and 
watchkeeping standards of foreign tankers 
requiring vessels to maintain cleanup plans that are consistent 
with the current national cleanup plan 
increasing penalties for spills 
the coast guard receives reports on about 7500 oil spills every 
year most of them small but about 200 requiring a federal takeover 
of the cleanup effort

president quett masire of botswana said 
thursday that industrial nations can help relieve drought and hunger 
in africa by reducing global warming caused by the greenhouse effect 
masire and dr bernard ledea ouedraogo an antihunger organizer 
in burkina faso were honored as cowinners of the 1988 africa prize 
for leadership for their efforts in averting hunger 
a severe drought gripped much of africa from 1981 to 1987 
killing millions experts believe that due to the organizing efforts 
of masires government not one person died of droughtinduced 
famine in botswana 
through early planning botswana organized a nutritional 
surveillance and warning system and distributed food nationwide 
by the time the drought ended malnutrition had actually 
declined before the drought 25 percent of botswanas children were 
underweight by 1987 that fell to 15 percent 
in his acceptance speech masire thanked western donor 
governments and private agencies for their help during the drought 
but suggested drought and hunger will get worse in africa if the 
earths climate keeps warming 
the semiarid tropics will have even greater climatic 
variability as the warming continues he said 
the industrialized countries may do more for africa in the long 
run by helping to reduce global warming than by supplying shortterm 
aid however welcome that is at the time 
we would prefer to prevent droughts altogether rather than have 
to learn to deal with them well 
the warming of the earth and its lower atmosphere is caused by 
trapped solar radiation 
the other africa prizewinner ouedraogo has organized about 
500000 peasants in nine countries in africa to develop their 
villages based on traditional cooperative village leadership 
the villagers in burkina faso chad gambia guineabissau mali 
mauritania niger senegal and togo raise vegetables learn new 
farming techniques improve literacy fight erosion replant 
forests build roads and improve health care 
the africa prize consists of 100000 and a statue awarded by 
the new yorkbased hunger project 
ouedraogo said he will ask the peasant farmers he has organized 
how they would like to use his share of the prize 
masire also said he would distribute his share of the award to 
grassroots organizers and villagers who made botswanas victory 
over famine possible

lebanons ambassador said thursday night us 
diplomatic inaction is giving syria a green light to occupy his 
country completely 
he said us assertions of support for lebanons independence and 
calls for the departure of foreign troops are no substitute for a 
vigorous policy 
syria is enforcing its hegemony over lebanon ambassador 
abdallah bouhabib said in a speech its very clear 
lebanon is torn by 14 years of civil war between christian forces 
and moslems backed by neighboring syria earlier this month calling 
the situation in beirut too dangerous us ambassador john mccarthy 
and his entire american staff departed 
abandonment of the us embassy was described by the state 
department as temporary but the american diplomats already are 
being reassigned to other posts 
syria whose troops have been in lebanon since 1975 controls the 
bekka valley and parts of beirut iraniancontrolled allies 
believed to be holding american hostages are strong in other areas 
while israeli forces occupy a security buffer in the south 
the lack of a concerted effort to solve the situation has made 
everyone concerned believe that the united states has no policy at 
all bouhabib said 
he contrasted us inaction in lebanon with us emphasis on 
human rights in other countries and assertions by president bush he 
will try to end the countrys suffering 
in lebanon it seems we have even less no rights bouhabib 
said 
more than 150000 lebanese have died in the war and 250000 have 
been wounded 
in the case of lebanon what is us policy the ambassador 
asked us policy means at the present time a green light that 
the syrians can do whatever they want in lebanon 
he stressed he was not asking for us military intervention or 
assistance we are simply calling for concentrated diplomatic 
action by the administraion and congress to bring pressure on the 
parties to end the destruction and tragedy the end the 
strangulation of the lebanese people the ambassador said 
bouhabib said us inaction could establish a dangerous precedent 
for small and defenseless nations elsewhere

a man with an assault rifle mowed down 
coworkers as he went from floor to floor looking for bosses at 
a printing plant thursday killing seven people and wounding 13 
before taking his own life 
police said joseph t wesbecker 47 had been on permanent 
disability was being treated for mental disorders and reportedly 
had threatened the company he carried several semiautomatic weapons 
and thousands of rounds of ammunition 
i told them id be back get out of my way john i told them 
id be back the gunman told fellow standard gravure corp 
employee john tingle who approached him before the 30minute 
shooting rampage began 
i said how are you rock tingle recalled he said 
fine john back off and get out of the way all the way to the 
wall 
tingle and other employees nearby then ran into a bathroom and 
locked the door 
police searched every floor of the threestory standard gravure 
building for victims two were found as officers led mayor jerry 
abramson through the building adjacent to the courierjournal 
newspaper 
we also found a fellow sitting in a corner that was just 
shuddering in fear abramson said he hadnt been shot but he 
was in shock 
five of the wounded initially were listed in critical condition 
with multiple gunshot wounds authorities said but two were 
upgraded to serious condition late thursday one person who was not 
wounded suffered a heart attack and was taken to nearby jewish 
hospital 
it looks like a battle zone with the blood and the people 
involved there abramson said there were bodies lying across 
staircases it was just frightening 
more than 100 doctors were called in to help treat the wounded 
said dr frank miller codirector at humana hospitaluniversity of 
louisville 
bone specialist dr david seligson said he had not seen such 
injuries since the vietnam war in 1970 and today brings that all 
back 
at 830 am wesbecker entered the building with a duffel bag 
an ak47 semiautomatic rifle two mac11 semiautomatic machine 
pistols a 38caliber handgun a 9mm automatic and a bayonet 
police chief richard dotson said 
he was loaded for bear dotson said it was unclear how many 
shots he fired from the ak47 the same type of gun used by a man 
who killed five school children in stockton calif in january 
at least four of the guns were purchased in kentucky said 
bill curley head of the louisville office of the us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms curley could not identify the sellers 
wesbecker took an elevator to thirdfloor offices pulled the 
rifle out of his bag and opened fire police and witnesses said 
he was up there looking for bosses tingle said he 
couldnt find none of the bosses and couldnt find none of the 
supervisors he was just in too deep to turn back so he just shot 
anything that was close to him 
wesbecker worked his way downstairs shooting people along the 
way 
he didnt fire randomly he was definitely doing some damage 
maj ed mercer said 
wesbecker eventually ended up in a pressroom in an annex where 
he killed himself with a shot under his chin dotson said 
i thought it was firecrackers going off said bud graser a 
pressman when i saw what it was i turned around and told 
everybody to get out of there 
ed green a supervisor in the plants etching room said he heard 
at least 20 shots i seen two victims and then i got out 
green said 
a police officer who knew wesbecker told dotson the man had been 
argumentative and confrontational for a number of years 
this guys been talking about this for a year said joe 
white a standard gravure employee hes been talking about guns 
and soldier of fortune magazine hes paranoid and he thought 
everyone was after him 
wesbecker had been on permanent disability dotson said 
he reportedly had made threats against the company which prints 
newspaper inserts and sunday newspaper supplements but standard 
gravure president michael shea said he did not know of any threats 
or the nature of wesbeckers disability 
im at a loss to speculate on anything shea said whats 
going through my mind right now is sympathy and caring for the 
people who are involved 
the gunman was found facedown in a pool of blood on the floor of 
a pressroom the pistol was discovered under his body and the rifle 
was a few feet away 
dotson said his officers had come close but not that close 
to apprehending wesbecker 
a woman who answered the telephone at a house where wesbeckers 
mother was staying said the family did not want to comment 
were just in shock like everybody else we had to find out 
over the television no one called us said the woman who did not 
identify herself i guess he was just a sick person thats all 
the newspaper building was evacuated after the shootings at 
least two downtown blocks were sealed off and a dozen ambulances 
lined the streets 
it was the worst oneday mass killing in the united states since 
aug 20 1986 when a postal worker shot 14 people to death before 
killing himself at a post office in edmond okla 
on jan 17 a 24yearold drifter opened fire on a stockton 
calif schoolyard with an ak47 rifle and other weapons killing 
five children and wounding 29 others and one teacher before killing 
himself that prompted a federal ban on imports of ak47 and other 
foreignmade assault weapons 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen asked how thursdays shooting 
reflected on president bushs policy of banning imports but not 
domestic semiautomatics said theres got to be an end to these 
tragic incidents and weve got to work towards assuring these 
weapons arent falling into the wrong hands

senate democrats are ready to work with 
republicans toward a compromise antidrug program but say theyll 
hold out for something close to their 10 billion plan that 
president bush threatened to veto 
the presidents plan is wholly inadequate said senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine adding that the white 
house is failing in its effort to paint the democrats as big taxers 
and spenders for wanting to do more 
the democrats who hold a 5545 majority in the senate united 
wednesday behind a proposal by sen robert byrd dwva to expand 
bushs 79 billion drug program by 22 billion with more money 
for drug education and treatment programs 
mitchell contended the white houses quick threat of a veto for 
the democratic plan and its claim that democrats just want to raise 
taxes show that the administration knows its plan is in trouble

asked how much money the 
soviet union has set aside for its space shuttle and other payloads 
for its new superbooster the rockets designer dug into his pocket 
and pulled out a handful of coins 
boris i gubanov a grayhaired man of 59 was joking in fact 
the government is spending 21 billion a year on the energia 
booster rocket and the shuttle buran it carries into orbit but 
beyond the mirth gubanov and other soviet space officials are under 
pressure to economize and are facing serious criticism not unlike 
that faced by the us national aeronautics and space administration 
and its shuttle program 
we have stubbornly continued spending money on this hopeless 
affair konstantin p feoktistov an engineer and former 
cosmonaut said of the soviet shuttle at a recent roundtable 
discussion in moscow 
when the gleaming white and black buran russian for 
snowstorm soared into orbit for the first time last fall 
president mikhail s gorbachev hailed it as one more confirmation 
of the kind of huge possibilities the soviet union has to solve any 
problem 
perhaps just as important burans pilotless remotecontrolled 
flight and return to earth proved that the soviets were still very 
much in the space race with the americans 
but feoktistov in remarks reported by the weekly moscow news 
said none of the technology developed for the shuttle has yet been 
applied to improve the lives of the soviet people and that launches 
of cargoes by the buran will be 20 to 40 times more expensive than 
by expendable rockets 
roald z sagdeyev a space scientist and member of the supreme 
soviet parliament said the soviet union developed a shuttle 
solely as a symmetrical reply to the us version even though 
officials knew it was not really needed 
he told the roundtable the program that resulted in a lookalike 
soviet version of the us shuttle was the last refuge of 
windowdressers 
the attacks fueled by chronic problems in the soviet economy 
were targeted at a space program that had long been a sacred cow 
the cosmos had been a source of national euphoria and pride ever 
since the soviet union ushered in the space age in 1957 with the 
launch of sputnik the first manmade object put into orbit 
the mounting criticism has already forced cuts and delays in the 
soviet shuttle program which began in 1976 and culminated in the 
first and only flight of the buran in november space officials 
spoke initially of launching the shuttle again in 1990 building a 
fleet of five or six and launching 10 by 1997 
now they say the next flight wont take place until 1991 that 
only three shuttles will be built and that only five missions will 
be conducted through 1995 
the whalesized energia the worlds most powerful rocket booster 
that flew a test mission in 1987 and propelled buran into orbit has 
also suffered cutbacks 
gubanov its chief designer told reporters who recently visited 
the baikonur cosmodrome 1560 miles southeast of moscow that five or 
six of the rockets could be produced annually but that he only has 
enough money for one a year 
gubanov and other project officials are countering the criticism 
with a public relations campaign to put the best face on the 
cutbacks and point out the programs benefits 
the energia designer told a moscow news conference in august the 
project had come up with 600 innovations that can be applied in the 
economy and that within the next 10 years the value of such 
spinoffs could reach 20 billion rubles 32 billion 
other officials defended the long waits for the next shuttle 
flights a 1991 unmanned mission to dock with the orbiting space 
station mir and the first piloted flight in 1992 
we dont plan to launch several times a year like the 
americans yuri p semenov the chief soviet spacecraft designer 
told a recent news conference in leninsk the city near baikonur 
where space center workers live they do this for business out of 
necessity we dont have such a need 
the veteran cosmonaut alexei a leonov who flew aboard a soyuz 
capsule that linked up with the us apollo spacecraft in 1975 has 
said people shouldnt be surprised that soviet officials are moving 
ahead cautiously with the shuttle 
we must have comfortable deadlines which dont force us to 
rush said leonov who now works in the star city cosmonaut 
training center near moscow 
at baikonur there are few signs that work on energia and the 
shuttles has slowed new launch pads assembly buildings and a 
runway have become part of the landscape and gubanov said 10000 
workers are involved in the project at the sprawling spaceport alone 
in the hangar where energia is assembled one rocket booster is 
being prepared for a test flight next year without the shuttle but 
with a payload still to be determined 
the buran meanwhile sits in a huge hangar where it is being 
analyzed following its flight the doors to the shuttles payload 
bay are open and specialists are removing some of the 40000 
delicate and expensive heatshielding tiles to inspect the skin 
underneath a second shuttle is being assembled in another section 
of the hangar 
soviet officials have said the shuttles tasks will include 
transporting repairmen to space to repair satellites and for 
rescuing crews stranded aboard space stations 
but the supreme soviet could put the shuttle under renewed 
scrutiny and gubanov said he is worried even further cuts might come

in the shadow of the launch pad from 
which man first entered the cosmos meat and butter are rationed and 
concrete crumbles from prefabricated buildings 
this is not cape canaveral said vladimir a shatalov head 
of soviet cosmonaut training who has visited the us spaceport in 
florida 
while leninsk may not by up to cape canaverals standards and 
food now is rationed the people who live here and work at the 
nearby baikonur cosmodrome are generally better off than most other 
soviets 
leninsk was built in 1955 on the kazakhstan desert in soviet asia 
1560 miles southeast of moscow as the bedroom for the cosmodrome 
from which the soviet union launches satellites interplantetary 
space probes manned space ships and its new space shuttle 
the land is flat and dry with little vegetation strong desert 
winds blow sand off the hard earth spewing dust on everything 
residents say temperatures can reach 115 degrees in the shade 
but the region is ideal for a spaceport the sky is generally 
cloudless and theres nothing for hundreds of miles around making 
it ideal for safety and security 
leninsks population of 75000 is growing steadily as more 
specialists arrive to work on the fledgling buran space shuttle 
which was tested in an unmanned flight last november most live in 
ninestory prefabricated apartment buildings like those found 
throughout the country 
the theme in leninsk is space 
the sole movie theater is the saturn children climb through 
miniature rockets in playgrounds and spacerelated banners and 
monuments are scattered throughout the city one colorful tile 
mosaic on the main road leading into the city features the orbiting 
space station mir and boasts the ussr is the homeland of 
cosmonautics 
but larisa i konovalenko a local tv commentator had a question 
for lt gen igor i kurinny the head of the leninsk political 
department at a news conference 
why is there such a big gulf between the high technology used 
for space and the social conditions of the city of leninsk 
kurunny replied it cannot be denied that such differences 
truly exist between the social aspects of the city and the 
technology with which were conquering space 
but he added that the communist party and government approved a 
plan early last year to build new housing schools a hospital 
maternity home and cultural and recreational facilities 
a modern pedestrian mall downtown was built this year and 11 new 
apartment buildings have been put up but kurinny said things are 
going slowly because of a shortage of construction workers 
a group of teenagers sitting on a park bench near a monument to 
baikonur workers killed in a 1960 accident said rationing of meat 
sugar butter and laundry detergent began in the city two months 
ago later than most of the country even so they added it came as 
a blow to leninsks people because they were so accustomed to buying 
food and consumer goods without difficulty 
one of the teenagers identifying himself as vitaly said 
residents now joke that leninsks trademark had become lines in 
stores open pipes and puddles indeed steam pipes line the 
sidewalks and puddles seem to appear from nowhere despite the arid 
climate 
vitaly and his friends artur and natasha even talked about their 
fathers work once a taboo subject 
salaries in leninsk run 300 to 600 rubles 480 to 960 a month 
compared to about 230 rubles 370 for the average worker 
nationwide 
vitaly artur and natasha said they attend technical schools and 
hope to stay in leninsk even though they are often bored 
then they headed off to a disco in a local park

the bloody crackdown on dissent in china has made 
many residents of this casinorich portuguese enclave increasingly 
reluctant to bet on a future here with the communist chinese 
takeover a decade away 
community leaders say the suppression of the mayjune democracy 
movement in beijing has increased fears of what might be in store 
for macao a reaction also experienced in the nearby british colony 
of hong kong which reverts to china in 1997 
we are exactly in the same situation as is hong kong said 
legislative assembly member alexandre ho the confidence crisis 
has worsened 
portugal agreed in 1987 to return this six squaremile enclave of 
about half a million people almost 97 percent of whom are ethnic 
chinese to china in 1999 beijing promised macao as it did with 
hong kong that it could maintain its capitalist system for 50 
years and enjoy a high degree of autonomy 
macao residents joined their hong kong brethren in 
enthusiastically supporting the studentled democracy movement in 
china 
on june 4 when reports on the chinese military suppression of 
the movement in beijing began to reach macao an estimated 
onefourth of the territorys population streamed into the narrow 
streets to denounce chinas leaders 
in both colonies the crackdown led to plunging property markets 
and increased interest in emigration 
we know many of our friends are preparing to leave said 
legislator ho press reports in lisbon say wealthy macao residents 
are depositing more personal wealth in portugal 
but the trauma in macao appears not as great as it is in hong 
kong in part because many people in macao can find new homes before 
1999 with their portuguese passports 
although the more than 3 million hong kong residents are eligible 
for british passports they have no right to settle in britain they 
have bitterly denounced prime minister margaret thatchers 
government in london for refusing to change that policy after the 
chinese crackdown 
but the 100000 or so macao residents with portuguese passports 
not only have full rights to live in portugal but expect to be able 
to settle almost anywhere in western europe including britain 
after the european economic community removes trade and other 
barriers by the end of 1992 
ho believes that perhaps a quarter of portuguese passport holders 
in macao will leave many of those who stay will do so because they 
have no language skills no work skills and no capital to start a 
new life he said 
the assemblyman says he has yet to decide whether he will use his 
portuguese passport to emigrate but acknowledges the crackdown in 
china makes me less comfortable 
another man yet to make a final decision is stanley ho who has 
made a fortune leading the monopoly that runs macaos six gambling 
casinos 
he said he plans to watch carefully what happens to hong kong 
after china takes over in 1997 
if it doesnt work you may see me in san francisco or 
canada or europe he said if its going to be difficult 
inconvenient ill have to say cheerio 
such a breezy response is not possible for the 400000 macao 
residents without portuguese passports many of whom are recent 
immigrants from china and do not have the money education or family 
connections to obtain residency rights in other countries 
their chances to emigrate appear dim and the portuguese 
government is not considering helping them leave 
settled in 1557 as the first european foothold in asia macao 
once was a major colonial trading center but long ago was surpassed 
by hong kong just 40 miles to the northeast 
politically beijings influence in macao has grown in recent 
decades in 1967 the territory agreed to deport to china 
anticommunist troublemakers most local business and civic leaders 
support the chinese government while the media except for a few 
weeks during the democracy movement generally toe the official 
beijing line 
economically the casinos and light industry remain the mainstay 
ive served more than 10 governors said stanley ho who has 
the gambling monopoly through 2001 each and every one of them 
tried to rely less on gambling i think none of them have succeeded 
the gambling revenue in macao is very important 
he added that he has received personal assurances from china that 
gambling will be allowed after 1999 
in an effort to help the territorys fortunes ho has joined 
forces with the macao government and china to build an offshore 
international airport the 450million first phase is scheduled for 
completion in 1993 other major construction projects include a 
deepwater harbor 
while some people say the airport will not attract enough 
business to be viable others say it is essential to attract foreign 
investment and bring more tourists to the territory 
but bishop domingos lam who heads the 27000member roman 
catholic church in macao sees no end to what he describes as the 
historical tendency of local residents to move elsewhere in search 
of a brigher future the recent events in china he said have only 
quickened the process 
those who have qualifications go out those who dont have 
qualifications stay he said 
the old generation of macao has already moved out take my 
family for instance im left alone to look after the graves 
im the only lam left in macao

only the muddy mouth of the slowmoving pearl river 
separates macao from hong kong but the portuguese and british 
enclaves in southern china seem worlds apart 
what little the two territories have in common largely is 
historical 
both were settled by great european trading nations macao by 
portugal in the mid16th century and hong kong by britain three 
centuries later but their populations have remained overwhelmingly 
chinese 
with the colonial era long over both enclaves are to be returned 
to china by the end of the century under a one country two 
systems policy that will allow them to remain capitalist for an 
additional 50 years 
but while hong kong has become one of the most dynamic cities of 
the late 20th century a center of trade light industry and 
finance macao some 40 miles to the southwest is known for little 
more than its six gambling casinos where supremely bored croupiers 
preside over a wide variety of chinese and western games of chance 
here are some other contrasts 
harbors hong kongs is filled with huge oceangoing cargo 
vessels and a sprinkling of luxury liners macaos is filled with 
silt the british colony claims it is the leading container port in 
the world in terms of cargo handled macao claims it will soon 
complete a deepwater port but for the time being its waters are 
home only to a group of small junks 
architecture hong kongs downtown is filled with modernistic 
skyscrapers the newest addition is the prismlike im 
peidesigned bank of china building a towering 1221foot 
structure most colonial era buildings have fallen to the wrecking 
ball macaos waterfront includes a smattering of new office 
complexes and hotels but the territory retains an old world flavor 
decaying colonialera buildings with colonnades and tattered 
shutters can be found on many streets the pink green and yellow 
pastels slowly fading 
a day at the races in hong kong horse racing is an obsession 
up to 70000 people crowd one of the two tracks every race day while 
countless others invade 129 offtrack betting centers a typical 
daily turnover last season was about 50 million in macao racing 
is done by dogs greyhounds several hundred people meander into 
the aging canidrome on race day but the opportunity to bet on

consumer champion stephen gardner is one of the 
lucky ones living out his high school idealism 20 years later in 
professional life 
im having so much fun its a lot of work but this is what i 
wanted to do in high school said the 38yearold gardner an 
assistant texas attorney general 
gardners fun frequently gives manufacturers fits especially if 
he believes their advertising or other trade practices violate 
texas consumer protection law 
his targets come from his own observations i drive my wife 
crazy i watch television commercials or from complaints 
culled from the hundreds his office receives monthly or from 
suggestions by consumer protection groups 
beyond texas gardner has pulled together attorney general 
offices from nine other states to fill in what he says are gaps in 
federal enforcement of consumer protection or truthinadvertising 
laws 
the confederation is backdoor national regulation he said 
its a federal chore but the feds arent doing it 
the federal trade commission is looking for a way not to 
protect consumers he said in an interview at his dallas office 
which includes a corner bookcase filled with memorabilia from past 
cases cereal boxes baby formula an auto parts guide 
the 18monthold collaboration has led to lawsuits or 
investigations involving quaker oats co sara lee corp kellogg 
co chrysler corp credit reporter chilton corp and citicorp 
among others 
in texas there also have been cases made against a man selling 
weedkiller in pill form as a weightloss aid and an antiabortion 
group advertising its services as an abortion clinic 
all the companies have denied the charges but gardner says 
weve got what we wanted in almost every instance 
the latest action came sept 7 when texas attorney general jim 
mattox filed suit against quaker oats charging the company with 
making false claims in advertising its hot cereal the move came 
just days after sara lee had agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by 
the confederation over claims its light products actually had 
more calories that regular products 
although the quaker suit is filed under mattox name it will be 
gardner handling the case just as he has previous highprofile 
lawsuits 
he gardner just loves getting after these big companies 
said mattox spokesman ron dusek he likes to play it real low key 
when in fact hes a real hot shot 
this is a case i developed and i believe in and i sold 
mattox on gardner said of the quaker suit mattox encourages 
us to do what we need to do to protect the public requiring only 
if you think the law is on your side do it 
gardner agrees there are political overtones to his work mattox 
is a likely democratic gubernatorial candidate but says those 
issues do not affect his decisions 
in the quaker case there was some discussion about the impact on 
mattoxs political plans he said but we decided that shouldnt 
be the basis of enforcing the law 
although he lived in a middle class north dallas suburb 
gardners father and grandfather both were police chiefs in the 
hightone dallas enclave of highland park 
we were help he said and his father raised me not to 
believe that making money was the thing to do 
while still in high school he decided to be a lawyer to help 
empower the people after graduating from the university of 
texas law school in 1975 he remained in austin until 1982 first as 
a legal services lawyer and then the students attorney for the 
university 
in 1982 he left texas for new york city where he honed his 
interest in consumer cases as an assistant attorney general he 
returned to texas in 1984 to head mattoxs dallas office 
then last year he instigated the cooperation of states on 
consumer protection issues during a meeting of the national 
association of attorneys general the group began with seven or 
eight states and now has 10 on board besides texas they are 
california iowa minnesota wisconsin missouri illinois florida 
new york and massachusetts 
the attorneys general who support the collaboration are 
everywhere across the political spectrum he said from reagan 
conservatives to liberal democrats 
there is no leader of the group gardner said with different 
states taking the lead on different issues in the quaker case for 
example the investigation began last year with a letter from the 
minnesota attorney general 
the cooperation allows for greater efficiency he said while at 
the same time it is a bigger hammer 
gardners logic is not necessarily accepted by manufacturers 
we feel that the actions of mr gardner and his group are 
most inappropriate said thomas howell jr vice president and 
general counsel of quaker oats the groups latest target 
a recent blueribbon task force of attorneys observed that 
state attorneys general do not belong in national advertising 
matters howell said adding that the lawsuit appeared to be 
primarily motivated by the personal ambitions of mattox and 
gardner 
gardner is sensitive to the possible criticism he is using the 
law to impose his own personal agenda but said i have the duty 
as a state official to enforce the law 
plus he said any actions by the texas attorney general or the 
other nine states are not the work of one person but are shaped by 
various officials at many levels 
there are investigations that are begun but are ended when the 
advertising claims hold up to closer scrutiny 
as for the future gardner said itd be fun to run for office 
but i dont have the money to run for any office id have

in a billion years when drifting 
continents have reshaped earths face and humans are extinct or 
changed by evolution voyager 2 will still be cruising the stars 
its mindboggling were actually going out to the stars 
said bruce brymer voyagers lead mission controller at nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory this spacecraft is going to outlive us 
its going to be out there forever 
in august voyager 2 swept past neptune and its icy volcanic moon 
triton the last planetary exploration in an incredible 12year 
journey that also took the spacecraft past jupiter saturn uranus 
and more than 50 moons 
now voyager 2 is speeding into the loneliest part of its trek 
the voyager interstellar mission with voyager 1 it will study the 
suns magnetic field solar wind and ultraviolet light from distant 
stars and galaxies 
like pioneers 10 and 11 and voyager 1 which explored jupiter and 
saturn voyager 2 also will search for the edge of the solar system 
the voyagers are expected to return information to earth until 
about 2015 or 2020 contact eventually will be cut off by some 
malfunction by exhaustion of the probes plutonium power 
generators or when their thruster fuel runs out leaving them 
unable to point antennas at earth 
then the robot explorers will pass among the stars each 
carrying a 12inch copper record of sounds and sights from earth in 
case they are found by a spacefaring civilization hopefully they 
will understand our peaceful and humble attempt at knowing and 
exploring the great unknown brymer said 
for now voyager 2s work is more mundane 
the interstellar mission is sort of anticlimactic theres no 
real drama expected were suffering from the blues a little bit 
he said its almost like postpartum depression weve gone 
through such highs with the spacecraft theres a great sense of 
melancholy now its like none ive sensed before 
voyager 2s encounter with neptune officially ends oct 2 when 
it will be 347 million miles past the planet going 37337 mph it 
will be 283 billion miles from earth and will have traveled 446 
billion miles since 1977 
until december voyager 2 occasionally will glance at neptune and 
dark space to improve the accuracy of observations its cameras and 
instruments made during the neptune flyby said voyager project 
manager norm haynes 
pictures of empty space let engineers measure how much sunlight 
reflects off voyager into its cameras a computer can subtract the 
light from voyagers neptune and triton photographs producing 
clearer prints haynes said 
in april most of the planets will be positioned for one of the 
voyagers to take photographs for assembly into a single picture of 
the solar system the planets are small and theres lots of dark 
space out there he said maybe it will give people a better 
impression of the vastness of things 
then engineers will turn off voyager 2s tv cameras and its 
infrared and visible light sensors 
voyagers interstellar mission officially starts jan 1 but the 
spacecraft already is using its remaining sensors to make the kind 
of measurements it will continue to collect for years ultraviolet 
light and cosmic ray sensors study distant galaxies and stars and 
also black holes and pulsars remnants of stars that died in fiery 
supernova explosions 
both voyagers also will keep measuring magnetic fields 
electrically charged particles that make up solar wind and waves in 
that wind 
if the voyagers and pioneers survive one or more of them may 
detect the heliopause where solar wind yields to interstellar 
wind some 5 billion to 14 billion miles from the sun many 
scientists consider it the edge of the solar system 
by about 2020 the voyagers will lose contact with earth 
my electrical energy is fading and i am feeling old and 
useless says voyager 2s imaginary voice in the voyager neptune 
travel guide a national aeronautics and space administration 
publication the planet which gave me life said goodbye i will no 
longer hear its voice nor it my heartbeat 
then voyager will approach the stars passing them like distant 
beacons in an incredible void 
in the year 20391 voyager will pass within 321 light years 
189 trillion miles of proxima centauri the nearest star some 
24000 years from now it should pass through the oort cloud a vast 
spherical cloud of comets that other scientists consider the true 
edge of the solar system 
then voyager makes for the open sea of interstellar space free 
of the suns gravity and wandering forever in the milky way galaxy 
going once around the center of the galaxy once every 
quarterbillion years said cornell university astronomer carl 
sagan 
nasa estimates that in the year 40176 voyager 2 will fly 165 
light years from ross 248 the first time it will be closer to 
another star than to the sun which will be 199 light years from 
voyager 
in the year 296036 voyager 2 will make its closest approach to 
sirius the brightest star visible from earth 
deep space is very benign so dust and cosmic rays will erode 
voyager 2 extraordinarily slowly 
in a billion or more years sagan said there will be no more 
humans because well be extinct or well be somebody else there 
will be no human artifacts left on earth continental drift will 
completely change what the continents look like 
but this brave spacecraft will be there a surviving artifact 
of our species and our times 
perhaps one day aliens in a starship may find one of the 
voyagers then play the copper record 
they will hear greetings in 60 languages from chinese to welsh to 
urdu including a 7yearold boy offering salutations from earths 
children 
there also is the music of many cultures from chuck berrys rock 
n roll to mozart bach and beethoven 
the aliens will listen to the sounds of surf wind rain and 
thunder croaking frogs and laughing hyenas a train a truck a jet 
and a rocket a baby crying and lovers kissing 
the record also holds 115 electronically encoded photographs or 
diagrams showing humans the earth and other planets human 
chromosomes a fetus the golden gate the grand tetons and the 
great wall of china 
and the extraterrestrials will read a message written july 16 
1977 by jimmy carter then president of a nation on a little planet 
that two months later dared send a bit of itself to the stars 
this is a present from a small distant world a token of our 
sounds our science our images our music our thoughts and our 
feelings 
we are attempting to survive our time so we may live into 
yours we hope someday having solved the problems we face to join 
a community of galactic civilizations this record represents our 
hope and our determination and our good will in a vast and awesome

a vaccine that would be the nations first for 
chicken pox has been submitted for federal approval and a new 
whooping cough vaccine with less risk of side effects may follow 
soon 
chicken pox strikes more than 3 million americans a year mostly 
children while it is generally just bothersome a small fraction of 
patients suffer harm to the central nervous system or other 
complications such as pneumonia or bacterial infections about 175 
americans a year die from such problems 
some calculations suggest that given the medical costs of 
complications a chicken pox vaccine can make economic sense for 
society as a whole 
merck sharpe amp dohme of west point pa in august asked the food 
and drug administration to approve its vaccine which stanley 
plotkin chairman of the american academy of pediatrics said is 
already used in japan and europe 
one question is whether a childhood inoculation will lose its 
effectiveness in adulthood a particular concern because chicken pox 
is generally more serious when it strikes adults 
we would all like more data on the duration of immunity 
plotkin said studies have shown no problem up to 10 years after 
inoculation and vaccinated people who do get chicken pox later 
appear to get milder cases he said 
the vaccine contains a weakened version of the chicken pox virus 
which in its natural form causes a lifelong nerve infection that can 
erupt into herpes zoster commonly called shingles studies suggest 
that vaccinated people run a lower risk of later shingles than do 
people who had chicken pox plotkin said 
the standard vaccine for whooping cough called pertussis is 
given in early childhood as part of the 
diphtheriatetanuspertussis or dtp vaccine 
about half of children who get the dtp vaccine run a fever with 
swelling or soreness at the injection site in 40 percent to 50 
percent chiefly due to the pertussis portion of the vaccine 
according to one large study 
the fever can cause convulsions usually not a serious problem 
but still upsetting for parents 
in contrast recent research found that fever appeared in only 
about 5 percent of children vaccinated with a new acellular 
pertussis vaccine and localized reactions were minimal said james 
cherry of the university of california los angeles school of 
medicine 
lederle laboratories of wayne nj may be ready by early next 
year to ask the fda to approve the new vaccine a spokesman said 
the immunization which eventually would become part of the dtp is 
already used in japan he said 
the infectious disease committee of the pediatrics academy 
recently urged the fda to approve the vaccine but only for the 
booster shots given after age 1 plotkin said experts disagree on 
whether it works as well as the standard version when administered 
before that age he said 
the dtp vaccine is recommended at 2 months 4 months and 6 
months with boosters at either 15 months or 18 months and again 
before entering school at ages 4 to 6 years 
the current dtp vaccine has been dogged by concerns that its 
whooping cough component can cause brain damage including mental 
retardation and movement difficulties 
that is a highly controversial area plotkin said my 
opinion is that there is no solid evidence that it causes brain 
damage 
in any case the lederle spokesman said it is too soon to tell 
whether the new vaccine would affect rates of brain damage alleged 
to result from the current vaccine

seeds buried for centuries in the 
permafrost of the arctic tundra could help save plant varieties 
threatened by extinction and provide living fossils to study plant 
evolution 
its a logical environment to look for very old seeds that are 
viable said james b mcgraw a biologist at west virginia 
university the permafrost soil buries the seeds insulates them 
and keeps them frozen no bacteria predators or fungi can get at 
them theyre really protected 
mcgraw has spent the past two summers digging up the dry frozen 
dirt beneath a hillside about 100 miles northeast of fairbanks 
alaska hoping to find seeds still alive after thousands of years 
seeds from the early 1800s have yielded grasslike plants called 
reeds and rushes and mcgraw is eager to see what grows in soil 
estimated to be between 1500 and 2000 years old uncovered during 
his latest dig we wont know exactly what we have until we have 
the samples carbondated we may find something we may not but 
there are hints that we may 
the dating process wont be completed until next spring 
scientists have known since the early 1970s that some seeds can 
stay viable for hundreds of years under the right conditions a 
600yearold seed found in a nutshell rattle and germinated in 1971 
is the oldest known seed to sprout 
knowing how long seeds can stay viable could help improve storage 
in seed banks where the government preserves thousands of crop 
varieties thousands of irreplaceable seeds die annually in 
underfunded antiquated seed banks 
the research also could help uncover a genetic trait for 
hardiness that could be transferred to crops grown in the harsh 
conditions found in some third world countries mcgraw said we 
have found significant differences between our older seeds and 
younger seeds that appear to be genetic but we wont be sure until 
we complete our dna analysis 
there have been no major surprises yet but weve looked at 
only 100 samples gathered last year we have five times that many 
this year 
mcgraw and his crew of volunteers used only picks and shovels to 
dig a trench through a fivefoot layer of clay called a lobe to 
reach the seedbearing layer of organic material no mechanized 
equipment was used because of the damage it would have caused to the 
delicate tundra environment 
the samples were put in plastic bags kept frozen in large 
coolers and shipped to morgantown where they were transfered to 
dozens of trays watered and kept under lights 20 hours a day to 
simulate the arctic summer 
we put them under ideal germinating conditions and basically 
just see if anything grows mcgraw said its the most efficient 
way to look for seeds because theyre so small and hard to find 
once the plants sprout mcgraw removes the seed cover from the 
root and the seeds age is determined through carbon dating 
measuring the amount of naturally radioactive carbon remaining in 
the material 
he then uses the living fossils to compare the structure 
growth rates and other characteristics of plants grown from old 
seeds and those existing on the tundra weve got some seeds that 
are nearly 200 years old and they are genetically different from the 
modern day seed and thats interesting 
but it will be even more interesting when we have seeds that 
are 1000 or 2000 years old and can measure their evolutionary 
development 
were not there yet but were closer 
mcgraw hopes to collect samples old enough to test theories of 
evolution 
current evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection 
should keep improving the genotype of the plant he said if 
thats true then the older types shouldnt stand a chance against 
the more recent plants 
well soon be able to check that

health officials are investigating sales of a 
dangerous drug compound in texas under the name the miracle herb 
texas health officials last year found chuifong tokuwan a 
drug compound made in hong kong for sale in pill form said the 
centers for disease control chuifong tokuwan first appeared in the 
united states in 1974 and was banned by the food and drug 
administration in 1978 
the product contains several drugs as well as lead and cadmium 
which can cause kidney disfunction the cdc said the drugs found in 
texas usually were repackaged and labeled the miracle herb 
mother natures finest 
ninetythree people were found in rural western texas who had 
taken it and some showed indication of kidney disfunction the cdc

an appetite suppressant for mosquitoes could 
be an answer to that summertime scourge but one challenge still 
remaining is getting the substance out of the lab and into female 
mosquitoes 
right now youd have to inject each mosquito with a little 
syringe said university of idaho entymologist marc klowden 
female mosquitoes the ones that do the buzzing and biting each 
summer need protein in human and animal blood to produce eggs 
klowden in 13 years of study has found that females stop feeding 
once they have a bellyful of blood 
one reason is a hormone produced during the eggcreating process 
klowden has found that injecting the hormone into female mosquitoes 
tricks them into thinking theyre full they stop feeding and biting 
research now is shifting to biotechnology in search of a gene 
that causes mosquitoes to create the appetite suppressant hormone 
he said if scientists can find the gene they might be able to 
splice it to a virus and create a disease that keeps mosquitoes from 
eating or reproducing 
but dont throw away your bug spray just yet theres a number 
of things that have to be done were talking many many years in 
the future

pervasive warnings about its potential for causing birth defects a 
government regulator says 
there is a vast number of instances in which the drug is being 
prescribed for people who dont need it said robert nelson 
chairman of the accutane monitoring group of the us food and drug 
administration 
of an estimated 50000 to 70000 new female users of the drug 
each year fewer than 20000 and perhaps as few as 5000 have an 
acne problem that merits using it nelson told an international 
conference on drug effects 
james labraico of hoffmanla roche inc the maker of accutane 
said nelsons estimate of excessive use is high but he agreed that 
it is clear some doctors prescribe the drug to women who dont need 
it i dont think there is a lot of frivolous use but we need to 
define severe acne better 
the drugs effectiveness is a powerful argument for its 
prescription a single 20week treatment usually puts severe acne 
which is five times more common in women than men into remission 
for up to two years said dr robert stern of harvard medical school 
and bostonbased beth israel hospital 
as of july 31 la roche had documented 78 cases of birth defects 
among infants delivered by woman exposed to accutane during 
pregnancy since the drug was introduced in 1982 the survey has 
detected 433 pregnant users about half of whom chose to have 
abortions said dr wanju dai a company researcher 
the birth defects have centered on the ears nervous and 
cardiovascular systems dai said about 70 of the 433 women who 
reported being pregnant while taking the drug gave birth to healthy 
babies she said 
the link to birth defects in the company survey and other surveys 
prompted the fda to intervene besides overprescribing the fda 
found that some doctors werent warning women of the dangers of 
becoming pregnant while on the drug 
at the fdas urging la roche in may opened a new assembly line 
to package accutane exclusively in 10pill blister packs with 
warnings also included is a questionnaire inviting users to 
participate in the tracking study 
because the study relies on doctors to urge users to participate 
there is a fear that only patients of good doctors who give 
adequate warnings will take part nelson said patients of doctors 
who are lax in giving warnings may be less inclined to join which 
could skew the results in the companys favor 
labraico said the nutley njbased drug company knows of the 
shortcomings and is considering ways to make the sample more 
representative

the federal reserve board has given approval 
for banks to double the amount of revenue that their securities 
subsidiaries can earn from certain underwriting operations 
the change announced wednesday will mean that a banks 
securities subsidary will be able to earn up to 10 percent of its 
revenues from the underwriting activities up from the previous 
limit of 5 percent 
the activities covered include underwriting of corporate debt 
municipal revenue bonds commercial paper mortgagebacked 
securities and securities backed by consumer loans 
the rest of the revenue must come from other types of businesses 
such as the underwriting of general obligation bonds issued by 
municipalities and us government securities two less risky areas 
of underwriting that have always been opened to banks 
the feds decision which came on a 60 vote drew praise from 
the banking industry which has been pressing to be allowed to 
expand further into the securities area 
these decisions correctly open the securities door a bit wider 
for banking and remind everyone of the need to get oldfashioned 
bank regulations in sync with the modern marketplace said thomas 
p rideout president of the american bankers association and a vice 
chairman of first union national bank of charlotte nc the 
benefits of prudent bank entry into securities far outweigh 
potential concerns alleged by our protectionist competitors 
rideout said that the bankers group hoped that the fed would 
expand the income level to 25 percent in the future 
the fed first approved bank underwriting activities for bank 
subsidiaries in 1987 and added corporate debt to the list of 
acceptable securities in january of this year the board has 
indicated that it would decide in a year whether to allow banks to 
underwrite stock 
the feds decision wednesday fits in with a trend in recent years 
in which advances in bank deregulation have come through 
administrative and court decisions because of a political deadlock 
in congress over the question of restructuring the financial system 
the bush administration is currently studying the question of 
what changes it will recommend making in the depressionera 
glasssteagall act the law which separated commerical and 
investment banking as part of the reforms passed by congress

an eastern airlines pilot who recently crossed the 
picket line in the 6month strike against the carrier said he came 
back because of the severe financial hardship the walkout caused him 
it was very cold days for myself peter clements told texas 
air corps annual meeting here wednesday i realized that 
cardboard doesnt keep you warm it doesnt pay the bills either 
clements an 18year eastern veteran went on strike with the 
airlines pilots flight attendants and machinists union members on 
march 4 but decided to return to work last month several hundred 
eastern pilots are estimated to have crossed the picket line at the 
same time after the nowousted leader of the airlines pilots union 
urged them to do so 
clements said eastern now is a wonderful place to work 
miamibased eastern a subsidiary of texas air has been under 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since march 9 texas air chairman 
frank lorenzo told shareholders at the meeting that eastern has 
made an astonishing rebound from the devastation caused by the 
strike of its three unions and is recovering much faster than 
expected 
lorenzo was visibly moved by the remarks by clements and other 
nonstriking eastern employees at the meeting and several 
bystanders noticed tears in his eyes as he left the room when the 
session ended 
another veteran pilot frank barber said he has been on the job 
since the strike started 
we had some very dark days early on but with the 600plus 
flights a day now were very excited he told the shareholders

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo insists 
that he plans to remain in the airline business countering 
speculation that he might quit 
a defiant lorenzo also said wednesday that texas airs eastern 
airlines subsidiary will start turning a profit next year despite 
the strikebound carriers enormous debts and bankruptcy proceeding 
while about 100 eastern strikers chanted antilorenzo slogans 
outside the longdelayed texas air annual meeting the chairman of 
the nations biggest airline company told shareholders he has no 
plans to quit the business wont sell eastern and likely will have 
texas air assume some of easterns financial obligations 
i have no intentions of leaving the airline business lorenzo 
said at a news conference after the meeting i plan to be around 
for plenty of years to come god willing 
speculation that lorenzo might quit was fueled by his surprise 
announcement aug 24 that he was considering selling all or part of 
houstonbased continental airlines texas airs other main 
subsidiary he had no comment on a statement wednesday by jan 
carlzon managing director of scandinavian airlines system that sas 
has no immediate interest in buying part of continental 
sas which owns a 99 percent stake in texas air has been in 
talks with texas air officials about possibly buying part of 
continental under us law foreign airlines are allowed to own up 
to 25 percent of an american carrier 
security was tight at the hotel where the shareholders meeting 
took place largely because of lorenzos unpopularity among eastern 
strikers stockholders had to pass through metal detectors 
television cameras were banned from the meeting room and houston 
uniformed and plainclothes police as well as private security guards 
were present 
lorenzos remarks about miamibased eastern came as the airline 
is mired in the seventh month of a strike that has become a national 
symbol of labor resistance and has left thousands of pilots flight 
attendants and machinists union members walking picket lines 
demanding lorenzos resignation 
eastern has been replacing the strikers with picketline crossers 
and nonunion hires and is flying a limited operation but it is 
doing business under the protection of federal bankruptcy court 
where it sought protection from creditors five days after the strike 
began march 4 
if continental were sold some observers believe lorenzo might 
liquidate eastern and quit the business 
but the airline chief told about 300 shareholders at the meeting 
that eastern is projecting profitable operations beginning next 
year the stockholders responded with applause 
eastern has made an astonishing rebound from the devastation 
caused by the strike of its three unions and is recovering much 
faster than expected lorenzo said during the hourlong meeting 
he said easterns proposed reorganization plan submitted to 
bankruptcy court july 21 likely will receive final court approval 
by year end or early next year clearing the way for the airline to 
emerge from bankruptcy at about twothirds its prestrike size 
texas air is standing behind eastern airlines and the 
possibility is excellent that texas air will assist eastern said 
lorenzo who aggressively built the parent company from a small 
intrastate carrier into an airline empire 
the annual meeting coincided with a hearing in us bankruptcy 
court in new york at which a judge approved a plan for payment of 
983 million eastern owes to employee pension plans texas air is 
lending eastern 45 million toward the payment eastern is paying 
27 million with the proceeds of asset sales and the rest has been 
deferred until july 1990 
easterns proposed reorganization calls for repaying all 
creditors in full including refunding the price of tickets that 
werent used because of the walkout 
the strikers have been pushing for a sale of eastern in its 
entirety and have allied themselves in that effort with joseph 
ritchie a chicago businessman eastern meanwhile has been selling 
aircraft routes and airport gates to raise money toward paying off 
its 23 billion debt 
the air line pilots association which represents pilots at 
nearly all the nations major carriers has spent 695 million 
about 57 percent of its contingency fund on the battle with 
eastern pilots at the other airlines have provided strike benefits 
to eastern pilots averaging about 2400 a month per pilot said 
john mazor an alpa spokesman in washington 
but the number of pilots paying those assessments to their 
colleagues at eastern has decreased as the strike has worn on mazor 
said in a telephone interview 
thats typical for any strike assessment for any labor 
union he said it goes through a predictable cycle 
alpa members are being balloted on whether to continue strike 
benefits to their eastern colleagues he said

britain continues to lead the world as a center 
for currency trading but the united states and japan are catching 
up as trading volume continues to mushroom central bank surveys 
show 
daily trading in currencies totaled 187 billion in london 
1289 billion in new york and 1152 billion in tokyo according to 
april surveys released by the central banks wednesday 
currency trading worldwide has more than doubled since 1986 the 
last time surveys were done figures for different countries cannot 
simply be added up because crossborder trades are counted twice in 
the buyers country and the sellers 
the growth in currency trading far exceeds the expansion of 
international trade in goods and services which is the underlying 
reason for currency trading 
although businesses need to trade currencies to do business 
abroad the vast majority of currency trading today is speculation 
by banks and other dealers statistics indicate 
big banks devote large staffs to playing the market buying and 
selling currencies by the minute in hopes of pocketing profits by 
guessing shortterm price trends 
in the united states only about 12 percent of banks dealings 
are with industrial companies and other institutions that need 
currencies for purposes other than speculation according to 
gretchen greene a senior vice president at the federal reserve bank 
of new york 
the rapid growth in currency trading reflects the closer 
connections among stock and bond markets around the world and the 
attractiveness of dealing in currencies for speculation and hedging 
among other factors greene said 
in london average daily currency trading rose 107 percent to 
187 billion from 90 billion in 1986 
in new york trading rose 120 percent to 1289 billion a day 
from 585 billion three years earlier 
the tokyo market showed the fastest growth up 140 percent to 
1152 billion from 48 billion 
in comparison world exports rose by about a third from 1986 to 
1988 according to united nations figures estimates for 1989 are 
not yet available 
after the big three trading centers came switzerland 57 
billion hong kong 49 billion france 26 billion the 
netherlands 16 billion and canada 15 billion up 57 percent 
canada was the only one of the smaller markets surveyed in 1986 
more than 300 billion worth of dollars marks yen pounds 
francs and other currencies change hands daily surveys by the banks 
reveal 
the total is probably more than 400 billion a day although 
estimates are difficult because of the doublecounting problem 
central bankers plan to share information in order to eliminate 
doublecounting of crossborder trades and come up with a net figure 
for worldwide currency trading possibly later this year or early in 
1990 greene said 
the central banks surveyed banks other financial institutions 
and brokers over 20 business days in april the federal reserve has 
surveyed currency trading every three years since 1977 and was 
joined in 1986 by a few other central banks 
the volume of trading is so huge that it often overwhelms efforts 
by central banks to stabilize currency rates such as by selling 
dollars on the open market when the dollar is getting too high 
for example federal reserve dollar sales of 130 million in the 
us market would equal only onetenth of 1 percent of total trading 
on an average day the new statistics show 
but greene said central banks still can be effective because 
although total trading volume is huge the imbalances between supply 
and demand that cause prices to move are much narrower in other 
words supplying a small sum of dollars to the market could soak up 
the excess demand and halt a price rise 
the greatest concentration of trading continued to be in the 
dollar against the west german mark japanese yen and british pound 
the surveys showed 
trades that didnt involve the dollar such as selling marks for 
yen grew in importance they rose to 11 percent of total volume 
from 4 percent in london they totaled about 4 percent in new york 
no new york comparison for 1986 was available

personal bankruptcy filings have doubled 
since 1980 and account for one half the annual fees paid by bank 
credit card holders said the president of visa usa in announcing 
a nationwide crackdown on fraudulent filers 
jon cristoffersen said wednesday that efforts are under way in 
los angeles dallas houston and chicago and will reach most major 
areas by year end 
bankruptcy can be an appropriate way for honest people to deal 
with a financial problem he said but our concern is with the 
fraudulent filing which can be as many as one in three 
personal bankruptcy filings have increased since 1980 to about 
600000 last year or one in 178 households cristoffersen said that 
socked the bank card industry with total losses of 15 billion in 
1988 as bankrupt cardholders simply wrote off their credit card debt 
about half of everyones annual fees for bank cards comes from 
bankruptcy he said if were able to deal with even 20 to 30 
percent of the fraud the payback to the public will be 
substantial 
most people who file for bankruptcy fraudulently have been able 
to get away with it cristoffersen said because twothirds of the 
banks with assets over 1 billion havent been challenging them 
visas new program encourages member banks to screen for fraud 
and abuse of the federal bankruptcy law challenge filings in court 
and seek criminal prosecution 
bankruptcy frauds include those who dont declare all their 
assets such as real estate in other states or inheritances they 
also include those who sell assets below their true market value or 
transfer ownership to a third party or relative abusers also 
include those who have the ability to pay back their debts but 
choose not to 
the stories are legend like the man who wanted to spread out 
payments for his jaguar or the chap who lost 350000 on a single 
roll of the dice after he took out 30 bank cards cristoffersen 
said 
cristoffersen speaking at a convention of the national 
foundation for consumer credit inc outlined a tough program that 
so far has enlisted 70 member banks those banks including 
citibank bank of america and chase manhattan issue 60 percent of 
visas 118 million cards in the country and are victims of 75 
percent of all bankruptcies 
when member banks in the program receive bankruptcy notices they 
will immediately review the account and if they suspect fraud or 
abuse notify all other members listed on the bankruptcy petition 
the other members will do a similar search and when two or more 
believe they have found fraud or abuse they will collectively use a 
single local law firm to represent them 
by multiple members reviewing bankruptcies they can put 
together a clearer picture of fraud and abuse and make it 
economically feasible to go after the abusers said kenneth r 
crone who heads the bankruptcy recovery program for visa 
the program also includes pursuit of criminal prosecution visa 
has hired a former fbi agent who will investigate cases prepare 
them for review by the fbi and seek prosecution by the us attorney 
on a fasttrack basis under a special arrangement with the justice 
department 
in los angeles the number of accounts showing up with fraud or 
abuse that are being challenged under the pilot program has doubled 
to more than 300 in the past three months crone said 
that represents a small percentage of the more than 30000 
fraudulent or abusive bankruptcies among the 51000 declared each 
year in los angeles but crone believes the program is sending the 
message that theres a darn good chance theyll get caught that 
the bankruptcy petition will be thrown out of court and theyll have 
to pay attorney fees and face criminal prosecution 
the bankruptcy reform act which was rewritten in 1978 was 
designed to encourage chapter 11 or chapter 13 personal 
reorganization filings wherein the debtor pays back creditors 
as much as possible over three to five years crone said 
but weve seen an incredible boom of chapter 7 bankruptcies 
where there are no assets and people get their entire unsecured debt 
discharged crone said credit cards are unsecured so theyre 
the first to get written off 
of the nearly 600000 personal bankruptcy filings in 1988 about 
95 percent were chapter 7 filings visa said 
the national foundation for consumer credit is the parent 
organization for more than 400 consumer credit counseling offices 
and offers free counseling services 
visa the worlds largest consumer payment system has more than 
19000 us bank members with 120 billion in payment volume a year

somewhere in the soviet union future big 
macs are still on the hoof but the people who will run the first 
mcdonalds restaurant in moscow are training hard already at 
hamburger university 
five soviets arrived at mcdonalds suburban chicago headquarters 
sunday for two weeks of training at its school for restaurant 
managers 
after returning to moscow they will be in charge of whats 
expected to be the worlds highestvolume mcdonalds scheduled to 
open near pushkin square early next year with seating for 900 
big macs in the borscht belt 
russia as you probably know has very good cuisine 
tasteful said alexander egorov deputy general director of 
moscowmcdonalds but today in our age when the speed of life is 
very fast it is very difficult to eat a borscht plate very fast 
there is a great need for fastfood restaurants such as 
mcdonalds that will provide muscovites with nutritious food and 
excellent service 
egorov and his fellow trainees spoke wednesday while making fast 
work of lunch before heading off to afternoon classes 
moscow macs is a joint venture between mcdonalds restaurants of 
canada ltd and the food service administration of the moscow city 
council plans call for 20 restaurants and for all food including 
the beef to be raised in the soviet union 
there are herds already waiting egorov said 
joining egorov at hamburger university are four restaurant 
managers khamzat kazbulatov mikhail shelesnov georgij smoleevskij 
and vladimir zhurakovskij 
before arriving at hamburger u the five spent the summer 
studying at mcdonalds institue of hamburgerology in toronto their 
training included counter work and cooking at mcdonalds 
restaurants but in oak brook they are taking advanced operations 
courses to learn management skills 
their counselor hamburger u professor henry chapoy said the 
five are typical mcdonalds people 
opening a country i really wasnt expecting them to be at that 
level but yes they have that level its called ketchup in the 
veins chapoy said 
the five spend long days in classes and were to start laboratory 
work today at night they study from manuals printed in english and 
russian 
on wednesday the five could be distinguished from fellow 
students in an effective people practices class only by their 
headphones although each studied english this summer translator 
oleg shakov who took the course two weeks ago to prepare worked 
from a darkened booth nearby 
the seminars are very useful to me because i personally have 
learned a lot of new things for myself for example effective 
people practices said shelesnov my basic knowledge of how to 
communicate to people comes from moscow but what ive learned here 
has provided some insight into how to communicate well 
all but zhurakovskij whose background is in foreign trade and 
engineering have extensive experience in the foodservice industry 
they were selected from nearly a thousand applicants 
the soviet mcdonalds is one fruit of a kremlin law on joint 
ventures enacted in 1987 to woo foreign capital technology and 
expertise from abroad that mission is not lost on the new hamburger 
u students 
asked about the problems of transferring their training to a 
moscow workforce shelesnov said i can only guess because this 
has never been done before it wont be easy 
although they expect no shortage of customers at home none of 
the five has much experience with the product theyll be selling 
none had eaten any mcdonalds food before arriving in canada 
i really liked it a lot shelesnov said matteroffact 
no really it was tasty zhurakovskij quickly emphasized

the mexican government and a committee of banks 
have announced an agreement on detailed language covering the 
historic debtreduction plan reached between that nation and the 
bank group in july 
the language called a term sheet will be sent to the more than 
500 banks owed money by mexico officials said wednesday the term 
sheet provides a list of options the banks may exercise to reduce 
the amount of mexican debt on their books 
the agreement on the term sheet concludes the second stage of 
the process said angel gurria undersecretary of the mexican 
ministry of finance 
as expected it has taken several weeks since we reached 
agreement in principle in july but the issues we confronted were 
new extremely complex and economically of great importance both to 
mexico and the banks he said in a statement released in new york 
where the bank committee and mexican officials met 
after a period for review we will visit financial centers 
around the world to explain the package and answer the banks 
questions gurria said 
the term sheet covers the period of 198992 
mexicos agreement in principle with the steering committee of 15 
creditor banks reached july 24 was seen as a test of bush 
administration policy for reducing third world debt and as a 
milestone for other debtor countries waiting to renegotiate 
it represents the first significant reduction in a governments 
debt to commercial banks 
under the agreement each bank has three options a 35 percent 
reduction in principle reduction of the interest rate on its loans 
to 6 percent from the current average of about 10 percent or 
providing new loans equal to 25 percent of what mexico owes the bank 
the deal applies to about 53 billion of mexicos foreign debt 
which totals about 107 billion second in the developing world only 
to the 120 billion owed by brazil 
in a statement us treasury secretary nicholas brady praised 
the agreement on the term sheet 
this agreement represents an important step forward in 
implementing the strengthened debt strategy and in mexicos efforts 
to obtain needed debt reduction and new financing to support its 
economic reform program brady said 
mexican treasury secretary pedro aspe has said that mexicos goal 
in reaching a debt agreement is to decrease the amount of the 
nations gross national product paid to the banks for debt service 
from the 63 percent of recent years to 27 percent 
he said that paying as much as mexico has been paying for its 
debt service is incompatible with economic growth

pan am corp became the first us airline to run 
a permanent foreign service 62 years ago and gained a reputation as 
americas flag carrier but survival may dictate that it find a 
foreign bankroller 
chairman and chief executive officer thomas g plaskett disclosed 
this possibility wednesday and seemed to suggest pan am viewed 
partial foreign ownership as the most realistic way to escape an era 
of staggering losses that has left its future in doubt 
plaskett said in february that pan am would need to find a merger 
partner or attract new investment to survive but he did not 
emphasize the foreign ownership option 
pan am unsucessfully bid for northwest airlines parent nwa inc a 
few months later and has been said to be weighing a bid for united 
airlines parent ual corp 
plasketts remarks came against a background of growing overseas 
airline investment in us carriers a trend that is reshaping the 
commercial aviation industry and raising speculation that some day 
foreign airlines might freely fly domestic us routes which they 
currently arent allowed to do 
since 1988 scandinavian airlines system has acquired a small 
stake in texas air corp owner of continental and eastern dutch 
airline klm joined a group of investors buying nwa and most 
recently british airways joined a group seeking to buy ual 
although us law limits foreigners to 25 percent ownership of a 
us airline these minority ownership arrangements have given the 
foreign partners enormous influence over us airline strategies 
moreover they could create what amounts to a new breed of 
superairline with tremendous global reach by linking schedules and 
ticketing services 
plaskett said the british airways involvement with united for 
example would create an operation that offers passengers nearly 
half the worlds existing air routes more than any other airline or 
alliance of airlines 
pan am is determined to be a major player in the evolving 
worldwide megacarrier system plaskett told a luncheon of 
aviation industry executives in new york if it takes the form of 
an infusion of capital from a foreign entity we want to be free to 
do it openly and without subterfugeour government needs to tell 
us what the rules are in very clear terms 
certainly its time for our government to consider whether 
there is still any valid national interest other than the national 
defense interest which can be protected in retaining these foreign 
ownership restrictions plaskett said 
he declined to identify any possible foreign partners for pan am 
or say whether the company still is actively pursuing other 
strategies including a possible bid for ual or texas airs 
continental which also may be sold 
new yorkbased pan am is one of the oldest us airlines and 
became the first to operate a permanent international air service in 
1927 it also helped pioneer routes to europe asia and latin 
america giving it the reputation as americas unofficial 
flagcarrier overseas 
but pan am has been battered over the past several years by tough 
competition labor tensions and other problem while competitors have 
been aggressively expanding it financial woes forced it to sell its 
latin american and pacific routes greatly shrinking its size 
the airline lost 462 million in 1986 265 million in 1987 and 
727 million in 1988 it has lost 1588 million so far this year

texas air corp is paying 45 million worth of 
eastern airlines pension fund obligations due friday to help the 
strikebound carrier save some cash 
the payment by the parent company will be in the form of a loan 
that eastern lawyers said would be repayed during the airlines 
bankruptcy reorganization 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland approved a proposal 
wednesday for payment of 983 million to easterns seven employee 
pension plans including those of striking workers and salaried 
employees 
eastern will pay just 27 million of the total and payment of the 
remaining 263 million will be deferred until next july 1 
it certainly is in everybodys best interest that the funding 
of those plans is completely sourced lifland said 
the plan was reached after discussions among eastern its 
creditors committee and the internal revenue service which is 
responsible for overseeing payments to pension funds 
lawyers for eastern said the plan gives eastern a break by 
deferring some payment until later in the course of its chapter 11 
proceedings and transferring other payments to texas air 
it saves eastern a lot of cash during the chapter 11 case 
eastern lawyer bruce zirinsky said 
the 45 million to be paid by texas air will be held as a claim 
on the eastern estate that will be resolved as part of easterns 
reorganization 
the agreement was opposed by lawyers for the air line pilots 
association and easterns preferred shareholders committee lawyers 
for the shareholders said any cash outlay would hurt the airline 
while the pilots lawyers wanted full payment into the funds 
of the total amount due 784 million represents money owed for 
pension plans ending last year and 199 million is for money due 
under waivers granted by the irs for previous plan years zirinsky 
said 
eastern has been under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after its machinists pilots and 
flight attendants walked off the job 
the airline has been selling aircraft routes and airport gates 
to raise money to pay off its 23 billion debt it gradually has 
rebuilt as a smaller carrier under a reorganization plan filed in 
july 
eastern officials recently disclosed to creditors that the 
airline will have about 370 million less in cash by year end than 
first projected having abandoned a plan to sell its latin american 
routes

during the period because of a model changeover at the factory he 
also speculated consumers may be waiting to see the redesigned 1990 
honda accord 
nissan spokesman ec mueller said early september sales were 
damaged by an incentive program that expired sept 5 
there was a run on the vehicles at the end of august he said 
auto dealers as they do every year around this time hold fire 
sales to rid their lots of unsold cars to make way for the new 
models rolling off assembly lines 
manufacturers also want to get rid of the cars so they have 
offered incentives to customers and their dealers which drop the 
price of the vehicle also analysts have said some consumers appear 
to be buying cars now rather than waiting for the new models and the 
higher price tags they will carry 
ford motor co was the only one of the big three to show declines 
in car and truck sales during early september the nations no 2

robert a roughs banking career started at 
age 14 when he worked as a runner for a bank in paterson nj 
after college came a stint as an auditor at the federal reserve 
bank of new york where he returned 20 years later president of 
his own bank to join the board of directors at the institution 
where many of his young colleagues from the 1960s were now senior 
officials 
on wednesday rough was sent to jail his career finished his 
money gone 
us district judge dickinson r debevoise sentenced him to six 
months in prison wednesday for leaking secret interest rate data 
while on the new york feds board debevoise also ordered the 
50yearold exbanker to perform 200 hours of community service 
during two years of probation 
i am an outcast in the banking community and my own 
community rough told the judge in emotionally choked tones 
these past few years have been truly a living hell 
debevoise called the case particularly sad and said he was 
convinced that roughs anguished remorse came from the heart 
but he said jail time for rough was essential for the public 
perception of the fairness of the system that white collar 
criminals and those with advantaged backgrounds be properly 
punished 
i breached a trust placed in me and in doing so blemished the 
reputation of the institution i still revere said rough his 
voice quavering 
he said a picture of former federal reserve bank chairman paul 
volker remains hanging on his wall the federal reserve bank of new 
york is part of the feds regional system 
rough sat on the new york feds board from 1982 to 1984 while 
president of the national bank of sussex county in branchville nj 
while there rough admitted in a plea bargain he regularly 
disclosed advance word regarding the feds discount rate to a 
nowdefunct livingston njbased brokerage firm bevill bresler amp 
schulman inc 
bevill bresler traded in government securities part of a market 
that is powerfully affected by the discount rate 
the case was the first to involve insider trading of government 
securities and marked the first such charges against a director in 
the fed system federal officials said 
rough could have received up to five years in prison but in an 
unusual move the us attorneys office recommended that if rough 
was sent to prison it should be for less than a year 
assistant us attorney paul weissman in a presentencing memo 
said rough expected no financial gain 
debevoise agreed to recommend that rough serve his sentence 
beginning oct 16 at eglin air force base in florida a minimum 
security prison camp roughs attorney michael himmel who had 
asked for probation said his client would probably serve about 4 
months gaining early release for good time 
roughs career as a prosperous country banker who once 
aspired to be chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation 
began to unravel in the spring of 1987 when witnesses at the trial 
of bevill bresler president gilbert c schulman disclosed the 
allegations 
rough usually leaked the data to schulman and blamed his actions 
on a misguided friendship with the bevill bresler official 
schulman and four other top executives of the firm were sent to 
prison in connection with its april 1985 collapse

skyrocketing gasoline prices that followed 
the exxon valdex oil spill in alaska cant be pinned on that 
disaster a washington state probe has concluded 
as 11 million gallons of alaskan crude from the supertanker that 
ran aground on march 24 coated alaskas prince william sound gas 
prices were soaring by 20 cents or more per gallon at service 
stations across the nation 
but the price hikes already were in the works before the spill 
because of a complicated series of production and market factors 
attorney general ken eikenberry said wednesday 
americas worst oil spill had a brief impact on us refinery 
supplies particularly in the west but not enough to be considered 
a major factor in the price hikes eikenberrys antitrust division 
said in a detailed report on its sixmonth probe 
investigators said they discovered no evidence of collusion among 
the big oil companies but neither could they disprove such a 
possibility any further investigation should be done at the federal 
level said eikenberry 
as chairman of the task force on gasoline overpricing of the 
nations attorneys general he has asked the justice department and 
the federal trade commission to investigate 
washington oregon california and arizona already are in federal 
court over alleged gasoline pricefixing and contrived shortages in 
the early 1970s 
already angered about the environmental consequences of the oil 
spill consumers demanded explanations for the price increases 
the report said 
many felt that the increases added insult to injury and that 
the spill was being used as an excuse to raise prices additionally 
some were concerned that by paying higher prices consumers would be 
paying for the cost of cleaning up the spill 
the investigators who grilled the oil industry conducted 
hearings and did their own analysis of economic information 
concluded that the oil spill had only minimal and temporary 
impact on gasoline supply 
the exxon valdez did not cause the price increase assistant 
attorney general tina kondo told a news conference prices went up 
all over the country even in places that dont depend on alaskan 
crude 
the spill caused a sharp oneweek dip in gasoline production on 
the west coast but it was quickly rectified and should have had 
little longterm impact the report said 
other factors already had created a volatile supply 
situation said the report prepared by kondo and investigator 
larry little 
crude oil prices had been surging squeezing refineries 
profits and adding to pressure to boost prices between last 
november and may opec boosted prices between 7 and 8 a barrel 
or between 16 and 19 cents a gallon of gas initially retailers 
absorbed some of the cost with refiners getting the lions share of 
the higher pump prices the report said 
west coast refineries had both scheduled and unexpected 
shutdowns arcos ferndale wash refinery was down between april 5 
and midmay chevrons fire at its richmond beach calif refinery 
on april 10 cut production by 25 percent for more than a month 
exxons benicia calif scheduled maintenance losing half its 
production texaco had an emergency shutdown at its anacortes 
wash refinery on feb 2 curtailing production until the end of 
march 
demand for gas was increasing but inventories were abnormally 
low texaco and arco customers reported outages before the spill 
chevron and arco bought expensive oil on the spot market to try to 
fill the gap 
uncertainly over the longterm effects of the spill and a major 
explosion at shells cormorant alpha oil platform in the north sea 
boosted prices on the world crude and spot markets 
stricter environmental regulations took effect on june 1 1989 
oil companies have estimated that antiair pollution laws will cost 
an extra 1 to 3 cents per gallon 
the alaska spill may have had an indirect catalyst effect 
the report said

an unprecedented accord will require churchs 
fried chicken inc to pay immigration authorities 80700 in fines 
for hiring unauthorized aliens the us justice department said 
in return the us immigration and naturalization service will 
not pursue a nationwide investigation and will give popeyes famous 
fried chicken inc a chance to correct improper hiring practices by 
the fastfood rival it acquired last february 
the justice department said it was the first agreement of its 
kind since the november 1986 enactment of federal legislation 
prohibiting the hiring of unauthorized aliens it said the agreement 
was signed wednesday in washington dc 
all of churchs 798 companyowned outlets and the companys 
corporate office in san antonio texas is covered by the agreement 
the justice department said 
under its terms the ins new orleans district will fine the 
corporate headquarters and each outlet 500 but will accept a 
settlement of 100 from each the justice department said that 
amounts to a total fine of 403000 and a settlement payment of 
80700 it said 
the acquisition of churchs by popeyes was a consideration in the 
settlement said ins district director john bz caplinger 
popeyes is an international new orleansbased firm which has 
strongly supported the legislation prohibiting the employment of 
unauthorized alien labor caplinger said 
the positive support provided by us by popeyes during our 
investigation and our trust in the ability of popeyes to correct 
the problems at its new churchs outlets led to this nationwide 
agreement he said 
the apprehension of some unauthorized alien workers at churchs 
outlets in baton rouge last fall triggered an investigation into 
whether churchs was complying with the immigration reform and 
control act of 1986 the justice department said 
the act forbids us employers to hire unauthorized alien 
workers and also requires them to complete am i9 form verifying 
the identities and employment eligibility of all employees even 
us citizens the justice department said 
numerous recordkeeping violations including missing and 
improperly completed i9 forms were found in a subsequent 
investigation of 97 churchs outlets and 2900 employees in 
louisiana mississippi and texas the justice department said 
as a result of those violations it said the ins proposed a fine 
of more than 620000 but accepted payment of 50000 from churchs 
last july 
the investigation indicated the churchs problem was nationwide 
in scope but by the time of the first settlement covering those 97 
stores popeyes had bought churchs caplinger said 
in light of the positive support by popeyes human resources 
director charles dilapi and his staff we felt that rather than 
initiating a nationwide investigation of churchs we would initiate 
a nationwide settlement which gives popeyes the opportunity to 
install new procedures and provide training which will we are 
confident correct the problem he said 
he said the agreement covers violations which occurred prior to 
june 1 1989 it gives churchs a 120period from aug 1 to nov 
28 to correct those violations caplinger said 
also he said the ins agreed not to issue any new fines during 
the 120day period and churchs agreed to terminate any unauthorized 
workers it might find in the process of correcting violations 
churchs also would be subject to fines for any uncorrected or 
new violations after nov 28 caplinger said

the next generation of ford escort and 
mercury tracer subcompact cars will cost ford motor co 15 billion 
to develop more than half of it going into two plants one in 
mexico 
the investment is part of a production switch scheduled for next 
year to clear the way for a new sportutility truck 
escorts and tracers will be made in the detroit suburb of wayne 
and in hermosillo mexico where they currently are assembled 
company executives said wednesday the escort plant in edison nj 
will be switched to making ranger light pickup trucks which now are 
assembled in louisville ky 
the louisville plant will be the source of the explorer a 
twoand fourdoor sport utility vehicle that replaces the bronco ii 
all the new vehicles will be introduced in the spring and in 
dealer showrooms later 
with an investment of this size ford is making a clear 
commitment to maintain small car production and sales leadership in 
north america alex trotman fords executive vice president for 
north american automotive operations said during the introduction 
of fords 1990 lineup of cars and light trucks 
he said about 600 million will be invested at the wayne plant 
and about 260 million at the mexican plant the remaining 640 
million will be spent at ford component plants for retooling 
suppliers and in other ford divisions linked to the new escort and 
tracer program 
the company also said it will spend about 285 million at the 
edison factory to prepare for truck production 
the subcompact market for much of this year has been weaker than 
last year through august sales of subcompacts have slipped 62 
percent from last years level to 649311 cars 
to avoid swelling dealer inventories too much ford shut down its 
wayne and edison plants for a week or two several times in the last 
four months the escort was the bestselling car last year with 
387815 of the cars driven off dealer lots 
cars have been assembled at the edison plant since 1948 and 
about 119000 escorts were made there last year the plant has an 
assembly line rate of 37 cars an hour on two shifts 
by contrast ford assembled about 296000 escorts at the wayne 
plant west of detroit last year its line speed is 68 cars an hour 
also on two shifts 
ranger pickups currently are made at fords louisville assembly 
plant at a rate of 37 an hour coincidentally the same rate as the 
edison plant that factory will begin producing the ford explorer 
sportutility vehicle which will replace the bronco ii when ranger 
production is moved to new jersey 
ford spokesman jay meisenhelder said he didnt know when the 
edison plant would stop production to retool and to retrain workers 
to make the pickup about 1600 people work there 
the new generation of escort and tracer will be introduced in the 
spring as a 1991 model ford executives declined to talk about 
details of the car at the 1990 models introduction wednesday

baseball commissioner and organizer of the 1984 los angeles 
olympics will take a stake in adidas usa the american subsidiary

company was planning a new strategy to overcome losses on the 
important us market

sales for 1989 were expected to top 400 million about 4 percent to 
5 percent down from 1988

he also holds an option for a stake in adidas ag the parent 
company but this remains well below 25 percent the dassler 
family will retain its majority holding in adidas ag the company

british petroleum co plc today announced a major 
restructuring to focus on higherrisk higherreward 
exploration a move which involves the sale of assets worth 13 
billion and the slashing of more than 1700 jobs 
bp the worlds fourth largest oil company said it has agreed to 
sell 9 percent of its british north sea exploration assets as well 
as assets in six other countries to oryx energy co one of the 
largest independent oil and gas producers in the united states 
the north sea assets include four oil and gasproducing fields 
five prospective developments and 42 unexplored blocks 
the job cuts would represent 17 percent of londonbased bps work 
force of about 10000 
we have to get into a position where our assets are working 
most efficiently john browne chief executive officer of bp 
exploration told a news conference 
we havent taken the meataxe to the company were preparing 
not only for today but also for tomorrow he saidwere shifting 
our focus to ensure that we put enough money into frontier 
exploration 
the proceeds from the sale would allow the company to invest in 
areas it considers to have more potential vietnam ethiopia the 
gulf of mexico and the western margins of the british continental 
shelf browne said 
the sale package includes assets in ecuador gabon dubai italy 
colombia and indonesia 
oryx energy based in dallas was formed when sun oil of the 
united states spun off its us exploration and production business 
as the sun exploration and production co in november 1988 it was 
renamed in may 1989 
there will be more asset disposals if exploration turns up 
something that would be more useful to someone else well sell 
it browne said 
the move follows bps 44 billion acquisition of britoil plc 
last year bp purchased the 45 percent of standard oil co of ohio 
it didnt already own for 79 billion in 1987 
bp might be raising cash to retire debt and to build up a war 
chest for another major takeover perhaps of an american company 
analysts have speculated 
in may bp agreed to sell its mineral interests to the british 
mining group rtz corp for 65 billion bp also is planning to sell 
its coal business later in the year for an undisclosed amount 
the streamlining should reduce overhead by more than 150 million 
a year bp said 
the company said many of the job losses would be achieved through 
early retirement and voluntary departures but it could not rule out 
layoffs 
the company said it would cut 970 jobs in scotland twothirds of 
them in aberdeen and the rest in glasgow another 470 jobs are to 
be cut at bps london offices and 280 at bps offices in houston 
texas 
bp exploration is being reorganized into three regional operating 
companies and international technology division and a global gas 
unit these will come under the overall direction of a small 
headquarters in new offices in london 
browne said the need for change is compelling we face rising 
taxes higher running costs and more onerous regulations worldwide 
we are also aware that we must be leaders in responsible 
environment protection and that there are lessons to be learned 
about promoting the health and safety of our work force 
all these factors are driving up costs and putting margins 
under severe pressure 
the restructuring announcement comes one week after bp announced 
that deputy chairman robert horton 50 would become chairman of the 
oil giant in march replacing sir peter walters who is retiring at 
age 59

the costly thriftrescue plan which promises a sweeping 
restructuring of the us financial system over the next three 
decades already has brought subtle changes to the lives of many 
americans since its enactment a month ago 
those highinterest cds peddled by some desperate thrifts to 
attract depositors are getting harder to find and some experts say 
they eventually could disappear real estate auctioneers are 
maneuvering to grab a piece of what easily will be the biggest 
distressed property sale in history 
more serious consequences could loom as the number of thrifts 
decline lessening competition homebuyers for example may find 
themselves priced out of the mortgage market which historically has 
been the main business of the savings amp loan industry 
the quiet changes unfolding so far partly reflect a slowmoving 
bureaucracy a relatively stable economy and widespread 
misunderstanding or apathy about the law and what it means many 
thrift executives say their customers dont realize a new era has 
begun 
in the general sense the bailout has been a nonevent said 
marion o sandler president of golden west financial corp parent 
of world savings and loan association in oakland calif the 
customers arent talking about it the branches were all prepared 
to answer questions after the bill was signed and no one did 
one of the most visible signs of the legislation has been the 
governments new insurance logotype emblazoned on the windows of all 
federally insured institutions 
it states deposits of up to 100000 remain backed by uncle sam 
but even that could change a congressional task force is exploring 
changes in this guarantee and could recommend lowering it 
its difficult to say what will happen he who uses a crystal 
ball always winds up eating glass cautions l william seidman 
chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp and charged with 
overseeing the sampl rescue operation 
the taxpayer is the upfront loser hes going to be paying 
about 1000 a year for someone elses mistakes but i think the 
financial system will be much more stable and more efficient with 
the law in place 
signed by president bush on aug 9 the law authorizes the 
spending of about 300 billion to close or sell hundreds of 
insolvent savings and loans over the next 30 years with taxpayers 
picking up 75 percent of the tab 
by the end of this year regulators are supposed to inject at 
least 20 billion into the industry to stabilize it against 
continuing losses 
the law also creates a new federal agency to oversee the 
operation the resolution trust corp which will among other 
things dispose of thousands of repossessed properties the 
government will inherit from sick sampls 
the government already has at least 100 billion in assets from 
the thrifts it has shut down with about half of that in commercial 
real estate experts say the property assets could total as high as 
400 billion 
some have expressed concern that the real estate industry 
already hurt by the deflation of the 1980s might feel more pressure 
as regulators unload that property either by auction or to private 
parties 
others say thats unlikely lets say you have 100 billion of 
property if you were to auction 10 million a day seven days a 
week without taking off for holidays it would take 28 years 
says jim gall president of miamibased auction company of america 
one of the many auctioneers hoping to participate in the bailout 
action 
seidman maintains the government is aware of the delicacy of the 
situation well approach this the way porcupines make love very 
carefully he says 
included in the law are business guidelines that could ultimately 
affect consumer services experts say for instance thrifts are 
required to raise capital levels and to do that many will have to 
shrink in size experts say 
another requirement is that thrifts maintain about 70 percent of 
their assets in investments linked to mortgages as a result they 
may stop offering car loans or personal loans they may even give up 
credit cards said robert k heady publisher of bank rate 
monitor a weekly report on financial rates 
seidman predicts that in the next five years the number of sampls 
will drop to around 1500 from 2600 
analysts say fewer thrifts may mean less competition for things 
like mortgage loans and that could mean higher rates although 
mortgage companies could fill that void 
some thrift depositors already have had to deal with less 
attractive rates as the government works to close insolvent sampls 
at a rate of between three or four a week according to seidman 
the deposit accounts of those institutions are often sold to healthy 
ones the abovemarket interest customers of the problem thrifts had 
been receiving are therefore no longer available 
many ailing thrifts particularly those in texas had offered 
cheap rates on mortgages and higher rates on savings as part of a 
struggle to gain more customers 
to remain competitive some healthy institutions attempted to 
match those rates all that was a bonanza to venturesome depositors 
who couldnt lose because federal deposit insurance guaranteed their 
money was safe 
some experts predict that as more problem thrifts are 
restructured or taken over by healthy sampls or banks bargain rates 
will disappear 
that already has happened to some degree in texas where the 
industry has been especially stressed due to a collapse in the oil 
and real estate markets there earlier this decade 
two years ago texas thrifts offered about three quarters of the 
top 100 highest yields on deposits and today they make up only 3 
percent according to heady 
even more significant heady said is that the difference between 
yields offered by thrifts vs banks has been narrowing when the 
bailout bill was signed into law thrift yields were nearly a half 
percentage point higher than bank yields but that has narrowed to 
less than a quarter of a percentage point he said 
but for now overall deposit rates actually have risen since 
enactment of the bailout due largely to a betterthanexpected 
economic picture analysts say 
according to bank rate monitor the nationwide average rate on 
money market accounts was unchanged from aug 9 to sept 6 at 626 
percent while rates on oneyear cds were up nearly a quarter 
percentage point over that period at 797 percent

here are some facts consumers should know about the new savings 
and loan bailout plan which president bush signed into law aug 9 
all deposits up to 100000 are protected per institution even 
if a thrift has been seized by the federal government 
if you have more than 100000 in an institution seized by the 
federal government the excess portion may also be protected 
provided its held in joint accounts with a member of the immediate 
family 
individual retirement accounts are insured separately from other 
accounts also at up to 100000 
the principal on your certificate of deposit is insured up to 
100000 but the rate isnt guaranteed if your thrift is sold to a 
healthy institution the rate on the cd might be lowered 
if your thrift is sold youll generally have to wait only a few 
days to get your federally insured deposits up to 100000 if you 
have more than 100000 you must file a legal claim to it just like 
any other creditor

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
higher this morning on the chicago board of trade struggling to 
recover from the steep losses of the previous session 
prices had fallen sharply wednesday amid speculation that the 
agriculture department would take measures to increase wheat acreage 
and boost supplies 
todays early gains were underpinned in part by confirmation of a 
sale of 140000 metric tons of wheat wednesday to the philippines at 
subsidized prices and by a report that poor yields would force the 
soviet union to buy 40 million metric tons of grain from the world 
market in the coming year 
that report was offset though by another report quoting oleg 
klimov head of the soviet grainbuying agency as saying the 
soviets had completed their grain buying for this year 
further buying was linked to a pair of national weather service 
forecasts a sixto10 day outlook and 30day outlook predicting 
continued wet weather for the western corn belt through midoctober 
which could hamper the corn and soybean harvest 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 387 a bushel corn 
was cent lower to cent higher with september at 233 a bushel 
oats were unchanged to cent higher with september at 134 a 
bushel and soybeans were 2 cents lower to cent higher with 
september at 587 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange with frozen pork belly futures locked 
up the 2centsapound daily limit following wednesdays statement 
by a bush administration official that the odds were very good that 
the united states would include pork bellies in a foodaid package 
to poland 
live cattle futures were 18 cent to 65 cent higher with october 
at 7262 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent to 28 cent 
higher with september at 8315 cents a pound hogs were 13 cent to 
70 cent higher with october at 4045 cents a pound and frozen pork 
bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with february at 4805 
cents a pound 
cattle futures settled higher on wednesday while pork futures 
were mixed

retail and real estate holding company campeau corp remained in 
an uncertain financial position today as discussions continued on a 
definitive plan to borrow money from a major stockholder 
campeau spokeswoman carol sanger declined to comment on the 
status of the talks 
meanwhile trading in campeau stock remained halted today on the 
toronto stock exchange pending an announcement from the company 
sanger couldnt say when the company would issue any news besides 
its secondquarter financial results which were released today the 
stock had been halted wednesday 
campeau reported it lost 124 million in the three months ended 
july 31 on revenue of 226 billion compared to a loss of 109 
million and revenue of 221 billion a year earlier 
campeaus allied stores corp and federated department stores 
inc units both facing credit squeezes as they stock up inventory 
ahead of christmas said wednesday there was no guarantee that 
campeau could obtain financing in time to meet debt repayment 
deadlines 
the news sent allied and federated highyield junk bonds 
plummeting wednesday by as much as 15 points or 150 per 1000 in 
face value the bonds were moderately lower in early trading today 
slipping another 10 to 20 per 1000 to yield in excess of 20 
percent although few bonds were changing hands 
allied and federated also indicated that control of their 
corporate parent could change hands after a definitive agreement is 
reached with olympia amp york developments ltd which has agreed in 
principle to lend campeau 250 million 
certain elements of the agreement in principle with olympia amp 
york might be deemed to constitute a change in control of campeau 
allied and federated said in quarterly documents submitted to 
the securities and exchange commission that were made public 
wednesday 
a campeau spokeswoman said discussions were in progress and 
details of the loan agreement with olympia amp york wouldnt be 
released until it was definitive 
it has been widely assumed that olympia amp york which has a 245 
stake in campeau would gain a larger interest in campeau in 
exchange for granting the loan there has been speculation that 
chairman robert campeau who owns nearly 54 percent of the 
torontobased company would relinquish controlling interest 
campeau trying to cope with a debt load approaching 10 billion 
late tuesday said its board of directors approved a plan in 
principle under which olympia amp york would loan it 250 million to 
cover working capital needs at allied and federated 
the board also authorized campeaus intention to sell the 
16store bloomingdales department store chain which is part of 
federated 
two potential bidders have confirmed their interest in 
bloomingdales marvin s traub the chains chairman and chief 
executive officer and crown american corp one of the countrys 
leading developers of shopping malls 
certain unspecified lender and creditor concurrences are required 
before campeau enters a definitive pact with olympia amp york campeau 
said tuesday noting that there was no assurance of getting the 
concurrences 
campeau is facing a friday deadline to secure financing 
arrangements that federated needs to buy back 400 million of notes 
held by three underwriters 
the lenders first boston corp painewebber inc and dillon read 
amp co had agreed to hold the notes until dec 1 provided certain 
conditions were met including a condition that the financing 
commitments to repurchase the notes were obtained by friday 
if campeau fails to get these commitments by friday the 
underwriters have the right to up to 696 percent of federateds 
common stock which is being held in an escrow account

the senate today moved toward final passage of 
a total ban on smoking aboard airliners after voting to halt 
delaying tactics by tobaccostate lawmakers 
after losing a pair of procedural votes by substantial margins 
senators from cigaretteindustry states accepted the inevitable and 
abandoned their efforts to dilute the proposed tougher restrictions 
the provision banning cigarette smoking aboard all domestic 
airline flights was then formally adopted by the senate on a voice 
vote final passage of a spending bill containing the language was 
possible later in the day 
on the key vote the senate voted 7721 to prevent a filibuster 
by cigarette industry supporters who had promised to bring 
legislative action to a standstill unless the smoking ban was 
limited to short flights tobacco lawmakers then lost a second 
procedural vote 6534 
supporters of the measure to prohibit smoking aboard all us 
airline flights had said in advance that they had the 60 votes 
needed to invoke cloture and halt the filibuster 
no doubt about it the chief sponsor sen frank lautenberg 
dnj said wednesday 
smokingban opponents served notice that even if they lost they 
would keep trying to block the proposal which is part of an 119 
billion transportation spending bill for next year sen ernest 
hollings dsc promised to try to quash the smoking measure on 
procedural grounds 
ive got 25000 or 30000 tobacco farmers in north carolina to 
whom i have made a commitment that id protect their interests as 
long as im in the us senate said sen jesse helms rnc 
and im going to do that 
elms said lautenberg may end up rolling us but he will know 
that he has been in a fight 
tobacco state lawmakers sensing the fight was not going their 
way said they would settle for a permanent extension of the current 
smoking ban on flights of two hours or less 
that restriction which covers 80 percent of all us routes 
will otherwise expire next april the house on aug 3 adopted a 
provision making the twohour rule permanent 
in offering to accept the permanent ban on short flights sen 
wendell ford dky said he and his allies would slow the senates 
work on other matters if the other side persisted in seeking broader 
restrictions congressional leaders want to finish 13 spending bills 
by the oct 1 start of fiscal 1990 
theres more at stake here i think than just the question of 
smoking on airliners ford said its a question of the budget 
so the rest of world can work 
airline employees and health groups have pressed for a total 
smoking ban on aircraft claiming that cigarette fumes can cause a 
risk of cancer and other diseases for everyone aboard a flight 
tobacco interests say there is no proof that cigarette smoke 
endangers nonsmokers and argue that there are plenty of other 
chemicals in recirculated aircraft cabin air 
meanwhile surgeon general c everett koop on wednesday 
criticized us tobacco marketing at home and abroad saying america 
is not respected overseas because of the manner in which we export 
disease and death 
koop said the epithet ugly american will indeed come home 
to roost in a decade or two when the developing countries of today 
realize what we did to them 
he also told a house subcommittee the wide availability of 
cigarette vending machines in the united states makes a mockery of 
laws forbidding minors to buy cigarettes 
he supported a bill sponsored by rep thomas luken dohio that

british petroleum co plc said thursday it was 
selling 131 billion in assets and cutting its work force by 17 
percent in a major restructuring aimed at boosting efficiency and 
focusing on higherrisk higherreward oil exploration 
bp the worlds fourthlargest oil company said it would sell 
exploration assets in the north sea and six other countries to oryx 
energy co one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in 
the united states 
bp said it has agreed to sell 9 percent of its british 
exploration assets in the north sea including four oil and 
gasproducing fields five prospective developments and 42 
unexplored blocks 
it said it would slash 1700 jobs in scotland london and 
houston the cuts are to be achieved through early retirement and 
voluntary departures but the company didnt rule out layoffs 
the londonbased oil giant said the streamlining should reduce 
overhead by more than 150 million a year 
bp exploration is being reorganized into three regional operating 
companies and international technology division and a global gas 
unit bp said 
bps shares fell on the news they finished at 320 pence or 
499 a share on londons stock exchange down 5 pence or 8 cents 
from wednesdays close 
we have to get into a position where our assets are working 
most efficiently john browne chief executive officer of bp 
exploration told a news conference 
bps margins were being pressured by higher costs higher taxes 
greater regulation and environmental and safety concerns browne 
said 
we havent taken the meataxe to the company were preparing 
not only for today but also for tomorrow he said were 
shifting our focus to ensure that we put enough money into frontier 
exploration 
browne said the proceeds from the asset sale would allow the 
company to invest in areas it believes have more potential 
vietnam ethiopia the gulf of mexico and the western margins of the 
british continental shelf 
the sale package includes assets in ecuador gabon dubai italy 
colombia and indonesia 
oryx energy based in dallas was formed when sun oil of the 
united states spun off its us exploration and production business 
as the sun exploration and production co in november 1988 it was 
renamed in may 1989 
there will be more asset disposals if exploration turns up 
something that would be more useful to someone else well sell 
it browne said 
nick clayton an analyst at the london investment firm smith new 
court plc said effectively this is recognition by bp that one of 
the means of improving profitability when crude oil prices are not 
rising dramatically is to focus on the cost aspect of the profit 
equation 
john toalster an analyst at the london investment firm hoare 
govett ltd said its essentially the clearing of the desk the 
clearing for horton to take over and to have a company that is 
more lean and efficient one that is more poised for the future 
toalster was referring to bps 50yearold deputy chairman 
robert horton who is to take over as chairman upon sir peter 
walters retirement in march at the age of 59 the leadership change 
was announced last week 
clayton said bp obtained a very full price for its assets 
it represents an excellent deal for bp and demonstrates their 
ability to extract value out of their portfolio 
bp is raising cash to reduce its debt and probably to build up a 
war chest for another major takeover probably an american company 
the analysts speculated 
toalster said it would want to increase is exposure in the 
usa and into gas and ideally acquire some assets in the 
developing world 
but clayton said the next few months will be spent polishing 
the balance sheet by reducing debt 
any move to make a major acquisition would follow when bob 
horton takes over he said 
the restructuring follows bps 44 billion acquisition of 
britoil plc last year bp purchased the 45 percent of standard oil 
co of ohio it didnt already own for 79 billion in 1987 
in may bp agreed to sell its mineral interests to the british 
mining group rtz corp for 65 billion bp also is planning to sell 
its coal business later in the year for an undisclosed amount 
bp is trying to narrow the gap with royal dutchshell group of 
cos and exxon corp the two biggest oil companies toalster said 
mobil corp ranks third 
the only way to do this is to move the company up in terms of 
the risk profile you have to increase the risk element you cant 
achieve that kind of growth without incurring risk the analyst 
said

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher thursday on the chicago board of trade boosted by a proposal 
to send 500000 metric tons of corn to poland as part of a foodaid 
package 
rumors of soviet buying interest prompted further buying of corn 
futures but the rally was weak with most contracts gaining less than 
3 cents a bushel 
this was a pretty thin tight market and it had a difficult 
time recovering from yesterdays debacle said dale gustafson an 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
grain and soybean prices had fallen sharply across the board 
wednesday on perceptions of weakening export demand for wheat and 
speculation that the agriculture department was planning moves to 
increase 198990 wheat acreage 
the 225 billion polish food aid package proposed thursday by 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy also includes 
500000 metric tons of sorghum 100000 metric tons of wheat 20 
million to 30 million pounds of pork and 10000 metric tons of 
butter 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 385 a bushel corn 
futures were 1 cents lower to 3 cents higher with september at 
237 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents higher with september 
at 134 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to 3 cents higher 
with september at 585 a bushel

junk bond trading slowed thursday as the cash 
crunch at campeau corp weighed heavily on the market with traders 
considering whether the companys problems were a forerunner of 
trouble in a wide variety of the highrisk securities 
admissions that campeaus allied stores corp and federated 
department stores inc units could default on their debt payments 
triggered a broad junk bond selloff wednesday that included issues 
regarded as among the most stable and attractive 
critics long have contended that junk bonds highinterest 
securities frequently used to finance corporate buyouts were ripe 
for a fall especially in a slow economy the notion is that many 
companies loaded with junk bond debt would default on interest 
payments either because they would be unable to raise as much money 
as expected from their cash flows or the sale of divisions 
several companies with major junk bond debts such as the revco 
ds drug store chain this year have sought bankruptcy protection 
or encountered serious financial troubles 
market experts considered wednesdays selloff significant because 
it affected a broad range of junk bonds including issues regarded 
as relatively less risky 
there are so many different tiers in the junk bond market 
said john moran a trader at advest inc for the first time the 
whole market got weak 
moran pointed to colt industries 12 percent bonds due in the 
year 2001 as one quality junk issue that tumbled when campeau 
disclosed its troubles the bonds were down as much as 20 per 
1000 in face value wednesday and lost another 10 early thursday 
but robert levine president of kidder peabody high yield asset 
management said the decline was more of a technical correction 
because prices had been on the upswing recently furthermore there 
has been no change in the credit quality of most companies he said 
by thursday trading had slowed to a trickle as dealers took a 
waitandsee approach and awaited the pricing of new issues coming 
to market 
yields on the colt industries issue hovered around 12 percent in 
comparison yields quoted on some allied and federated issues soared 
well above 25 percent as prices plummeted 150 per 1000 in face 
value on wednesday and dropped as much as an additional 20 on 
thursday yields which rise to compensate for higher risk move in 
the opposite direction of prices 
when a bond is trading at a 25 percent yield it means theyre 
not going to pay said anthony naylor a senior vice president at 
rodman amp renshaw inc 
campeau used billions of dollars from the sale of junk bonds to 
finance its 88 billion takeover of federated last year not only 
did he pay top dollar for the retail chain but a stagnant consumer 
market dashed his plans for relying on cash flow to pay down the 
debt 
federated is scheduled to make an interest payment friday 
reported by some to be 50 million 
campeau meanwhile was scrambling to line up financing from 
torontobased olympia amp york developments ltd to pay the debt any 
success in getting more financing for allied and federated which 
are in dire need of credit so they can stock up on inventory ahead 
of the christmas shopping season would help not only to prop up 
those precarious issues but the market in general 
last week campeau put its flagship bloomingdales department 
store chain on the auction block in an effort to raise cash 
traders said they had not yet detected any significant selling by 
mutual funds that invest in junk bonds a trend that could severely 
hit the market if it materialized 
moran said managers are studying the situation and are not 
likely to act hastily besides the whole thing is up in the 
air he said noting that campeau could succeed in its 
restructuring plans 
the markets latest woes come less than five months after the 
indictment of junk bond king michael milken the former drexel 
burham lambert inc executive who virtually created the current 200 
billion arena for highrisk securities 
shortly milken was indicted on racketeering and other charges 
the market took a major hit with some issues falling as much as 50 
per 1000 in face value a heavy supply of new bonds fears of a 
recession and rumors of massive mutual fund sales also worked to 
weaken the securities at that time

the industrial states of the midwest and 
northeast are pulling out of the population doldrums and adding 
people once again the census bureau reported thursday 
the industrialbased states of indiana michigan and ohio 
continue to recover from the early 1980s population losses the 
bureau said these three states added more population between 1986 
and 1988 than in the previous five years combined 
in addition the northeasts population growth between 1985 and 
1988 was the highest since the late 1960s the bureau said 
and the report came just one day after the bureau and the 
department of agriculture reported that the nations rural 
population had halted its longterm decline 
growth was sluggish in states with energybased economies the 
bureau added particularly alaska louisiana oklahoma texas west 
virginia and wyoming 
but the other trends notwithstanding the bureau noted that the 
nations overall growth pattern continues to favor sun belt states 
like california and florida 
at least since 1970 the western region has remained the fastest 
growing section of the nation with the south second the bureau 
noted in the study state population and household estimates with 
age sex and components of change 198188 
the east north central states increased by 443000 from 1985 to 
1988 after population losses during the 198085 period the report 
said indiana michigan and ohio added more population in the 
threeyear period between 1986 and 1988 than in the previous 
sixyear period 
the northeast lost population between 1975 and 1980 but has since 
recovered the report said and annual growth of 05 percent between 
1985 and 1988 is the highest since 1970 indeed half of new 
englands growth between 1980 and 1988 has occurred just since 1985 
slowed growth and population losses have plagued several 
farmoriented states in recent years but the bureau concluded 
the downward slide seems to have reversed last year iowa showed 
a slight new immigration as did nebraska and south dakota has 
slowed its outmigration enough to experience population growth for 
two consecutive years 
the sluggish population growth in energydependent states is a 
continuing problem with west virginia losing people every year in 
this decade and even texas which added 59000 people in the year 
ending july 30 1988 far below its peak growth of 198182 when it 
agined 609000 
in fact texas experienced net outmigration last year for the 
second year in a row the report said 
here is a statebystate list showing the population of the 
states according to the 1980 census and the estimates for 1985 and 
1988 in thousands

treasury minister guido carli on thursday blamed top 
officials of banca nazionale del lavoro for a scandal at its 
atlanta ga branch and said the banks credit exposure to iraq had 
reached about 3 billion 
carlis declaration made before the senate finance and treasury 
committee was his first public statement about the scandal that has 
shaken italys largest commercial bank which is 74percent owned by 
the treasury 
the exposure is the result of credit extensions by the atlanta 
branch that the bank says werent authorized by either the bnl north 
american management or the head office in rome 
carlis assessment of the banks credit exposure was well above 
bnls own asssessment the bank said last week that it had extended 
up to 264 billion in credits of which 920 million hadnt yet 
been disbursed 
carli held former management responsible for the scandal saying 
officials had failed to establish proper procedures for checking 
operations at the atlanta branch 
the investigations have allowed us to reconstruct some of the 
techniques used to hide the irregular operations despite the 
falsifications perpetrated traces were left in the official records 
and therefore should not have been able to escape accurate internal 
controls he said 
the banks atlanta branch extended the credits to iraq without 
reporting them on the official books 
carli said that following the atlanta affair banca nazionale 
will need no less than 14 trillion lire or 1 billion in 
fresh capital funds to meet the capital adequacy ratios set by the 
bank of italy the countrys central bank 
he said he would proceed with a previously announced plan to 
raise banca nazionales capital through the creation of an alliance 
between bnl and the state insurance agency ina and the state pension 
fund inps 
a further step could come from a partial privatization of the 
bank carli suggested 
carli indicated he intends to enlarge the role of the private 
sector in the italian banking business currently about 80 percent 
of the italian banking system is governmentowned 
banca nazionale has said it doesnt expect to incur losses from 
the atlanta affair because all transactions were guaranteed either 
by the us commodity credit corporation or by the central bank of 
iraq 
carli and bank of italy governor carlo a ciampi last week 
pressured bnl chairman nerio nesi and general manager giacomo pedde 
into assuming responsibility for the affair and forced them to 
resign 
carli said an investigation by the bank of italy in the wake of 
the affair showed that banca nazionale did not have sufficient 
internal controls 
he also confirmed that the bank of england has asked banca 
nazionale to limit its activities at its london investment banking 
unit to trading until bnls internal system of controls was 
improved bnl has denied the bank of england had found any 
irresgularities at the bnl investment bank in london

analysts said the market remained unsettled by recent pressure on 
the market for highyield junk bonds of companies carrying large 
debt loads 
the worries focused on the problems of campeau corp which is in 
the process of trying to restructure its retailing empire to keep up 
with its debt obligations 
whatever the outcome of campeaus efforts observers said its 
problems clouded prospects for new debtfinanced acquisitions by 
other bidders in the immediate future 
brokers also noted that traders were proceeding cautiously in 
advance of the quarterly triple witching hour involving a series 
of expiring stockindex options and futures 
the government reported this morning that retail sales increased 
07 percent in august slightly below most advance estimates the 
news provided some support for us treasury securities nudging 
interest rates a bit lower in that sector of the credit markets 
but stocks got little benefit from those developments

in less than a year on its own oryx energy co 
changed its name announced plans to build the first skyscraper in 
dallas in years and embarked on its longpromised international 
expansion 
oryx has agreed to pay 131 billion for some north sea and other 
exploration assets of british petroleum co plc both companies said 
thursday 
besides the north sea the reserves are in indonesia dubai 
ecuador colombia gabon and italy oryx estimates the total proved 
and probable reserves to be about 405 million barrels increasing 
the companys oil and gas reserves by 30 percent 
this is precisely the type of acquisition that meets our stated 
goals said oryx chairman robert p hauptfuhrer in terms of 
size it is significant but well within our means these properties 
are a strategic fit for oryx energy and create a balanced portfolio 
worldwide 
on the new york stock exchange oryx fell 225 to 3787 in 
active trading on a generally down day on the market 
hauptfuhrer said production from the former bp properties will be 
about 34 million barrels next year most of it from five north sea 
fields remaining stable until 1994 when an increase to 36 million 
barrels is projected 
the purchase will be paid for through new debt which will be 
retired through cash flow some divestiture and reduced capital 
spending 
for the first half of this year oryx had net earnings of 119 
million on revenues of 610 million improvements over a loss of 
278 million on 664 million in revenue in the first six months of 
1988 the 1988 period included a 395 million writedown of oil and 
gas properties and other charges 
oryx north americas largest independent oil and gas company 
became a separate entity on nov 1 1988 when it was spun off from 
sun co formerly known as sun exploration and production co oryx 
changed its name on may 3 to reflect its independence 
since being spun off oryx executives have frequently said they 
wanted the company to become an important player and at the 
annual meeting last may hauptfuhrer promised shareholders we are 
ready to seize the appropriate opportunity to make a significant 
acquisition but were not going to be stampeded into making a 
deal 
oryx also has worked to extend its domestic resources and has 
replaced about 90 percent of its reserves it also recently 
announced plans to drill as many as 85 wells in texas next year if 
regulators approve the companys horizontal drilling operations 
off the oil field oryx announced in july it would occupy a new 
26 to 28story office tower on the citys north side the building 
which oryx will lease is the first announcement of a new skyscraper 
in dallas in a number of years and comes despite an abundance of 
empty office space

rallied on news of a foodaid package to poland energy futures fell 
and precious metals were mixed

aug 20 and a highland valley copper co mine in british columbia 
that has been shut down by a strike since july 6 
weatherrelated problems at another mine in papua new guinea and 
a recent strike by zambian copper miners have also contributed to 
the supply jitters analysts said 
theres still about 600000 tons of capacity shut down and 
thats a substantial tonnage said fred demler a metals economist 
in new york with drexel burnham lambert inc 
i think the market realizes that even if all the problems were 
resolved today there would still be tightness in refined supply for 
several months he said 
analyst stephen platt of dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
said the shutdowns of the bouganville and highland valley mines have 
cut off two of the far easts major sources of copper 
platt said buying by chinese interests was a key factor in 
thursdays rally

president bush prodded by congressional 
leaders to do more for the new polish government announced thursday 
he will double to 100 million next years us food aid to that 
nation 
this new assistance is one element of our continuing effort 
working with our allies and others to support the process of change 
that is underway in poland bush said in a statement 
foods to be sent to poland all coming from existing surpluses 
include beef pork corn butter butter oil sunflower oil cotton 
and rice 
the aid for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 will follow 84 
million in emergency food aid sent to poland this year 
the food aid doubling the previously announced 50 million is 
separate from a 119 million package of economic assistance to 
poland previously announced by the white house 
bush saying that high prices and food shortages have placed a 
particularly heavy burden on the polish people commented we 
expect that shipments of the new assistance will arrive in time for 
the difficult winter months 
the presidential announcement came in the face of mounting 
congressional pressure for bush to do more to aid the new government 
in poland the first in eastern europe since world war ii to have a 
noncommunist prime minister 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan who visited poland last 
month with his wife transportation secretary elizabeth dole has 
pressed for an increase in us food aid 
separately on thursday the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee sen patrick leahy dvt proposed that the united 
states increase its food assistance to poland to 25 billion 
poland is a country with a history of food riots leahy said 
it does no good to say seek freedom unless we can point to 
poland and say they did and see what they got 
after the presidents announcement leahy called bushs proposal 
a welcome but stopgap effort that fails to give poland the 
longterm help it needs to restructure its agricultural economy and 
to sustain the worlds newest democracy 
besides food itself leahys proposal would provide technical 
assistance from the agriculture department and would forgive 2 
billion in polish agricultural debt 
in announcing the new package bush said it is intended that 
the food aid will support longterm reform of the polish 
agricultural system by providing much needed commodities during a 
transitional period toward a market economy 
he said the package underscores our continuing commitment to 
assist the polish government and people in their efforts to 
introduce market principles and to build a private sector that will 
enable poland to invigorate its economy 
while the initial 50 million is mostly in grants the new 50 
million installment will be composed of grants subsidized sales and 
some lowinterest loans administration officials said 
in advance of the white house announcement state department 
officials extended assurances to poland and its congressional 
supporters 
the polish government can count on our continued support 
said department spokesman richard boucher 
we felt that additional measures might be appropriate he 
said 
while bush announced the earlier aid during a trip to poland 
earlier this summer the administration has moved reluctantly in 
offering new aid to the solidarityled government of prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki suggesting poland should demonstrate its ability 
to make the transition to more of an openmarket economy first 
lech walesa the solidarity leader whose noncommunist trade 
union movement commands a dominant role in the warsaw government 
has called for 10 billion in emergency assistance including 27 
billion from the international monetary fund 3 billion from the 
world bank and 41 billion in new bilateral credits 
walesa plans a november visit to washington

amid jitters in the junk bond market he helped 
create former drexel burnham lambert inc financier michael milken 
said thursday there is tremendous opportunity for highyield 
bonds despite a rash of recent defaults 
milken who is widely credited with reshaping corporate america 
through the use of highyield debt securities but now faces federal 
fraud and racketeering charges sought to dispel the notion that an 
economic recession could adversely affect junk bonds 
people perceive that if a recession happens something is going 
to happen milken told a conference on highyield debt im not 
sure what a recession means what it means for the cable industry 
what it means for the entertainment industry what it means for the 
cellular industry 
he urged the traders and other junk bond executives to evaluate 
companies worth on a casebycase rather than industrybyindustry 
basis because not all businesses and companies would necessarily 
fare badly 
junk bonds are highinterest securities frequently used to 
finance corporate buyouts but predominantly used to raise capital 
for smaller companies 
critics say that in an economic slowdown companies loaded with 
highinterest junk bond debt would default on payments either 
because they would be unable to raise as much money as expected from 
their cash flows or the sale of divisions 
several companies with major junk debts have sought bankruptcy 
protection defaulted on payments or encountered serious financial 
troubles this year 
milken and two others were charged in a 98count indictment in 
march alleging conspiracy racketeering insider trading and other 
securities law violations stemming from his involvement in corporate 
takeovers at drexel 
he resigned from drexel in june to form his own financial 
consulting firm and prepare his defense for a trial set to begin 
next march 
milken spoke at a conference on investing and trading in 
highyield debt in new york sponsored by the institute for 
international research milken has appeared at similar events 
several times since his indictment 
his talk thursday came after a large junk bond selloff a day 
earlier when campeau corp indicated it might default on debt 
payments at two of its department store affiliates campeau financed 
the buyouts of the companies with junk bonds 
milken who declined after his speech to comment on campeaus 
situation said low interest rates on longterm government 
securities and strong equity markets this year create a positive 
climate to help finance businesses that need to grow 
there is tremendous opportunity out there today he said 
the market is saying give us more equity turn your debt into 
equity hopefully more people will listen milken added 
milken received an ovation from the roughly 130 people attending 
the conference and was praised for pioneering the 200 billion junk 
bond market 
he really did this essentially by himself with his notes his 
sales ability and his telephone paul t owens president of 
berkeley capital management and chairman of the financial research 
group said in introducing milken 
but owens added indirectly referring to milkens legal 
troubles he wont be able to tell you how he did it

exxons infusion of thousands of oilspill 
cleanup workers and millions of dollars into prince william sound 
did as much harm as good fishermen charged thursday as the 
sixmonth cleanup ground to a halt 
its time that everyone realizes that no amount of money in the 
world is going to restore prince william sound to a pristine 
condition said riki ott of cordova district fishermen united 
while about a third of the sounds fishing fleet worked for exxon 
this summer and in some cases profited handsomely fishermen who 
opted to fish suffered from a restricted salmon season and a poor 
catch 
with most of the sound closed for fishing fishermen were forced 
to compete in a small area for a few fish this year we were like 
rats penned inside a cage said dave clarke of the prince william 
sound seiners association 
in addition businesses that depend on fishermen suffered because 
much of exxons cash was not spent on fishing supplies and gear 
clarke said 
the money spill has probably been as devastating as the oil 
spill clarke said 
the fishermens observations came at a news conference as exxon 
continued to return the last of the cleanup workers from oiltainted 
shorelines in the sound exxon officials said they expect to declare 
the summer cleanup over friday 25 weeks after the tanker exxon 
valdez cracked open on a reef and spilled nearly 11 million gallons 
of crude oil 
while the fishermen did not criticize their colleagues for 
accepting exxons cash they said the money has caused an emotional 
division between those who accepted and those who did not fishermen 
scraping by this season fear they may be at a competitive 
disadvantage next year because they cant afford better boats and 
gear 
the money has become just another stress factor from the 
spill clarke said 
ott said the cleanup effort stemmed more from public relations 
needs than environmental concerns once the friday cleanup deadline 
was set exxon began using warmer water and higher pressure to hose 
down the oiled shorelines faster doing more harm than good she 
said 
the beach cleanup should not be evaluated on the amount spent 
the amount of equipment and people working on it it should be 
evaluated on its effectiveness ott said 
ott said her group favors a permanent scaleback of the 
cleanup with smaller strike forces set up to respond to 
sensitive areas threatened by oil washing off the shorelines 
we dont want thousands of people on the beaches again she 
said it was about as bad as the oil spill itself 
at the height of the cleanup exxon had about 12000 people 
working on the effort about 3000 of them on the shorelines 
the only tasks remaining as of friday were moppingup and 
shoreline treatment with fertilizer to stimulate microorganisms 
attack on the oil exxon spokesman joe tucker said 
the final 700 shoreline workers will be returned to valdez 
through saturday tucker said they will be joined by about 400 
sailors and marines who will arrive next weekend for three days of 
leave in the busy oil port 
exxon officials have said they will monitor the spill over the 
winter and reevaluate the need to resume shoreline cleanup next 
spring

a computer network linking statelevel 
securities regulators in the united states and canada is among the 
goals for the 1990s proposed by the incoming head of the north 
american securities administrators association 
in remarks prepared for delivery thursday night in quebec at the 
72nd annual fall conference of the statelevel regulators group 
susan bryant said the most significant issue in the next decade 
will be the internationalization of the securities markets 
i intend to see to it that the states emerge as major players 
in international securities regulation said ms bryant who heads 
the oklahoma department of securities 
toward that goal she proposed extending an existing computer 
linkup among securities regulators in the 50 states to all the 
canadian provinces and territories 
the national association of securities dealers a selfregulatory 
group and the securities and exchange commission the federal 
agency that regulates the stock and bond markets created the 
national computer network 
the system helps regulators keep tabs on individuals offering 
securities who have violated state or federal regulations 
to fight international securities fraud we will need a truly 
global system for spotting and tracking violators said ms bryant 
this will make north america the first continent in the world 
in which grassroots securities regulators will be wired together in 
order to fight securities fraud and abuse said ms bryant
