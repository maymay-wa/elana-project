president bush attacking saddam hussein from 
the campaign trail tuesday said iraqs military must not be 
allowed to benefit frm any humanitarian shipments of food and 
medicine intended for innocent civilians 
he also said there is no reason the persian gulf crisis should 
keep politicians from actively campaigning i am sure every 
democrat agrees we will not allow our political life to be held 
hostage to a crisis bush said 
bush made his comments in gop fundraising events in denver and 
los angeles at the start of a twoday trip on wednesday he will 
campaign in san francisco before returning to washington 
we mean to keep the sanctions in place to keep the pressure 
on and prove to saddam hussein that aggression does not pay 
bush said he said iraqs invasion of kuwait has caused misery 
and suffering for millions 
the chief beneficiaries of bushs visits were rep hank brown 
who is trying to move up to the colorado senate seat being vacated 
by republican sen william armstrong and sen pete wilson in a 
close race for governor in california 
wilsons race is the no 1 target for the gop this year and 
bushs appearances were expected to raise 2 million 
in his speeches bush combined his assault against saddam with 
standard campaign appeals to congress for action on the budget 
deficit anticrime legislation and an overhaul of the clean air 
act 
its time to reach a binding budget agreement that shows the 
american people that we are serious about real deficit reduction 
bush said 
he also called for energy conservation and development of 
alternative fuel sources to curb dependence on foreign oil weve 
indulged a dangerous habit as a nation far too long he said 
despite the partisan nature of his outing bush avoided any 
direct criticism of democrats however democrats seized on the 
occasion to twit bush on allegations that his son neil acted 
improperly in the 1 billion failure of a denver savings and loan 
dick freese chairman of the colorado democratic party issued a 
statement challenging bush to turn over the profits from browns 
fundraiser to the savings and loan bailout 
any good father knows what needs to be done freese said 
when our boys hit a ball through a neighbors window we dont 
make the guy next door pay to fix his own window we get it fixed 
and work with the kids to make good on it 
bush did not comment in his speech on the sampl scandal 
discussing the persian gulf bush raised the possibility that 
humanitarian aid eventually may have to be sent to iraq to offset 
hardships resulting from un sanctions and a blockade on iraqi 
commerce 
should aid become necessary he said it must be 
distributed under strict international supervision to make certain 
that emergency aid reaches those iraqis who need it most 
we cannot allow saddam hussein to divert needed humanitarian 
aid in order to sustain his army of occupation the president 
said 
in a speech in los angeles bush said the gulf crisis requires 
that patriotism take precedence over politics 
so its good that politics stop at the waters edge but that 
still leaves a lot of america in between bush said from long 
beach to long island we should and we will vigorously campaign 
right up to the november election 
for those of us at home he added we can serve our country 
by being the best candidates the best citizens and yes the best 
republicans and democrats we can be 
struggling to maintain a global consensus against iraqs 
aggression bush has kept the persian gulf crisis at the center of 
his public appearances while congress and the public stand united 
behind his policy bush has been expressing concern that the 
support might fade in a prolonged desert showdown with saddam 
never before has the world community been so united bush 
said never since the invasion began has iraq stood so isolated 
and alone the key is collective action sharing the 
responsibilities and the risks the challenges and the costs he 
said more than 20 countries have forces in the gulf 
he said that despite the gulf crisis we can all see the 
outlines emerging of a stronger more peaceful world order 
and let me be clear with all thats at stake the world will 
not allow one dictators aggressive ambitions to stand in the 
way 
flying to denver on air force one bush signed into law a bill 
allowing members of the armed forces in the persian gulf to send 
mail to the united states without cost the law covers the sending 
of letters and recorded tapes

oklahoma became the first state in the 
nation to put a limit on the length of service of state legislators 
by giving overwhelming approval tuesday to a constitutional 
amendment 
the amendment which becomes effective jan 1 puts a lifetime 
cap of 12 years on legislative service legislators currently in 
office will be allowed to serve 12 more years 
with 95 percent of the precincts reporting yes votes 
outnumbered nos by 427347 to 205023 or 68 percent to 32 
percent 
tulsa businessman lloyd noble ii backed the circulation of an 
initiative petition to get the issue on the ballot he contended 
that the term limitation was needed to keep legislators from 
becoming entrenched in office and beholden to vested interests 
instead of the people they were supposed to serve 
opponents argued that a remedy already was available the 
ballot box they pointed out that only 16 members of the 48member 
state senate and 14 of the 101 house members had 12 or more years 
of service at the end of the 1990 legislative session 
the opponents also argued that voters would be giving up some of 
their rights by approving the term limitation bill but most 
observers had predicted from the outset it would pass particularly 
after the people approved another state question in 1989 that 
sharply limited the time the legislature can remain in session 
although state legislators elected this year will take office in 
november noble said he believed the 12year limit would apply to 
them 
colorado and california will vote on term limitation proposals 
nov 6 according to the national council of state legislatures 
similar legislation has been introduced in florida and new york 
the council said

editors nte the drama that plays daily in criminal 
courtrooms around the country is mostly tragedy and judge earl 
strayhorn knows its characters and sad speeches well still in 
this second part of the series city faces city fears the 
jurist who grew up in the inner city says he cannot let his 
sorrow and pity cloud the tough judgments he must make 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its late morning in judge earl strayhorns 
chambers and todays topic is wasted lives one young man is dead 
in a shooting over drugs another a 19yearold gang member will 
pay for the crime 
now its bargaining time 
the 19yearolds lawyer pleads for mercy the prosecutor talks 
of murder then the judge makes his offer 20 years take it or 
leave it 
minutes later the boyish cocaine dealer jaw jutting head 
cocked back defiantly pleads guilty to murder his mother 
straining to hear in the courts front row cups her tearful face 
in her hands as she leaves shes comforted by a youth whose 
tshirt has a moniker on the back killer 
so goes another day in the cook county courts another day where 
dreams die where mothers cry where the strangest and saddest 
stories are told where a few words from the honorable earl 
strayhorn can mean life or death 
yes this is justice the judge says of the fiveminute 
bargaining session he estimates saved seven trial days hes not 
walking away with a slap on the wrist twenty years aint chopped 
liver the penitentiary is not a country club 
for almost 20 years strayhorn has judged the crimes and 
misdemeanors of urban america this tarttongued veteran of the 
nations largest court system says hes a pragmatist not a 
dreamyeyed crusader out to right every wrong 
i am not societys avenging angel he declares i am not 
sitting in order to act as the conscience of society and to impose 
the horrible wrath of the lord on people who commit horrible 
crimes 
and he has heard his share the teen who threw her baby down a 
garbage chute into a compacter the guy who axed his grandmother to 
death the man who hacked off his lovers head and toes and mailed 
them 
life in this day and age is cheaper than a piece of meat in 
the meat market strayhorn says people will haggle over the 
cost of steak more than they will consider the worth of a human 
life 
i cope with that but he adds slowly i never get used to 
it 
in fact strayhorn believes the world has turned harsher since 
he first donned black robes more vicious crimes more drug use 
younger offenders 
but this man who has climbed the steps of the depressionera 
criminal courts building for 42 of his 72 years as a prosecutor 
defense attorney and now judge decided long ago not to allow the 
cruelty eat him up 
i put a shield on i dont let it get behind that shield he 
says sitting in his chambers lined with awards memorabilia and 
photos of his wife lawyerson doctordaughter and grandchild 
strayhorn disposes of 500 to 550 cases a year about 60 percent 
in pleas or bench trials in 1989 28647 felony cases were filed 
in the countys criminal division more than triple the number of a 
decade earlier officials say an estimated 75 percent were tied to 
drugs 
strayhorn says being a black raised in chicago he now lives a 
15minute drive from work better prepared him to be a judge he 
understands the environment and experiences of many who become 
court statistics 
but when the whitehaired bespectacled judge takes the bench in 
his cavernous marble and wood courtroom hes no soft touch 
why are you wearing that junk he snaps at a bearded drug 
offender whose earring he takes as a sign of gang membership 
when you come into court you better take it out youre caught 
with them their dirt is going to spill over on you and im going 
to send you to the penitentiary do you understand 
a suspected burglar fares no better his lawyer wants his bond 
reduced arguing that he supports four children strayhorn asks how 
much he gives the mother each week and questions his claim that a 
jobs waiting the man mumbles a confused answer 
strayhorn interrupts snarling at the lawyer dont make him 
lie tell him to shut up thats why hes here hes a liar 
you cant put anything over on the guy says jack murphy a 
prosecutor hes seen it all hes heard it all 
but strayhorn has a lighter side too he teases a balding 
lawyer this case has got all the hair on it you lost off your 
head he needles another youre starting off on the short end 
of the stick this one happened in my neighborhood 
and at a civil marriage ceremony for a jail inmate strayhorn 
suddenly looks up from his paperwork and barks hey man kiss 
her 
after a generation on the bench strayhorn says punishment 
remains the toughest part of the job 
he has imposed the death penalty twice though he morally 
opposes it and once sentenced a gang rapist to 125 years 
prompting the man to retort i hope you croak in bed tonight 
but he also acknowledges he probably gives more probation than 
other judges in about 85 percent of his cases 
my probation is harder to do than doing time he argues 
you have to use some selfdiscipline thats punishment 
particularly when they know what theyve got hanging over their 
head is a big sword 
if i send this malleable kid down to the penitentiary all 
hes going to learn down there is how to be a bigger worse 
crook he adds 
when ordering probation strayhorn always tells criminals what 
their prison sentences will be if they violate it he gives no 
second chances 
im arrogant he says i have confidence in myself i feel 
im better than most and as good as the best 
still he says not a day goes by that i dont remember that i 
am black and being a judge really hasnt changed that 
it becomes a theme when he speaks to groups of young people 
when does a black person become a nigger in our society he 
says he asks such groups and their eyes widen and then somebody 
says i dont know when i say when you leave the room 
the moral of the story i know im good but im still 
black that means im not going to receive the benefit of being 
good merely because i have been good im going to have to be 
something more 
strayhorn says he knows racism and other urban ills often are 
factors in crimes that doesnt sway him 
all i can do is put a bandaid on the cancer he says if 
i allow my sorrow and my pity and my understanding that there is an 
explainable reason this person is just a step above an animal if i 
allow the feeling to outweigh my judgment im not going to be a 
good judge

drug cases have clogged urban courts delayed 
civil matters overcrowded jails and stirred new debate over the 
best possible solution legalization or more judges 
if you want to look at the largest single cause of caseload 
glut drugs are it said albert alschuler professor at the 
university of chicago law school were having fewer and fewer 
trials particularly on the civil side no one can afford to wait 
the systems just become unworkable 
much of the impact is on state courts which process about 97 
percent of drug arrests but the federal system also is feeling the 
crunch consider 
drug cases in federal courts increased by 280 percent since 
1980 chief justice william rehnquist said last december in his 
annual endoftheyear report he urged congress to act immediately 
on a proposal to create new judgeships 
in july the senate judiciary committee approved a measure to 
create 77 new judgeships the bill is pending in the senate 
federal drug cases represented more than 26 percent of new 
criminal filings and up to 60 percent in some districts rehnquist 
said nearly 55 percent of criminal appeals involved drug offenses 
compared with 30 percent in 1980 
the drug caseload rose by 56 percent in 17 bigcity courts 
between 1983 and 1987 according to a 1989 report the impact of 
drug cases on case processing in urban trial courts among the 
major increases boston 175 percent jersey city nj 114 
percent the bronx borough of new york city 109 percent and 
oakland calif 95 percent 
drugrelated cases made up about a quarter of felonies 
disposed of in 26 bigcity courts in 1987 the report said it 
noted that number actuallyis low because it doesnt count 
incidents in which drugs were involved but didnt constitute the 
most serious charge 
the situation has turned even grimmer since then in detroit 
the percentage of state court drug cases more than doubled from 
1987 to 1989 said john goerdt the reports coauthor and senior 
staff attorney at the national center for state courts 
drug cases he added are starting to show up in family 
courts in juvenile courts with abused and neglected kids 
when courts are stressed nobody can render the same quality 
of justice said james fyfe a criminal justice professor at 
american university in washington dc we all know the old saw 
that justice delayed is justice denied evidence disappears 
recollections grow dimmer 
complicating matters experts say are new mandatory sentencing 
laws leading some defendants to seek trial rather than pleading 
guilty adding to the backlog 
in goerdts report jury trials in the 26 bigcity courts 
disposed of only 6 percent of all felonies in 1987 
while some propose more staff us district judge robert w 
sweet in new york last year became the first federal judge to 
publicly advocate drug legalization the burden is so great he 
said that in september 1989 no federal juries in manhattan were 
available to hear civil trials 
others who have previously supported legalization include 
baltimore mayor kurt schmoke and conservative columnist william f 
buckley 
regardless of different proposals experts agree the impact is 
enormous 
the taxpayers are spending lots of money to warehouse people 
in jail alschuler said inmates are sleeping on floors on 
mattresses everybody in the system suffers

bush administration and congressional budget 
negotiators were an impasse late monday after both sides made new 
offers that still left them far apart in the area of new taxes and 
with important disagreements over spending cuts 
congressional leaders of both parties and top administration 
aides planned to abandon the talks at nearby andrews air force base 
and instead were scheduled to meet at the us capitol on tuesday 
in an attempt to get the discussions going again 
bargainers said they were not giving up hope that a 
deficitcutting deal could ultimately be reached but they 
expressed uncertainty over how that could be done 
its not quite an impasse but its pretty close to one said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan after 10 grueling days 
there are still major differences on dozens of issues all the way 
from a for agriculture to z for enterprise zones 
its going to be tough but its still not impossible and no 
one is giving up dole continued the problem is were running 
out of time 
asked if the talks had collapsed sen phil gramm rtexas 
another negotiator said no but at this point weve reached an 
impasse were apart on every major area 
a democratic official involved in the talks speaking on 
condition of anonymity declined to call the bargaining at an 
impasse he said the only remaining areas of discord was over 
president bushs insistence that the package include a cut in the 
capital gains tax 
the lawmakers and administration officials had met for the last 
10 days at andrews in hopes the isolation from capitol hill might 
help them reach an agreement on ways to ease the deficit 
bush earlier monday called on the bargainers to complete a 
deficitreduction package but reiterated that he wanted a capital 
gains tax cut to be part of the deal 
weve made some headway recently in budget talks bush told 
reporters but it really is time now to get an agreement now i 
think we owe that to the american people 
negotiators at the talks which entered their tenth day have 
said the fight between democrats and republicans over reducing the 
capital gains tax rate is the key dispute blocking an agreement 
republicans have pushed to reduce that tax which is charged on 
the profits from the sales of property arguing that it would 
stimulate the economy but democrats have said the proposal would 
help almost exclusively the wealthy and have insisted that if it 
is included in the package there must also be a tax rate hike for 
the rich 
the bargainers meeting at andrews om nearby maryland swapped 
new budget cutting offers late monday both packages were aimed at 
reducing the deficit by about 50 billion next year and by 500 
billion through 1995 the two sides both wanted about 25 billion 
of the savings next year to come from new taxes and fees 
but the democrat offer was contingent on not having a capital 
gains cut as part of the package while the republican offer 
contained the cut and offset it by eliminating the deduction for 
state and local taxes for people earning more than 200000 
annually said one official close to the talks 
but republicans said there were major additional differences 
between the two sides that had caused the andrews talks to end 
they complained that while their package cut defense spending by 
170 billion over five years the democratic plan specified cuts of 
only 10 billion next year and 23 billion in fiscal 1992 the 
reductions for the three years beyond that were left unclear 
in recent days democrats had offered to cut military spending 
by 200 billion over the next five years 
republicans also complained that democrats were not willing to 
cut domestic programs deeply enough gop bargainers wanted to pare 
benefit programs like medicare by 1233 billion over the money 
they would need to stay even with inflation over the next five 
years democrats wanted to limit the cut to 1206 billion 
unless a deficitcutting package is in place by oct 1 the 
beginning of the next fiscal year the grammrudman law will 
automatically trigger about 100 billion in cuts in the 12 
trillion federal budget an amount considered high enough to 
seriously disrupt government operations 
there hasnt been one darn thing since we started that anybody 
has agreed on complained one of the bargainers rep silvio 
conte rmass earlier monday 
conte and house minority leader robert michel rill said some 
lawmakers are beginning to discuss legislation that would 
temporarily postpone the grammrudman spending cuts unless a budget 
deal is worked out both men said they opposed the idea but 
declined to say who was considering it 
ever since making it an issue during his 1988 election campaign 
bush has pushed to lower the top tax rate on capital gains the 
profits from the sale of property he has argued that a reduction 
would invigorate the economy by encouraging people to sell 
democrats have labeled the proposal a boon to the wealthy that 
would lower government revenues in the long run they have said 
that if the tax cut is to be included in a deficitcutting package 
they want it accompanied by higher income tax rates on the rich 
without a budget deal next years shortfall is expected to 
exceed 250 billion which would be the highest mark ever

san franciscos supervisors still enter their chambers through an 
archway braced by timbers 
the embarcadero freeway is still deserted weeds sprouting from 
cracked concrete an estimated 1000 people left homeless by the 
71magnitude tremor sleep in doorways and shelters while the city 
negotiates redevelopment funds to rebuild hotels 
in santa cruz a seaside tourist town eight miles from the oct 
17 quakes epicenter chainlink fences ring downtown craters where 
the shuddering earth crumbled victorian buildings cracking 
colonnades and toppling turrets 
from san francisco to watsonville businesses homes and 
freeways severely damaged by the loma prieta quake remain in ruins 
and officials estimate it will be five to 10 years before the worst 
of the 7 billion10 billion damage is repaired 
none of the agencies involved was willing to estimate the final 
price tag which will include seismic renovations to protect 
against the the really big one 
its one of the most depressing things ive ever been through 
in my life its like it was nuclear bombed all the buildings are 
gone i can imagine going through world war ii and coming home 
to see your city totally destroyed said bob shepherd he was 
santa cruz city finance manager until he resigned aug 17 to teach 
only one of the 15 buildings demolished in the town centerpiece 
pacific garden mall is under construction five others have

as one of the senates staunchest 
conservatives for a dozen years orrin hatch might be expected to 
be among lawmakers campaigning to slash federal grants for the 
arts 
but the utah republican who spent two years as a mormon 
missionary is taking a pass 
he shakes his head glumly at moves to curb funding for the 
national endowment for the arts on grounds that some of the money 
has gone to projects tainted by obscenity 
no one is more against obscenity and pornography than i am 
but i just dont believe that the congress should impose censorship 
through the authorization process hatch said 
some of these people if they had lived in the time of 
leonardo da vinci and michelangelo the sistine chapel would never 
have been painted hatch says of lawmakers heading the drive 
they wouldnt allow you to hang a reubens in the senate 
hatch is scrupulously polite and softspoken although sometimes 
an emotional side surfaces unexpectedly 
when the senate debated rights for the disabled in july hatch 
was telling how his brotherinlaw suffered as a victim of polio 
suddenly he just broke down 
i mean i just wept tears rolling down my cheeks hatch 
recalls i was embarrassed because i dont like people to know 
that side of me that much 
from the scourge of the liberals to patron of the arts and other 
issues irksome to conservatives hatchs political persona is 
undergoing a distinct change 
when hatch arrived in the senate in 1977 he was immediately 
accepted as one of the fiercest conservatives to prowl the floor 
over the last two years though hes been at odds with old allies 
more than once 
despite conservative opposition he spearheaded in 1989 a 175 
billionayear package of childcare grants hes campaigned for 
escalation of the battle against aids and he sponsored a justice 
department program aimed at fighting hate crimes motivated by 
racial and religious bias 
the hate crimes bill put hatch on a collision course with sen 
jesse helms rnc who called it the flagship of the gay rights 
agenda 
hatch 56 scoffs at the notion that hes changed he remains a 
supporter of capital punishment a critic of gun control and an 
opponent of a major civil rights bill on capitol hill whose 
minorityhiring provision he says would inevitably lead to hiring 
quotas 
all the same a recent poll showed many utah voters believe hes 
moved in a more liberal direction 
and hes finding increasing favor with lawmakers he once fought 
he is open on some things said sen paul simon dill he 
has grown and i hope we can all grow he was superb on the 
hatecrimes bill 
lean at 6foot4 with every silvery hair in place and a taste 
for conservatively tailored dark suits and blazers hatch likes to 
tell of his humble origins as the son of a pittsburgh metal lather 
i grew up on the wrong side of the tracks he says we 
were poor poor people 
he worked as a janitor to help pay his way through brigham young 
university where he met his wife elaine they have three sons 
three daughters and 10 grandchildren 
he graduated from the university of pittsburgh law school and 
practiced in that city before returning to utah 
in 1976 he upset incumbent democratic sen frank moss in part 
with the help of hundreds of hatches in rural utah their numbers a 
legacy of the heavily mormon states polygamous past 
moss and other democrats however blamed roughandtumble 
tactics by new right conservatives washington groups whose 
trademark was mailorder campaigns designed to rise funds and 
energize voters around issues such as abortion and school prayer 
in the senate hatch is a vocal member of the judiciary 
committee where he ranks second behind sen strom thurmond rsc 
but his major post is that of top republican on the labor 
committee where hes often at odds with chairman edward m 
kennedy dmass 
but frequently hatch and kennedy reach a compromise as they 
did on a hatch bill opposed by some liberals that allows export of 
pharmaceuticals not yet approved by the food and drug 
administration for use in this country 
indeed the hatch record on such matters gives business little 
to complain about 
he is a firm backer of bills to rein in court damages in product 
liability and medical malpractice lawsuits major goals of the 
insurance industry and hes sponsoring a bill to allow the federal 
government to preempt tough state standards governing pesticides 
in foods 
hatch scoffs at complaints from liberal consumer groups that his 
bill would allow unsafe concentrations of pesticides in foods 
thats not based on science he says thats based on old 
wives tales 
senate republicans take little notice of strained ties between 
hatch and conservative activists they hail him as hardworking and 
effective 
im a real admirer of orrin hatch said sen john c 
danforth rmo 
he undertakes the toughest chores in the senate because he is 
the ranking republican on the labor committee danforth said 
the issues he involves himself in are often hotly controversial 
and take up a good deal of the senates time but he does his job 
with unflappable competence 
but such testimonials leave hardcore conservatives unmoved 
he has separated himself from us on social welfare 
legislation on what we would call gay rights legislation on a 
whole range of issues said new right pioneer paul weyrich 
weyrich says hatch has been shopping for issues to help broaden 
his support and hopes for an appointment to the us supreme court 
indeed when justice william brennan announced his retirement 
reporters were quick to corner hatch and ask if he wanted the post 
he said no 
hatch also says hes always been a champion of the underdog and 
that perhaps his conservative critics just havent noticed 
i have always been an advocate of those with disabilities 
those who are downtrodden who really cant help themselves he 
said what i have a problem with is people who can help 
themselves but wont 
at the same time he says his conservative critics should take a 
more careful look at his overall record 
i wonder who they think took the lead in fighting for a lot of 
the changes around here he said his voice rising i wonder 
who they think fought for fairness in the irancontra hearings 
that view is echoed by writeractivist patrick mcguigan author 
of a recent book on the battle over robert borks nomination to the 
supreme court mcguigan is an outspoken hatch admirer but says 
many would disagree 
there are a lot ofconservatives who dont know him as well as 
i do who think orrin hatch has gone around the bend says 
mcguigan they think he isnt a conservative anymore

children in this biblical arab town 
used to copy stonethrowing palestinians of the occupied 
territories in a game called intefadeh now they play burn 
the american flag 
they are responding to what many adults in kufr kanna and other 
arab towns in israel have said since the usiraqi showdown began 
saddam hussein is a hero who will unite arabs against the united 
states and its ally israel 
most israeli jews have been startled by such wide support for 
the iraqi president among israels 800000 arab citizens liberals 
are disappointed and hardliners cry treason some even urging 
that arab citizens be expelled 
the arabs in israel are crossing a red line support for an 
enemy who is threatening to annihilate half of israel with chemical 
weapons said eliezer tsafrir arab affairs adviser to prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
we used to say the majority of our arab citizens are loyal to 
the state we must go on saying that but im not sure any longer 
how accurate it is 
tsafrir said saddamania was further weakening jewisharab 
coexistence already hurt by israeli arab support for the 
33monthold palestinian intefadeh or uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
support for saddam among israeli arabs springs partly from anger 
about their treatment by the jewish majority 
they were under military government until 1966 and today their 
communities get only about onequarter the government funds given 
to similar jewish towns 
moslem fundamentalism also plays a role the fundamentalists are 
angry that american infidels have been sent into saudi arabia 
near moslem holy places 
a study by givat haviva a leftwing israeli think tank found 
that israeli arab intellectuals initially condemned the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait by iraq but rallied behind saddam when us 
troops entered arab lands 
outspoken support for saddam is the rule in kufr kanna a 
hillside farming town of 12000 north of nazareth that is believed 
to be where jesus changed water into wine 
two weeks after iraqs invasion about 2000 people marched 
through town carrying banners with such slogans as saddam hit 
the americans and israel with chemical weapons 
the marchers burned an american flag and pictures of hosni 
mubarak president of egypt who has cooperated with the us 
defense of saudi arabia 
omar saeed a leader of the nationalist sons of the village 
movement said the demonstration inspired the childrens game of 
pretending to burn makeshift american flags 
saeed a selfproclaimed socialist sees saddam as a fellow 
revolutionary because he ousted kuwaits oilrich royal family 
saddam is leading the revolution of the poor he is the arabs 
robin hood saeed 30 said in the living room of his fathers 
twostory home overlooking the town 
he has an apartment in haifa where he is studying for a 
doctorate in pharmacology at an israeli university and said most 
of his jewish neighbors call him a traitor 
they are saying if you are with saddam you are against us 
but my professor said he would fight for my right to speak my 
mind said saeed who spent four years under house arrest and six 
months in prison for nationalist activities 
his 65yearold father radwan described saddam as a savior 
fighting to unite arabs in the tradition of the late egyptian 
president gamal abdel nasser 
radwan saeed who been under town arrest for 10 years because of 
nationalist activities pointed to a picture of nasser on the wall 
and said tomorrow well have a picture of saddam up there as 
well 
jews are shocked by such sentiments from arab countrymen who 
remained silent during israels wars with its arab neighbors 
i didnt expect to find them on friendly terms with such a 
dictator said yossi sarid of the leftwing citizens rights 
movement maybe they havent digested deeply the democratic rules 
of the game 
conservative israeli newspapers suggested the government crack 
down on arabs supporting saddam 
no one asks that they identify with israeli policy but no 
state that values its existence can accept the identification of 
its citizens with an enemy said an editorial in the daily 
maariv one does not play with fire 
on the extremist fringe usborn rabbi meir kahane of the 
antiarab kach movement said israeli arabs should be expelled 
i saw on television how the arabs of kufr kanna our 
arabs good arabs faithful arabs marched in support of this 
dictator kahane said at a rally friends if we want a common 
policy it is throw the arabs out 
tsafrir said there were no plans for action against israeli 
arabs unless they broke the law but noted that growing resentment 
by jews would make it more difficult to redress the imbalance in 
funding for arab towns 
in kufr kanna mayor aref hamdan said arabs were angry over 
separate and unequal policies under which a permit for building 
a factory had been denied the towns unemployment rate is about 25 
percent more than twice the jewish rate 
mohammed abbas unemployed after losing jobs in his field of 
biology and as a waiter said the jews think we are weak 
inferior people we have to explain ourselves to them all the time 
say that we are loyal to the state they never explain themselves 
to us

the 265th quartermaster detachment of the south 
carolina national guard is one of the reserve units called up for 
duty in saudi arabia national writer fred bayles has been with the 
14 guardsmen as they trained and deployed to the mideast 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
no one stays at this assembly area for 
more than a day the sergeant major explained except that a day 
can sometimes last two weeks or more 
this industrial area in the desert is first stop for many new 
troops arriving in saudi arabia the gritty landscape of dusty 
mills and corrogated metal buildings is covered with long rows of 
olive drab tents 
units arrive here each day to receive their assignments the 
expectation is they will quickly be shipped somewhere else 
welcome to ellis island one officer said by way of 
explanation 
the 265th quartermaster detachment a south carolina national 
guard unit mobilized to run water purification equipment in this 
dry country arrived over the weekend 
but so far the only water the 14 men have seen is in the 15 
liter bottles handed out to them several times a day like so many 
other units staying here the 265th is an orphan looking for a 
home 
we got to get going here said sgt ronnie jackson who 
leads the 14 men from allendale sc we need to go to a place we 
can start working 
the urgency to get out isnt rooted in work ethic alone as an 
intelligence officer pointed out matteroffactly this place is 
considered a prime iraqi target 
it doesnt take much to see that there are no bunkers no 
trenches no where to run or hide 
you get an air strike in here this place will get torn up 
bad said jackson 
so the sergeant spent his time looking to get the unit 
officially adopted driving to various headquarters areas trying 
to learn where his unit is headed 
the wide empty sixlane highways carried only a light traffic 
of us troops in humvees and pickups and saudis in toyotas and 
mercedes many of the saudis waved as they rocketed past at speeds 
well over 60 mph 
jacksons quest took him to a civilian airport still under 
construction inside the broad concourses and baggage areas 
americans with charts lists and field telephones were busy keeping 
up with the paperwork of nearwar 
the initial news wasnt good the battalion the 265th is 
assigned to hasnt made it in country yet 
thats uncle sam for you said spc bobby youmans hell 
put you on hold like a telephone 
back at the assembly area the unit settled into temporary 
housekeeping in a 15by60foot tent set in the sandy dirt 
there wasnt much to do in the heat of the day mostly the men 
snoozed on their cots listened to the radio swapped portions of 
their rations and kidded each other about sex 
the relative peace was broken several times a day as f15s 
screamed overhead on their way to patrol duty to the north 
most were a little disappointed with their first glimpses of 
saudi arabia 
this isnt what i expected said spc mark rooker as he 
tried to clear the grit off his clothes i didnt think itd be 
this dirty 
youmans was waiting to take in the sights i need to see a 
camel bad he said 
what passed for sightseeing was a stroll down sunblasted streets 
to a variety store off base latrines were down the street so were 
a hastily constructed set of showers 
sunset came with a hint of relief from the days dusty heat as 
three members of the 265th took up guard duty stopping vehicles 
coming onto post the m16s on their shoulders werent loaded 
clips of ammunition were in their pockets 
looking into the hazy night sky spc willie badger pointed out 
the little dipper 
its the same sky as home he said but down here its 
not the same not by a long shot

prosecutors are hinting they may seek a jail 
term for mayor marion barry on his cocaine possession conviction 
but they say he wont be retried on a dozen charges that deadlocked 
a federal jury 
us attorney jay b stephens announced monday that barry would 
not be retried on the 12 charges including one involving an fbi 
videotape of the mayor smoking crack cocaine 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson set sentencing 
for oct 26 
asked whether he will recommend that barry be sent to prison 
stephens said the latitude is there for sentencing of a 
full year in prison which we believe is an adequate basis of 
punishment for mr barry 
the prosecutor refused to elaborate saying only that he will 
make a sentencing recommendation to jackson 
under federal sentencing guidelines barry could face a maximum 
penalty of one year in prison and a 100000 fine 
im obviously relieved at this phase of the legal 
proceedings barry said after the us attorneys decision was 
announced he declined further comment 
barry is running for an atlarge city council seat earlier he 
had announced he would not seek a fourth fouryear term as mayor 
during a fiveminute court hearing assistant us attorney 
judith retchin said simply the government has made a 
determination not to seek retrial on the pending counts 
the governments decision comes five weeks after barrys 
twomonth trial ended with his conviction on one misdemeanor 
cocaine possession charge acquittal on another and a mistrial on 
the 12 remaining counts three felony perjury charges and nine 
misdemeanor counts 
stephens said mr barrys political status and political 
future are not factors we considered when making decisions about 
this prosecution 
the jurys verdict was widely interpreted at the time as a 
victory for the mayor 
but stephens said monday when all the dust is settled in the 
final analysis the ultimate truth will remain that the chief 
executive of this city charged with the responsibility of leading 
the fight against illegal drugs and violence has himself been 
convicted of contributing to that human devastation 
while barry escaped conviction on most of the charges against 
him including the three felonies which carried mandatory jail 
sentences he was forced to pay a political price 
current and former barry administration sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said one reason barry announced he would 
not seek reelection as mayor was to let the jury know he had 
already made sacrifices and cast himself in a sympathetic light 
barrys decision not to seek reelection opened the door for 
political newcomer sharon pratt dixon who won last weeks 
democratic mayoral primary dixons pledges to clean up the 
government and reduce the city work force drew support that was 
interpreted by many as a sign that city voters want a change from 
barrys ways 
after dixons victory the mayor acknowledged that the people 
have said they want something different but he has stood by his 
decision to attempt a political comeback 
the jurys decision followed a dramatic eightweek trial 
featuring a videotape of barry smoking crack cocaine the night he 
was arrested in an fbi sting operation 
barrys lawyer argued that federal prosecutors had improperly 
trapped him by asking a female friend to invite him to the hotel 
and to press him repeatedly about whether he wanted drugs 
before mondays status hearing prosecutors gave no indication 
whether they would try the mayor again earlier this month terry 
halperin the us attorney for the virgin islands announced that 
she would not bring charges against the mayor there 
one of the felony perjury charges and a conspiracy charge 
against barry involved alleged drug activity in the virgin islands 
during 1986 and 1988

the beleaguered chairman of the national 
endowment for the arts is applauding a senate bill that would give 
the courts not his agency the burden of deciding whether some 
federally subsidized works of art are obscene 
nea chairman john e frohnmayer said the senate measure and a 
report by a bipartisan commission last week give us hope that the 
crisis will soon pass over federal support for controversial art 
frohnmayer refused however to scrap a muchcriticized 
requirement that nea grant recipients sign an antiobscenity pledge 
before they can receive federal money 
he said he would delay a decision on eliminating the pledge 
until congress decides whether to impose new antiobscenity 
restrictions on the endowment and a federal court in new york rules 
on the constitutionality of the pledge 
at a news conference monday at the national press club 
frohnmayer said there was zero truth to those rumors that he 
would resign soon after a turbulent year as nea chairman 
the endowment is an independent 171 million federal agency 
that supports a wide variety of artists and arts organizations it 
has been the target of heavy criticism for the past 18 months from 
conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists who accuse the 
nea of subsidizing obscene and sacrilegious works 
last week the senate labor and human resources approved a 
bipartisan compromise bill extending the nea for five years beyond 
sept 30 when its statutory authority expires the bill would 
require the nea to recoup funds from grant recipients who are 
convicted of violating obscenity laws 
frohnmayer said this provision puts the determination of 
obscenity in the courts where it should be 
last october at the urging of sen jesse helms rnc 
congress voted to prohibit the nea from spending federal funds on 
any works that may be considered obscene including depictions 
of homoeroticism sadomasochism and the sexual exploitation of 
children 
a month later frohnmayer began requiring grant recipients to 
sign a pledge that they would not use federal money to produce 
works that might be deemed obscene 
the antiobscenity pledge stirred widespread protests in the 
arts community a dozen grant recipients refused to sign it and 
forfeited their grants three federal lawsuits filed in new york 
and los angeles charge that the pledge violates first amendment 
guarantees of free expression 
the 12member independent study commission created by congress 
urged frohnmayer last week to scrap the pledge a similar plea was 
made earlier by the neas presidentially appointed advisory body 
the national council on the arts 
the study commission endorsed the nea but recommended changes in 
its grantmaking procedures to make the agency more responsive to 
the publics interests the panel also urged congress not to impose 
any new restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for nea subsidies 
when the current antiobscenity ban expires on sept 30

six blacks are among a dozen candidates 
scrambling to claim the house seat in louisiana being vacated by 
rep lindy boggs the only white in congress who represents a 
district that is mostly black 
mrs boggs 74 announced in july that she was stepping down for 
personal reasons after more than 17 years in the house the popular 
democratic congresswoman enjoyed strong support from new orleans 
voters in all age ethnic and economic groups throughout her 
tenure 
but despite mrs boggs strong record on civil rights issues and 
her support in the black community blacks were growing anxious to 
elect one of their own in the district which has a 60 percent 
black voting majority 
many believe 1990 may be the last year a black can be elected 
from the district since new orleans lost people in the 1980s 
district lines drawn after the 1990 census are expected to reduce 
or eliminate the black majority 
even before mrs boggs announced in july that she would retire 
at the end of this term two prominent black democrats had 
announced plans to run for her seat 
but since she dropped out race has not been much of an issue 
since four of the five major candidates are black 
one of them attorney michael bagneris has said that whites who 
live in new orleans are starting to feel as disenfranchised as 
blacks did before the civil rights movement black political groups 
must work to include whites and avoid repeating the folly of 
the past he says 
i see as the major issue getting everyone to focus on the 
major issues and not to focus as we have so often done in the 
past on superficial things such as personality or race he says 
mrs boggs had taken 75 to 90 percent of the vote in almost 
every race since she decided to run to succeed her husband rep 
hale boggs who disappeared on a plane flight over alaska in 1973 
her most serious challenge was in 1984 after courtordered 
redistricting to meet the requirements of the voting rights act 
altered the makeup of her district and left it 60 percent black 
in that race israel augustine a respected black judge got 39 
percent of the vote still mrs boggs long record of work for 
civil rights and her political power brought her 38 percent of the 
black vote in that election 
mrs boggs did not elaborate on her reasons for retiring but it 
has been widely reported that she wanted to spend more time with 
her daughter barbara sigmund the mayor of princeton nj who 
has cancer 
political observers say the leading black candidates to succeed 
mrs boggs are state sens william jefferson and jon johnson and 
attorneys marc morial and bagneris the leading white candidate is 
school board member harwood woody koppel all are democrats 
they and most of the other seven candidates are running on a 
pledge to improve new orleans economy which never recovered from 
the 1980s collapse in oil prices 
in all six democrats two republicans and four independents are 
running in louisianas open primary in which all candidates are on 
the same oct 6 ballot regardless of party if nobody gets more 
than half the vote the top two will be in a runoff nov 6 
with less than a month to go before the primary its too early 
to predict who will make a runoff said loyola university pollster 
and political analyst ed renwick 
i think its quite possible that a runoff would be between two 
blacks renwick said 
jefferson has been endorsed by mayor sidney barthelemy and 
johnson by gov buddy roemer 
morial son of the late former mayor dutch morial has his 
fathers name and his mother sybils active and influential 
support bagneris is a protege of the elder morial but has support 
from both blacks and whites 
koppel got 21 percent of the vote in the fiveperson 1973 
democratic primary for the special election that put mrs boggs 
into the house 
currently there are 23 black members of the us house

remarks about plans for possible us air 
assaults on iraq cost gen michael j dugan his job as air force 
chief of staff but the incident was not the first time the 
fourstar general rankled his pentagon bosses 
dugan fired by defense secretary dick cheney on monday said in 
a statement that he regretted any embarrassment his comments 
caused the bush administration cheney said dugan 53 would be 
forced to retire ending a 32year air force career that included a 
stint as commander of us air forces in europe 
several days after president bush committed us troops to 
operation desert shield on aug 7 to deter a possible iraqi 
invasion of saudi arabia dugan was quoted in a published report as 
saying the united states had ruled out using chemical weapons or 
battlefield nuclear arms if fighting broke out with iraq 
that comment caused a stir in the pentagon where military 
authorities have been careful not to preclude any options in order 
to complicate baghdads planning 
dugan also had been the object of private complaints by us 
commanders in saudi arabia 
an aide to gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff told a reporter during powells visit to saudi arabia last 
week that dugan was one of several military authorities who were 
talking too much in public about contingency plans 
saddam already has you guys giving away the store we dont 
need to help him any more the aide said speaking privately 
in explaining his decision to dump dugan cheney told a pentagon 
news conference that the air force chief displayed a lack of 
judgment by engaging publicly in wideranging speculation 
about us military options in iraq 
dugan was quoted by the los angeles times and the washington 
post as saying the joint chiefs of staff had decided that us air 
power including a massive bombing campaign against baghdad that 
specifically targeted president saddam hussein was the only 
effective way to force iraq out of kuwait if war erupted 
if and when we choose violence he ought to be at the focus of 
our efforts dugan was quoted as saying referring to a military 
strategy known as decapitation 
cheney said dugan confirmed to him that he had made the 
comments which were reported by the newspapers during dugans 
visit last week to us forces in saudi arabia 
in his brief statement issued through the air force public 
affairs office at the pentagon dugan said his comments to the 
times and post reflected his personal views and should not be 
construed to reflect any plans or the position of the bush 
administration 
i sincerely regret any embarrassment that my comments may have 
caused the administration dugan said officials in his pentagon 
office said he was not available for further comment monday 
cheney told reporters he would recommend to bush that gen 
merrill a mcpeak replace dugan mcpeak 54 is commander of 
pacific air forces based in hawaii 
dugan took the top air force job in july and quickly gained a 
reputation for openness with the news media and congress one 
gesture that illustrated this departure from past air force 
practice was his decision to give defense reporters laminated cards 
listing his office phone number and the numbers of his chief aides 
an irishman with a breezy personal style dugans attempts at 
openness were a clear departure from the practice of his 
predecessors a small example of dugans approach was his recent 
insistence that his public affairs office respond immediately to a 
published report in which an airman in saudi arabia complained of a 
lack of gear designed to protect against chemical arms attacks 
cheney lauded dugans long air force career but said the 
fourstar general has no future in the military

president bush is embarking on a heavy 
campaign schedule for gop candidates and nowhere is his stumping 
as important to his party as in the california gubernatorial 
contest he visits this week 
bush hopes to raise at least 2 million in a trio of appearances 
devoted to helping sen pete wilson become the next california 
governor 
bush told a news conference monday that he hopes he wont be 
drawn anew into a controversy over drilling off californias coast 
ive got enough problems right here in washington without 
commenting on a provision out there bush said when asked about a 
proposed state initiative opposed by wilson to ban offshore 
drilling 
bush has imposed a 10year moratorium on new drilling off 
california 
if the question is put to me at a press conference do you 
want to ban offshore drilling the answer will be no bush 
continued 
but he said if he were asked whether he should change his 
decision on the moratorium ill say no i dont think i need 
to do that 
before flying to the west coast today bush planned to stop in 
denver en route to lend a hand in rep hank browns bid for the 
us senate 
the twoday trip is one of several campaign swings the white 
house has scheduled for bush between now and the november election 
from denver today he was heading to a 1000aperson 
fundraising dinner in los angeles to boost wilsons campaign 
coffers 
on wednesday bush attends a breakfast for the california 
republican party before heading to san francisco for a 
1000aticket luncheon that also benefits the wilson campaign 
the california race pits wilson the states lowkey twoterm 
us senator against the democratic nominee former san francisco 
mayor dianne feinstein 
bushs help with fundraising is key in a race that is based 
mostly on expensive dueling tv commercials wilson plans to spend 
more than 15 million to defeat feinstein campaign aides say 
beyond keeping control of the governors seat in the nations 
largest state national strategists are pulling out all the stops 
in the campaign because of its implications in the future makeup of 
congress 
california will gain seven new seats in congress in the 1991 
redistricting because of its population growth which now gives it 
oneninth of the nations population 
the process redraws congressional district lines based on 
population and the boundaries can determine which party will win 
the districts house seat 
with californias democraticcontrolled legislature in charge of 
approving the new district boundaries only a gubernatorial veto 
gives the republicans hope of staving off a democratic windfall in 
congressional seats 
it is the motherlode of congressional seats said ed rogers 
who heads the white house political office wilsons race he said 
is the number one target for the republican party 
recent polls have shown the race a virtual dead heat although 
the wilson camp says its polling shows the senator is inching 
ahead 
bush made a political trip to calfornia in february and is 
expected to return again before election day 
he was expected to tailor his remarks in los angeles and san 
francisco to coordinate with wilsons current campaign emphasis on 
crime issues 
wilson is airing two toughoncrime commercials one 
spotlighting his advocacy of legislation to treat drugaddicted 
mothers who give birth to socalled crack babies and his work for 
a successful state anticrime initiative 
in colorado brown had no primary opposition and faces josie 
heath whose only background in elected office was as boulder 
county commissioner 
still the republicans are not taking the race for granted gop 
strategists say and are focusing on keeping the states 
nonaligned independent voters from gravitating toward heath who 
ran a strong campaign 
brown and heath are vying to succeed retiring sen william 
armstrong one of three republican senators stepping down 
nationwide

federal researchers should be more openminded 
about unconventional treatments that show some potential to help 
cancer patients a fouryear congressional study concludes 
the study by the office of technology assessment found that none 
of the alternative methods it reviewed including psychological 
nutritional and herbal remedies was obviously or dramatically 
effective 
but the report also said these treatments have had little if 
any scientific review which leaves patients with no guidance if 
they want to supplement or replace their conventional treatment 
its very hard to get information beyond promotional 
brochures said roger c herdman who supervised the report 
which was released monday there isnt a lot in the peerreviewed 
literature where scientific findings are reported 
yet thousands of cancer patients have turned to alternative 
treatments most after undergoing at least some conventional 
treatment for their disease the report said 
its worthwhile to give serious thought to unconventional 
approaches to serious diseases herdman said 
we suggested a more systematic and more aggressive look be 
taken by some of the responsible agencies including the national 
cancer institute provided there was reason to believe the 
treatment could benefit patients he said 
the report urges researchers to take a sympathetic and 
thoughtful look at some of these treatments he said 
officials at the national cancer institute had not seen the 
report and therefore could not comment on it institute spokesman 
paul van nevel said 
the study was not intended to evaluate the effectiveness of 
alternative cancer treatments but rather to help members of 
congress deal with such issues as insurance reimbursement of cancer 
treatments and research and development funding rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
requested the review in august 1986 
dingell called the report balanced and said it tells us 
that some alternative approaches to cancer treatment can have both 
physiological and psychological benefits which should not be 
ignored by physicians 
it is clear we need better information on these treatments 
and that the federal government should consider its role in that 
effort he said 
proponents of unconventional treatments had been very critical 
of an earlier draft version of the report it was filled with 
errors and failed to fault the current system of evaluating these 
therapies they said 
however after hearing reports about the final version the 
criticism softened 
the report recommends that more information be gathered on the 
types of patients who use unconventional treatments it suggests 
the federal government could start a registry for documented 
reports of tumor regression that appears to be unrelated to 
conventional treatment the government also could collect 
information on documented adverse reactions the report said 
the report also urged federal funding of efforts to evaluate 
unconventional treatments 
some methods have been studied but overall these reviews 
generally have not been well designed and have not met with the 
approval of academic researchers the report said 
currently cancer treatments that are considered mainstream 
and are usually covered by medical insurance include surgery 
radiation therapy chemotherapy hormonal therapy and 
immunotherapy which involves manipulating a patients immune 
system to fight the cancer 
the report said that based on the little information available 
most of the patients who turn to an alternative treatment have had 
at least some conventional therapy many continue the mainstream 
approach while incorporating an alternative method the report 
said 
major clinics that offer unconventional therapies charge in the 
range of 5000 to 40000 for a course of treatment the report 
said 
among the alternatives reviewed the report found that 
welldesigned studies are beginning to look at the potential of 
psychological interventions like mental imagery and meditation it 
called the results so far encouraging but said the value of 
these approaches remain uncertain 
the report also reviews dietary treatments mixtures of herbal 
products and such biologic agents as laetrile which was popular in 
the 1970s and is currently offered by several clinics in mexico

much of what air force gen michael 
j dugan said that got him fired is indeed part of us contingency 
plans for war with iraq but dugan was the only military leader 
who discussed the plans publicly in such detail 
the sheer numbers of the iraqi military make air power vital for 
the united states to defend saudi arabia and to launch any 
offensive attack usmilitary leaders have made clear in recent 
weeks 
interviews with american commanders pentagon deployment 
announcements and other information released publicly have 
indicated that us contingencies include massive air strikes 
against iraqi military and political targets 
us commanders have said privately that the politics of the 
middle east made it preferable that any attack on iraq avoid damage 
to religious and cultural monuments so that the united states 
would not destroy any chances of diplomatic relations with any 
iraqi government after saddam husseins 
this is saddam husseins war not the iraqi peoples a 
senior army officer said recently they should not be punished 
for his madness 
but until dugan gave detailed interviews about what he said 
were air force plans if president bush ordered an offensive action 
any detailed picture of contingencies for bombing iraq was 
available only by piecing together information from a number of 
sources 
dugan was fired monday as commander of the air force by defense 
secretary dick cheney who said dugan was relieved for discussing 
classified operational matters in great detail 
dugan in interviews with the los angeles times and the 
washington post said air force contingencies included bombing 
places frequented by saddam hussein and his inner circle as well 
as military and economic targets 
from the early stages of the deployment the united states had 
announced it was sending massive air power to the region some 
commanders have been willing to discuss the plans for massive air 
strikes although none in the detail provided by dugan 
the publicly announced deployments to the region included f111 
bombers now stationed in turkey and saudi arabia the f117 
stealth fighterbomber and longrange b52 bombers aircraft 
carriers in the red sea and just outside the persian gulf carry a6 
bombers 
a squadron commander aboard one carrier said two weeks ago his 
unit had been briefed on possible bombing runs against iraqi 
targets 
the united states also sent several awacs planes to help saudi 
awacs maintain 24hour patrols a us air force officer said the 
large deployment guaranteed there would be enough awacs available 
to monitor enemy activity in the middle east and to direct 
offensive air activities if ordered to do so 
in public statements military leaders including joint chiefs of 
staff chairman gen colin l powell and army gen h norman 
schwarzkopf commander of us forces in saudi arabia have said 
air power is the only way the usled force could defeat iraqs 
millionman army without overwhelming casualties and extended 
fighting the iraqi armys strength in the iraniraq war was 
holding defensive positions 
we will not start a war but we will finish one quickly in the 
air air force col john mcbroom said shortly after the first 
us forces arrived in saudi arabia but when asked to be more 
specific mcbroom chose a different course than dugan responding 
im not going to talk about that 
within two weeks of arriving on saudi soil according to 
military sources some us commanders were being briefed on 
potential iraqi targets including military bases munitions 
factories power plants and other facilities considered vital to 
supplying the iraqi army in general and its occupation force in 
kuwait in particular 
a map shown to an associated press reporter about two weeks ago 
had numerous potential targets in iraq circled some as far north 
as baghdad others in areas closer to kuwait and iraqs border with 
saudi arabia a handful of iraqi military bases were among the 
potential targets according to an officer who briefed a reporter 
on the condition of anonymity the officer insisted the specific 
locations and names of targets not be identified 
we will use our air superiority to knock out their fighters 
and then clear a path allowing us to take out their command and 
control operations and supply lines one senior military 
commander in saudi arabia said privately last week 
then we will be able to string them out the officer said 
without orders and supplies the greater numbers wont be of much 
use to iraqs ground forces

ten years of boom times have suddenly gone 
bad along the dusty highway to iraq 
the unordered embargo on trade with turkeys neighbor has 
struck a devastating blow along the road to the border forcing 
hundreds of merchants to close their shops and seek jobs elsewhere 
local officials say 
the highway was all they had now of course they will go 
said neset okten mayor of silopi 
a string of small businesses including bakeries groceries and 
car repair shops are now empty forming an extended ghost town 
along the route 
silopi nine miles west of the iraqi border and neighboring 
cizre 18 miles farther west are on the only highway linking 
turkey with iraq 
in the past decade as turkish trade with iraq grew these 
oncesleepy towns of a few thousand population each enjoyed a boom 
and populations swelled to 30000 for silopi and 70000 for cizre 
about 5000 trucks and oil tankers passed through the towns 
daily local officials said last year turkey earned 480 million 
from transit fees 
the highway is two lanes in the border area but is also part of 
the e5 international highway that runs from western europe through 
turkey to the middle east 
most of the trucks carried goods for iraq food machinery 
even parts intended for an iraqi supergun that turkish officials 
managed to intercept moving in the other direction tankers 
carried crude oil from iraq to turkey 
the local people selling spare car parts food drinks and 
other goods to the drivers reaped profits from the heavy traffic 
now the road is empty save for some passenger buses and turkish 
military vehicles patrolling the border area for kurdush 
guerrillas 
merchants losses while devastating to local economies are 
believed to be only a fraction of the 4 billion turkey says it is 
losing this year because it closed two iraqi oil pipelines that run 
through the country and banned all trade with iraq 
bags of sugar spaghetti flour and spices were piled up against 
a wall at mehmet emins shop in cizres market place 
i havent sold anything today he said 
emin said he used to gross 110 a day before iraq invaded kuwait 
on aug 2 and set the persian gulf crisis in motion 
trucks dont drive by anymore he said there are no 
customers 
resul akyurek who sells sugar cooking oil tea lollipops 
chewing gum and even shoes said his earnings are down to about 7 
a day from about 185 before the crisis 
i cannot even pay my rent now he said 
the troubles also hit silopi an ethnic kurdish town through 
which tens of thousands fleeing kuwait and iraq mostly asians 
have been crossing into turkey 
you are the only person who has entered my shop today salim 
guntas who sells clothing and shoes told a reporter 
at habur the border crossing post between turkey and iraq one 
man kept watch over arrivals and offered about 20 cents per kuwaiti 
dinar the dinar was worth 380 before the turkish central bank 
stopped accepting kuwaiti and iraqi currency the arrivals mostly 
pakistanis in cars and on foot were happy to get anything at all 
for the money 
as he counted the bills in the stacks of dinars he had bought 
the money changer explained that he would become rich one day if 
the kuwaiti dinar rose to its old value

dianne feinstein promises that as governor 
she would uphold the provisions of a school financing initiative 
that gov george deukmejian and others say contributed greatly to 
the state budget crisis 
democrat feinstein said monday she is committed to the 
carrying out of the spirit the letter and the intent of 
proposition 98 and pledged to make education her top priority at 
budget time 
no matter what schools arent going to be shorted 
feinstein said no matter what schools for the reason of 
survival of our people have to be no 1 among those budget 
priorities 
by putting schools first feinstein drew a distinction between 
her agenda and that of republican challenger pete wilson the us 
senator says public safety is his no 1 priority perhaps even at 
the expense of education 
wilson also says that in reaching budget reform the state may 
have to rethink proposition 98 which voters approved in november 
1988 the measure inserted financial protection for schools into 
the state constitution

state rep dewey crump convicted 
last week on three felony drug charges said he has asked the 
missouri democratic party to do whatever it can to get his name off 
the november ballot 
i believe my constituents are entitled to be represented by 
someone who is not the subject of such notoriety as i have 
experienced crump dmaryland heights said in a statement 
released monday 
because in my professional life i have always tried to 
represent the people i have served to the best of my abilities i 
believe that my recent personal problems would impair my capability 
to be the effective state legislator these citizens deserve the 
43yearold lawmaker added 
republican mark holloway is on the nov 6 ballot for crumps 
seat last thursday democrat robert weatherly filed as a writein 
candidate for the seat

republican gov tommy g thompsons 
campaign has engaged in a systematic shakedown of racing 
interests while amassing a 46 million treasury says his 
democratic opponent for governor 
the comment monday by state assembly speaker thomas loftus came 
after the milwaukee journal reported that dog racing interests had 
donated at least 28600 to thompsons campaign 
thompsons top adviser administration secretary james klauser 
says loftus use of the word shakedown was a dishonest 
characterization in an effort to smear thompson through 
innuendo 
scott jensen director of the governors campaign assailed the 
loftus camp for hiring david fechheimer a san francisco 
investigator to review state racing board records 
michele carrier the top loftus adviser said fechheimer was 
hired because of his experience in dealing with financial 
investigations and the racing industry 
at a news conference loftus questioned why a florida family 
seeking a track license would hire attorney michael grebe chairman 
of the republican party of wisconsin to represent it 
i think it has more to do with his position as tommy 
thompsons handpicked chairman of the republican party and the 
influence he has with the governor than with his legal expertise 
loftus said

abdullah al shabnan smiling the 
smile of a 12yearold holds in his hand an image of war 
abdullahs drawing shows saddam hussein a skull and bones 
insignia on his beret a bloody knife in his hand 
he will die he will not live abdullah tells a visitor 
speaking slowly and deliberately still smiling if i have to i 
will go and fight 
abdullah should be in school back in kuwait but he lives these 
days as a refugee in a saudi hotel spending most of the day 
playing in the halls 
for two hours each day he gathers with other kuwaiti children 
for a makeshift lesson 
during a break they gather on the floor around a table joking 
among themselves as they reach for paper and crayons rolling on 
the floor and running in circles 
the art they produce is disturbing dominated by violence 
tanks blood and destruction 
of course it bothers us says khadija one of the kuwaiti 
women who supervise the children they are children they should 
not have these feelings but these memories will never go out of 
their minds 
khadija who did not want her family name published because she 
fears for relatives still in kuwait said the children are not told 
what to draw 
however in daily lectures to the children women denounce saddam 
and iraq for invading kuwait the talks refer to saddam as a 
killer madman and thief 
the childrens art is full of the same message 
alah like abdullah is 12 and should be in her first week in 
the sixth grade learning english science math and other 
subjects 
she pauses darting her eyes around the room at the drawings on 
the wall when asked if she enjoys living in a hotel 
i want to go home she says to kuwait 
her latest drawing shows a mosque it also shows tanks rolling 
down a street with bursts of smoke coming from the guns and 
saddams head on the body of what alah says is a wolf 
because he conquered kuwait is her answer when asked why 
she likens saddam to a wolf he is a bad man who has stolen 
kuwait 
she is grinning broadly and tugging at the dress of a friend 
when asked what she wants saddam to do next to die she says 
alah was on vacation in turkey when iraq invaded her country six 
weeks ago her father brother and sister are still there she 
shrugs when asked if she thinks they are safe 
a friend 11yearold shaimaa takes a visitor by the hand and 
shows her a drawing it depicts a sword drawn in the colors of the 
kuwaiti flag decapitating saddam 
the friends of kuwait will cut his head off she says 
does she expect to go home sure she says when saddam 
dies i will go back

a set of valleys said to resemble the 
animated character gumby and a meteorite impact crater unlike any 
other seen in the solar system are visible in the magellan 
spacecrafts newest pictures of venus 
the computerassembled pictures released by nasa monday were 
made from data magellan collected saturday as it started its 
243day mission to peer through the planets thick clouds and map 
its rugged landscape 
its just excitement time the scientists are in there like 
bees to honey said ed sherry a magellan technical assistant at 
nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
one picture shows a 40milelong set of valleys or troughs 
its a feature we nicknamed gumby said steve saunders 
magellans chief scientist referring to the animated clay figure 
from a childrens tv show of the 1950s 
two valleys each about three miles wide look like gumbys 
legs the north end of the two valleys converge into a single 
trough resembling gumbys upper body and the trough ends in a box 
canyon that looks a bit like gumbys head 
the gumbylike feature probably formed when underground molten 
rock flowed out of the area causing the ground above to collapse 
along fault lines and create the valleys saunders said similar 
features have been seen on mars he said 
another picture released monday shows a meteorite impact crater 
about five miles wide and seven miles long 
large lobes of material ejected by the impact are visible north 
south and east of the crater that means the crater was formed when 
a meteorite slammed into venus at a low angle rather than from 
directly above saunders said 
shaped like a kidney it is unlike any other impact crater seen 
in the solar system nasa said a possible explanation for the 
strange shape is that the meteorite broke into several large chunks 
just before it hit saunders said 
magellan which was launched from the shuttle atlantis in may 
1989 was to have formally begun its 744 million mapping mission 
on aug 29 almost three weeks after it went into orbit around 
venus but engineers temporarily lost radio contact with the 
spacecraft on aug 16 and again aug 21

when trucker bill mckamey heard that 
montanas museum of the rockies had found a tyrannosaurus rex 
skeleton he offered to make his vehicle and services available any 
time anywhere 
how many times in your life do you haul a dinosaur he 
asked 
the fossil trex found in the badlands of eastern montana is the 
largest and most complete skeleton of a tyrannosaurus ever 
discovered it also is the first of four trex skeletons discovered 
in montana that will be staying here 
that has become a source of pride for people in montana 
mckamey for example was one of scores of volunteers who helped 
bring the fossil of the meateating beast from its 65 
millionyearold bed in the dry rugged territory around the 
missouri river to the display room in bozeman 
although the tyrannosaurus is the best known dinosaur only 
eight have been found four in montana two in canada and one each 
in south dakota and wyoming 
while montana may be the most fertile hunting ground for the 
trex none of the fossils has stayed in the state 
until this i didnt realize how many people were upset about 
fossils going out of state said pat leiggi chief preparator of 
paleontology for the museum a lot of people told me they had a 
ranch here and there and certain people would come and take 
fossils out and they never heard about them again 
he said that until the museum of the rockies opened its 
paleontology department eight years ago the state had no facility 
to research the fossils now the museum has one of the largest 
palentology departments in the country and it has more of a say 
now we know whos doing what he said montana is in this 
network of paleontology departments 
the tyrannosarus rex was the largest carnivore ever to walk the 
earth it grew to 35 to 40 feet long and up to 12 feet high with 
teeth 6 inches long 
museum staffers dug up the 90 percent complete skeleton over 
four weeks this summer on federal land near the small farming town 
of circle 
army corps of engineer engineers built a dirt road into the 
remote site and helped load the seven tons of fossils onto trucks 
mckamey was waiting nearby with a flatbed truck and hauled the 
bones nearly 400 miles to the museum at montana state university 
the fossils packed in plaster and caked with rock and hardened 
mud then had to be unloaded weighed and set up for display but 
the museum worried that the floor wouldnt be able to support the 
3ton pelvic section 
we had a reporter in here and he wrote about it and the next 
morning we got a whole bunch of calls saying what do you need 
it sure made my life easier leiggi said 
two state workers helped weigh the pieces an architect 
volunteered to examine the floor a rental firm loaned dollies a 
construction company loaned a forklift and a driver and a concrete 
casting firm brought in a crane 
we read a little blurb in the newspaper that they needed to 
turn the pelvis over and that the largest forklift couldnt do 
it said steve anderson of bozeman who operated the crane so 
i called them and talked to them it was a chance to see 
something really rare 
eventually the floor was reinforced 
museum visitors can watch staffers cleaning and preparing the 
bones in a display room a process that will take many months the 
museum may eventually erect a mold of the skeleton or exhibit the 
bones themselves 
the skeleton was discovered almost two years ago by two amateur 
fossil collectors tom and kathy wankel of angela leiggi said a 
call came from the front desk of the museum that someone had some 
fossils they wanted identified 
people ask us to identify bones all the time he said to 
me it was just another bunch of people who wanted me to look at 
their bones 
but when curator and chief paleontologist jack horner confirmed 
that the wankels had found the arm and hand of a tyrannosaurus 
our eyes were just popping out of our head leiggi said 
since the story broke nearly a year ago reporters scientists 
and dinosaur enthusiasts from around the world have focused their 
attention on montana 
when you find a trex it turns out to be an overnight success 
internationally leiggi said i never expected this

gen mike dugans bluntness was apparent from 
the day he testified before a senate committee judging his 
nomination as air force chief of staff in the three months since 
his plain spoken ways became even more obvious 
on monday dugan was fired by defense secretary dick cheney for 
his frank description of us strategic planning in the mideast 
in an interview published a day earlier in the washington post 
and the los angeles times dugan said the military had contingency 
plans to decapitate the iraqi leadership by targeting president 
saddam hussein his family and even his mistress 
president bushs national security adviser immediately disavowed 
the statement cheney consulted with president bush about firing 
dugan and by noon monday the 53yearold decorated exfighter 
pilot was history 
his bluntness was apparent in june when dugan then air force 
commander in europe testified before the senate armed services 
committee 
he told the panel that as the services european commander i 
have been at the front line of change and have had the 
opportunity to witness and in some regards manage its initial 
impact on the united states air force 
the overriding question among lawmakers was the word from the 
pentagon that the air force had proposed to cheney that the 
modernization of landbased missiles be delayed 
asked if the service had made the recommendation dugan replied 
i understand that i accept that approve that and i support 
that one needs to look at affordability issues in every regard 
dugan made it clear that the air forces no 1 priority was the 
b2 stealth bomber and that plans to build the singlewarhead 
midgetman missile and move the multiplewarhead mx missile from 
silos to rail cars could wait 
in crafting its defense budget the senate responded to the 
signal from the air force eliminating 16 billion in procurement 
money for the mx railgarrison missile program 
shortly after taking over from gen larry welch on july 1 dugan 
began an aggressive campaign to meet with reporters giving 
reporters laminated cards listing his office phone number and the 
numbers of his chief aides

on sept 14 he told reporters in saudi arabia that the united 
states had two possible courses of action patience and sweat or 
violence and blood he added 
if theres any culture in the world thats impatient its 
mine its the united states 
asked at another time about soviet military advisers still in 
iraq despite the united nations embargo on trade with saddams 
regime dugan said flippantly that he was more or less satisfied 
that the soviets have decided they are on the same side as us 
for weeks commanders in saudi arabia criticized dugan for his 
open assessment of us military capabilities by last week even 
aides to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen colin

grave under marker 609 in the city cemetery laid to rest with her 
stuffed animals as tokens of the childhood the 16yearold never 
had 
heather a runaway who didnt run far lived and died on the 
streets of this industrial city of 100000 south of boston where 
homicides are rare 
a week ago an unseen assailant sprayed gunfire at the 
teenager her boyfriend and his roommate as they sat on a wall 
outside a row of stores she died in surgery an artery in her 
abdomen severed by a 22caliber slug 
heather who since age 7 had lived in a successsion of foster 
homes here but had been a runaway for nearly a year was one of 
those street children who didnt seem to belong anywhere or to 
anyone 
but at her graveside friday it was clear there were many who 
cared 
one of her foster mothers mary hatfield dedicated a poem to 
her how shall we explain the life that slips away like shadows 
fading into the black of night she is not unrecognized she will 
not be unremembered 
hatfield remembered heather as both charming and difficult 
she was starved for affection she never knew the potential 
she had she always had to ask do you like me am i pretty 
she said 
heather had been without her family since she was 7 said 
heathers aunt suzanne gonsalves she was left at a very early 
age its hard to be a teenager when you never got to be a 
child 
in a eulogy the rev jeanne bell said we are overwhelmed by 
the tragedy of her violent and cruel death at 16 we think of her 
as loving animals and babies we think of her with a good sense of 
humor and a winsome smile 
authorities would not disclose details about heathers family 
history and how she ended up in foster care 
her friends said she was tough and selfreliant or at least 
seemed that way social workers who tried to help said they were 
limited by heathers resistance 
its very difficult when a child runs away from a system that 
is trying to help said lorraine carli spokeswoman for the state 
department of social services its hard to deal with 
adolescents you cant hold them down in one place 
the killing remained a mystery police have so far drawn a blank 
on suspects

and his roommate gary danny nelson 26 when someone fired 
seven shots in their direction hitting all of them heather 
stumbled across the street to a friends house

climb the back stairs but fell as she lay dying fonseca said 
she wanted to tell me something she wanted to tell me who did it 
but she couldnt breathe 
she had a rough life fonseca said she always tried to 
make jokes about it and laugh about it but it really hurt her 
inside all she wanted was for somebody to love her 
the two men are recovering from their wounds 
as far as i know we dont know right now whether it was a 
driveby or if someone walked up to them and shot them said sgt 
joe silver 
it was the citys second homicide this year

wanted to she really wanted to

the agriculture department says it may be 
ready to put into use within two years a controversial proposal to 
streamline beef inspections including the notion of putting 
greater reliance on packing companies 
officials hailed a report by the national academy of sciences as 
an important step in the development of the experimental inspection 
system for cattle slaughter plants 
the academys report generally supported adoption of the 
streamlined inspection system for cattle called sisc but had 
some important qualifications for its approval 
for example the report said if the department does rely more 
heavily on private industry to maintain meat quality the agency 
should concentrate its resources on safety to guard consumers 
against microbial and chemical contamination 
the federal government should design its inspection programs 
to focus on contemporary health issues the report said it 
should insist that industry comply with policies and procedures 
required to protect public health and foster public confidence in 
the safety of the food supply 
although supporting the speededup inspection system for cattle 
the report said the food safety and inspection service should 
develop methods for quickly testing carcasses for microbial and 
chemical contamination 
the sisc plan was studied by a panel of the academys institute 
of medicine under a 154000 grant from the department 
from a food safety viewpoint sisc alone is probably no 
better and in some situations can be less effective than 
traditional inspection because the reduced oversight by government 
inspectors is not compensated by a total commitment to product 
quality on the part of the industry the report said 
but the report also called the streamlined system the most 
important change in bovine meat inspection since federal 
supervision was begun in 1906 
for this system to work in practice both fsis and industry 
must fully endorse the philosophy of shifting responsibility for 
meat quality from fsis to industry so that the government can 
concentrate on safety the report said 
the plan was officially proposed in november 1988 usda 
spokesman jim greene said an amended proposal probably would be 
made based on the new study 
greene said the department plans to begin using the revised 
system within two years but only in plants that slaughter fed 
cattle for the slaughter market these cattle are mostly 
grainfattened steers and heifers from feedlots 
the report said about 80 of the nations more than 1300 
usdainspected cattle slaughter plants would be eligible to use the 
system those account for an estimated 80 percent of the fed cattle 
slaughtered for the consumer market 
lester m crawford fsis administrator said the 11month study 
by the scientific panel confirms our ongoing commitment to 
modernize inspection at cattle slaughter plants is on solid 
footing 
crawford said the report shows the experts agree the proposed 
system is a single successful step toward an optimal 
scientific inspection program that was envisioned by the academy in 
a 1985 report to the agency 
under traditional inspections federal inspectors check bile 
ducts heart cheek muscles and numerous lymph nodes for disease 
and other abnormalities they also are responsible for condemnation 
and disposition of diseased carcasses as well as supervising the 
trimming of undesirable parts 
but under sisc plant employees would incise heart and cheek 
muscles position parts for inspectors and assume responsibility 
for some trimming 
inspectors still would be responsible for condemnation and 
disposition of diseased carcasses and still would examine every 
head viscera and carcass 
the streamlined inspection system is currently used 
experimentally in five meat plants using highspeed techniques to 
slaughter steers and heifers for the beef market 
agency officials said those include two montfort plants in 
greeley colo and grand island neb two excel plants in friona 
and plainview texas and a national beef plant in liberal kan 
the industrys american meat institute called the report an 
objective assessment of the new inspection program and said it 
may help to end the controversy over the merits of sisc 
tom devine of the consumeroriented government accountability 
project which has helped federal whistleblowers to criticize usda 
inspection operations said he was delighted by the report 
its a gratifying vindication for the concerns raised by 
whistleblowers who as usda inspectors alleged there have been 
many slipshod unsanitary practices in plants where the new system 
has been used he said 
park wilde of the community nutrition institute another 
advocacy group said he had reservations about the academy 
committees conclusions 
the report was produced in a secretive manner shutting out 
the concerns of consumer groups and the inspectors themselves he 
said 
further wilde said a lot of the reports information about the 
suitability of sisc came from the departments inspection agency 
itself some of that he said included data that consumer 
advocates had requested but had not been able to obtain from the 
agency 
under such circumstances he said the reports conclusions 
have to be considered a charade

the turmoil in the persian gulf is hitting 
american consumers where it hurts in their wallets 
energy prices began soaring immediately after the iraqi invasion 
of kuwait on aug 2 crimping consumers power to purchase other 
items and threatening to topple the nation into a recession 
the government is scheduled today to release its first 
assessment of the inflationary damage at the retail level where it 
counts for consumers 
in advance most economists were predicting the labor 
departments consumer price index soared 08 percent in august 
double the 04 percent rise in july 
thats the equivalent of a 10 percent annual inflation rate and 
would be the steepest monthly increase since january when a cold 
snap sent fuel oil and vegetable prices skyrocketing and produced a 
11 percent overall price rise 
in a report last week the department said wholesale prices paid 
to producers such as factories and farmers jumped 13 percent the 
steepest rise in seven months 
georgia state university economist donald ratajczak who 
conducts his own inflation surveys was predicting about twothirds 
of the august consumer price rise would be attributed to energy he 
forecast a gasoline hike of 17 percent and a fuel oil rise of 26 
percent 
analysts are divided over how long the inflation jolt will last 
some are predicting the bad news will continue for months as the 
inflation works its way into chemicals plastics and other 
petroleumbased products 
by the end of 1990 the inflation rate for the year will 
register at around 6 percent ratajczak predicted up significantly 
from the 5 percent expected before the invasion and from the 46 
percent recorded in 1989 
others however believe the pain will be relatively 
shortlived they say economic growth is too weak to support an 
inflationary spiral 
the inflation climate will remain unpleasant for the next 
several months economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch said 
in a recent newsletter but the economy is extremely weak 
possibly recessionary within a year the inflation rate is likely 
to be lower than it was just prior to the oil shock

oklahoma voters decide today whether to 
limit state lawmakers terms something no state ever has done 
the proposed constitutional amendment would put a 12year cap on 
service by members of the state house or senate 
supporters argued it would keep incumbents from becoming so 
entrenched they no longer worked for the people opponents 
contended passage would concentrate power in the hands of 
nonelected career bureaucrats and lobbyists 
oklahoma is the first state to bring such a proposal to the 
ballot said the national council of state legislators colorado 
and california will vote on similar proposals nov 6 similar 
legislation has been introduced in florida and new york 
there have been no limits on the terms of state or federal 
lawmakers since the constitution superseded the articles of 
confederation which had limited house terms to three years out of 
every six 
the oklahoma proposal got on the ballot through an initiative 
petition circulated by tulsa businessman lloyd noble ii he argued 
that legislators are so concerned about getting reelected they 
ignore important matters like waste in government 
all our legislators talk about cutting waste but they dont 
cut any waste that gets them elected noble said 
opponents said voters already can limit lawmakers terms by 
not reelecting them 
i just basically hate to see any deterioration of the right of 
the voters to decide his or her own representatives said senate 
president pro tem bob cullison 
other opponents noted that only 16 members of the 48member 
senate and 14 of the 101 house members had 12 or more years of 
service when the 1990 legislature adjourned 
legislators now in office would be allowed to serve 12 more 
years the ballot measure also provided that the constitutional 
provision would not go into effect until jan 1 
although legislators elected this year will take office in 
november noble said he believes the 12year limit would apply to 
them

the weakening us economy ironically could 
help soften the expected balloon in the nations merchandise trade 
deficit brought on by the oilprice shock of the persian gulf 
crisis analysts say 
the price of oil has soared since the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
on aug 2 driving up americas energy bill the united states 
imports about 50 percent of its oil consumption 
but while oil prices are rising the us economy is slowing 
draining the amount of money consumers have to spend on cars made 
in japan and computers shipped from south korea the deficit is the 
difference between imports and exports thus trade deficit relief 
might be in the offing 
oil prices were rising even before the iraqi invasion however 
and analysts were looking for todays commerce department report on 
merchandise trade to see what effect it had on the july deficit 
many analysts thought it would top 7 billion the deficit 
totaled 507 billion in june the lowest since june 1983 when it 
fell to 396 billion 
higher july imported crude oil prices are likely to boost 
the oil deficit by about 500 million economists at mitsubishi 
bank wrote in their current weekly economic indicator report 
michael k evans head of evans economics inc a washington 
forecasting firm said oil prices rose between 2 and 3 in july to 
about 17 a barrel they had averaged 1464 a barrel in june 
meanwhile the us economy is slumping with growth in the 
first half of the year down to an annual rate of 12 percent from 
25 percent in 1989 and 45 percent in 1988 many analysts expect 
the business cycle to slide into a recession by the fourth quarter 
of this year if it is not already experiencing one 
and as the economy grows more sluggish consumers are growing 
more reluctant to spend not only on americanmade goods but on 
items imported from overseas as well 
if you look at imports of other commodities other than 
energy i would expect them to be fairly weak said economist 
cynthia latta of drimcgrawhill in lexington mass that should 
hold overall imports down 
for the first six months of 1990 the deficit averaged 764 
billion a month compared to 912 billion in 1989 
and before kuwait many analysts and government officials were 
predicting the deficit would total less than 100 billion this year 
for the first time since 1983 whether that goal can be attained 
now is questionable 
unless we have a recession that really is pretty nasty 
cropping up i wouldnt expect imports to fall sharply enough to 
allow us to get anywhere close to that number said robert 
brusca chief financial economist with nikko securities co 
international inc in new york 
at the same time the united states will see a slowdown in 
export growth because economic conditions are deteriorating 
overseas added lawrence chimerine senior fellow at the economic 
strategy institute a washington research organization

the targets lay spreadeagle on a 
mound of dirt sheldon smith leveled his 12gauge shotgun and 
gleefully pumped away aiming mainly for the knees and ankles 
when the smoke cleared another set of blue jeans lay crumpled 
on the chewedup embankment riddled with holes 
the 24yearold smith is a clothing designer he sells shotgun 
wash jeans and is making a fortune his jensensmith company is 
expected to gross more than 1 million this year selling 
shotgunventilated jeans for 60 a pop 
the tiny chattanooga company made a flashy debut nearly three 
years ago with a line of snakeskinanddenim jackets 
part of the image we portray is real bold he said its 
almost reckless like well do anything in jeanswear we got that 
attitude when we started in the western business because they all 
thought we were crazy 
from that time on weve kind of kept on shaking people up 
with crazy things he said 
which is why smith and a couple of employees loaded down with 
shotguns and boxes of blue jeans recently traveled to a shooting 
range on mowbray mountain north of chattanooga 
you guys shoot the knees and ankles ill get the rest 
smith said as jeans were spread twodeep on the embankment 
he advised them about different techniques stand close and you 
make a nice solid hole a few paces back and the result is an 
equally pleasing spray pattern 
if one little pellet hits the zipper itll ruin them he 
warned remember knees and ankles no crotches or butts 
once the bright new blue jeans are blasted they are bleached 
and washed until they fray an empty shotgun shell is added as a 
tag 
smith got the idea after his brotherinlaw was wounded in the 
hip during a hunting accident he was fine but he had a hole in 
his jeans my sister would always show people and they were 
fascinated by them he said 
sales have been good since jensensmith began marketing the 
ventilated jeans about three months ago even though its mostly a 
gag on the current popularity of ripped denim 
we want to have fun with it for a while make a statement and 
let it run its course then get back to our normal business which 
is still not real normal he said

ally milder needs all the help she can get for 
her campaign to unseat nebraska democratic congressman peter 
hoagland but she has no intention of asking veterans affairs 
secretary edward derwinski for a return visit to omaha 
the former illinois congressman said monday that milders 
concern was understandable in the aftermath of his reference to 
illegal aliens as wetbacks a remark he conceded was a dumb 
mistake 
theres no place in government for people who have attitudes 
like this said milder who said it was up to president bush to 
decide whether the remark was enough to force the cabinet secretary 
to resign 
were not going to comment said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
milder wouldnt discuss the incident which occurred friday 
morning and stirred an unwanted controversy over the weekend 
thats certainly not the way she feels in the least sense of 
the word said kent grisham a spokesman for the nebraska 
republican party i think she made an interesting point that 
being jewish she has experienced a lot of prejudice firsthand 
riccardo correa an omaha businessman who is active in hispanic 
affairs said derwinskis remark had not altered his longstanding 
support for milder 
correa said her apology was not for people like me but for 
people who would use this against her 
hoagland won the omaha congressional seat in 1988 by a margin of 
fewer than 3000 votes succeeding republican hal daub who ran for 
the senate 
howard schloss spokesman for the house democratic campaign 
committee called the hoaglandmilder contest a very tight race 
and he relished the opportunity to link milder to derwinski 
it showed very bad judgment on her part to even invite him out 
there in the first place he said calling derwinski 
insensitive not only to minorities but to women schloss said 
milder brought him out there regardless of his views on these 
matters 
derwinski aides confirmed published reports that the cabinet 
secretary often refers to women on his staff by nicknames such as 
little miss coffee maker zsa zsa little miss muffett 
and lena he also has nicknames for several male aides 
derwinski said the nicknames were part of his policy of running 
a completely informal office 
he called it just one of my efforts to have one great big 
happy family on my staff 
derwinski aides refer to him as the big cheese 
sandy peyton a program assistant at the department of veterans 
affairs said derwinski calls her miss america and i dont 
mind at all being called that 
peyton said there was a good warm atmosphere in the office 
and that the women employees were all livid to read a story 
suggesting they were offended by the secretarys habit of giving 
them nicknames 
derwinski said his use of the term wetback was just one of 
those dumb slips that law of averages you have them i guess 
he said he used the term during a breakfast meeting when he was 
asked what his department was doing to combat drugs 
i just volunteered that one of the problems with drugs is 
theyre so easy to smuggle and that therefore curing addiction in 
the long run was the way we had to go he recalled and then i 
just got so carried away with my subject that without even thinking 
of exactly what i said i said the drug cartel even uses wetbacks 
to get drugs into the country

ally milder needs all the help she can get for 
her campaign to unseat nebraska democratic congressman peter 
hoagland but she has no intention of asking veterans affairs 
secretary edward derwinski for a return visit to omaha 
the former illinois congressman said monday that milders 
concern was understandable in the aftermath of his reference to 
illegal aliens as wetbacks a remark he conceded was a dumb 
mistake 
theres no place in government for people who have attitudes 
like this said milder who said it was up to president bush to 
decide whether the remark was enough to force the cabinet secretary 
to resign 
were not going to comment said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
milder wouldnt discuss the incident which occurred friday 
morning and stirred an unwanted controversy over the weekend 
thats certainly not the way she feels in the least sense of 
the word said kent grisham a spokesman for the nebraska 
republican party i think she made an interesting point that 
being jewish she has experienced a lot of prejudice firsthand 
riccardo correa an omaha businessman who is active in hispanic 
affairs said derwinskis remark had not altered his longstanding 
support for milder 
correa said her apology was not for people like me but for 
people who would use this against her 
hoagland won the omaha congressional seat in 1988 by a margin of 
fewer than 3000 votes succeeding republican hal daub who ran for 
the senate 
howard schloss spokesman for the house democratic campaign 
committee called the hoaglandmilder contest a very tight race 
and he relished the opportunity to link milder to derwinski 
it showed very bad judgment on her part to even invite him out 
there in the first place he said calling derwinski 
insensitive not only to minorities but to women schloss said 
milder brought him out there regardless of his views on these 
matters 
derwinski aides confirmed published reports that the cabinet 
secretary often refers to women on his staff by nicknames such as 
little miss coffee maker zsa zsa little miss muffett 
and lena he also has nicknames for several male aides 
derwinski said the nicknames were part of his policy of running 
a completely informal office 
he called it just one of my efforts to have one great big 
happy family on my staff 
derwinski aides refer to him as the big cheese 
sandy peyton a program assistant at the department of veterans 
affairs said derwinski calls her miss america and i dont 
mind at all being called that 
peyton said there was a good warm atmosphere in the office 
and that the women employees were all livid to read a story 
suggesting they were offended by the secretarys habit of giving 
them nicknames 
derwinski said his use of the term wetback was just one of 
those dumb slips that law of averages you have them i guess 
he said he used the term during a breakfast meeting when he was 
asked what his department was doing to combat drugs 
i just volunteered that one of the problems with drugs is 
theyre so easy to smuggle and that therefore curing addiction in 
the long run was the way we had to go he recalled and then i 
just got so carried away with my subject that without even thinking 
of exactly what i said i said the drug cartel even uses wetbacks 
to get drugs into the country 
he said he hadnt realized what he said and the first 
opportunity i apologized i said obviously it was a dumb 
mistake it was an inadvertent almost unconscious comment

the persian gulf crisis has cut short the 
economic boom of jordans only port and main tourist resort 
beaches normally packed with tourists are deserted aqabas 
wide treelined boulevards and oncecrowded shopping malls have 
become the haunt of stray cats searching vainly for scraps of food 
until iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the resulting turmoil 
in trade throughout the middle east aqaba was jordans fastest 
growing city and had a bright future 
but now tourism is dead the port is at a practical standstill 
and so is business in general bemoans bassam kakish president 
of the aqaba region development authority 
thewalls of kakishs office are lined with colored architects 
drawings of the tourism and other development projects along the 
sandy beaches and crystalclear waters of the red sea 
the port has been severely affected because 70 percent of its 
business was iraqi imports and exports and that trade has been 
killed by the unordered embargo on trade with iraq in 
retaliation for its seizure of kuwait 
aqaba with an estimated population of 45000 is near jordans 
southern tip sandwiched between saudi arabia and israel it sits 
next to the israeli resort city of eilat 
only two or three ships a day dock in the port compared with 
more than 20 before the crisis more than 7000 of the 11000 
jordanian trucks engaged in hauling goods to and from the port have 
been idled kakish said 
thousands of people have been flung out of work dockers in 
the port truck drivers and hundreds more providing auxiliary 
services this has brought business in town to a virtual 
standstill 
in the tourist sector kakish said aqaba catered to 150000 
european tourists last year and this year we expected even more we 
were actually 5000 beds short 
all the local hotels are expanding and new ones are under 
construction yet now all the hotels are empty and this is the 
beginning of the high season he said 
hoteliers confirmed that with the outbreak of the crisis guests 
began leaving fearing the region would be engulfed in a war 
the only guests we have now are the occasional journalists 
that come down from amman to visit the port and see how the 
sanctions are implemented said a receptionist at one of the main 
hotels who gave his name as mohammed 
weve had hundreds of cancellations and future bookings have 
dried up he said 
kakish estimates that aqaba will lose more than 12 billion 
from the combined collapse of its tourism and port business no end 
is in sight to the falloff which kakish believes is unfair since 
jordan is abiding by un sanctions against iraq 
people talk without reason of jordan as a war zone he said 
when will they regain confidence how long will this period of 
uncertainty continue one or two months one or two years

ford motor co says it is not recalling light 
trucks for gear shift repairs because there is no safety hazard if 
the levers break that decision is drawing fire from a consumer 
advocacy group 
the center for auto safety founded by ralph nader asked the 
government monday to order a recall of 240000 ford ranger pickups 
and bronco ii utility vehicles from the 1986 and 1987 model years 
the national highway traffic safety administration launched an 
investigation in june of reports that the manual transmission 
levers were breaking off in the drivers hand 
fords approach to such a blatant widespread defect is 
woefully inadequate said samuel cole vehicle safety staffer for 
the consumer organization 
ford provided the government agency with a september 1988 
internal report that disclosed 6473 gearshift lever failures on 
1986 and 1987 ranger pickups with manual transmissions made by 
mazda 
that translates into a failure rate of one in every 37 vehicles 
the center for auto safety said 
the bronco ii has the same transmission as the ranger ford 
spokeswoman joy stinson said ford began using an improved lever 
assembly with 1988 models 
ms stinson said the company did not consider the problem a 
safety hazard even if the lever breaks the vehicle remains in 
gear and the driver is able to pull off the road without losing 
control she said 
whatever gear it breaks in its driveable she said for 
that reason a safety recall is not warranted 
cole disagreed saying that it will only be a matter of time 
before we begin seeing accidents attributed to the gear shift 
defect

liberias civil war has entered a 
new phase of chaos with encircled government soldiers setting huge 
fires around the capital and nigerian jets bombing a rebel army 
news reports and military sources say 
clouds of smoke hung over the ravaged capital monrovia on 
monday as rival rebel forces under charles taylor and prince 
johnson battled each other and loyalists of slain president samuel 
doe with artillery and machine guns 
there were no immediate reports on casualties 
the british broadcasting corp said from monrovia that doe 
loyalists doused buildings with gasoline setting huge fires that 
burned out of control 
no doe no liberia no president no capital it quoted the 
soldiers as chanting the bbc said the remnants of does army have 
decided to go down fighting expecting no mercy from insurgents who 
have been hunting them down since doe died this month in rebel 
hands 
the rebels control most of the country and have confined 
government holdouts to a section of monrovia 
military sources in lagos the nigerian capital said monday 
that that countrys jets had bombed strongholds of rebel leader 
charles taylor 
the reports of those attacks sunday were the latest indication 
that west african nations who said they were sending a joint 
military force to liberia to restore peace were instead becoming 
more involved in the fighting 
over the weekend ghanaian warplanes also bombed taylors forces 
in retaliation for shelling that killed five people on a ship and 
at the west african forces headquarters in monrovia 
herman cohen the us assistant secretary of state for africa 
met in sierra leone with gambian and nigerian officials to discuss 
a possible visit wednesday to monrovia the state department said 
cohens schedule had not been finalized 
nigeria sent 650 troops to freetown sierra leone where they 
were waiting to board warships bound for monrovia they are to join 
1000 nigerian troops already participating in the 3000member 
regional force which also includes troops from gambia ghana 
guinea and sierra leone 
the new nigerian contingent includes paratroopers military 
sources said they would be dropped into the port of buchanan 
southeast of monrovia and kakata north of the capital 
both are held by taylor who is opposed to the west african 
force he has seized 2000 west african citizens as hostages 
the rival rebel leader johnson has welcomed west african 
intervention and its call for an interim government followed by 
elections 
members of the west african force and many liberians have 
criticized the united states for not sending troops to end the 
8monthold war at least 5000 people have died in the fighting 
most of them civilians 
the war began in december when taylor invaded from the ivory 
coast prince johnson a former taylor ally formed a rival force 
over the summer 
the rebels claimed does government was corrupt and mismanaged 
but the conflict has largely been fought along tribal lines 
weve got to a stage where really we have to think deeply on 
what to do to bring a very bad very confused and violent situation 
to an end said gambian president sir dawda jawara the chairman 
of the economic community of west african states 
about 2100 us marines have evacuated hundreds of foreigners 
they are also guarding the us embassy and residential compound in 
monrovia but they have orders not to intervene militarily 
liberia was founded by freed american slaves in 1847

after four failures nasa gave up 
trying to launch the leaky space shuttle columbia so that it can 
concentrate on getting discovery aloft in october before the 
planets fall out of the proper alignment 
nasa scrbbed the fourth attempt to launch columbia about seven 
hours before it was to lift off at 128 am today after a buildup 
of hydrogen a highly flammable gas was detected in the engine 
compartment during fueling 
a baffled robert crippen shuttle director said i do not 
understand it our plan is that we are going to understand it 
columbia was to have lifted off with the 150 million astro 
observatory to study some of the hottest objects in the universe 
driven by the need to launch discovery next month nasa ran out 
of time and patience with columbia the discovery mission has 
priority its crew is to launch the ulysses space probe toward the 
sun during an alignment of earth sun and jupiter that wont 
reoccur for 13 months 
another effort to launch columbia is not likely before november 
if then nasa said 
columbias crew of seven which includes four astronomers was 
to head back to houston today 
three of columbias scrubs were for hydrogen leaks the fourth 
was because of a problem communicating with one of the four 
telescopes columbia was to carry on a 10day astronomical mission 
the latest failure only added to what has been a difficult year 
for nasa it means that nearly six months will have gone by without 
a shuttle flight if discovery goes in october the longest gap 
between missions since flights resumed after the challenger 
disaster 
the space agency planned on nine missions this year so far it 
has had only three 
this also has been the year when the hubble space telescope was 
found to have blurred vision and when the magellan spacecraft 
orbiting venus twice slipped its communications bonds with earth 
i believe that we still have people out there who are capable 
of solving this kind of a problem crippen said but he added 
we certainly havent done this in a very expeditious manner i 
know that 
engineers had not decided on the next step which probably will 
involve installing cameras and lights in columbias engine 
compartment and going through the tanking procedure again crippen 
said there may be three or more leaks 
after a fueling attempt on may 29 when the first hydrogen 
buildup occurred both outside the shuttle and inside the engine 
compartment nasa focused on a plumbing connection between the fuel 
tank and the shuttle a similar leak was found in atlantis 
prompting nasa to ground the threeshuttle fleet temporarily 
engineers determined that microscopic glass beads somehow worked 
their way into columbias seals and provided a path for the leaks 
the connecting pipe was replaced but on sept 5 hydrogen flooded 
the aft compartment again 
nasa replaced three small pumps and a damaged teflon seal over a 
valve 
now crippen said the leak may have had something to do with 
us going through taking things apart after columbia returned 
from its last mission in january with some systems contaminated 
with an abrasive used to polish metal

standard amp poors corp has dropped 
philadelphias bond rating about as low as you can go and 
mayor w wilson goode appealed to the state for help in solving the 
citys deepening fiscal crisis 
the legislature must recognize that philadelphia is the 
heartbeat of this commonwealth and give the city the authority to 
raise taxes goode said monday 
i think that had new york city not raised taxes by nearly 1 
billion this past year it would be in the same position that we are 
in right now he said 
the bond rating agency downgraded its rating on philadelphias 
13 billion of general obligation bonds monday to the weakest 
credit rating short of default moodys another national bond 
agency took similar action on friday 
you cant lower it any more said hyman c grossman sampp 
managing director its about as low as you can go 
the credit rating makes it more difficult and more expensive for 
the city to borrow money 
philadelphia starved for revenue because of the economic 
downturn in the northeast has been trying to sell 375 million in 
shortterm notes but has found no banks to guarantee them 
city finance director betsy reveal has said that without an 
infusion of cash philadelphia will be out of money by the end of 
the year or shortly thereafter 
the goode administration monday ordered a oneweek freeze on new 
spending prohibiting hiring executing new contracts and buying 
supplies reveal also instructed city department heads to defer 
payments if possible 
the reduced rating to triplec from triplebminus will stay 
in place until there is a solid credible plan to restore 
philadelphias fiscal posture to a level where it can meet all of 
its financial obligations standard amp poors said in a statement 
during an appearance on financial news network on monday night 
goode said the city had to find more revenue 
i think you have an option he said you can cut your way 
out of this problem and therefore cut your services to a point 
where nobody wants to be around because your services are so far 
gone you cant resolve any problems 
on the other hand you have to have sufficient revenue to 
maintain the quality of life he said 
grossman said the city needs a special tax to pay its debt in 
return for which it will have to give up some of its authority 
the time is long gone he said there is no access to the 
credit market 
he said he hopes the rating sends a message to the city and 
the state that together they need to construct a mechanism to 
enable the city to begin to address its chronic financial 
distress

president mikhail s gorbachevs unexpected call 
for a referendum on ending collectived farming indicates he is now 
having second thoughts about pushing ahead with a compromise plan 
to create a market economy gorbachevs proposal to put to the 
people whether to allow private ownership of land came monday as 
parliament opened debate on competing plans for salvaging the 
shortageplagued and grossly inefficient economy 
gorbachev speaking to parliament did not say when the 
referendum would be held who would vote or where he personally 
stood on the issue 
he is apparently reluctant either personally or politically to 
part with six decades of communist party ideological opposition to 
private ownership of land said professor murray feshbach of 
georgetown university in washington 
gorbachev just cant bring himself to turn in his party 
card feshbach said in a telephone interview 
soviet peasants were coerced into collectivization and all land 
became state property during a 19291932 campaign led by josef v 
stalin that is believed to have claimed the lives of between 5 
million and 10 million people 
the debate in the legislature monday turned tumultuous as 
delegates and economists rose to attack parts of all three economic 
reform proposals presented in the past week 
the compromise supported by gorbachev was criticized by 
supporters of both the other plans and the chances of a broad 
consensus appeared dim 
the most radical proposal known as the shatalin plan for its 
principal author economist stanislav shatalin would in 500 days 
give land back to farmers sell factories to private owners and 
move the soviet union toward a free market 
it would shift most economic authority from the central 
government to the increasingly separatist republics and deprive the 
national government of the right to levy taxes 
a more conservative proposal supported by prime minister 
nikolai ryzhkov would retain central control over the economy and 
move more slowly toward a heavily regulated market 
gorbachev on friday presented the compromise plan written by 
shatalin and another leading soviet economist abel aganbegyan it 
contains many elements of shatalins radical 500day plan but would 
move at a slower pace and not disturb the central governments 
power to levy taxes 
the compromise proposal also backs away from private ownership 
of land while shatalins 500day plan calls for selling some land 
to individuals for nominal prices the compromise calls for leasing 
it 
gorbachev has urged a compromise to avoid a split with the 
parliament of the russian federation the largest of the 15 soviet 
republics with half the countrys people and threequarters of its 
land 
the russian parliament overwhelmingly adopted shatalins 500day 
plan last week 
thousands of people marched through moscow on sunday to demand 
the resignation of gorbachev ryzhkov and the council of ministers 
for failing to solve the countrys economic problems 
gorbachev rejected the calls monday saying reshuffling the 
top echelons of power would draw us into grim political 
battles and would heighten confrontation in society at a time 
when we most badly need consolidation to carry out the market 
economy program

boston universitys hardbitten president battled 
a former attorney general for the democratic nomination for 
governr today after a wild campaign that saw an attempted coup 
against retiring gov michael dukakis 
in the nations other gubernatorial contest both parties in 
oklahoma had runoffs for candidates to succeed republican henry 
bellmon he too decided not to seek reelection 
two political newcomers enlivened oklahomas republican 
campaign and the gop race in massachusetts took a surprising turn 
this month but the massachusetts democratic race has been the most 
heated and at times bizarre turnout was expected to be huge 
earlier in the race polls had shown john silber on leave as bu 
president running neckandneck with former state attorney general 
francis belloti lt gov evelyn murphy had lagged badly in 
fundraising and in the polls 
then murphy tried to grab control of the states ailing finances 
from dukakis while he was on a european trade mission earlier this 
month 
what republican candidate steven pierce dubbed mutiny on the 
titanic wound up sinking murphys campaign she withdrew from the 
race and threw her support to bellotti though her name remains on 
the ballot 
silber a 63yearold philosopher gained a reputation for 
outspokenness as bu president for 20 years he didnt tone down his 
style in making his first bid for public office 
the silber shocker that may have caused the biggest furor 
came when he suggested during a debate that the state may want to 
ration health care when youve had a long life and youre ripe 
then its time to go he said 
last week asked about giving a crime control speech in an 
innercity neighborhood silber said there was no point addressing 
a group of drug addicts 
silber criticized the news media for focusing on such remarks 
and not the substance of his speeches 
bellotti called silber irrational and intemperate 
a poll taken for wbztv and the boston globe and released sunday 
showed bellotti leading silber 50 percent to 39 percent the poll 
by krc communications inc surveyed 696 likely democratic primary 
voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points 
the gop race had been relatively sleepy until this month when 
polls indicated former federal prosecutor william weld overtook 
pierce the state house minority leader 
weld spent more than 1 million of his own money on the

diplomats gathered today for a new general 
assembly new session in an atmosphere of unprecedented cooperation 
among leading powers but unremitting tension over iraqs invasion 
of kuwait 
the united nations finally is achieving the purpose which was 
envisaged by its founders and it is becoming a far more 
influential actor on the world stage ronald i spiers 
undersecretarygeneral for political and general assembly affairs 
has said 
the 44th general assembly closed its final meeting monday with a 
unanimous appeal to south african authorities to suppress the 
violence that has killed nearly 800 blacks the last six weeks 
the 45th general assembly was to convene today for its first 
postcold war session the assembly is expected to be dominated by 
the persian gulf crisis and economic development debt and the 
environment 
at todays gathering the new assembly was expected to elect as 
its president by acclamation guido de marco deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister of malta 
the position rotates among regional groups each year it is 
largely ceremonial but the president has power to arrange the 
agenda and mediate among various interest groups 
the annual general debate and speeches by world leaders begin 
sept 24 when president bush is to address the 159nation 
assembly he is to be followed by 27 heads of state 18 prime 
ministers and more than 100 foreign ministers the assembly 
convenes at a time when the prestige of the organization never has 
been higher because of a series of tough security council 
resolutions condemning iraqs seizure of kuwait and ordering an 
embargo on trade with iraq 
it also comes during unprecedented ussoviet cooperation and 
harmony between those two countries and the other three permanent 
members of the security council france britain and china 
the general assembly often likened to a global town meeting 
cannot adopt legally binding resolutions as can the security 
council but its increasingly unified voice carries considerable 
weight as an expression of will of the international community 
mondays resolution on south africa noted that countrys 
progress over the last year such as freeing nelson mandela and 
other political prisoners and lifting the ban on the african 
national congress and other organizations 
south africas voting rights in the general assembly have been 
suspended since 1974 for its refusal to abolish apartheid 
the new session will admit liechtenstein as the 160th un 
member but the reunification of east and west germany on oct 3 
and its membership with a single un seat will keep the membership 
at 159 
the cambodian seat previously held by the antivietnamese 
coalition of democratic kampuchia is to be filled by a member of a 
provisional government being formed to organize elections under 
un auspices details of a cambodia settlement and un 
administration remain to be worked out 
this is the first postcold war general assembly spiers 
said 
he said he expected the middle east and especially the persian 
gulf crisis to be recurrent themes in speeches by world leaders 
but he emphasized that the great issues of today and years to 
come are third world debt and development poverty the 
environment narcotics and other social issues 
except for the middle east and the persian gulf crisis few 
contentious issues remain on the un agenda as the soviet union 
seeks to end its involvement in regional conflicts and cooperate 
with the united states 
but cambodia western sahara afghanistan and cyprus remain 
trouble spots and unresolved conflicts 
at a time when the united nations is called upon as never before 
to make peace it remains far in financial arrears largely because 
the united states owes more than 700 million 
for years the united states withheld funds because it said the 
world body was biased against the united states and tilted in favor 
of the soviet union and the third world 
bush has asked the us congress to restore funding however

the united states acknowledged today 
that the days of a large us military presence in the philippines 
are numbered and asked for time to phase out its oldest and 
largest bases abroad 
it is clear to me that the days of a very large presence 
of us sailors and airmen in the philippines are coming to an 
end chief american negotiator richard armitage told the opening 
session of talks on the bases future 
what remains for us to determine is the rate at which this 
presence will be reduced and the nature of the relationship our two 
governments wish to pursue during and after this transitional 
period 
it was the first time a us official had publicly raised the 
possibility that washington is prepared to give up the six bases 
the talks continue negotiations begun in may on the future of 
clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller 
installations their lease expires in september 1991 and 
philippine opposition to the installations is growing 
on monday a bomb exploded at a voice of america relay station 
60 miles north of manila and communist rebels claimed 
responsibility in a statement saying they were protesting us 
domination of the philippines 
there were no injuries and us officials said damage was 
slight 
the talks are being held in the central bank building guarded 
by more than 1500 police and soldiers about 1000 leftist workers 
and students rallied near the bank today to protest the bases but 
dispersed peacefully after police refused to allow them to march to 
the site 
at least 17 people were arrested and 14 injured during 
antibases protets in manila on monday 
us diplomats have said in the past that us troops will 
remain in the philippines only as long as they are wanted 
on monday however state department spokesman richard boucher 
said washington wants to keep its bases in the philippines 
in his comments today armitage did not propose a timetable for 
removing the 40000 troops defense department civilians and 
military dependents but he hinted that the process could extend 
until the end of the century 
he said the us and philippine military filipino base workers 
and other nations in the region need time to adjust to the possible 
closing of the bases 
let the voters of the 21st century decide whether or not they 
believe a continued us presence will be helpful armitage said 
rafael alunan spokesman for the philippine negotiators said 
manila welcomed armitages willingness to discuss the 
crafting of a new relationship between our two countries 
but he took exception to armitages call for voters of the next 
century to decide on the american presence this matter is not to 
be decided in the 21st century alunan said the time for 
decision is now 
rep stephen solarz chairman of the us house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs said friday that us 
officials were considering a 10year phaseout 
last month manila newspapers quoted unidentified sources as 
saying the philippines was considering allowing the americans to 
remain in subic for up to 10 years if they returned clark and the 
other installations in 1991 
opponents believe the bases infringe on national sovereignty and 
represent a vestige of american colonial rule which ended with 
independence in 1946 us forces have been in the philippines 
since the americans captured the islands from spain in 1898 
during a nationally televised speech monday president corazon 
aquino said her government wants to maintain close ties with 
washington but she said the end of the cold war and absence of any 
external threat to the philippines made the bases less important 
it is now necessary for our government to work with the united 
states for arrangements regarding the orderly withdrawal of their 
forces from our country mrs aquino said 
she noted that a government committee is drafting plans to 
convert the bases into civilian use including a commercial airport 
at clark and a ship repair facility at subic 
the united states has strongly supported the aquino 
administration since a 1986 revolution ended the 20year rule of 
the late president ferdinand marcos a longtime us ally 
in december us jets from clark flew air cover for government 
forces during an unsuccessful bid by military rebels to oust mrs 
aquino 
american troops from the bases also provided help for the 
government during a july earthquake that killed nearly 1700 
people

former state sen paul carpenter faces 
up to 80 years in prison after being convicted of shaking down 
political lobbyists for campaign contributions 
the 62yearold democrat from long beach once a powerful figure 
in the state legislature was found guilty on racketeering 
conspiracy and extortion charges stemming from a 5yearold fbi 
investigation at the capitol 
he is the second california elected state official convicted on 
corruption charges joseph montoya a democrat who was convicted in 
february while still a member of the state senate is serving a 
6year prison sentence for racketeering extortion and money 
laundering 
carpenter who served 12 years as a state senator and was a 
senate democratic caucus chairman is expected to appeal said his 
attorney gerard hinckley 
sentencing was not immediately set for carpenter who for 
several years was one of the senates leading fundraisers 
he faces a maximum of 80 years in prison and 750000 in fines 
he also risks losing his seat on a powerful state tax board he is 
up for reelection to the board of equalization in november 
the jury deliberated for nearly two days before reaching 
verdicts on carpenter who was indicted in march the charges arose 
from alleged wrongdong before carpenter left the legislature to 
join the tax board in 1987 
they centered around 20000 in campaign contributions that 
carpenter received in 1986 from an fbi undercover agent posing as 
an alabama businessman 
the prosecution contended the money was a payoff to ease passage 
of a bill the businessman was sponsoring supposedly to obtain 
financing for a shrimp plant in the sacramento area 
carpenter acknowledged he took some steps that could have been 
interpreted as helping the bill however he contended that he did 
nothing for the bill in exchange for the money saying he had been 
assured by an aide that the businessman agreed carpenter could take 
the contributions without any strings attached

gorbachev if he were soviet leader 
during the questionandanswer session at moscow state reagan 
also said he believes germany has rejoined the civilized world 
and will not repeat nazi atrocities 
reagan in the soviet union at gorbachevs invitation said

presidency and faced with the crumbling soviet economy he would 
act just as gorbachev is 
id be doing the things that president gorbachev is trying to 
do to bring about private ownership to bring about the free 
economy he said 
gorbachevs economic reform proposals were among the topics the 
two discussed in the kremlin on monday including the possibility 
of a soviet referendum on ending farm collectivization 
a key to the reform reagan said is a persons right to own 
land 
until youve done so you cant realize the patriotism and the 
pride that you have when you can stand on a piece of land and say 
this is mine reagan told the group 
asked how he maintained his psychological fitness during eight 
years in the white house reagan quoted another former president 
abraham lincoln 
he said at one point that he could not perform the duties of 
his office for 15 minutes if he did not know that he could call 
upon one who was wiser and stronger than all others reagan said 
he was speaking of course of god i learned while i was in 
the white house why he said that i discovered that i had that same 
need 
on monday reagan who used to call the soviet union an evil 
empire urged those in the countrys breakaway republics to keep 
cool heads 
visiting for the first time since leaving office the former 
president made his appeal while speaking to lawmakers of the 
national parliament 
freedom can bring out passions between groups of people that 
may boil over he said in a reference to the recent soviet 
reforms when they do cool and calm decisions are called for by 
leaders so as to lower temperatures all around

last new orleans teachers strike 12 years ago said they will walk 
the picket lines as long as it takes 
school system figures indicated that 68 percent of the 4500 
teachers failed to report to work monday the union claimed the 
number was greater than 80 percent a spot check of principals 
indicated most of the 84000 students attended classes monday 
no new contract negotiations were scheduled 
when negotiations broke off during the weekend the teachers 
union reverted to its original demand for a 45 million package 
including 10 percent raises each year of a threeyear contract 
on the first day of school sept 4 teachers voted to postpone a 
strike and limit their demands primarily to better health insurance 
benefits and raises for clerical workers and teacher aides 
on saturday the union made a new proposal asking for 1 
million to improve health benefits and agreeing to wait until later 
in the year for raises for aides and clerical workers but the 
board rejected that sticking to its offer of 600000 union 
leaders said 
then on monday the school board cut the 600000 offer in half 
frank fudesco an associate superintendent and the boards chief 
negotiator said the 300000 pulled back would have come from the 
school systems selfinsured workers compensation fund 
we cannot give what we do not have fudesco said 
sixthgrade teacher katy hall picketing at lafayette elementary 
school said the teachers are not striking just for money 
were looking for professional respect 
in 1978 new orleans teachers struck for 12 days returning 
after they were promised a 7 percent pay raise 
most money for teachers pay comes from the state which now 
pays 14472 for a starting teacher with a bachelors degree and 
25737 for one with a doctorate and 25 years of experience said 
wj cleveland of the state eduction department the state 
increased its share 7 percent this year 
some poor rural parishes dont add anything to that cleveland 
estimated that the average parish supplement is 3500 
new orleans adds 4983 to a starting salary and 9374 at the 
top of the scale so that starting teachers get 19455 and someone 
with a doctorate and 25 years of experience gets 35111 
about 650 teachers aides who make about 10000 a year and 
450 clerical workers who make about 17000 also are covered 
under the contract

border to saudi arabia today their numbers sharply decreased after

time in more than a month about 6000 refugees have entered saudi 
arabia

crossing in saudi arabia passenger said about 300 were waiting on 
the other side of the checkpoint the only frontier crossing 
between kuwait and saudi arabia 
more men under the age of 40 were grabbed as cars were picked to 
leave the country in a haphazard manner the refugees said the 
seizures began monday with the iraqis taking away men between the 
ages of 17 and 40 and sending them north in buses 
a man who said he was 55 years old related how four men in their 
20s were taken at gunpoint from his car as he approached the 
frontier today he said he had not heard of the seizures the day 
before otherwise he would not have brought the young men 
i didnt get the news he repeated staring at the ground 
he would not give his name 
some kuwaitis said the young men would be forced into the 
military others said they will be interned in iraq there was no 
explanation given to the men or their travel companions when they 
were seized 
today iraqi soldiers were allowing one car to cross into saudi 
arabia every 10 minutes six checkpoints on the 120mile route from 
kuwait city to the border eliminated the possibility of random 
escapes the refugees said 
in kuwait the refugees said police and military officers as 
well as any of the westerners still left in kuwait were the 
particular targets of manhunts they said the new iraqiappointed 
governor of kuwait ali hussein abdelmajid had previously been in 
charge of eradicating kurdish resistance in northern iraq 
iraq was widely condemned for using outlawed chemical weapons in 
the crackdown on the rebellious kurds in 1988 
iraq annexed kuwait six days after invading it on aug2 iraqi 
president saddam hussein then declared the emirate iraqs 19th 
province and appointed abdelmajid its governor last week 
one kuwaiti who fled his homeland said the iraqi army has set up 
camp around the us embassy in kuwait and tanks have their 
cannons pointed at the embassy premises and the nearby egyptian 
mission 
the man his wife and four sons were among the first to cross 
into saudi arabia at khafji the man would allow himself to be 
identified only as a state technocrat fearing reprisals against 
relatives he left behind 
he said the iraqis are rapidly changing the face of kuwait 
renaming streets and buildings the kuwaiti governmentinexile 
says saddam is trying to depopulate the captive nation and move in 
iraqis 
it is all becoming iraqi the refygee said he estimated 
that only 300000 kuwaiti nationals remain behind with about half 
a million having fled 
the man described an armed camp in the embassy district where 
diplomats from more than a dozen countries including the united 
states britain and egypt are defying an order by saddam to leave 
i saw the american embassy surrounded by the army tanks are 
around most embassies including the egyptian and american with 
turrets and cannons pointed at the embassies he said 
i do not know what is happening inside the embassies but at 
the american embassy the iraqis are not allowing anyone in or out 
there is only a oneway manmade path that they control 
the man described kuwait city as a ghost city especially 
after dark 
the refugees were not being allowed to leave khafji while their 
documents were being checked the saudis are worried about 
infiltration of spies and provocateurs 
refugees were transported to airconditioned schools where they 
were to be fed and housed until they had all been processed

fireworks and balloons filled atlantas morning 
sky today when the international olympic committee announced the 
city will be the site of the 1996 summer olympics 
pandemonium broke out at the downtown retailentertainment 
complex called underground atlanta where thousands of people 
gathered to watch the announcement over televisions broadcasting 
the ioc meeting live from tokyo 
bright orange and green fireworks lighted the sky even though 
the sun had already risen when the news came about 750 am the 
boom of the fireworks could be heard throughout downtown 
a band played the olympic theme and strangers hugged each 
other 
this was exciting this was unbelievable mayor maynard 
jackson said at a news conference in tokyo just after the vote 
this proves that if you dont run the race you dont have a 
chance to win 
its not my victory its a victory for atlanta said former 
mayor andrew young who helped lead the campaign for the olympics 
we have to thank god and pray that we are worthy and that all of 
the things that we have said we can make come true he also was 
in tokyo 
atlanta entered the race late by most standards in 1987 with 
nine volunteers some cities spent more money on the bids for 
example athens spent nearly 30 million compared with atlantas 
750000 and some spent more time belgrade entered the race in 
1985 
to win a city needed 44 votes from the 88member ioc 
the committees choice basically came down to the history and 
tradition of athens or the 21st century stadiums communications 
and commercial appeal of its rivals which also included belgrade 
yugoslavia manchester england melbourne australia and toronto 
according to a study done jointly by an accounting firm and the 
university of georgia the games would pump 35 billion over six 
years into georgias economy add 85000 jobs and create global 
exposure 
it made me feel i was making the olympic team again said 
evander holyfield the former olympic boxer who is from atlanta 
seconds after the announcement crowds in atlanta were sixdeep 
at an atlanta organizing committee cart selling tshirts and hats 
with the citys olympic logo 
in the minutes before the announcement the crowd alternated 
between nervous silence and goodnatured jeers as ioc president 
juan antonio samaranch fumbled with the card holding the name of 
the host city 
i wanted this so bad said janice stockard of suburban 
decatur i wanted it because atlantas great this means a lot 
we got the superbowl for 1994 and now we got the olympics 
i am absolutely amazed i cant believe atlanta has gone from 
a place nobody thought had a chance to really getting those 
games said michael lomax chairman of the fulton county 
commission 
afterward many in the crowd headed for work but others hung 
around to scoop up the last remaining souvenirs and to get started 
on an allday party planned for underground atlanta

downed the plane with a sam7 missile

a year after a french airliner was blown up over 
the sahara killing 170 people the government stands accused of 
suppressing a report that implicates libya 
the uta dc10 exploded sept 19 1989 over niger en route from 
brazzaville congo to paris the victims included the wife of the 
us ambassador to chad and a chadian cabinet minister 
according to the french news magazine le point investigators 
have determined that three congolese dissidents carried out the 
bombing on the instructions of libyan agents 
french officials have refused to comment on the article or a 
subsequent report in the times of london that said syria as well 
as libya had been implicated 
the times said france is withholding the findings of the 
investigation because it does not want to upset relations with 
libya and syria at this point in the persian gulf crisis set off by 
iraqs takeover of kuwait 
the investigation of the bombing has been headed by judge 
jeanlouis bruguiere one of frances leading experts on 
international terrorism 
he reportedly briefed president francois mitterrand on his 
findings in early august about the time of the iraqi invasion 
the inquiry gathered momentum after search teams working in 
scorching desert heat retrieved the victims remains and aircraft 
debris that were scattered over 150 square miles of moonscape 
terrain in central niger 
investigators reassembled the plane in a hangar outside paris 
and eventually concluded that the bomb exploded inside a samsonite 
suitcase loaded aboard the dc10 in brazzaville 
according to le point investigators identified the probable 
chief suspect as apolinaire mangatany listed as boarding the plane 
in brazzaville 
investigators reportedly suspect that mangatany got off the 
plane during a stop in ndjamena chad only 105 of the bodies of 
the victims were positively identified and mangatanys was not 
among them 
in january according to le point congolese security officers 
arrested one of mangatanys associates bernard yanga and learned 
the identity of a third possible accomplice 
yanga whose current whereabouts are unknown rportedly 
recounted how the bombing was planned under the guidance of a 
libyan embassy staff member identified as abdallah elazrag yanga 
reportedly said the motive was to punish france for supporting chad 
in its war against libya 
two other possible motives have been suggested retaliation for 
perceived french aid to christian forces in lebanons civil war or 
an attempt to kill exiled libyan opposition leader yusuf 
almagariaf 
according to le point and the times almagariaf decided at the 
last minute not to take the flight 
the government plans a memorial service wednesday in paris in 
honor of the victims but some relatives are upset by the handling 
of the inquiry 
claude peinchaud whose daughter died aboard the plane 
expressed his anger to the newspaper le figaro last week 
we have the right to know all the results of the inquiry he 
said 
its essential that they tell us who the masterminds are and 
that those responsible are caught and punished too bad if this 
doesnt suit the government

prime minister margaret thatcher 
of britain today proposed that a 35nation summit this fall adopt a 
universal code of rights for europe and north america 
in a speech to czechoslovakias parliament the countrys first 
democratically elected legislature in five decades she also urged 
that the 12nation european community offer full membership to 
czechoslovakia and eastern europes other new democracies as soon 
as they have introduced westernstyle economies 
if we can create a great area of democracy stretching from the 
west coast of the united states right across to the soviet far 
east that would give us the best guarantee of all for security 
because democracies dont go to war with each other the british 
leader said 
mrs thatcher also apologized for the 1938 munich treaty in 
which britain endorsed adolf hitlers division of czechoslovakia 
we failed you in 1938 when a disastrous policy of appeasement 
allowed hitler to extinguish your independence she said 
although britains wartime leader winston churchill was quick to 
repudiate the agreement the british still remember it with 
shame she added 
in contrast to 1938 the united states europe and indeed 
the wider world have responded with an impressive display of unity 
to saddam husseins aggression she said of iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 
turning to alexander dubcek whose 1968 prague spring attempts 
to create socialism with a human face were crushed by soviet 
tanks mrs thatcher also referred ruefully to the wests lack of 
action then 
the pictures of that brave venture are etched in our memory 
and our inability to help remains a burden on the free worlds 
conscience she said 
dubcek is now president of parliament 
mrs thatcher the first british prime minister to visit 
czechoslovakia is on a trip celebrating the downfall of communism 
in central europe she will also visit hungary 
her visit followed one last week by french president francois 
mitterrand whose country also signed the munich agreement 
endorsing hitlers annexation of the sudetenland in northern 
czechoslovakia 
a year later germany invaded poland and world war ii broke out 
after her speech mrs thatcher walked to central wenceslas 
square with dubcek and president vaclav havel 
the square is the heart of pragues peaceful november revolution 
and the british leader laid flowers at the statue of bohemian 
patron st wenceslas the rallying point for most of the 
revolutions protests 
crowds gathered despite the drizzle and applauded as mrs 
thatcher laid the flowers and then went over to shake hands with 
several wellwishers 
before leaving prague for bratislava she formally renamed a 
nearby square winston churchill square after britains world war ii 
leader it was formerly named after antonin zapotocky a postwar 
communist party secretary 
in bratislava the capital of slovakia she planned to meet with 
slovak leaders before leaving for budapest late today 
underlining her proposal for a 35nation universal code of 
rights mrs thatcher presented the assembly with a copy of 
englands 13th century magna carta which guaranteed basic freedoms 
for the population 
mrs thatcher did not provide details of her proposal but it 
seemed to involve a document guaranteeing basic human rights 
she said she wanted a european magna carta adopted at the 
summit of the 35nation conference on security and cooperation in 
europe to be held in paris in november the conference includes all 
european countries except albania in addition to the united 
states and canada 
mrs thatcher has urged repeatedly that the group become a key 
consultative body for the new europe and its relations with north 
america following the collapse of communist rule in most of the 
east bloc last year and reforms in the soviet union

prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov indicated today 
he will resign or refuse to cooperate if the national legislature 
adopts radical economic reforms that he opposes 
ryzhkovs comments came during a break in the supreme soviet 
legislatures second day of debate over three competing economic 
reform plans the most conservative of which ryzhkov put forward 
last week 
as prime minister ryzhkov 61 oversees the government 
bureaucracy and could play a key role in putting any reform plan 
into effect or obstructing it 
asked by a reporter whether he would step down if the 
legislature rejected his plan ryzhkov said i will carry out 
that in which i believe thats all i will not carry out any other 
plan 
ryzhkov also said last week that if his plan was defeated he 
would take responsibility for it before the people and the 
supreme soviet but he has avoided making a clear promise to step 
aside if radical reforms are enacted 
several leading reformers including moscow mayor gavriil popov 
have demanded ryzhkovs resignation since he presented his plan 
which envisions continued central control of the economy while slow 
moves are made toward a marketbased system 
by contrast the radical reform plan adopted a week ago by the 
parliament of russia the largest soviet republic calls for 
switching to a market within just 500 days it would retur land to 
private farmers sell government enterprises to private 
stockholders and gradually remove statecontrolled prices on many 
goods 
thousands of people marched through moscow on sunday to demand 
that ryzhkov resign for failing to improve the soviet economy 
plagued by shortages of consumer goods ranging from tobacco to 
paper and shoes 
but president mikhail s gorbachev rejected those demands 
monday telling parliament that reshuffling the top echelons of 
power would draw us into grim political battles and would 
heighten confrontation in society at a time when we most badly need 
consolidation to carry out the market economy program 
instead gorbachev proposed a national referendum on ending 
collectivized farming he did not say when the referendum would be 
held who would vote or where he personally stood on the issue 
soviet peasants were coerced into joining collective farms and 
all land became state property during a 19291932 campaign led by 
josef stalin that is believed to have claimed the lives of between 
5 million and 10 million people 
gorbachev has backed a compromise economic plan that contains 
many elements of the radical 500day plan but would move at a 
slower pace and not disturb the central governments power to levy 
taxes 
the compromise proposal also backs away from private ownership 
of land while economist stanislav shatalins 500day plan calls 
for selling some land to individuals for nominal prices the 
compromise calls for leasing it 
gorbachev apparently is reluctant either personally or 
politically to part with six decades of communist party 
ideological opposition to private ownership of land said professor 
murray feshbach of georgetown university in washington 
gorbachev just cant bring himself to turn in his party 
card feshbach said in a telephone interview 
gorbachev has urged a compromise to avoid a split with the 
parliament of the russian federation the largest of the 15 soviet 
republics with half the countrys people and threequarters of its 
land the russian parliament overwhelmingly adopted shatalins 
500day plan last week

crossing into saudi arabia was of a wealthy nation broken and in 
despair 
stunned refugees among the thousands who have fled their 
homeland since the border was opened saturday told of husbands and 
sons pulled out of cars and hauled away by iraqi troops 
the iraqis were not explaining what they intended to do with the 
men 
because of the apparently random seizures of men ages 17 to 40 
the number of refugees crossing into saudi arabia had decreased to 
a trickle today iraqi soldiers were allowing one car across the 
border every 10 minutes or so 
refugees said today that the iraqis had set up six checkpoints 
on the 120mile route from kuwait city to the khafji border 
crossing 
they said the iraqis seeking to break their spirit had 
mounted an escalating campaign of torture beatings and shootings 
one fleeing professional said the iraqis were out to demolish 
anything that has to do with kuwait or its ruling alsabah 
family changing the names of streets hospitals traffic circles 
the alsabahs forced into exile by saddam husseins aug 2 
invasion say the iraqi leader intends to empty their oilrich land 
of its people 
it is all becoming iraqi the professional said estimating 
that just 300000 kuwaiti nationals remain behind with about half 
a million having fled saddam has declared kuwait part of iraq and 
annexed it and the professional said a prominent traffic circle in 
kuwait city was being demolished to make way for a lifesize statue 
of saddam 
in washington meanwhile the government said the iraqi invasion 
of kuwait aug 2 had sent gasoline prices up by 76 percent and 
fuel prices jumped 154 percent the steepest rise in those 
categories since january 
economists said they believe more bad news is coming they said 
crude prices continued to rise in september and the increase would 
be felt at the gas pump 
diplomatic activity continued today with the announcement that 
syrian president hafez assad would make his first trip to iran a 
strong ally 
assad will fly to tehran next week to discuss the persian gulf 
crisis the issue of hostages in lebanon and irans poor relations 
with egypt and saudi arabia now allied with syria against iraq 
officials in iran and syria said 
the visit was expected to boost assads drive to project himself 
as a dependable ally of the west and clean up his countrys image 
also plo chief yasser arafat arrived in amman jordan for 
talks with king hussein arafat arrived from baghdad where he met 
with saddam to discuss ways to resolve the crisis 
in paris defense and foreign ministers of nine nations were to 
gather to discuss building up western european forces in the gulf 
following a dramatic rise in tensions between europe and iraq in 
recent days 
the french navy meanwhile announced that france britain 
italy and the netherlands have carved out patrol districts in the 
gulf region distinct from us and australian flotillas part of 
frances quest to maintain military independence 
meeting in brussels on monday foreign ministers of the 
12nation european community agreed to expel all iraqi military 
attaches in retaliation for the iraqi raids friday on the french 
belgian dutch and canadian embassy compounds in kuwait 
they also restricted the movement of iraqs diplomats and called 
on the iraq to realize the suicidal character of its behavior 
toward the international community 
in addition britain ousted eight officials at the iraqi embassy 
and deported 23 other iraqi citizens france has expelled 29 iraqis 
since friday 
a 17member japanese medical team flew to saudi arabia today 
the first japanese personnel sent to assist the usled force 
against iraq 
the five doctors four nurses and eight support staff will visit 
the capital riyadh and other major saudi cities for about two 
months to study how a planned 100member japanese medical 
contingent will be able to contribute to the gulf force the 
foreign ministry said 
japan after being criticized for moving too slowly has pledged 
4 billion to the usled multinational gulf forces 
president bush on monday endorsed expanding the unordered 
embargo on trade with iraq to include air traffic 
what we want to do is tighten up the united nations sanctions 
so nothing is going in he told reporters in washington some 
countries seem to be more willing than others to avoid the 
sanctions 
the five permanent members of the un security council have 
been meeting since the weekend but western diplomats say it will 
be difficult to achieve unanimity on the air blockade issue 
the united states britain and france support the blockade but 
china and the soviet union were said to oppose it all five council 
members appeared to back a resolution that would take punitive 
measures against violators of the existing embargo 
an air blockade is considered risky because halting planes is 
difficult without the use of deadly force 
bush said americans were magnificently united behind the 
deployment of some 150000 us troops in the region to stand up to 
saddam and forestall a possible invasion of saudi arabia 
but he acknowledged im not clear in my own mind how long 
this kind of support holds up 
in an indication of the sensitivity surrounding the us 
deployment the head of the air force was fired monday after 
discussing contingency plans for air strikes against baghdad 
air force chief of staff gen mike dugan made the remarks while 
touring us military installations in saudi arabia and they were 
published sunday in the washington post and the los angeles times 
there are certain things we never talk about an angry 
defense secretary dick cheney told reporters in washington 
also today in jerusalem an israeli cabinet minister said soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev had called saddam a wild beast 
during a meeting last week in moscow with two israeli officials 
the talks were the highestlevel encounter between the two 
countries which have had no formal relations since moscow cut the 
ties in 1967

a gasolineladen tanker on the saginaw 
river burned early today after a series of explosions reignited 
flames that firefighters doused hours earlier 
the coast guard said it was too dangerous to try to put out the 
fire aboard the listing hulk in the dark 
this morning officials again were considering whether to let 
the fire burn itself out or apply foam to the blaze and 
authorities flew over the site by helicopter to check for signs of 
environmental damage 
the mv jupiter carrying 1 million gallons of gasoline first 
exploded and burned while unloading at a pier sunday leaving one 
crew member missing and presumed dead three others remained 
hospitalized today in fair condition 
the fire burned nearly 30 hours before specialists from texas 
smothered it with foam monday afternoon but eight hours later the 
ship exploded again 
obviously the vessel was still hot and there was still fuel 
in the cargo bin said dan lacy a spokesman for ashland oil inc 
of ashland ky parent of cleveland tankers inc which owns the 
tanker 
no new injuries were reported early today coast guard petty 
officer patrick higgins said firefighters hoped to quench the 
flames again using foam 
authorities planned to inspect the crippled ship to gauge 
damage how much fuel remained and how to remove the fuel and the 
tanker 
state police lt robert nelson the jupiter may have to be pumped 
free of fuel water and firefighting chemicals before it can be 
moved 
by the time the blaze was put out monday the rail of the ship 
where the fire was most intense had sunk to within 6 inches of the 
waters surface and some fuel splashed out and burned on the water 
said terry walkington spokesman for the state department of 
natural resources 
barbara singleton a sheriffs emergency worker was sitting in 
a car with a coworker on shore near the ship when it exploded 
again 
i went out one door and he went out the other singleton 
said about a minute after the blast there came that smell 
again of burning gasoline 
state specialists were awaiting results of air and 
waterpollution tests after hundreds of dead fish washed ashore 
near the tanker but said there was little evidence of a big pill 
downtream 
we dont know if it was the explosion or if it was from the 
heat that caused stress on the fish said mike moore department 
fo natural resources deputy director 
the cause of the explosion was unclear but ashland spokesman 
lacy said the wake of a passing ship could have parted some of the 
jupiters mooring lines and its gasoline transfer connection 
spilling fuel that ignited the blast

blood and saliva taken from a former dallas 
minister suspected in the near strangulation of his wife will be 
used for dna profiling a newspaper reported today 
federal and local authorities hope the scientific process will 
help identify the attacker of margaret railey who has been 
comatose since the attack in april 1987 the dallas times herald 
reported 
walker railey formerly a prominent methodist minister has been 
the only suspect while maintaining his innocence he has declined 
to testify before a grand jury and a judge found him responsible 
in a civil proceeding 
fbi agents in california on friday took railey to a detention 
center where he gave courtordered blood and saliva samples 
fbi and dallas police wouldnt comment officially but sources 
within both agencies told the newspaper they were taking the body 
fluids for dna testing 
dna deoxyribonucleic acid is found in every cell and is 
unique in each person its use as an identification tool is 
considered the most important development in criminal 
investigations since fingerprinting body tissue such as hair 
skin or blood is often found at crime scenes 
the railey attack happened before dna testing was available but 
the technique can still be applied because there is a long shelf 
life of the physical evidence the newspaper quoted an 
unidentified fbi agent as saying 
norman kinne the chief assistant dallas district attorney said 
dna profiling of railey was the fbis idea he added that if the 
testing links railey to the crime scene it certainly would be 
significant to the case 
the fbi has been investigating the attack because of raileys 
claims he received threatening letters before his wife was 
attacked police later concluded that they had been typed at 
raileys own church 
mrs railey was attacked in the garage of the couples home 
while railey claimed to have been at a library it was later 
determined he also had been at the home of his mistress a dallas 
psychologist with whom he later lived in california 
at the time of the attack railey was pastor at the 6000member 
first united methodist church of dallas subsequently he left the 
ministry gave guardianship of his two children over to friends 
and moved to california 
railey was held responsible for his wifes attack in a civil 
trial and was ordered to pay 18 million he has since filed for 
divorce from mrs railey who remains in a vegetative state in a 
nursing home

president hafez assad of syria will make 
his first trip to his ally iran next week to discuss the persian 
gulf crisis and western hostages in lebanon diplomats said today 
official announcements in tehran and damascus said that asasd 
will fly to iran next week at the invitation of iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia said observers attach special significance to president 
assads visit in the wake of the crisis in the persian gulf it 
did not elaborate on the topics to be discussed nor mention the 
length of the visit 
diplomats in damascus speaking on condition of anonymity said 
a number of sensitive issues were expected to be on the assads 
agenda the gulf crisis the plight of western hostages in 
lebanon and irans poor relations with egypt and saudi arabia 
with whom damascus is allied in the confrontation with iraq 
the visit was expected to boost assads drive to project himself 
as a dependable ally of the west and clean up his countrys image 
after years of isolation because of its implication in terrorism 
the trip follows talks in damascus last week between assad and 
secretary of state james baker iii that was the first major 
facetoface contact between damascus and washington since 
president bush was elected in 1988 
on his trip baker won a pledge from assad to commit more troops 
and armor to a usled multinational force that assembled in saudi 
arabia after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
about 4000 syrian troops already had been sent to the region 
and diplomats said assad promised to send 15000 more 
assads stance on the gulf crisis motivated largely by personal 
hatred of iraqs saddam hussein and loyalty toward his kuwaiti 
bankrollers marks the first time that he has sided with the united 
states in a middle east conflict 
baker said while in damascus that he was concerned about iranian 
calls for a jihad or holy war against foreign forces in the gulf 
us officials also have been alarmed by reports that iran was 
punching holes in the emabrgo imposed on iraq by the un security 
council 
many foodstuffs tat had disappeared from the iraqi market have 
reappeared in recent days and residents have said the goods are 
coming from iran iraqs enemy in a 198088 war 
diplomats in damascus said the talks with iran may produce a 
breakthrough on the hostages in lebanon although baker said assad 
did not indicate a hostage release was imminent 
six of the 13 western captives held in lebanon are americans 
the others are four britons two western germans and an italian 
american journalist terry anderson 42 is the longestheld 
hostage anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press was kidnapped on march 16 1985 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon with 40000 of its 
troops controlling twothirds of the country 
but it has avoided a showdown with the shiite extremists mainly 
because iran had been its only ally while the western world rallied 
against damascus 
the syrian government was implicated in the april 1986 attempt 
to blow up an israeli jetliner at londons heathrow airport 
the explosion of a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie scotland in 
which 290 people were killed in december 1988 was blamed on the 
radical popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command 
the united states urged damascus to close down pflpgc bases in 
syria and expel the groups leader ahmed jibril a former syrian 
army captain but syria refused on the grounds the evidence 
implicating jibril was not solid 
baker said before he left damascus that the differences over 
terrorism and jibrils presence in syria remained unresolved

supporters of abortion rights asked the senate 
judiciary committee today to reject david souters nomination to 
the supreme court the health and lives of millions of american 
women are at stake they said 
a leading conservative meanwhile said souter should not be 
confirmed because he hasnt done enough to stop abortion 
in three days of testimony that ended monday night souter 
declined to disclose his views on abortion the nominee said he had 
not made up his mind on whether to overturn the 1973 court ruling 
legalizing abortion 
we consider placing judge souter on the supreme court to be 
too great a risk said kate michelman executive director of the 
national abortion rights action league 
the health and lives of million of american women for 
generations to come may depend on where david souter stands 
said faye wattleton president of planned parenthood of america 
their testimony was criticized by committee members including 
sen alan k simpson rwyo himself a backer of abortion rights 
youre making a big mistake simpson said there are going 
to be other supreme court cases where youre really going to have 
to be in the trenches he said simpson added that as a federal 
judge souter could not answer the abortion question because of 
judicial ethics 
a strong antiabortion conservative howard phillips said in 
prepared testimony that souter should be rejected as too 
proabortion phillips chairman of the conservative caucus cited 
the fact that souter served on the boards of two hospitals where 
abortions were performed and had gone along with the practice 
he lacked the moral courage or discernment to help prevent the 
destruction of so many innocent human lives when he had the 
authority indeed the responsibility to do so phillips said 
committee members said souter appeared assured of confirmation 
when his testimony ended monday night 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel told souter his 
appearance had been a tour de force on your part 
biden said some senators including himself were still 
undecided on the nomination but he told souter who marked his 
51st birthday monday that cause to celebrate could come in two 
or three weeks the presumed schedule for committee approval and 
senate confirmation 
sen edward kennedy dmass who repeatedly probed souters 
suitability with questions on rights issues including abortion 
appeared to concede at the end that souter would be confirmed 
as the new hampshire judges appearance drew to a close monday 
night kennedy told souter that he would tip the balance in 
discrimination cases before the court 
youre going to be really the swing vote on this issue as 
well as many others he said 
sen paul simon dill asked souter to err on the side of 
freedom once on the court 
simpson reflecting the apparent unanimous support of the six 
republicans on the 14member panel told souter he had impressed 
the nation during the televised testimony 
out in the land there is a good feeling said simpson 
a lot of people have the feeling that your confirmation 
processis over sen arlen specter rpa told souter 
in his testimony souter worked without the help of notes and 
displayed a vast knowledge of constitutional disputes but he 
avoided giving the committee even a clue of how he would vote on 
the hottest issues before the court 
all three days souter repeatedly pushed aside attempts by 
senators on both sides of the issue to extract his views on 
abortion he maintained his mind was still open 
on monday he expressed his appreciation for the gravity of the 
case saying that overturning the 1973 roe vs wade abortion 
decision would affect thousands of lives could result in widely 
different laws from state to state and could throw into question 
other rulings on privacy issues 
on other topics monday he 
said he believed the death penalty was constitutional and not 
prohibited by the ban on cruel and unusual punishment 
stated that he wished he had insisted while new hampshires 
attorney general that the state return money to a utility that 
donated funds for prosecuting protesters at its seabrook nuclear 
plant 
repeated his aversion to being portrayed personally as an 
isolated scholar unaware of societal problems and promised to 
learn more about the nation as he had with his native state we 
cannot seal ourselves away he said of the judiciary 
after completing its hearings the judiciary committee will meet 
to vote on the souter nomination and send its recommendation to the 
full senate 
sen herbert kohl dwis the newest committee member going 
through his first supreme court confirmation process said he 
thought souter had gone far to ensure his success 
but he expressed doubt the hearings had unveiled the nominees 
thoughts while souters record suggested he was very conservative 
kohl said he appeared before the committee as a moderate 
theres a certain mystery as to how he will appear on the 
court kohl said we cant open up a persons mind

atlanta brought the olympics to the american south 
today winning a long race over athens and four other rivals to be 
host of the 1996 summer games 
the victory in voting by the international olympic committee 
means the 100th birthday of the modern olympics will be staged in 
one of the worlds most modern cities and take the games into their 
second century on a hightech bigmoney road 
the decision read from a sealed ballot by international olympic 
committee president juan antonio samaranch ended the hopes of 
athens to stage the 96 games in the country where the olympics 
were born in 776 bc and reincarnated in 1896 
atlanta had entered the final days of the fouryear contest 
generally rated among the frontrunners it received a boost in its 
formal presentation with a videotaped appeal by president bush 
it caught athens on the third of the maximum five ballots took 
the lead on the fourth and won it 5135 as it picked up most of the 
22 votes toronto had on the previous round 
other runnersup in order of their elimination were belgrade 
yugoslavia manchester england and melbourne australia 
atlanta is world headquarters of cocacola one of the olympics 
biggest sponsors it is the home of pro football baseball and 
basketball teams prestigious universities large and small and the 
civil rights movement 
its gone with the wind and stone mountain catfish and 
cable news networks ted turner and now its also an olympic 
city 
in atlanta today fireworks and balloons filled the morning sky 
when the international olympic committee gave the city the games 
thousands of people gathered at the underground atlanta 
shopping and entertainment district for an olympic party shouted 
with joy when they heard the announcement over huge televisions 
broadcasting the committee meeting live from tokyo 
the boom of fireworks could be heard throughout the downtown 
area a band played the olympic theme and strangers hugged each 
other 
i am absolutely amazed i cant believe atlanta has gone from 
a place nobody thought had a chance to really getting those 
games said michael lomax chairman of the fulton county 
commission 
it made me feel i was making the olympic team again said 
evander holyfield the former olympic boxer who is from atlanta 
atlanta joined los angeles 1932 and 1984 and st louis 1904 
as us summer olympic hosts the 84 games ushered in an era of 
unimagined money for the international olympic committee and 
holding the games in atlanta increased the chances for big money 
from american tv networks the ioc announced last week the olympic 
movement would make 184 billion in the four years leading up to 
1992 not bad for an organization that was almost broke a decade 
ago 
with solid facilities built or planned impeccable hotels and 
infrastructure and glowing reports from various evaluation 
commissions the international olympic committee decided to go for 
the gold again 
the ioc awards the 1996 olympic games to the city of 
atlanta samaranch said 
the atlanta delegation led by chief organizer billy payne 
appeared overcome by joy payne had left the session room in tears 
after presenting atlantas final report earlier in the day 
the conference hall erupted in cheers 
greece was the birthplace of the olympics and staged their 
rebirth a century ago athens had good facilities and it certainly 
had history on its side we have sent the torch away 25 times in 
100 years we are only asking for it once greek prime minister 
constantine mitsotakis told the members 
but spyros metaxa the leader of athens campaign had upset 
some olympic committee members by saying that morally the games 
belong to us the greeks also were accused of arrogance and 
flouting the rules of the bidding 
exiled king constantine of greece an international olympic 
committee member said he was deeply disappointed along with all 
greeks that the centenary games were not awarded to athens 
but we must bow to the democratic process of the ioc and i 
congratulate the winner on its successful election constantine 
said 
beginning in 1994 the summer and winter olympic games will be 
staggered rather than held during the same year 
for example in 1992 the winter games will be held feb 823 in 
albertville france and the summer games july 25aug 9 in 
barcelona spain 
in 1994 the winter games will be held in lillehammer norway 
followed two years later by the summer games in atlanta 
the cities bidding for the 1998 winter games include salt lake 
city aosta italy jaca spain nagano japan ostersund sweden

the restoration of diplomatic ties 
between the soviet union and saudi arabia further isolates iraq and 
allows the kingdom to counter iraqi charges that it is too 
dependent on the united states 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait helped speed the sovietsaudi 
agreement to exchange ambassadors for the first time in 52 years 
the agreement was announced monday in moscow 
this is a move that has been in the works for a long time and 
is the natural culmination of a series of events said a western 
diplomatic source there was no question that it would come 
within a year but the events of aug 2 accelerated it 
the agreement also paves the way for arms deals between the 
soviet union and saudi arabia which has long been allied with the 
united states 
prince abdulrahman bin abdulaziz the deputy defense minister 
made offthecuff comments to reporters tuesday referring to the 
general saudi military procurement policy of seeking developed 
weapons whatever the type 
the soviet union is a superpower and events have proved it is 
an important element of the united nations and its resolutions 
prince abdulrahman said 
the soviets have endorsed seven security council resolutions 
against iraq since the invasion of kuwait moscow also has cut off 
arms shipments to its longtime ally 
in moscow on tuesday the saudi foreign minister noted that 
like the soviet union saudi arabia had been a previous ally of 
baghdad 
saudi arabia stood with iraq through many crises and we 
supported iraq in every possible way prince saud alfaisal said 
at a news conference 
when these two countries stand together for the withdrawal of 
iraqi troops from kuwait and for territorial legitimacy and 
identify their position in a common way this i believe should 
give a message to the leadership of iraq that their position is 
untenable saud said 
progovernment saudi papers welcomed the diplomatic relations 
the daily okaz underscored the importance of the ties with a 
country of such important political weight which has has 
lately been clearly evident through the balanced policy that won 
wide international support 
the saudi newspapers noted that soviet transformations on 
religious freedom and human rights were conducive to a policy 
much in harmony with the kingdoms policy okaz said 
riyadhbased diplomats said that while the persian gulf crisis 
has accelerated the reestablishment of formal relations they were 
not surprised at the development 
it was the most logical move said one diplomat who like 
the others spoke on condition of anonymity 
when saudi arabia forged diplomatic ties with china in july 
experts predicted that relations with the soviet union would follow 
within a year 
during the persian gulf war one source said the saudis 
realized the advantage of having diplomatic relations with all 
permanent members of the un security council with the formal 
exchange of envoys with the soviet union the saudis will have 
achieved that goal 
the communique issued monday stated that both countries would 
work actively to achieve settlements to regional conflicts 
develop international cooperation and strengthen overall peace and 
security 
sources here say the soviet union is not likely to contribute 
either militarily or monetarily to solve the gulf crisis 
the soviet union is so absorbed in its own problems they 
shouldnt be expected to contribute forces one diplomat said 
but what theyre doing in the un has been quite helpful its 
an extra show of solidarity 
the soviet union the first country to officially recognize king 
abdul aziz of saudi arabia called back its last ambassador to the 
kingdom in 1938 he was later executed

twenty years after his death legendary 
rock guitarist jimi hendrix still packs em in 
they dont come in large numbers at any one time but they come 
some bring guitars some bring flowers visitors might spend a 
little time at his grave strumming tunes 
the crowds here have mellowed a bit as has the mood of the 
country said hank kerns general manager of greenwood memorial 
park where hendrix is buried 
once in a while theyll leave a beer can but were careful to 
get it picked up right away 
kerns said the number of visitors to hendrixs grave has 
increased during the past few years and the goodwill games brought 
more than usual one national magazine he said listed visiting 
the gravesite as one of the things to do in seattle while attending 
the international athletic contest 
hendrix died in london on sept 18 1970 according to coroners 
records he died when he choked on his vomit a nonlethal amount 
of barbituate drugs was found in his system 
forever in our hearts reads his headstone which includes 
an electric guitar carved in basrelief there is little to 
indicate he was the king of acid rock but by the time of his death 
at age 27 he had forged a lasting legacy 
i heard he was buried around here i needed to make the 
pilgrimage peg wood said sunday during a visit to the cemetery 
the 26yearold recently moved to seattle from illinois to begin 
an internship with the veterans administration as she pursues a 
phd in psychology her other life is playing rock guitar 
my parents named me peggy sue for gods sake i was destined 
for a life of decadent rock n roll she said laughing 
hendrix who grew up in seattles predominantly black central 
area was about 14 when he talked his father into buying him a 5 
used guitar according to al hendrix 
he wore that thing out the father said later on i got 
him his first electric guitar and i got a sax i didnt know much 
about the sax and he didnt know much about the guitar so wed 
make quite a bit of noise 
at first the young hendrix was content to play along with 
recordings of blues greats bb king and muddy waters 
so i told him come up with something original and he 
did recalled al hendrix the first time i heard are you 
experienced the first jimi hendrix experience album it was 
something altogether different than what i was used to listening 
to 
it didnt take long for the elder hendrix to become one of his 
sons biggest fans innovative sometimes outrageous and blaring 
with his music jimi was quiet and unassuming offstage his father 
said 
al hendrix still goes to his sons grave about once a month 
still gets a kick out of recalling the times he has found fans 
sitting around the grave with guitars in hand 
fans frequently leave small items peg wood added a guitar pick 
to the collection there 
he was the most inventive guitar player i ever heard she 
said i like the blues but i felt he rewrote them he changed 
the rules so that there werent any rules he freed me up

she was once known as mother 
of the nation a symbol of black defiance of south africas 
racial policies now winnie mandela faces criminal charges and an 
uncertain future in south africas antiapartheid movement 
the wife of african national congress leader nelson mandela has 
endured repeated hardships inflicted by the whiteled government 
throughout their 32 years of marriage 
but in recent years her controversial statements and sometimes 
erratic behavior have put her at odds with antiapartheid activists 
and blacks in her own community 
the government said tuesday that mrs mandela 56 will be 
charged with the 1988 kidnapping and assault of four young men 
including 14yearold stompei seipei who was killed 
the head of her bodyguard unit jerry richardson was convicted 
this year of murder and sentenced to death in the case 
mrs mandela has denied wrongdoing she and her husband have 
accused the government of using its investigation as a propaganda 
campaign and said she would welcome a chance to defend herself 
she will stand trial with seven members of the nowdisbanded 
mandela united football club which played few matches but served 
as her entourage and bodyguard 
tuesdays announcement came as mrs mandela appeared to have 
reclaimed a leading role in the antiapartheid movement after her 
husbands release in february from 27 years in prison mrs mandela 
was highly visible though silent as she accompanied him on 
international trips and to local rallies 
she recently began to make strong antigovernment statements 
that sometimes contradicted official anc policy 
the anc last month named her social welfare director a move 
criticized by some black leaders it is the first official post she 
has held in any antiapartheid group 
some antiapartheid figures have privately criticized mrs 
mandela for preferring the spotlight of international publicity to 
the less glamorous task of political organization 
she is blunt rash emotional and speaks from the heart that 
is why people respond to her and why she is controversial said 
fatima meer author of a biography of mandela 
following her husbands imprisonment in 1962 mrs mandela 
raised their two daughters alone while under constant restrictions 
including house arrest she was held in solitary confinement for 
more than a year though never charged with a crime 
she defied the government restrictions during nationwide unrest 
in the mid1980s making fiery speeches at public rallies and 
funerals of activists 
antiapartheid leaders launched a campaign to promote her as 
mother of the nation but a series of controversial statements 
and actions eroded her stature 
she told a 1986 rally with our boxes of matches and our 
necklaces we shall liberate this country the remark was a 
reference to necklacing the killing of suspected government 
collaborators by setting ablaze a tire placed around the neck 
the exiled anc leadership disassociated itself from the remark 
endorsing the practice 
many of mrs mandelas recent troubles have stemmed from her 
association with the soccer team the mandela home was burned down 
in july 1988 by a group of black youths that clashed with mandela 
united 
then came accusations that seipei and three others were abducted 
by soccer team members and brought to mrs mandelas new home 
where she allegedly beat them with a whip

a us negotiator said tuesday 
washington is prepared to give up its bases in the philippines but 
wants a final decision delayed until the next century and voted on 
by the filipino people 
chief us negotiator richard armitage made the statement during 
the opening session of talks here on the future of the usrun 
military facilities 
it is clear to me that the days of a very large presence 
of us sailors and airmen in the philippines are coming to an 
end armitage said what remains for us to determine is the 
rate at which this presence will be reduced and the nature of the 
relationship our two governments wish to pursue during and after 
this transitional period 
let the voters of the 21st century decide whether or not they 
believe a continued us presence will be helpful armitage said 
a spokesman for the philippine negotiators rafael alunan 
welcomed armitages willingness to discuss the crafting of a 
new relationship between our two countries but took exception to 
armitages call for filipino voters in the next century to decide 
on the american presence 
this matter is not to be decided in the 21st century alunan 
said the time for decision is now 
the lease on the us bases expires in september 1991 any 
extension of the american presence after that must be approved by 
the 23member senate where opposition to the bases is strong and 
also by a national referendum if ordered by the philippines 
congress 
analysts say most filipinos would vote for the us bases to 
remain because of their economic benefits 
the current talks are a continuation of negotiations that began 
in may on the future of clark air base subic bay naval base and 
four smaller us facilities 
us officials previously stated us troops would remain in the 
philippines only as long as they are wanted but on monday state 
department spokesman richard boucher said washington wants to keep 
its bases in the philippines 
armitages statement marked the first time a us official had 
publicly raised the possibility of washingtons readiness to give 
up the bases he did not propose a timetable for removing the 
40000 troops defense department civilians and military 
dependents us sources said washington hopes for continued access 
to the facilities perhaps on a commercial basis after 
relinquishing formal control 
the united states has strongly supported president corazon 
aquinos administration since 1986 when a civilianmilitary 
uprising ended the 20year rule of the late president ferdinand 
marcos 
in december us jets flew air cover for government forces 
during an unsuccessful bid by military rebels to oust mrs aquino 
american troops from the bases also provided help for the 
government during a july earthquake that killed nearly 1700 
people 
but opponents believe the bases infringe on national sovereignty 
and represent a vestige of american colonial rule which ended with 
independence in 1946 us forces have been in the philippines 
since the americans captured the islands from spain in 1898 except 
for a period of japanese occupation during world war ii 
mrs aquino said monday her government wants to maintain close 
ties with washington but that the end of the cold war and absence 
of any external threat to the philippines made the bases less 
important 
mrs aquino said a government committee was drafting plans to 
convert the bases into civilian use including a commercial airport 
at clark and a ship repair facility at subic 
meanwhile communist rebels claimed responsibility for a bombing 
late monday at a voice of america station 60 miles north of manila 
the insurgents said the bombing was to protest continued us 
domination of this former colony there were no injuries and 
us officials said damage was slight 
last may communist rebels killed two american airmen near clark 
on the eve of talks on the bases american troops and their 
families have been restricted to base to prevent possible attacks 
during the current negotiations

if the persian gulf crisis culminates with the 
removal of saddam hussein from power experts on that part of the 
world say they wouldnt look for democracy to blossom under the 
iraqi sun saddams most likely successor would be a saddam clone 
the nature of any new government in iraq no matter what the 
denouement of the current crisis is one of the puzzlements for 
those trying to visualize how the crisis might end 
saddam could lose his showdown with george bush and hang on but 
it is just as likely that he could not survive such a humiliating 
defeat in that event the experts suspect his successor would be 
someone from his inner military circles someone much like him 
in eastern europe in the winter of 1989 and the spring of 1990 
the world saw one autocracy after another fall to be replaced by 
governments responsive to the popular will 
but democracy is alien to iraq and most of the rest of the arab 
world egypt is the only arab country with a semblance of it 
so the best betting is that whatever follows saddam is likely to 
be a government similar to the one that exists now an 
autocratic oneman rule says herman eilts former us 
ambassador to egypt and saudi arabia now a boston university 
professor 
its presumably someone in the military agrees daniel pipes 
director of the foreign policy research institute in philadelphia 
but he says the successor would probably only be a new face 
behind the same old iron fist 
the next government like the present one pipes says is likely 
to be based on power not principles saddam hussein doesnt 
stand for anything he says and neither would his successor 
by contrast iran iraqs neighbor is a government based on 
ideology the muslim principles of the ayatollahs 
the traditional way for governments to change in iraq 
former cia director william colby has noted is when the 
successor murders his predecessor 
but saddam has already survived dozens of plots against him and 
wiped out any visible opposition 
the experts are uncertain whether saddam can meet president 
bushs demand for iraq to withdraw completely immediately and 
without condition from kuwait and still survive 
to find an ally for his conquest of kuwait saddam gave back to 
iran virtually everything gained in the bloody eightyear iraniraq 
war buckling now to bushs demands would make iraqis look upon 
both the war and the invasion as worthless enterprises for which 
much was paid 
the regime sustains power by doling out goodies and if he 
withdraws from kuwait its another blunder he wont have any 
goodies says laurie mylroie a fellow at the harvard center for 
middle eastern studies in that event she posits the military may 
move against him 
if he were made to retreat with nothing to show for it it 
would be a serious humiliation and weaken his position says 
historian shaul bakhash of george mason university in virginia 
author of reign of the ayatollahs iran and the islamic 
revolution 
but eilts says that as long as saddam keeps control of the 
instruments of coercion the army and the police he can 
still control the situation 
he notes reports that saddam recently had 14 army officers 
executed to remind their survivors in the officer corps of the 
price of dissent there has been a spate of rumors of executions of 
generals for opposing the takeover of kuwait 
if war comes pipes says and the united states and its allies 
defeat iraq saddam of course would be removed by the victors who 
would then have the duty of replacing him 
in a society with no democratic tradition installing a new 
government one that will no longer be a threat to the region will 
become a responsibility of america and its allies 
it is he says a staggering thought

the us department of education has cut up 
to 7 million in aid to dekalb county schools after a sixyear 
battle over whether or not the school system discriminates against 
handicapped students 
the school system contends the department of educations office 
for civil rights is overstepping its authority in investigating 
allegations of discrimination 
among other things the fund cut announced monday would affect 
special mathematics instruction for lowincome pupils assistance 
for the handicapped and programs for immigrant children 
school superintendent robert freeman and the systems attorneys 
went to us district court in washington today seeking a 
temporary restraining order on removal of the funds until a lawsuit 
being heard in that court is resolved if that court rules against 
dekalb may said the system would appeal to the 11th us circuit 
court said school spokeswoman christine may 
freeman earlier acknowledged that the school system cannot 
sustain the programs for long without federal aid and said the 
schools will back down if they lose in court 
we cant afford to fight the us government we cant afford 
to surrender any of our federal funds said freeman 
taking funds away from a school district is the most drastic 
means for this office to enforce the law said michael l 
williams assistant us secretary of education for civil rights 
but when it is necessary to guarantee the protection of civil 
rights for all this administration will not hesitate to do so 
the county school system just east of atlanta has about 71000 
students as of may 3200 of those are either in 
selfcontained centers or taking four or more courses in 
special education 
parents complained in 1984 the county refused to pay for 
private residential placements for handicapped children 
may declined to comment on the parents complaint 
the parents could have filed complaints under the education of 
the handicapped act which requires a free appropriate public 
education for disabled students 
but they filed complaints instead under section 504 of the 
rehabilitation act of 1983 a civil rights law barring 
discrimination against the disabled in federally funded programs 
the county refused to cooperate with the education departments 
investigation of the complaints saying the department had no 
jurisdiction the state of georgia also refused to cooperate 
while the education of the handicapped act covers a set list of 
disabilities section 504 school officials contend could be used 
to cover a wide range of problems including illegal drug use 
in a 1987 ruling on a procedural issue in the dekalb case a 
federal judge in atlanta said the dispute over authority under the 
two laws had not been resolved by the courts

pilots over age 60 have twice as many 
accidents as those in their 50s but theyre still safer than 
pilots in their 20s or 30s according to a congressional report 
the office of technology assessment reached no conclusion on 
whether the federal aviation administration should revise its 
regulation forcing retirement at age 60 for pilots on major 
airlines those which operate planes with more than 30 seats 
there is no such requirement for corporate private or 
commuterairline pilots 
critics have argued the age60 rule for airlines arbitrarily 
grounds many healthy experienced pilots and denies the traveling 
public the benefit of their skill 
they have called for more flexible rules tied to stringent 
medical examinations but the ota questioned whether current 
testing techniques could adequately detect the subtle mental 
deterioration which it deems the principal hazard posed by aging 
pilots 
the otas study based on average accidents per 100000 flight 
hours for all pilots with more than 1000 hours of flight 
experience found that pilots between ages 60 to 69 have an 
accident rate that is 21 times higher than the accident rate for 
50 to 59yearolds 
however the same data show that the accident rate for the 
60to 69yearold pilots is less than that for pilots in the 
3039yearold and 2029yearold age groups the report said 
it found that experience clearly counts noting that pilots over 
60 with more than 5000 flight hours have a lower accident rate 
than pilots of any age with 1000 to 5000 flight hours but in all 
experience groups the accident rate goes up after 60 the ota 
said 
the congressional agency said the safety issue for major 
airlines has little to do with the vulnerability of aging pilots to 
sudden impairment a heart attack say since a copilot and 
sometimes a third flight officer are on the flight deck and could 
take the controls in such cases 
rather piloterror accidents are almost always based on 
mental error rather than the pilots incapacitation and the data 
showing higher accident rates for the over60 bracket suggest 
that the increase may be due to subtle agerelated 
deterioration in cognitive function 
thus more stringent or frequent medical exams likely would have 
little effect on accident rates unless they involved more accurate 
neuropsychological measurements than currently available the ota 
said 
the airline industry and the air line pilots association both 
support the age60 mandatory retirement rule

former president reagan tutored moscow university 
students tuesday on the finer points of capitalism and democracy 
and said hed copy mikhail gorbachevs economic reforms if he were 
soviet leader 
reagan also said during a questionandanswer session at moscow 
state university that he believes germany has rejoined the 
civilized world and will not repeat nazi atrocities 
reagan met with about 45 students for an hour in the 
universitys mammoth administration building in the lenin hills 
looking down on central moscow later tuesday he met with the 
board of directors of the associated press 
hes great he impresses me he radiates energy yuri 
ammosov a 21yearold history student said after listening to 
reagan 
he does not seem as old as he is said another student 
edwin lobinsh i would think that he was about 60 he just keeps 
on going 
despite his hearing aid the 79yearold former president had 
trouble hearing some of the students questions and had to be 
helped by us ambassador jack matlock 
but he had no trouble lauding gorbachev one of the schools 
bestknown graduates and said the two men continue to build on the 
relationship forged in front of a fireplace at their first summit 
in geneva in november 1985 
who would have thought that the warmth of that fireplace in 
geneva would melt the ice of the cold war reagan said later in a 
luncheon toast at the us embassy 
reagan told the students that if he suddenly became president of 
the soviet union and had to salvage its crumbling economy he would 
follow the same course as gorbachev to bring about private 
ownership to bring about the free economy that has proven so 
fruitful for our own country 
gorbachevs economic reform proposals were among the topics the 
two discussed in the kremlin on monday including the possibility 
of a soviet referendum on the decollectivization of farms 
a key to the reform he said is a persons right to own land 
until youve done so you cant realize the patriotism and the 
pride that you have when you can stand on a piece of land and say 
this is mine reagan told the group 
reagan said that while he wholeheartedly supported german 
unification he understood the apprehensions of many soviets who 
lost millions of people to the nazis in world war ii 
he said the preservation of concentration camps as memorials 
sends a message to young germans that this must never happen 
again 
so i think that germany has rejoined the civilized world and 
there will not be a repeat of the nazi horror reagan said 
reagan urged more exchanges between soviet and american 
students saying if young people like you in the world could 
get to know each other there would never be another war 
asked how he maintained his mental health during eight years in 
the white house reagan quoted another former president abraham 
lincoln 
he said at one point that he could not perform the duties of 
his office for 15 minutes if he did not know that he could call 
upon one who was wiser and stronger than all others reagan said 
he was speaking of course of god i learned while i was in 
the white house why he said that 
reagan and his wife nancy leave moscow for rome on wednesday 
after a fiveday visit at gorbachevs invitation the two couples 
dined together monday night but raisa gorbachev missed tuesdays 
lunch because of illness her husband said

the government could be stuck with a 619 
million bill for computer systems originally priced at 7 million 
because of poor management in the agriculture department says a 
congressional report 
the general accounting office said the government is paying 
andersen consulting a division of the arthur andersen accounting 
firm for the systems to monitor billions of dollars worth of 
commodities inventories 
one system was installed two years later than planned and the 
other is scheduled to be installed in july 1991 which would be 
almost a sixyear delay said the gao report the report was 
being reviewed today by a congressional subcommittee 
the gao congress investigative arm put heavy blame on 
ineffective project management and oversight by the agriculture 
stabilization and conservation service which commissioned the 
work 
sarita schotta deputy administrator of the service told the 
house government operations subcommittee on agriculture she is now 
providing the supervision the project should have had all along 
schotta has been overseeing the project for a year the costs have 
been piling up since 1983 
the delays and cost increase since the awarding of this 
contract have been astonishing said rep robert wise dwva 
subcommittee chairman 
he said the agriculture departments inspector general issued 
reports in 1986 and 1987 criticizing the agency and andersen 
consulting but the ascs never showed them to andersen 
the service deals with billions of dollars administering farm 
commodity conservation and emergency assistance programs 
including commodity loans and price support payments to farmers 
in 1989 for example its program and administrative costs 
amounted to 13 billion by the end of the fiscal year its 
commodities inventories totaled nearly 4 billion 
since the 1950s the service has used an automated system to 
track the acquisition storage movement sale and donation of 
grain and processed commodities but the computer system was 
becoming outdated 
in 1983 the service awarded andersen a contract to update its 
systems for 7 million it tacked on a cost plus incentive fee 
because no one would take the job at fixed cost 
most agencies by now have learned that cost plus is a ticket 
for automatic disaster said wise he noted that the provision 
has cost the taxpayers nine times the amount originally estimated 
for work that is not yet complete 
he said users of one of the systems are moving data into 
personal computers to do sensitive reports 
it seems the users do not feel that the system is reliable 
enough to do critical work wise said 
wise said he found the nearly 62 million in spending 
particularly troubling since the agency plans a massive upgrade of 
other systems 
in may the agency said it needed an additional 57 million in 
procurement authority for minicomputer equipment upgrades 
maintenance and software between july 1990 and september 1992 
the gao questioned the 57 million figure saying it made its 
own calculations and found the job could be done for about 25 
million

associated press writerequals 
washington ap president bushs drug advisory council tuesday 
announced a fall conference of civic leaders to discuss strategies 
for winning the fight against illegal drugs in americas cities 
the leadership forum scheduled to be held nov 910 will be 
the basis for organizing a national coalition of the 200 local 
antidrug organizations that have sprung up nationwide the council 
said 
it is based on an emerging belief that a priceless resource in 
our nations war on drugs is a long list of local communities whose 
privatesector leadership is both organized and committed to 
initiate new activities and to strengthen ongoing programs to 
reduce the use of illegal drugs in that community said alvah h 
chapman jr an advisory council member and former chairman of 
knight ridder inc the miamibased newspaper company 
coalitions of local business civic and religious leaders have 
offered advice to schools and private firms about improving drug 
education programs chapman said 
others have launched antidrug advertising campaigns a group in 
santa barbara calif has spurred antidrug peer pressure among 
the citys youth he said still others are fostering programs to 
promote drugfree workplace programs in private businesses 
in miami the coalition that chapman helped found pushed local 
officials to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles to efforts to enforce 
a law that allows demolition of crack houses in that city last 
year 475 crack houses were demolished he said 
the coalition didnt run the bulldozers that knocked down the 
houses but the coalition did use a bulldozer on the bureaucracy 
that was preventing the local law that was in effect from for two 
years from being really applied chapman said 
bush appointed the 27member advisory council to help coordinate 
privatesector and nonprofit drug programs and to help enlist 
volunteer organizations in the war on drugs said the panels 
chairman william moss 
chapman said he hoped that the effort will unleash private money 
to help expand drugtreatment programs which he said must provide 
24hour service to those who want help 
if you are making a decision to kick the drug habit and you

offers of food for six orphaned wolf pups 
are pouring in from montanans moved by the animals plight but 
officials say the 4monthold animals are making do with some help 
from the government 
the response has been amazing said ed bangs head of the 
us fish and wildlife services project to restore wolves in 
montana 
the animals protected by the endangered species act are part 
of a federal program to establish 10 breeding pairs of wolves in 
montana 
one woman wanted to donate venison steaks from her freezer 
another had some chickens she didnt need a man offered to set up 
a guard station to protect the pups in the ninemile valley west of 
missoula 
bangs turned them all down 
the pups are doing fine on roadkilled animals and the surplus 
deer meat that officials are providing from the lee metcalf 
national wildlife refuge said mike jimenez the wildlife biologist 
who has monitored the litter since spring 
jimenez said the pups spend their days chasing grasshoppers 
field mice and gophers they weigh about 50 pounds and are about 
the size of german shepherds 
the pups mother was illegally shot to death last summer the 
father fed and protected them until he was hit by a car on 
interstate 90 two weeks ago 
federal officials then stepped in but the animals will be back 
on their own by winter when theyll have to start killing their own 
game bangs said 
he says some of them probably wont survive falling victim to 
starvation mountain lions or hunters stray bullets 
the pups will have more hard knocks than if there was an adult 
protecting them he said

on her first day back to school 
7yearold wanda colored a mimeographed counting exercise ate a 
hamburger for lunch and took the no 4 bus home to a city 
shelter 
for wanda and for the thousands of other homeless children 
just going back to school can be a lesson in survival 
these kids have gone through a lot by the time they get into 
the classroom said michelle linehan director of the state 
department of educations office for education of homeless children 
in boston 
theyre not homeless because they want to be said glenwood 
elementary principal robert kelliher whose school is near the 
motelshelter where wanda lives they want the same thing as 
other youngsters a bed to sleep in at night a place to study 
a place to play 
as of november 12000 children were living in massachusetts 
shelters half of them school age linehan said thats only the 
numbers that we know of she said 
the us department of education estimated that at the end of 
last year 200000 of the 272000 homeless children attended 
schools 
problems facing homeless children range from ragged clothes and 
no place to study to poor self esteem families driven to shelters 
by house fires often have trouble tracking down duplicates of birth 
certificates and immunization records required for school 
admission 
shelters report that more than 10 percent of their schoolage 
children do not go to school and tests show that they have a harder 
time in the classroom 
a lot of them are tired because theyre living in crowded 
conditions they seem distant said arlene tanous who works with 
homeless children for the springfield action commission 
for many parents the chief concern is keeping their chldren in 
the school they attended before homelessness struck 
the alternative is a fractured education said kelliher 
recounting the story of a thirdgrader who had moved 13 times 
kelliher persuaded school officials to find money for private 
transportation back to glenwood if the boy moved again 
i was informed the other day that hes moved kelliher said 
utica new york 
a 1987 federal law gives children of homeless families the 
choice of going to the school in their last district or one closer 
to the shelter however the law doesnt provide for transportation 
to the old school 
then theres the stigma of homelessness 
desiree a fourth grader doesnt tell her friends that 
financial problems led to a change of address over the summer 
i just told her if anybody asks you where youre staying 
youre just staying with a friend said her mother naomi who 
spoke on condition that her last name not be used 
dealing with that sort of problem is one of the functions of 
linehans office founded three years ago with an administrative 
budget of about 90000 a year 
in addition to collecting information and applying for grants 
for such things as home tutoring programs for the homeless 
linehans office has prepared guidelines for teachers 
its just things such as being aware that if you have birthday 
parties this kid may not be able to bring a treat so be aware of 
that linehan said teachers also should beware of the importance 
a homeless child may attach to seemingly meaningless possessions 
when i used to teach if a kid came in with a little car 
after the third warning not to play with it in class it used to 
go in the bottom drawer until after may you just cant do that to 
a homeless kid it can devastate them she said 
at 7 wanda is too young to worry about her classmates finding 
out where she lives but her older sister 12yearold wakena 
isnt wakena scheduled to start at a junior high school this 
fall wasnt too sure last week if she wanted to go 
some of those kids are cracking on teasing you she said 
about clothes you know like 50 sneakers 
the junior high would be her sixth or seventh school she said 
we went to a lot of schools we never finished a year she 
said 
the family has had a succession of living arrangements during 
the past six years said her mother betty foster she said she 
hopes to get more assistance from the state to get out of the 
motelshelter and into an apartment 
i want them to have good education you got to find some kind 
of opportunity she said i tell them what are you going to 
do clean somebodys bathroom

the us merchandise trade deficit soared 75 
percent in july for its steepest increase in eight years the 
government said renewing recessionary fears even before the 
effects of the persian gulf crisis are felt 
the commerce department said the deficit totaled 933 billion 
up sharply from 534 billion in june and the worst imbalance since 
last januarys 102 billion the surge was the largest since the 
shortfall jumped 205 percent to 55 billion in august 1982 a 
spokesman said 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher noted the july report 
contained the last trade data unaffected by the disruptions caused 
by the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the rise in oil prices since then is likely to increase the 
average trade deficit for the last five months by an amount in 
excess of 2 billion per month mosbacher said 
in addition to the effects of the oilprice shock many private 
analysts pointed to a 64 percent decline in exports in july and 
questioned whether much improvement was in the offing 
over the past three years fully onethird of overall us 
economic growth has been supplied by surging export sales that had 
become even more important recently as consumer spending faded in 
the face of adverse economic news 
but mark m zandi an economist with regional financial 
associates in west chester pa said high interest rates and 
slower economic growth overseas are going to take a bite out of 
our export picture he said 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a new 
york securities dealer added that while its unlikely the trade 
numbers will continue to look as bad as they did in july they do 
give us a hint that we have come to the end of major improvements 
in trade 
in fact the united states had a deficit of 133 billion with 
western europe because of falling exports after posting a surplus 
of 806 million in june 
exports have been the only area of strength in the economy for 
several years now said bruce steinberg senior economist for 
merrill lynch in new york if they fall theres no area of 
strength and thats very bothersome 
exports which posted a record 343 billion in june fell to 
320 billion in july imports jumped 45 percent to 414 billion 
the deficit is the difference between the two 
nevertheless mosbacher said exports were up 81 percent during 
the first seven months of the year while imports rose just 33 
percent meaning the 1990 deficit was running at an annual rate of 
950 billion the deficit last year totaled 10940 billion 
he remained optimistic that the nonoil deficit which he 
called a better indicator of international competitiveness 
would decline further from the current 458 billion rate 
oil imports in july rose 79 prcent to 398 billion but that 
was due to increased volume rather than prices americans imported 
885 million barrels a day up from 840 million in june while the 
average price per barrel edged down from 1464 to 1450 
since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait however crude oil 
prices have surpassed 33 a barrel 
exports slipped in part because of a 500 million drop in 
aircraft shipments but decreases also were posted in all major 
categories capital goods foods automobiles industrial supplies 
and consumer goods 
at the same time consumer and capital goods automobiles and 
industrial supplies added to the import total 
as usual the biggest deficit was with japan a 297 billion 
imbalance down from a 307 billion deficit in june 
other deficits included taiwan 114 billion china 113 
billion canada 992 million brazil 335 million korea 623 
million and hong kong 439 million

americans are growing increasingly 
disenchanted with the two major political parties associating 
republicans with wealth and greed and democrats with incompetence 
according to a survey released tuesday 
since 1987 there has been a significant upswing in feelings 
of mistrust of political leaders disillusionment with politics and 
feelings of powerlessness said the times mirror survey 
titledthe people the press amp politics 1990 
the study said the growing cynicism and economic polarization 
among all but the wealthiest americans threatens to subvert 
traditional partisan politics or block the effective resolution of 
social and economic issues 
another finding was that while anticommunism is fading as a 
factor in american politics antijapanese sentiment has soared as 
economic expectations plummet equally dramatic was the decline 
in support for israel 
dislike for the japanese has become more mainstream 
concluded the survey it is no longer primarily concentrated 
among the kinds of people who have been hit especially hard by 
japanese competition 
growing dislike for israel is evident across all demographic 
political and social groups except among american jews the 
survey said but it also said that it is important to note that 
the sharp decline in identification with israel has not been 
accompanied by a substantial identification with the causes of the 
palestinians 
president bush fared as well in this as in other recent surveys 
with 76 percent giving him very or mostly favorable ratings 
the findings were based on facetoface interviews in may with 
3004 adults a random sample of 1000 was reinterviewed between 
aug 19 and 25 the responses for the overall sample had a margin 
of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points 
the responses were analyzed by princeton research associates and 
compared to the findings of a similar study conducted in 1987 
in the three years between the two studies there was little 
change in americans affiliation with the major parties the 
number of people identifying themselves as republicans increased 3 
percentage points while those calling themselves democrats 
declined 4 points 
the survey found 33 percent of the respondents called themselves 
democrats 28 percent republicans and 39 percent independents 
beneath this surface stability however there are volatile 
forces at work said the study it concluded that both parties 
have declined precipitously in the publics estimation 
even among people who are the strongest supporters of the 
democratic party the party was viewed as incapable of governing 
america successfully and unclear on what it should stand for 
despite the republican success at holding the white house the 
survey concluded the party has been unable to capitalize on these 
declining democratic fortunes because the gop itself is now seen by 
a majority of the public as the political instrument of the 
nations rich and powerful 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown said im not at all 
disheartened by those findings he noted that the survey was 
conducted at a time when the republican president has very high 
approval ratings but that nonetheless it reinforces the point 
that weve been trying to get across namely that the republican 
party is the party of the privileged few 
brown said his party must do a better job of getting across the 
point that republicans have been in charge of government for the 
last decade it hasnt been democrats and republicans have failed 
totally in managing this government 
the latest survey found growth in the already large numbers of 
americans feeling alienated from their government 
among the findings were these 
thirty percent said they agreed completely with the statement 
that generally speakng elected officials in washington often 
lose touch with the people pretty quickly three years ago 22 
percent agreed completely 
the majority that felt people like themselves have no say in 
what government does grew from 52 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in 
1990 
the number of people who said that elected officials care 
what they think declined from 47 percent to 44 percent 
thirtyeight percent said they agreed completely with the 
statement its really true the rich get richer and the poor get 
poorer that was an increase from 31 percent in 1987 
drugs far outstripped other matters when people were asked to 
list the most important problems facing the nation 
thirtysix percent cited drugs compared to 11 percent three 
years ago the federal deficit was named by 11 percent the same 
proportion as in 1987 homelessness and the environment each were 
listed by 8 percent fewer than 1 percent named either matter three 
years ago 
the proportion of people willing to spend more money to combat 
drugs increased from 66 percent in 1987 to 73 percent this year 
in both surveys 67 percent said they would be willing to spend 
more for the homeless and 35 percent would approve more funds to 
aid blacks and other minorities 
on abortion the survey found 55 percent saying they opposed 
restrictions on access to abortions however among republicans and 
those who lean to the gop 47 percent opposed restrictions and 48 
percent favored them democrats and those inclined to support the 
party opposed restrictions by a margin of 62 percent to 33 percent 
when asked about attitudes toward japan 56 percent gave a 
favorable opinion and 39 percent unfavorable three years ago 69 
percent viewed japan favorably and 27 percent unfavorably 
the greatest increases in unfavorable opinion toward the 
japanese occurred among whites men upper income earners and those 
in the western united states the survey found 
on israel 44 percent rated the country favorably and 45 percent 
unfavorably three years ago the split was 65 percent favorable 
and 27 percent unfavorable

a sharp increase in opium production in 
guatemala has prompted the state department to add that country to 
its list of drug problem countries an administration official 
said tuesday 
according to official estimates the guatemala acreage devoted 
to opium is sufficient for a 12ton yield any country with a yield 
of 5 tons or more is automatically placed on the state department 
list 
the official who asked not to be identified said that 
inclusion on the list does not constitute criticism of guatemalas 
efforts to curb drug trafficking 
he said smugglers send raw opium from guatemala to mexico where 
it is refined into heroin for shipment to the united states 
guatemala joins 10 other latin american and caribbean countries 
on the list colombia mexico ecuador jamaica the bahamas 
belize paraguay ecuador bolivia and panama fourteen asian and 
middle eastern countries are also on the list 
the only other hemispheric country where there is sizeable opium 
production is mexico but production in mexico and guatemala is 
minuscule next to such countries as burma afghanistan iran and 
laos according to official statistics 
the us embassy spokesman in guatemala city james dickmeyer 
said the guatemalan government has tried to curb opium poppy and 
marijuana production and to curtail cocaine shipments from 
colombia 
diplomatic sources said president vinicio cerezo is being urged 
to use the guatemalan military to stop cocaine trafficking through 
guatemala 
two prominent citizens were killed recently in what appeared to 
be incidents linked to drug trafficking 
heavily armed men shot banker ramiro castillo love to death at 
his home on aug 24 
he refused to launder drug money former vice president 
mario sandoval alarcon a friend of castillos said 
danilo barillas head of a commission investigating corruption 
in the christian democrat party and widely believed to have found 
links to the colombian cartels was killed on aug 1

the seabrook nuclear power plant has been 
allowed to go into full operation within three miles of a popular 
beach without adequate plans for evacuation in the event of 
disaster the us court of appeals was told tuesday 
as opponents of the plant demonstrated outside the court heard 
arguments on the petition of massachusetts officials and 
environmental groups to revoke the license issued for the new 
hampshire facility 
the plant was licensed by the commission in march after nearly 
two decades of court challenges and thousands of arrests in mass 
demonstrations it began operations last month 
lawyers for the nuclear regulatory commission and the new 
hampshire public service company principal owner of the plant 
defended the licensing saying the nrc followed longestablished 
principles that provided substantial protection they said there 
was no way to know in advance just how much protection would be 
adequate 
the idea is to create a plan that provides some measure of 
protection to the people said john f cordes jr attorney for 
the nrc he said the procedures were not designed to permit the 
commission to revisit a site decision once it was made 
judge stephen f williams a member of the threejudge panel 
that heard the arguments asked if this meant that you do the 
best you can in the circumstances if that means distributing bibles 
and suicide pills 
cordes replied that the commissions rules would allow it to 
change its procedures if it were faced with a site where it 
believed no one could be evacuated and there was no shelter 
that is not remotely the case at seabrook he said 
robert a backus representing two citizens groups opposed to 
the plant said the nearby beach attracts at least 50000 people on 
fine summer days he said the only shelters available are motels 
cottages and structures such as ice cream parlors with screened 
porches 
although there is one interstate highway in the area most of 
the potential escape routes are twolane roads he said he said 
traffic jams in the area sometimes last for as long as seven hours 
he said the commission failed to follow its procedures in 
approving an evacuation plan for people living in 17 new hampshire 
communities and six in neighboring massachusetts 
the commission did not make a judgment on whether or not there 
were adequate evacuation plans backus told the court 
they basically made a judgment without looking at the 
evidence said john traficante assistant massachusetts attorney 
general we are not saying they drew the wrong line we are 
saying they drew no line 
traficante argued that the commission relied on a check list 
that doesnt have any teeth on this basis he said it could 
approve a site on 42nd and broadway in new york 
cordes said the commissions procedures assured that there would 
be a full measure of planning for an emergency and that this 
would be substantial protection for the public 
this is not a secret approach he said its nothing 
mysterious 
thomas g dignan jr representing the owners argued the 
adequacy of an evacuation plan is something that will never be 
determined at a nuclear site until the day of the accident 
he said it would depend on such things as the nature of the 
accident and the wind direction at the time 
judges james f buckley and a raymond randolph are the other 
members of the panel which will rule later on the petition 
stephen b comley of rowley mass a leader of the 
demonstration that was held outside said a similar demonstration 
is planned for wednesday at the headquarters of the nrc 
ron sher spokesman for new hampshire yankee seabrooks 
operator said by telephone from seabrook station it is ironic 
and unfortunate that opponents continue to try to stop the 
operation of seabrook when seabrook is generating electricity and 
displacing the need to burn more than a million and a half barrels 
of oil a month

the united states is on the verge 
of paying a 200 million claim brought by iran western diplomats 
said tuesday the payment would pave the way for the resolution of 
a decadeold dispute 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
settlement of the claim stemming from iranian payments made on 
undelivered us weaponry was imminent 
the case is part of the foreign military sales claim being 
arbitrated here by the iranunited states claims tribunal the 
9yearold tribunal is charged with arbitrating all commercial and 
governmenttogovernment claims between the two nations arising 
from the 1979 iranian revolution and the ensuing expropriations and 
broken contracts 
iran has set the total military sales claim involving 1200 
cases in all at 11 billion a figure the us government says is 
inflated 
once the case involving the undelivered weaponry is settled the 
200 million will be deposited in the socalled security account 
from which money is paid out to claimants at the tribunal the 
money is now in a trust fund 
another case close to being settled involves weapons that iran 
had sent to the united states for repairs but never got back the 
weapons were impounded by the us government after the 1979 
seizing of the us embassy in tehran by islamic militants 
the sources would not give a time frame for settlement of this 
case nor put a dollar amount on it but the settlement is believed 
to amount to up to 300 million 
the agreement is were paying them an agreedupon value for 
the equipment and we get to keep it said a western diplomat 
the military equipment impounded by the us government includes 
several airplanes airplane engines and even a world war iiera 
dieselpowered submarine now in the philadelphia navy yard 
at the time of the revolution iran had large numbers of 
warplanes and several destroyers on order in the united states but 
those were canceled by mutual agreement in light of the freeze on 
military transfers 
the largest foreign military sales claim is irans 5 billion 
demand for damages resulting from the us governments refusal to 
license exports of weaponry and other military material tehran had 
ordered the iranian government has never explained precisely how 
it arrived at that figure 
but tehran has on several occasions said that return of its 
assets held by the united states was a precondition for its 
intervention on behalf of western hostages held in lebanon the 
captors of the 13 known western hostages are believed to be 
proiranian shiite moslem militants 
however a western diplomat said the foreign military sales 
negotiation process is completely internal to the tribunal it 
has nothing to do with any outside events including hostages and 
the iraqkuwait situation 
the tribunal is the only official forum for contacts between the 
united states and iran it was set up in 1980

skyrocketing oil costs pushed retail prices up 
a sharp 08 percent last month as the persian gulf crisis began 
hitting americans wallets the government said tuesday 
the seasonally adjusted increase in the labor departments 
consumer price index was double the 04 percent rise in july and 
the largest since january when a severe cold snap pushed prices up 
11 percent 
in a separate report signalling slackening economic growth the 
commerce department reported the sharpest increase in the trade 
deficit since august 1982 americans imported 933 billion more 
than they exported in july up 75 percent from june 
analysts said the trade deterioration was particularly worrisome 
because it was recorded before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
sent oil prices and thus the value of us imports spiraling 
were looking at the worst of all possible worlds for the 
economy worsening inflation and slower growth said economist 
david jones of aubrey j lanston amp co a government securities 
dealer in new york 
financial markets turned down in response to the double dose of 
bad news 
for the first eight months of 1990 prices rose at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 62 percent up sharply from the 46 
percent rise for all of 1989 
inflation is now at the worst pace in eight years said 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch it is the worst since 
1982 when the economy was coming out of doubledigit inflation 
the department attributed nearly half of the august increase to 
energy costs up 43 percent gasoline prices rose 76 percent 
while fuel oil prices jumped 154 percent after six consecutive 
declines it was the steepest increase in both categories since 
january 
food inflation however moderated prices held back by a 
decline in fruit and vegetable costs rose 03 percent the 
smallest since may fresh fruit prices tumbled 4 percent but dairy 
costs rose 13 percent prices in other food categories also 
increased 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors prices rose a 
seasonally adjusted 05 percent after a 06 percent increase in 
july that translates into an annual core inflation rate of more 
than 6 percent a persistently high rate to accompany an economic 
slowdown analysts said 
they believe more bad news is coming in the next several months 
crude oil prices have continued to rise in september topping 33 a 
barrel this month compared with an average of 20 in july that 
will work its way through to the gasoline pump 
also increases are ahead for chemicals paint plastics and 
other petroleumbased products said economist allen sinai of the 
boston co 
the chain of effects of oil inflation is massive through the 
economy we calculate that 75 percent to 80 percent of the items in 
the consumer index ultimately are affected by oil he said 
however many analysts believe economic growth is too slow and 
demand too weak to support a sustained inflation burst if oil 
prices stabilize 
in another report the labor department said americans 
inflationadjusted earnings fell a seasonally adjusted 06 percent 
in august earnings fell 05 percent in each of the two preceding 
months 
in other details of price activity in august housing costs rose 
07 percent and transportation was up 18 percent both were driven 
by rising energy prices with gasoline accounting for nearly 90 
percent of the transportation rise 
medical care rose 09 percent in line with a long string of 
sharp increases tobacco was up 03 percent after having risen more 
than 2 percent in both july and june clothing and upkeep costs 
were up a slight 01 percent 
the various changes put the index for all consumer goods at 
1316 in august that means that a hypothetical selection of goods 
costing 100 in the 198284 base period would have cost 13160 in 
august up 7 from a year earlier the index numbers are not 
adjusted for seasonal variations 
the recent combination of oilinduced inflation and slow 
economic growth has put monetary policymakers in a quandary the 
federal reserve board normally pushes interest rates higher to 
fight inflation and lower to stimulate lagging growth 
it just poses the worst possible dilemma jones said fed 
policymakers are likely to keep policy unchanged while they let the 
dust settle from the middle east explosion

a pattern of widespread murder by government 
security forces appears to be continuing in sri lanka amnesty 
international said in a report released wednesday 
in northeastern sri lanka where government forces are battling 
tamil separatists hundreds of defenseless civilians may have 
been victims of extrajudicial execution or disappearances the 
report said 
indeed the government appears to condone the summary killing 
of suspected tamil tiger members it added 
as many as 30000 people are believed to have died in 1988 and 
1989 in the south of sri lanka where the government faced 
sinhalese rebels the report said 
although reports of extrajudicial executions and 
disappearances in southern sri lanka diminished after march 1990 
they did not cease and intimidation and death threats by 
government forces continued the international human rights 
organization said 
with the renewed heavy fighting between government and the 
tamil tigers in the northeast since june amnesty international 
fears the pervasive pattern of violations is continuing 
the human rights group said the janatha vimukthi peramuna 
opposition tamil separatists and the indian peacekeeping force 
deployed in sri lanka between 1987 and 1990 were all guilty of 
serious human rights abuses 
in the south where the dominant group is sinhalese the 
government is opposed by the armed janatha vimukthi peramuna or 
peoples liberation front in the northeast the liberation tigers 
of tamil eelam or tamil tigers are fighting for a separate tamil 
state 
fighting continues in the northeast and more than 300000 
people have fled their homes in the jaffna district amnesty 
international said 
since 1987 the report said the united national party 
government of president ranasinghe premadasa had apparently allowed 
its security forces to ruthlessly suppress armed opposition 
thousands of people have disappeared or been killed at the 
hands of security forces in recent years in the south and hundreds 
more have fallen victim to this violence in the latest wave of 
repression in the northeast amnesty international said 
entire communities have been attacked in retaliation for 
opposition violence and many people have been arbitrarily rounded 
up and sometimes killed on the basis of anonymous accusations of 
subversive involvement it said 
for example in june government soldiers who had regained 
control of the town of kalmunai after the tamil tigers left it 
rounded up many young men stabbed them to death with bayonets 
and burned their bodies in shops said the report 
elsewhere in the east patients taken from hospital and 
refugees from camps have disappeared it said 
since 1987 the security forces had killed under many guises in 
uniform in plainclothes operations attributed to vigilantes 
and in death squads amnesty international said 
the government has fueled this violence by handing the 
security forces extraordinary powers said the report

iraqs erratic opening of the border 
with saudi arabia appeared to be part of a harsh campaign to break 
the kuwaiti peoples will to resist kuwaiti officials diplomats 
and refugees said tuesday 
over the past week iraqi authorities have introduced a series of 
measures that have put the population on edge they said they 
range from the trivial like making men shave to blowing up 
houses of suspected resistance members 
they are trying to break our morale to make us weak said 
faisal a 27yearold computer programmer who fled kuwait tuesday 
they want us just to give up 
faisal was one of about 750 refugees who made it to the saudi 
border crossing at khafji tuesday a steep drop from the thousands 
who arrived the two previous days on monday iraqi troops started 
seizing men under the age of 40 at random from cars that sharply 
reduced the numbers attempting to leave 
also fewer cars were being permitted across the border just 
one vehicle with a sick elderly man in it was allowed over in 
midafternoon 
the family in that car said all others were told to return to 
kuwait city and try again wednesday 
the haphazard releases appear designed to cause general 
consternation and upset the people said a western diplomat 
observing the border in case any of his nationals made it through 
saudi police expelled reporters from the border area tuesday 
afternoon before conducting a second thorough search of the 
hundreds of people who arrived over the past three days without a 
single identity document 
iraqi troops have confiscated passports car registrations and 
all other documents they found 
a team of four dogs trained to sniff explosives and narcotics 
assisted in the saudi search 
kuwaiti government officials questioned the refugees closely to 
check their accents family ties and knowledge of kuwait saudi 
officials have said they want to make sure no infiltrators make it 
through 
a senior official from the kuwaiti defense department said iraq 
over the past week had intensified its efforts to break any 
resistance find all foreigners still hiding in kuwait infiltrate 
the kuwaiti population with intelligence agents and seize as much 
private property as possible 
the official who had just returned from kuwait said the 
campaign stalled resistance plans to leave car bombs throughout the 
city 
we cannot move like in earlier days he said noting that 
checkpoints were put up every 300 yards sometimes closer in 
neighborhoods of suspected resistance activity 
each checkpoint now had at least one republican guard the 
besttrained iraqi troops assigned to it in the past week he 
said 
one refugee arrived at the border crossing with a flier released 
two days ago by the iraqi authorities 
it was directed at both the armed resistance and the civil 
disobedience campaign all kuwaitis in essential services have 
refused to go to work 
the flier ordered everyone to return to work or face heavy 
fines shops would be opened by force it said 
police and military officers are to turn themselves in within a 
week or face execution 
anyone caught firing a gun will be hanged or shot it said 
anyone found keeping a weapon will have his house destroyed on 
his head the flier said and if the authorities confirm shooting 
from any house the area 360 degrees around it will be leveled 
the defense department official said the past week saw a marked 
jump in executions housetohouse searches with the entire 
neighborhood sealed off and a higher level of overall harassment 
the situation is misery said massoud a 38yearold 
refugee like most of those arriving here he appeared somewhat 
relieved that he would no longer have to run a daily gauntlet of 
iraqi soldiers but he was confused and depressed about whether he 
made the right decision to flee his country and abandon it to the 
iraqis 
when they invaded they said they came to protect us the 
defense department official said now their mood has changed and 
they are trying to kill the kuwaiti people 
many refugees spoke of executions over the past week none could 
be independently confirmed but the details of the stories were 
similar 
farouk mohammadi 45 said he fled after the corpses of two 
cousins and a friend were returned to their houses two weeks after 
they were hauled away accused of taking part in the resistance 
the crackdown was pushing people to flee because they were 
terrorized about stepping outside but going crazy from inactivity 
indoors 
every kuwaiti is swimming in a sea of horror he said

vice president dan quayle said tuesday public 
schools must dismantle a berlin wall of rules that allow them 
to operate like a communist staterun monopoly 
educators should take a lesson from the failure of socialized 
economies in eastern europe and the soviet union quayle said 
he called for wider efforts to give parents choice in public 
education and vouchers to allow them to choose between public and 
private schools 
he had in mind vouchers paid for by state and local governments 
not washington 
addressing a hudson institute forum at the national press club 
the vice president said the people of eastern europe are 
throwing out these governmentcontrolled systems and the people 
of the soviet union hopefully are not far behind it is now time 
to apply this lesson to our own education system 
unfortunately the education establishment has succeeded in 
putting our school system behind a berlin wall of rules and 
regulations that stifle ingenuity and limit competition he 
charged 
parents are denied free choice in selecting their childrens 
school he said schools lack the freedom to hire the most talented 
staff and teachers cannot choose the best curriculum 
our schools are robbed of the benefits of flexibility and 
competition that are enjoyed in virtually every other sector of 
our society he said 
the american economy flourishes because it operates in a free 
market our school system is declining because it is a centrally 
planned monopoly said quayle who sends his three children to 
private schools they attended fairfax county va public schools 
when their father was a senator 
quayle praised minnesotas public school choice program and a 
statebacked experiment in milwaukee giving up to 1000 poor 
children a chance to choose any public school or a 2500 voucher 
toward tuition at a private school 
quayle met earlier with polly williams a democratic state 
representative from milwaukee spearheading that effort to promote 
choice 
he said he will campaign in oregon next week for a initiative on 
the november ballot giving oregonians a similar choice among 
schools 
lets give the education establishment and the politicians a 
little wakeup call said quayle 
public schools now enroll more than 88 percent of the nations 
46 million schoolchildren private schools just under 12 percent 
according to government figures

east germanys former secret police chief 
arranged contacts between palestinian terrorists and west germanys 
notorious red army faction terror gang in the late 1980s west 
german prosecutors said tuesday 
the legacy of the hated secret police or stasi has become the 
no 1 political theme in east germany and is increasingly spilling 
over into west germany 
in bonn there was a political stalemate over amnesty for the 
stasis spy corps that raised the specter of a wave of arrests on 
german unification day oct 3 
since the fall of east german leader erich honecker there have 
been nearly continuous disclosures about his communist governments 
alleged support for terrorism the latest such disclosure concerns 
imprisoned former secret police chief erich mielke 82 and his 
former deputy gerhard neiber 
both are suspected of having harbored members of west germanys 
leftist terrorist red army faction west germanys topranking 
prosecutor alexander von stahl said tuesday he said a criminal 
investigation was under way 
east german police working with their west german colleagues 
rounded up nine red army faction terrorist suspects in june they 
had been living in east germany under assumed names 
the red army faction has waged a deadly campaign against west 
german businesses military facilties and other targets 
in 1987 and 1988 the stasi helped put red army faction members 
in touch with the palestine liberation organization the chief 
prosecutor said 
there were no further details of the alleged ties to the 
palestinians although such links have long been suspected the 
former communist government once trained small cadres of 
palestinians at a military school along east germanys northern 
coast 
the prosecutors also accused mielke and neiber of being 
responsible for harboring a rightist terrorist from west germany 
the suspect whose name was not disclosed had fled to east 
germany he was later convicted of attempted murder 
proof of the allegations is contained in nearly 200 pages of 
documents seized from the former secret police von stahl said in a 
statement a spokesman hansjuergen foerster said its still 
too early to tell when or whether mielke or neiber will be 
brought to trial 
von stahl in a television interview monday night also said he 
believed east german secret police were involved in the bombing of 
west berlins la belle discotheque in april 1986 
that bombing led to the us air raids on the libyan cities of 
tripoli and benghazi 10 days later after washington blamed libya 
for the attack the la belle attack killed two us soldiers and a 
turkish woman 
the disco was a popular spot for american servicemen in west 
berlin 
in west berlin justice department spokesman cornel christoffel 
said the stasi had an inside agent who provided the east german 
secret police with information before the attack however he said 
he could not confirm that the stasi played an active role in the la 
belle bombing 
honecker himself is the target of several criminal 
investigations including one in west germany for obstruction of 
justice the obstruction of justice allegations against the 
78yearold honecker stem from support for fugitive west german 
leftist terrorists 
in east germany the embattled interior minister predicted a new 
round of disclosures of alleged secret police ties this time 
targeting himself and prime minister lothar de maiziere 
interior minister petermichael diestel said such reports would 
be defamatory diestel has already denied rumors he once held 
the rank of major in the stasi 
several hundred people took to the streets in the east german 
cities of dresden and schwerin to demand access to the files of the 
disbanded stasi 
in the city of chemnitz the local leader of the german social 
union was kicked out of the party officials said they had proof 
that the leader helmutjoachim nestler had been a stasi 
collaborator from 1975 to 1985

the state department said tuesday it expects 
jordan will end its continuing purchases of iraqi oil and also 
blasted that country for hosting a conference that featured the 
arab worlds most radical antiamerican elements 
according to official estimates jordan formerly imported 90 per 
cent of its oil requirements from iraq but has reduced that figure 
to 40 per cent since the united nations economic embargo against 
iraq went into effect six weeks ago 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration understands jordans unique dependence on iraq the 
administration is hopeful she added that with the help of 
assistance from donor countries jordan soon will be in full 
compliance with the us goal of a total trade embargo against 
iraq 
ms tutwiler was far more critical of jordans decision to host 
a threeday conference of arab radicals and guerrillas the 
delegates warned that their objective is to strike against the 
american interests everywhere and by all means at the same moment 
an american military attack is launched against iraq 
ms tutwiler said the united states was surprised and dismayed 
that this conference took place and we have told the jordanians so 
we want to work with jordan during and after this crisis in the 
persian gulf hosting this conference is very hard for us to 
understand 
king hussein did not attend the conference but his reluctance to 
take a strong stand against the iraqi takeover of kuwait has 
strained what had been a close relationship with washington dating 
back many years 
the 3000 delegates attending the meeting also called for the 
overthrow of egyptian president hosni mubarak and said they will 
initiate guerrilla actions against the united states and other 
countries that have sent troops to saudi arabia 
the sentiments expressed at the meeting ms tutwiler said 
were not surprising given the guest list which included 
representatives of the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine and the popular front for the liberation of palestine 
we are appalled by the statements that were made at that 
conference such language is not only inflammatory but it can have 
the result of inciting the kind of violence which it threatens 
ms tutwiler said 
the rhetoric she added ignores the overriding threat to the 
region which is iraqs unbridled ambition evidenced by its 
invasion and occupation of neighboring kuwait

the manufacturer of evenflo child safety seats 
said tuesday it was recalling the buckle assembly on some models 
because it does not meet government safety standards 
consumers can telephone or write for a free repair kit the 
company said in a statement 
the problem with these seats is that at times the buckle can 
look buckled and feel buckled even when it is not completely 
latched said jerry curry administrator of the national highway 
traffic safety administration 
this can give users a false sense of security that the child 
is protected curry said however if the buckle is not 
completely latched it can release during a crash and substantially 
reduce the protection provided to the child 
the recall involves more than 3 million child safety seats 
manufactured between april 15 1985 and april 22 1990 each seat 
has a black buckle housing and a red pushbutton release 
people who own the seats should not return them to the retailer 
evenflo said they should request a repair kit which includes a 
replacement buckle assembly that is easily installed 
consumers should continue using the seat until the replacement 
arrives but should make certain the buckle is engaged by pulling 
down firmly on the crotch strap the company said 
the recall involves infantonly car seats with the model numbers 
441 442 443 444 445 446 448 456 458 201 and 202

un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar on tuesday warned that iraqs invasion of kuwait could lead 
to the next world war unless a diplomatic settlement is found 
i am old but i have witnessed wars global war global 
global global war said the 70yearold un chief 
and that is the tremendous threat that we are facing now 
because injustice was done against a small country to one which 
was one of the most faithful and loyal countries among our ranks 
he said referring to kuwait overrun aug 2 by its neighbor iraq 
in making the remarks the un chief departed from the text of 
a prepared speech to a luncheon of the un correspondents 
association 
perez de cuellars pessimistic comments follow his effort at 
personal mediation in the persian gulf crisis he traveled to 
jordan last month to meet with iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz 
but the meeting brought no breakthroughs and perez de cuellar 
expressed disappointment afterward 
earlier tuesday the secretarygeneral warned that the middle 
east remains the most explosive region of the world today 
but in his annual report perez de cuellar pointed with pride to 
the un security councils historic response to the iraqi 
invasion 
in a series of resolutions the council condemned the invasion 
rejected iraqs claim to have annexed kuwait demanded the release 
of all detained foreigners imposed an economic embargo on iraq and 
occupied kuwait and allowed the use of naval force to back up the 
embargo 
the security council is now considering tightening the embargo 
with a resolution calling for sanctions against any countries 
violating it and imposing an embargo on iraqs air traffic 
perez de cuellar said middle east conflicts including the gulf 
crisis could be resolved by adhering to some common principles 
in the long run lasting peace will come to the middle east 
only when the principles of international law govern the relations 
between states when the aspirations of those deprived of their 
rights have been fulfilled and regional security and economic 
arrangements which take into account the concerns of all the 
parties in the area have been established he said

the fight over president bushs proposed 
capitalgains tax cut which is stalling critical deficitreduction 
talks extends a decadelong battle pitting democratic charges of a 
tilt to the rich against a republican focus on a need to spur 
economic growth 
it is absolutely incredible that the key item in dispute 
is the presidents insistence on giving a new gift to the higher 
rollers in this society rep david obey dwis told reporters 
tuesday 
however sen pete domenici rnm said the democrats 
argument against cutting taxes on capital gains which are profits 
from the sale of investments was simply wrong 
lets dispel any notion that the republican capitalgains tax 
reduction is to help the rich he said were supposed to get 
growth out of this budget 
as democrats accused bush and his party of risking a deficit 
agreement to win on capital gains the president sent his top 
negotiators to the capitol to discuss the next step in trying to 
avoid massive arbitrary cuts in most federal programs starting 
oct 1 
white house and congressional negotiators working on a plan to 
cut the deficit by 50 billion next year hit an impasse monday 
night after reaching tentative agreement on several spending cuts 
and tax increases 
they met for an hour in the capitol tuesday and agreed to 
continue working toward a compromise 
if the capitalgains issue could be settled said senate 
majority leader george j mitchell dmaine the rest would come 
together quickly 
domenici said there are a number of hangups 
he noted republicans have proposed to offset part of the 
capitalgains reduction by limiting the state and local income tax 
deductions available to people with incomes over 200000 when the 
two items are combined he said i dont see how thats helping 
the rich 
still rep charles schumer dny declared that a 
capitalgains cut is an ideological obsession of the right wing 
of the republican party and unfortunately the president has yielded 
to it 
economic growth has been bushs argument for the reduction since 
he proposed it during his 1988 campaign some economists agree that 
reducing the tax would give people with money incentives for making 
new investments that could create jobs others say there is no 
evidence for such a claim 
but the question of cutting the tax has been fought on another 
point democratic leaders cite estimates that nearly 80 percent of 
the benefit would go to those with incomes over 100000 a year 
democrats note that higherincome people benefited greatly from 
major tax laws enacted in 1981 and 1986 the 70 percent top tax 
rate on their investment income was slashed to 28 percent as was 
the 50 percent top rate on their wages 
the latest gop proposal would cut the maximum capitalgains rate 
to 15 percent 
a study by the laborfinanced citizens for tax justice provided 
opponents this argument against a capitalgains reduction the 
492000 richest 1 percent of families with incomes averaging 
737000 would reap a tax cut averaging nearly 20000 a year the 
40 million families with incomes under 61000 would see a tax cut 
averaging 30 
bush and other backers of the reduction bristle at such 
arguments i am sick and tired of the demagogues who call this a 
tax cut for the rich bush said earlier this year it means 
jobs it means savings and it is good for all americans 
republicans note that millions of lessthanwealthy americans 
are likely to receive a capital gain at some time in their lives 
they say the statistics do not tell the whole story since a 
50000ayear family that received a onetime 60000 gain from 
selling a family business would be listed in that year as among the 
over100000ayear group 
capital gains enjoyed preferential tax treatment until the tax 
code was thoroughly rewritten in 1986 as a price for cutting 
individual incometax rates across the board congress and 
thenpresident reagan agreed to take away or reduce numerous 
special benefits ranging from the deduction for state and local 
sales taxes to the capitalgains preference 
in its explanation of the new law congress concluded that the 
lower overall rates eliminated the need for a special lower rate on 
capital gains in addition the report stated treating capital 
gains like other income will result in a tremendous amount of 
simplification for many taxpayers 
restoring a special capitalgains rate democrats say would 
mean reneging on the 1986 bargain that special provisions should be 
given up in favor of lower rates

methadone programs could be more effective in 
helping stop the spread of aids if patients were given doses large 
enough to wean them from their heroin habit addiction treatment 
experts told lawmakers tuesday 
experts also testified that needleexchange and outreach 
programs are effective ways to reduce behavior that puts 
intravenous drug users at high risk of becoming infected with the 
aids virus 
however more than 80 percent of the estimated 15 million iv 
drug users are not being reached with treatment programs they 
said 
rep ted weiss dny and chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on human resources estimated that more 
than 2 million people iv drug users and their sexual partners 
are at high risk of getting aids because they share needles and 
have sex without protective condoms 
these users and their partners have fallen through the 
cracks he said their addiction is not being treated and they 
are not being protected from hiv infection 
according to a report by the congressional office of technology 
assessment released at the hearing methadone programs differ 
widely including doses of the synthetic narcotic given to wean 
heroin users from their addiction 
an average daily dosage of 80 milligrams of methadone is 
considered sufficient to wean most users from their heroin habit 
the lowest effective dose is believed to be around 60 milligrams 
the report said 
however a recent survey of 24 methadone programs found the 
average daily dosages ranged from 21 to 67 milligrams the report 
said twentyone of them gave an average daily dose of less than 60 
milligrams 
the reluctance to use higher dosages of methadone is rooted in 
the belief that the narcoticfree state is optimal and that 
methadone is a medicallysupervised narcotic addiction said 
diana hartel an assistant professor at albert einstein college of 
medicine in new york 
most addicts on lowdose methadone treatment will relapse into 
drug use repeatedly putting them at high risk for aids again she 
said 
the human immunodeficiency virus called hiv is spreading rapidly 
among intravenousdrug users who often share the needles they use 
to inject drugs they in turn transmit the infection to their 
sexual partners and the women transmit it to their babies 
methadone is not a treatment for cocaine and other nonopiate 
drug abuse nor is it effective for all heroin users 
but the ota report concludes that even if treatment for drug 
abuse is not 100 percent effective it may markedly decrease drug 
use for extended periods and therefore decrease the probability of 
hiv transmission 
it should be emphasized that when these interventions are 
applied on a very large scale to hundreds of thousands of people 
the public health impact of an intervention with even limited 
effectiveness can be substantial 
the report also said the need to prevent the further spread of 
aids increases the pressure for reexamination and scientific 
evaluation of public policies with regard to the availability of 
syringes and needles 
holly hagan an epidemiologist at the tacomapierce county 
health department told the lawmakers that since the tacoma wash 
needleexchange program began in august 1988 the number of drug 
users in the area has not increased as some critics feared 
also the program has led iv drug users to cut down their use of 
shared needles and to increase their use of bleach to sterilize 
syringes she said

european nations their anger at saddam hussein fueled by raids 
on their diplomatic compounds in kuwait demanded tuesday that the 
un trade embargo on iraq be extended to the air as well as the 
sea 
the decision reflected the growing resolve among european 
leaders to punish baghdad it came a day after the european 
community voted to expel iraqi diplomats and restrict the movements 
of others 
at the united nations officials said the five permanent members 
of the security council had worked out an agreement on terms of an 
air embargo and were hoping to get it passed by the full 15 
membercouncil before monday 
under the embargo officials said planes on their way to iraq 
would not be forced down but could be challenged 
the five permanent members are the united states the soviet 
union china britain and france 
in other developments tuesday us government economic figures 
for the month of august gave an idea of how the gulf crisis is 
taking its toll at home soaring energy prices 
the flow of kuwaiti refugees across the newly opened saudi 
border thinned abruptly as news spread that iraqi troops were 
seizing young husbands and sons from families as they tried to 
leave 
refugees said the erratic manner in which the iraqis were 
treating them appeared part of a harsh campaign to break down their 
will to resist 
international pressure on saddam hussein was increasing with 
countries implementing diplomatic sanctions and alliances slowly 
shifting in the middle east 
syria and iran announced that president hafez assad would visit 
tehran next week assad was expected to try to persuade his iranian 
allies to join the west and other arab nations against saddam 
moscow and washington have been trying to sway iran from a possible 
alliance with iraq 
assad met last week with secretary of state james a baker iii 
in the first major facetoface contact between damascus and 
washington since president bush was elected in 1988 
saudi arabia meanwhile emphasized that its renewal of ties 
with moscow another former ally of baghdad should send a clear 
sign to saddam 
when these two countries stand together for the withdrawal of 
iraqi troops from kuwait and identify their position in a 
common way this i believe should give a message to iraq that 
their position is untenable the saudi foreign minister said 
saudi arabia has been the staging ground for some 150000 us 
troops that have been deployed since the aug 2 iraqi takeover of 
kuwait 
jordan has tended to side with iraq its most important trading 
partner and on tuesday it received some harsh criticism from the 
state department for acting as host to a radical palestinian 
guerrilla conference where delegates have called for attacks on 
us forces 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the united states is 
surprised and dismayed that this conference took place and we 
have told the jordanians so 
she also said the united states expects jordan will end its 
continuing purchases of iraqi oil 
one of saddams few key supporters plo chief yasser arafat 
arrived in jordan tuesday following talks with saddam in baghdad 
he met immediately with king hussein in a continuing effort to come 
up with a solution to the crisis officials said it was his third 
visit to jordan in less than four weeks 
the first japanese presence appeared in the gulf tuesday a 
17member japanese medical team sent to saudi arabia 
in paris defense and foreign ministers of nine european nations 
the western european union decided to take steps as soon as 
possible to enforce the un embargo by air as well as by sea a 
statement said and to coordinate air and ground forces 
the union is the sole european body dealing with defense issues 
its members include nine of the 12 european community nations only 
neutral ireland greece and denmark are not members 
france and britain both of whom have now sent ground forces to 
the gulf want their allies in the union to join them at least 
symbolically italian and dutch newspapers speculated tuesday their 
governments might sent ground troops a number of nations have sent 
ships and planes 
on monday ec countries decided in brussels to expel iraqi 
military attaches and restrict movements of iraqi diplomats on 
tuesday britain told the 41 iraqi diplomats still in the country 
they cannot go more than 25 miles from central london without 
permission portugal restricted iraqi diplomats to within 19 miles 
of central lisbon 
the toll of the nearly 7weekold crisis hit home tuesday with 
the release in washington of economic figures for august the 
government said the iraqi invasion sent gasoline prices up by 76 
percent and fuel prices jumped 154 percent the steepest rise in 
those categories since january 
the soaring energy prices pushed the cost of living up by 08 
percent the government said 
also the gain in the labor departments consumer price index 
was twice the 04 percent rise in july and the largest since 
january the department attributed nearly half that increase to the 
gulf crisis 
the trend will continue economists predicted they said crude 
oil prices have continued to rise in september and will be felt at 
the gas pump 
at the border between kuwait and saudi arabia hundreds of cars 
were still lined up with fleeing kuwaitis tuesday but their 
numbers were greatly decreased as news spread the iraqis were 
seizing young men 
since iraq unexpectedly opened the border saturday about 6000 
refugees have entered saudi arabia men under the age of 40 were 
grabbed as cars were picked to leave the country in a haphazard 
manner the refugees said iraqi troops began seizing the men 
monday and sending the north in buses 
some kuwaitis said the men would be forced into the military 
others said they would be interned in iraq the iraqis gave no 
explanation 
a man who said he was 55 years old related how four men in their 
20s were taken at gunpoint from his car as he approached the 
frontier he said he had not heard of the seizures the day before 
otherwise he would not have brought the young men 
i didnt get the news he repeated staring at the ground 
he would not give his name 
in kuwait the refugees said police and military officers as 
well as any westerners still left were the targets of manhunts 
they said the new iraqiappointed governor of kuwait ali hussein 
abdelmajid had previously been in charge of eradicating kurdish 
resistance in northern iraq 
iraq was widely condemned for using outlawed chemical weapons in 
the crackdown on the rebellious kurds in 1988

rep marge roukema went to bat for the 
salvation army tuesday askin the labor department to drop its 
plan to require the charity to pay a minimum wage to its 
clientworkers 
roukema rnj asked labor secretary elizabeth dole to grant 
the organization an exemption from enforcement of minimum wage laws 
at scores of centers around the country 
the people served in the salvation armys work therapy 
programs are not employees they are participants in 
rehabilitation roukema wrote in a letter to dole 
acting on a complaint from a former salvation army client the 
us department of labor on sept 7 ordered the organizationk 
based in verona nj to pay its workers a minimum wage 
the department said other rehabilitation organizations 
including goodwill industries inc meet minimum wage standards 
established under the fair labor standards act 
last friday the salvation army officials advised the department 
that it would contest the order 
the nonsectarian christian group provides room board and a 
stipend to downandout clients who are expected to assist in the 
organizations kitchens or unload discarded furniture and clothing 
the army collects 
while the labor department views the clients as exploited 
workers salvation army attorney william j moss described them as 
beneficiaries who work at the centers for rehabilitation 
roukema repeated the armys claim that payment of a wage could 
doom its social service centers which are kept financially afloat 
by a network of thrift shops across the country 
there are no winners in this scenario she wrote in the 
end the salvation army will suffer the budgets of the cities and 
states will suffer and most importantly those who will be denied 
help will suffer

the government said tuesday it 
will charge winnie mandela with kidnapping and assault a move that 
could endanger its peace talks with her husbands african national 
congress 
mrs mandela wife of anc leader nelson mandela will be charged 
in the alleged abduction and beatings of four young men at her home 
in december 1988 one of them 14yearold stompei seipei was 
found dead 
mrs mandelas bodyguard jerry richardson was convicted of 
murdering seipei and sentenced to death last month at his trial 
the surviving victims testified that mrs mandela 56 beat them 
with a whip she has denied wrongdoing 
the announcement came as mandela the countrys bestknown black 
leader met with other anc officials to discuss the police 
crackdown on black factional fighting in townships around 
johannesburg 
mandela on monday threatened to suspend the peace talks if the 
government fails to halt the carnage that has killed nearly 800 
blacks since aug 12 most of the fighting has been between xhosa 
and other black anc supporters and the zulubased conservative 
inkatha movement 
he said new police measures announced saturday including 
reinforcements roadblocks weapons searches and mounted machine 
guns on police vehicles would be ineffective and were a 
license to kill for security forces 
mandela has staunchly defended his wife and might be encouraged 
by supporters to break off talks if the government proceeds with 
the prosecution 
president fw de klerk and mandela met twice last week and both 
say they want blackwhite talks on ending apartheid to move forward 
as quickly as possible but the township battles combined with the 
charges against mrs mandela make setbacks appear more likely than 
breakthroughs 
klaus von lieres und wilkau attorney general for the 
johannesburg supreme court had said he would await completion of 
the richardson case before deciding whether to charge mrs mandela 
after careful consideration of all the relevant facts 
including possible implications beyond the normal legal ones i 
have decided to prosecute mrs mandela he said in a statement 
there was no immediate comment from mrs mandela or her husband 
they have accused the government of using the case as a 
propaganda campaign against them and the anc the largest black 
opposition group they have said they would welcome a chance for 
mrs mandela to defend herself 
she has denied any wrongdoing but has never given a full account 
of the episode 
an anc statement refrained from criticizing the government and 
urged the news media to let the courts decide the case 
mrs mandela will stand trial with seven members of her former 
bodyguard unit whoalready have been charged the attorney general 
said she will face four counts of kidnapping and four of assault 
with intent to commit grievous bodily harm 
she is expected to be formally charged sept 24 when the former 
bodyguards are scheduled to appear in the regional court in soweto 
outside johannesburg 
her former bodyguards about two dozen teenagers known as the 
mandela united football club were repeatedly in confrontations 
with police journalists and black groups in the township 
antiapartheid groups accused them of waging a reign of terror 
according to court testimony four black youths were kidnapped 
in december 1988 from a church in soweto and taken to mrs 
mandelas home in the township where they were assaulted 
mrs mandelas bodyguards accused seipei of being a police 
informer and the three men of having homosexual relations with the 
white minister who ran the church home according to the testimony 
the methodist church cleared the minister of any misdeeds there 
was no evidence presented that seipei a wellknown antiapartheid 
activist despite his young age was a police spy 
during her husbands 27 years in prison mrs mandela spent more 
than a year in solitary confinement without being charged and was 
under government restrictions including house arrest for more 
than 20 years 
the decision to prosecute mrs mandela followed by a day the 
governments arrest of rightwing extremist piet rudolph who has 
claimed responsibility for bombing two offices of de klerks 
governing national party rudolph also is suspected of a weapons 
theft at an air force base 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said rudolphs arrest showed 
that police regarded crime as crime from either side of the 
political spectrum 
the independent south african press association reported that 
eugene terreblanche leader of the extreme rightwing afrikaner 
resistance movement said it was unfair rudolph was arrested while 
mrs mandela remained free

over the last two weeks iraqi troop strength 
in and near kuwait has risen to 360000 while some tanks and 
artillery have been pulled back from the front lines near saudi 
arabia the pentagon said tuesday 
the pentagons last estimate two weeks ago was that there were 
265000 iraqi troops and 2200 tanks in kuwait and in nearby 
sections of iraq 
spokesman pete williams said there are now 360000 iraqi troops 
in those areas together with 280 tanks 1800 armored vehicles 
and 1450 artillery pieces although the number of tanks increased 
overall there are fewer near the saudi arabian border 
in another development williams said that a team from the 
guided missile cruiser uss biddle stopped and boarded a soviet 
cargo ship the pyotyr masherov on monday as part of the effort 
to block trade with iraq 
he described the boarding in the waters of the northern red sea 
as routine and said it was conducted with the permission of the 
master of the soviet vessel 
the soviet ship was permitted to proceed and it entered the 
jordanian port of aqaba williams said 
he said it was the first boarding of a soviet vessel in the 
blockade but that there was no protest from the soviet government 
in discussing the iraqi troop buildup williams said the overall 
combat status of the forces remains about the same with the only 
major difference being an increase in infantry 
williams said there is no indication iraq has assumed a more 
offensive military posture 
the overall posture continues to be defensive he said 
but he said iraq retains the ability to shift to go on the 
offensive at short notice by launching an attack on oilrich saudi 
arabia 
williams noted that the total number of iraqi soldiers increased 
as infantry replaced armored units in regions close to the border 
of saudi arabia 
since the united states began using naval vessels to enforce the 
united nations trade embargo against iraq there have been more 
than 1030 interceptions williams said he noted that some vessels 
likely were intercepted more than once 
seventy ships were boarded he said of which five were diverted 
by us and allied vessels 
the five ships were of five separate nationalities flying the 
flags of iraq cypress the bahamas sri lanka and liberia 
williams said

nasa engineers baffled by 
columbias persistent fuel leaks pored over data tuesday from the 
shuttles fourth failed launch attempt and pushed ahead for next 
months flight of discovery 
columbias commander vance brand said before leaving for johnson 
space center in houston that he and his sixman crew were 
disappointed the shuttle did not lift off early tuesday as planned 
the next launch attempt for the astronomy mission will be no 
earlier than november 
most of us have been involved in the space flight business for 
some time and we know from experience that hardware problems can 
be difficult and it does not pay to fly until the spacecraft is 
ready brand said 
the astronomy mission is very worthwhile and the crew is 
ready and anxious to fly as soon as the remaining hydrogen leaks 
are repaired 
nasas fourth attempt to launch columbia with a 150 million 
astronomical observatory ended abruptly monday evening about seven 
hours before planned liftoff despite repairs hydrogen flooded the 
engine compartment as the shuttle was being fueled 
it was the third time since may that columbias countdown was 
halted because of leaking hydrogen 
were really at a loss on this particular problem said 
david winterhalter director of systems engineering and analysis 
for the national aeronautics and space administration 
engineers are a resourceful group were digging in thinking 
more about it what is it we can do we havent done 
nasa was forming an investigative team tuesday to look into the 
matter 
henry pohl director of engineering at johnson space center 
said hydrogen appears to be escaping from a pinsize hole or 
several tinier cracks inside columbias crowded engine compartment 
he said the leaks are difficult to trace because they appear only 
when the liquid hydrogen is at its coldest minus 423 degrees 
fahrenheit 
officials believe the leaks are linked to the dismantling of 
columbia after its last flight in january workers took apart the 
engine compartment in a search for contamination by a 
metalpolishing abrasive 
i think we created a problem in that process pohl said 
someplace we didnt get a seal back on right or something 
insulation probably will have to be removed in the engine 
compartment a timeconsuming job pohl said workers are not 
expected to gain access to the area until wednesday 
pohl said hes not worried discovery might have hydrogen leaks 
similar to those plaguing columbia and atlantis 
discovery is scheduled to lift off around oct 8 with a 
plutoniumpowered satellite that will explore the suns poles 
if discovery does not lift off with the ulysses satellite by 
oct 23 the 750 million mission will have to wait until late 1991 
when earth the sun and jupiter are back in the proper alignment 
nasa has not decided whether to conduct a tanking test on 
discovery before launch because it takes about five days 
discovery experienced no problems during its flight in april 
with the hubble space telescope which later was found to have a 
flawed mirror that was the last time a shuttle has flown 
john pike director of the federation of american scientists 
space policy project said the fact nasa has launched shuttles 35 
times proves they can make it work in general 
the problem is making it work in particular right now pike 
said the bottom line is its more bad news when they really 
could use some good news

plo chairman yasser arafat on tuesday 
briefed jordans king hussein on talks he had held a day earlier 
with iraqs president saddam hussein a senior plo official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity the official said the two 
discussed developments in the persian gulf crisis set off by iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait it was the third meeting in a month 
between the jordanian monarch and arafat chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization 
meanwhile george habash the leader of the marxist popular 
front for the liberation of palestine and nayef hawatmeh leader 
of the democratic front for the liberation of palestine received 
thunderous applause when they made public appearances in jordan for 
the first time in two decades 
the two along with arafat were banned from jordan after the 
1970 black september battles against king husseins army 
arafat patched up his differences with the king and made his 
first return trip to jordan in 1984 the other two only recently 
gained a royal pardon 
habash told reporters he had the impression that jordan and the 
plo share the same political ground support for an arab 
settlement of the gulf crisis jordan has a large palestinian 
population 
we are facing a common danger he told reporters 
habash declared that the solution to the gulf crisis must be 
linked to an end to israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip saddam also has demanded that the discussions on kuwait be 
linked to resolving the palestinian problem 
the united states and its allies have rejected that position 
after his flight from jordan habash established the pflp 
headquarters in the syrian capital damascus this led to a cooling 
of his groups relations with iraq because of the long feud between 
president hafez assad of syria and saddam 
palestinian rejection of the us military presence and the new 
cooperation between washington and some arab states including 
syria appears to be altering alignments 
habash denied that he had been banned from returning to 
damascus 
he said the pflp will open an office in baghdad but denied that 
it would be the groups new headquarters 
he said there were no plans to open an amman office despite the 
rapprochement with king hussein palestinian sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said jordanian security was wary of 
allowing pflp radicals to freely travel in jordan

women with an abnormal immune condition related 
to the thyroid may be twice as likely to suffer miscarriages early 
in pregnancy a study has found 
but an independent researcher and authors of the report 
published in wednesdays journal of the american medical 
association cautioned that the finding needs further study 
this is the first time anything like this has been found 
said one of the studys authors dr alex stagnarogreen of the 
endocrinology division of mount sinai school of medicine in new 
york before women need to start worrying about this this study 
will have to be replicated 
the report is the first to link miscarriages with the presence 
of two thyroid autoantibodies thyroglobulin and 
thyroidperoxidase an autoantibody is a type of antibody but 
instead of aiding the body in fighting off disease it works 
against it stagnarogreen said 
its unclear what causes the two thyroid autoantibodies but 
researchers know they are related to a disfunction in the way the 
immune system typically works he said 
stagnarogreen said the study is an important finding in that 
its another instance in which immunological factors have been 
linked to miscarriages 
women who test positive for either thyroglobulin and 
thyroidperoxidase dont suffer from common hormonal disorders such 
as an overactive or underactive thyroid stagnarogreen said 
it really has nothing to do with the hormonal balance he 
said the only way to tell whether these autoantibodies are 
present is through a blood test 
in the study researchers at mount sinai screened 552 women from 
seven obstetric practices in new york during their first trimester 
and found that 108 or 196 percent tested positive for thyroid 
autoantibodies the rest tested negative 
researchers then collected information on whether the women 
carried the pregnancy to full term of the 492 women available for 
followup 102 percent suffered a miscarriage 
the report said that 84 percent who tested negative for the 
autoantibodies miscarried seventeen percent or twice the rate 
miscarried among women who had tested positive for the 
autoantibodies the report said 
stagnarogreen said further studies would have to verify his 
results and to determine a causeandeffect 
a doctor not associated with the study agreed 
the results of this study are certainly interesting but also 
need to be looked at with caution said dr elliot main an 
assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology who runs a 
reproductive immunology lab at the university of california san 
francisco 
main said the incidence of women who tested positive for the 
autoantibodies nearly 20 percent was high 
one should always be suspicious when that large a share of a 
group that is otherwise normal reflects an abnormality he said 
they could suggest some false positives 
main also said a study needs to address the question of whether 
the process of miscarrying somehow leads to the development of 
autoantibodies rather than the other way around

defense secretary dick cheney consulted with 
the white house on tuesday about his selection of a vietnam veteran 
and former thunderbird pilot to replace the general he fired as air 
force chief of staff 
cheneys spokesman pete williams said the secretary had 
discussed with white house officials his selection of gen merrill 
a mcpeak to replace gen mike dugan fired monday after revealing 
to reporters secret us plans that contemplate bombing iraq and 
personally targeting prsident saddam hussein 
williams declined to say how soon president bush is expected to 
act on cheneys recommendation 
white house sources said however that the pentagon had not yet 
sent over the paperwork to set in motion the presidential review 
process the sources who requested anonymity said that after the 
paper arrives it will take some time for officials there to review 
the matter before bush decides whether to nominate mcpeak 
at the pentagon meanwhile cheney sought to reassure his 
subordinates that they have nothing to fear from talking to 
reporters 
it would be a thorough misreading and a total misunderstanding 
if anyone were to conclude that were trying to discourage people 
from talking to the press williams said 
the spokesman said he had said as much to commanders and other 
pentagon officials 
we encourage our military commanders to be open and 
accessible he said 
in contrast to his predecessors dugan had encouraged more 
openness with the press to a point that got him in trouble after 
he told three reporters aboard a plane to saudi arabia late last 
week that the united states has contingency plans to bomb baghdad 
and target saddam 
explaining his decision to dump dugan cheney said monday that 
the chief of staff had displayed a lack of judgment by engaging 
publicly in wideranging speculation about us military 
options in iraq 
dugan will receive a full pension which for an officer with his 
rank and seniority totals about 60000 annually officials said 
mcpeak 54 is commander in chief of the pacific air forces at 
hickam air force base in hawaii his responsibility includes us 
air operations from japan to the united states and a command of 
more than 60000 people 
in his 33 years of service mcpeak has flown over 4000 hours on 
fighter planes and became a skilled parachutist 
for two years starting in 1966 he flew solo or the lead position 
in nearly 200 air shows as a member of the thunderbirds the us 
air force air demonstration squadron 
the stunt flying was good preparation for his next mission 
vietnam 
mcpeak flew 269 combat sorties in the year he served there 
earning several decorations 
he then attended the national war college and got a masters 
degree at the same time 
mcpeak was assigned to command us air bases in england and 
spain and was promoted to chief of staff of us air forces in 
europe 
he subsequently held several command positions at home assuming 
his current job in july 1988 he was made a full general at the 
same time 
a health and fitness buff mcpeak is married and has two sons

the antarctic ozone hole has been detected a 
month earlier this year than in the past due to improved methods 
of measuring the chemical federal officials said tuesday 
instruments aboard a polar orbiting satellite detected the 
beginning of an ozone hole on aug 22 and the region of depleted 
ozone has enlarged since then the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration announced 
the thin layer of ozone high in the earths atmosphere protects 
the planet from dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun 
manmade chemicals can damage that layer however and if it were 
thinned over populated regions scientists fear an increase of skin 
cancer and other damage to humans animals and plants 
the socalled hole actually a region of depleted ozone has 
been detected over antarctica during several recent winters there 
the seasons are reversed south of the equator 
in the past however instruments have been able to measure 
ozone only using visible light because antarctica has nearly six 
months of darkness in its winter detection of the ozone hole has 
been possible only after midseptember in past years 
now noaa reported satelliteborne instruments have been used 
to measure ozone using infrared radiation allowing the ozone hole 
to be detected during the darkness 
the ozone hole is generally worst in october which is 
springtime in that region during that period a band of winds 
called the polar vortex encircles the region preventing air there 
from mixing with the atmosphere in other parts of the world 
during the period temperatures drop to 125 degrees fahrenheit 
in the upper atmosphere creating a situation where 
chlorofluorocarbons can react with the ozone and deplete it later 
in the year temperatures warm somewhat the vortex breaks down and 
outside air mixes in restoring normal ozone levels 
noaa officials said that they have collected infrared 
measurements from the region for several years but only now have 
figured out how to use this data to calculate the ozone loss during 
the antarctic darkness 
that past data remains in storage and scientists hope that they 
can now use it to calculate dates and strength of the ozone hole 
for past years

computer ignorance at the agriculture 
department cost the public nearly 62 million when 7 million might 
have been sufficient to cover the job according to testimony 
tuesday before congress 
at issue is a project started in 1983 when the agriculture 
stabilization and conservation service contracted with the arthur 
andersen accounting firm to design two nationwide computer systems 
to monitor commodities inventories 
the firm wouldnt take the job unless the 7 million contract 
included a cost plus clause or one that provides an openended 
contract in case unforeseen expenses arise the firm said it needed 
that guarantee because of the vagueness of the services request 
most agencies by now have learned that cost plus is a ticket 
for automatic disaster said rep robert wise dwva whose 
house government operations subcommittee on agriculture is 
investigating the contract 
basically andersens job was to design a system for users who 
didnt know exactly what they wanted said jayetta hecker a 
director at the general accounting office which conducted a review 
of the computer system for wise 
she said andersen was not always required to correct defects at 
its own expense but did nothing illegal under the contract 
it was ineffective management and oversight along with 
poorly defined needs and inconsistent direction at the top levels 
of the agriculture service that caused costs to escalate she said 
in the last seven years six people have served as the deputy 
administrator for management hecker said this lack of 
continuity has contributed to decisions to start stop and restart 
the project which has resulted in additional costs 
rep glenn english dokla pointed out that administrators 
job at the stabilization and conservation service has been filled 
by political appointees whose credentials have not always included 
computer expertise 
basically weve had political hacks holding the job he 
said 
they didnt know enough about what they wanted and where they 
were going did they he asked hecker they were sheep to be 
shorn 
thats a pretty good characterization she said 
dr sarita schotta a computer expert who has been deputy 
administrator of the service for the last year tried to assure the 
congressional subcommittee that she was providing the kind of 
supervision the project should have had all along 
she said the computer system should be complete by next year 
she emphasized that the technological advances involved 3000 field 
offices 
part of the oversight problem came because the agency was so 
overwhelmed with getting software out in 300 counties she said 
the folks they were training already had 20 to 30 years in county 
office the last they thought theyd be doing was using 
computers 
the stabilization and conservation service is in charge of 
administering farm commodity conservation and emergency assistance 
programs including commodity loans and price support payments to 
farmers it handles billions of dollars each year 
in 1989 for example its program and administrative costs 
amounted to 13 billion by the end of the fiscal year its 
commodities inventories totaled nearly 4 billion 
its automated system for tracking acquisition storage 
movement sale and donation of grain and processed commodities had 
not been updated since the 1950s

a pledge of 300000 from the ohio gop 
that helped persuade robert taft ii to run for secretary of state 
rather than governor was a payoff a spokesman for democratic 
incumbent sherrod brown said tuesday 
bob taft became a candidate for secretary of state not because 
he thought the job was right but because the price was right 
said dale butland a spokesman for the brown campaign 
butland said a dayton daily news story about the state gops 
campaign pledge shows that taft was pressured out of the governors 
race by promises of campaign money 
the newspaper reported tuesday that taft abandoned his bid for 
governor 12 days after being offered the check by ohio republican 
party chairman robert bennett the check was voided after a feb 2 
meeting between bennett and taft which ended with taft publicly 
maintaining he would remain in the governors race 
but about four months after taft changed his mind he received 
300000 in contributions from the ohio republican party and the 
republican national committee 
brian berry executive director of the state party acknowledged 
that bennett had offered the check 
its no big surprise to anybody that the state party was ready 
to commit dollars no big surprise this is a phony issue berry 
said 
bennett told the daily news the 300000 check had been a prop 
for his meeting with taft designed to demonstrate the gops 
commitment to winning the secretary of states office the meeting 
was aimed at avoiding a costly divisive primary with ultimate gop 
gubernatorial nominee george voinovich 
taft told the daily news the partys commitment of money helped 
persuade him to leave the governors race 
certainly one factor in my decision was knowing what kind of 
support there would be from the state and national party he was 
quoted as saying

democratic gov cecil andrus on tuesday 
pledged to use the idahos budget surplus to slash local property 
taxes if he is reelected to a fourth term in november 
andrus said state budget analysts already were drafting the 
taxcut plan 
i believe we will have adequate revenue to target that tax 
relief to substantial reductions in local property taxes the 
governor said in a statement 
his underdog opponent former republican state sen roger 
fairchild said this summer that he would use the state surplus to 
underwrite a revenue sharing program for local governments that 
would include property tax relief 
based on revenue estimates from administration economists the 
state will have a onetime windfall of around 45 million 
the property tax is for most idahoans the most onerous tax 
the governor said it is time to return some of the budget 
surplus we have enjoyed to our citizens

congressional democrats filed a complaint 
tuesday accusing a group headed by house minority whip newt 
gingrich of violating federal election law 
the complaint was filed with the federal election commission by 
the democratic congressional campaign committee it said the 
gingrich group gopac has been working to influence federal 
elections but has not registered with the fec as required by law 
the complaint was based on a recent direct mail campaign in 
which gopac solicited contributions and urged people to sign a 
citizens veto to protest the congressional franking privilege 
letters used in the direct mail campaign stated that gopac hopes 
to raise 180000 to campaign for a republican majority in congress 
in 1992 by fighting the franking privilege and the practice of 
gerrymandering in congressional redistricting 
under federal election law any group that raises or spends more 
than 1000 to influence federal elections must register as a 
political committee with the fec 
gingrich a georgia republican is general chairman of gopac he 
said the dccc complaint is as phony and as inaccurate as 
everything else the dccc has said about me in the last two years

the 45th un general assembly the first 
of the postcold war era convened tuesday for a threemonth 
session the persian gulf crisis was expected to dominate the 
agenda 
the 159 nations welcomed their newest colleague in the 
international forum liechtenstein which became the 160th member 
when east and west germany unite in october and occupy a single 
seat the membership again will fall to 159 
guido de marco the foreign minister of malta was chosen by 
acclaim president of the general assembly a largely ceremonial 
post but one with influence on the agenda of more than 155 items 
the presidency rotates yearly among regional groupings 
de marco in his inaugural speech called the forthcoming 
unification of germany a sign of new optimism 
he called it a symbol of the new healing role of europe with 
its dismantling of barriers the freeing of peoples the 
reinstating of democratic institutions and the progressive 
abandonment of armaments 
but the president said iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait was a 
sign of the dangers ahead he called iraqs attack on its neighbor 
not only an outrageous and illegal action in itself but an 
action which also reflects the bitterness and turmoil the hatred 
and injustice that prevail in the middle east 
de marco told the assembly the world is indeed at a turning 
point in history the question is in which direction are we 
turning 
the security council he said has responded clearly and 
unequivocally in demanding the immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces 
and restoration of the government of kuwait 
we cannot shirk our responsibities he said adding that 
people around the world were looking to the assembly for moral and 
political guidance 
the general assembly cannot adopt legally binding resolutions 
but its statements carry weight as representing the will of the 
international community 
in addition to the persian gulf crisis he said the 
international community faces continuing unsolved conflicts such 
as the status of palestinians many living in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
the palestinian question has a dimension which goes far beyond 
the occupied territories he said it creates rancor 
soulsearching prejudices and unfortunately hatred 
he said convening an international conference on the middle east 
was a fundamental step to peace in the region the current un 
session he said must try to reach a comprehensive settlement of 
the palestinian question 
delay in solving the palestinian issue is a denial to the 
palestinian people of the country which is theirs and to israel of 
those secure and guaranteed frontiers to which it is entitled 
he also cited debt and development poverty terrorism 
narcotics the environment and the role of women as major issues 
confronting the forthcoming general assembly

polar explorer will steger entertained members 
of congress tuesday with tales of his dogsled trek across 
antarctica but his support for legislation to make the frozen 
continent a world park met with a cold response 
steger of ely minn was the star witness when the house 
interior subcommittee opened hearings on legislation sponsored by 
rep bruce vento dminn that would ban us mineral exploration 
and curtail other development damaging antarcticas environment 
internationally weve been dragging our feet when it comes to 
the antarctic issue steger told the panel theres an 
opportunity to take a leadership role for the environment 
steger coled a sixmember international transantarctica 
expedition which completed the longest unmechanized passage across 
the continent in march 
he described the teams battle with a 2monthlong storm when 
winds hit 35 to 50 mph and their fears that they wouldnt find a 
companion who became lost overnight shortly before the end of the 
3741mile trek 
its almost like crossing another planet steger said 
the united states should take the lead to ensure the continent 
stays as pristine as it is now even though it may contain valuable 
deposits of uranium and platinum he said 
in order to preserve this place it may be best that we leave 
it said rep jim oberstar dminn 
but officials with the departments of state and interior said 
other nations with interests in antarctica must cooperate before 
the united states could agree to banning mining and turning 
antarctica into a nature reserve 
however unlikely it may seem now it is possible to envision 
circumstances where shortages of critical mineral resources may 
force other nations to ignore a ban said william houston a 
deputy assistant secretary of interior 
negotiating an effective agreement to protect the antarctic 
environment under these circumstances would be very difficult 
the existing convention on the regulation of antarctic mineral 
resource activities prohibits mineral exploration on the continent 
unless there is a consensus that it would not hurt the environment 
houston said 
vento argued that cramra signed in 1988 was a step in the 
wrong direction in that it provided the basis for future mining 
the united states instead should take the initiative in prohibiting 
antarctic mineral development he said 
peter wilkins director of polar programs for the national 
science foundation said the antarctic legislation could disrupt 
scientific research in the region at a time when nsf is remedying 
past environmental problems 
the legislation would apply all us environmental and historic 
preservation laws to the continent without regard to its unique 
situation he said 
for example us law could require chemical processing of waste 
water and cause more damage than current treatment methods 
recommended by scientists wilkins said

polands feuding leaders led by 
solidarity chairman lech walesa and prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki agreed on the need for early free elections but little 
else in meetings tuesday participants said 
the six hours of discussions called by the powerful roman 
catholic primate brought together more prominent officials than 
any meeting since the spring 1989 negotiations that led to the 
downfall of the communist regime 
participants had cautioned before starting that no decisions 
would be made behind closed doors and indicated afterward they 
were divided on key issues concerning the nations next steps 
toward democracy 
they said the session served as preparation for thursdays 
potentially fiery debate in parliament on the schedule for 
postcommunist polands first fully democratic presidential and 
parliamentary elections 
there couldnt have been any decisions because it was just a 
conversation said walesa the only declared presidential 
candidate as he left primate jozef glemps residence 
mazowiecki said there had been a broad exchange about all 
the problems poland faces but asked if there was a convergence 
of views he said i dont think so 
minister aleksander hall responsible for contacts among 
political parties said two concepts emerged one to hold a 
presidential election first and the other to hold balloting for the 
presidency and parliament at the same time 
all are of the opinion that those events should take place in 
the next few months he said 
president wojciech jaruzelski the former communist party leader 
who has indicated he will leave office early said the 
constructive exchange brings us closer to decisions 
the primates intention is to create the most civilized 
conditions for further political evolution in poland deputy 
government spokesman edward krzemien told polish radio the point 
is that the coming elections shouldnt divide and tear poland apart 
but provide transition to democracy 
the onceunited solidarity movement has split into two camps 
one center alliance backs walesa and is identified with workers 
and the solidarity union headquartered in gdansk the other known 
by the acronym road includes many intellectuals and supports 
mazowiecki and the government in warsaw 
leaders of both groups evolving as political parties after four 
decades of oneparty communist leadership were among the 25 people 
invited also included were other parliamentary leaders 
the session followed walesas announcement monday that he will 
run for president in the elections expected as early as this fall 
and no later than spring 
there has been no word on a bid by mazowiecki walesa parted 
ways with his former adviser over the pace of reforms saying the 
government has lost sight of the issues and that too many 
communists remain in positions of power 
a public opinion poll conducted sept 34 and published tuesday 
showed mazowiecki was supported for president by 48 percent of 
those surveyed compared with 37 percent for walesa the rest had 
no opinion 
however walesas prominence political instincts and authority 
are incalculable and he has said he is confident of victory he 
received the loudest cheers from the crowd watching the arrivals at 
the primates residence jaruzelski was greeted by derisive 
whistles 
the poll also showed a drop in confidence in the government from 
82 percent in january to 61 percent about half of those questioned 
had never heard of either the center alliance or road 
the churchs position in the election will be critical in 
overwhelmingly catholic poland 
the polish media first dubbed the session a small 
roundtable reminiscent of the unprecedented spring 1989 
meetings of the former communist authorities and the solidarityled 
opposition the talks opened the way for reform in poland and 
across eastern europe 
but walesa and others objected and the session became known as 
tea at the primates 
free elections will become our new roundtable not any 
agreement behind the back of society walesa said 
jaruzelski the former communist party leader who jailed walesa 
and mazowiecki during martial law imposed in 1981 has said he is 
willing to resign early from his sixyear term

a fire aboard a gasoline tanker was 
declared under control a second time tuesday and firefighters 
boarded the vessel to pump fireretardant foam inside as a 
precaution 
the fire erupted with a series of explosions sunday aboard the 
mv jupiter moored in the saginaw river one crewman is missing 
and believed dead 
private specialist firefighters working from a coast guard 
vessel at first declared victory over the blaze monday afternoon 
but it reignited that evening burning all night and into tuesday 
on tuesday firefighters from the texas firm boots amp coots 
returned and knocked the flames down with fireretardant foam they 
believed the fire was put out tuesday afternoon said tom dalesio 
a spokesman for ashland oil inc of ashland ky parent of the 
company that owns the jupiter 
after the flames appeared out a crew boarded the mangled tanker 
to spray more foam inside the ship and begin inspecting it dalesio 
said 
damage estimates werent expected before wednesday when experts 
would begin planning how to salvage the ship he said 
the tanker had unloaded just over half its cargo of 23 million 
gallons of gasoline when the fire broke out sunday and raged for 30 
hours and officials are unsure how much if any gas may have 
leaked into the river 
the tankers bow was lodged on the river floor in a shallow spot 
but its stern remained afloat 
the blaze erupted after a transfer hose snapped spewing 
gasoline 
ashland blamed the accident on a passing vessel saying its wake 
rocked the jupiter parting mooring lines and the hose 
ashland attorneys have written american steamship co owner of 
the coal freighter buffalo to say we hold them responsible 
said roger schrum an ashland spokesman 
american steamship spokeswoman kelly pezone denied the 
allegation 
some fuel splashed into the water tuesday prompting crews to 
pile absorbent booms around the tanker said state department of 
natural resources spokesman terry walkington 
the coast guard is investigating the accident 
no one is sure is how much gasoline remains on the ship or 
spilled said ashland spokesman dan lacy 
dnr and state health experts were awaiting results of water and 
airpollution tests 
at the height of the blaze black smoke spread for 100 miles and 
hundreds of dead fish were found near the tanker the test results 
were expected later in the week 
some residents were angry that evacuations hadnt been ordered 
we have human health at risk here said terry miller 
chairman of the lone tree council an area environmental group i 
would think just as a precautionary measure they should have asked 
local residents to evacuate even if its just gasoline burning 
tim bosco 29 owner of boscos fruit market located a half mile 
from the burning tanker said the fumes gave him a headache with 
all that raw gas burning it was real bad we couldnt get away 
from the smell he said 
mike lupo 42 boscos cousin said it really shook up the 
city there are a lot of people complaining that their houses and 
cars are covered with an oily soot 
yesterday it got so bad there was this haze for three or four 
miles 
gov james blanchard speaking on the banks of the river 
tuesday the state would review safety at the 13 michigan spots 
where petroleum products are offloaded 
the missing jupiter crewman tom sexton 46 of iowa was 
believed to have died while trying to swim ashore from the burning 
tanker three other crew members who were thrown or jumped from 
the tanker remained hospitalized tuesday in fair condition

there his troops shot and captured president samuel doe earlier 
this month and doe died in captivity 
johnson has embraced a peace plan put forward by the economic 
community of west african states to install an interim government 
that would organize fair elections

has refused to talk peace before the departure of a 3000man west 
african peacekeeping force which arrived in monrovia on aug 24

african force dead last week ghana and nigeria responded by

the second summer cleanup of beaches 
tarred with crude oil spilled from the exxon valdez ended with 
state officials still worried that buried blobs of oil could cause 
more environmental damage 
exxon crews scoured contaminated shorelines for five months 
starting in april to remove oil left through the winter after the 
987foot tanker slammed onto a reef in march 1989 and spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons into prince william sound 
most beaches still covered with oil after the agitation of 
typically violent winter storms were cleaned up but many large 
collections of crude oil lie offshore covered by shifting sand and 
gravel 
the same forces that buried it can unbury it state 
spokesman ernie piper said 
gov steve cowper said hes worried that oil untouched by the 
cleanup will leach toxic substances for a long long time 
initially 1245 miles were coated with spilled oil piper said 
at the start of the 1990 cleanup about 100 miles of beach remained 
tainted he said 
by saturday when exxon shut down operations for the winter 
only four miles were classified as heavily oiled piper said 
cowper commended exxon and the coast guard for what was 
accomplished but fretted about the environmental future of the 
area where thousands of animals live and breed 
i dont think well ever see the point where the spiller and 
the regulator will ever agree to everything cowper said last 
week its our job to bark at the heels of everyone its our 
beach 
there is no agreement about how to best deal with buried oil 
some say it should be dug up others say environmental disruption 
caused by digging would be worse than leaving the oil untouched 
otto harrison exxons general manager in alaska said cleanup 
work and winter wave action produced a rapid recovery of prince 
william sound and the gulf of alaska 
the oil company pointed to a record 1990 salmon catch as partial 
proof fishermen hauled in 43 million pink salmon nearly 50 
percent more than the record set in 1987 the salmon have a 
twoyear life cycle meaning the ones caught this year were those 
that swam out to sea in 1989 during the height of the spill 
inspectors said this years catch was high quality 
coast guard rear adm david ciancaglini said he was happy with 
the second summer cleanup and discounted the flurry of state 
complaints accompanying its close 
the controversy is over as far as im concerned he said 
lets get out of here on a happy note and do whatever we have to 
do to finish up next year 
exxon said it would resume the cleanup in 1991 if the coast 
guard decides it is needed the state plans to draw up its own list 
of areas to be cleaned the oil company said it spent 2 billion on 
the cleanup in 1989 and 200 million more this year

the us syphilis rate is at its highest level in 
40 years and the biggest increase in the sexually transmitted 
disease has been among blacks according to a federal study 
a separate study also published in wednesdays journal of the 
american medical association says the common inexpensive methods 
of treating gonorrhea should be abandoned because of sharp rises in 
both the penicillinresistant and tetracyclineresistant strains of 
the disease 
in the first study researchers at the centers for disease 
control in atlanta report a 34 percent increase in the number of 
americans treated for syphilis between 1981 and 1989 
they said 184 of every 100000 americans were treated for 
syphilis last year up from the 137 cases per 100000 treated in 
1981 
the 1989 rate was higher than at any time since 1949 the study 
said 
the overall rate has risen most sharply in the last four years 
which may be an indication that precautions spurred in the early 
1980s by the aids outbreak are on the wane said one of the studys 
authors dr allyn k nakashima of the cdcs division of sexually 
transmitted diseases 
obviously the message has not gotten out to certain groups 
nakashima said in a telephone interview monday 
especially worrisome though the studys authors say is the 
high rate among blacks the study shows the incidence of syphilis 
among blacks more than doubled between 1985 and 1989 to 1218 
cases from 526 cases per 100000 people 
in contrast syphilis rates among white males have dropped by 69 
percent since 1982 the disease rate for white females remained low 
and unchanged 
data for the study came from quarterly and annual reports sent 
to the cdc by state health departments over the nineyear period 
reviewed 
researchers were unable to give concrete reasons for the 
differences between the racial groups although they suggest that 
the higher rate among blacks may be linked to a higher incidence of 
drug abuse poverty and homelessness 
this is just one more problem that can be attached to that 
disenfranchised group nakashima said 
commenting on the new study the march of dimes birth defects 
foundation said in a statement that it has seen a shocking 186 
percent jump in the number babies born with syphilis passed on by 
infected mothers in the last five years 
the ravages of syphilis among newborns closely follow trends 
in infection among women said dr reed v tuckson a senior vice 
president at the march of dimes in white plains ny the 
resurgence of this disease among adults is clearly reflected by a 
rapid rise in the number of babies who develop serious disorders 
and die 
the gonorrhea study shows that although the incidence of the 
disease has decreased since 1975 there is an increasing problem 
with infections caused by strains that are resistant to treatment 
with penicillin and tetracycline 
in the study conducted from september 1987 through december 
1988 researchers examined 6204 cases from 21 clinics nationwide 
and 21 percent showed potential for resistance to both treatments 
as well as two other often used drugs cefoxitin and spectinomycin 
results of the study helped the cdc write new guidelines which 
were published last year for treating gonorrhea 
the cdc recommends gonorrhea be treated with ceftriaxone its 
at least seven times more expensive and is the only treatment that 
all of the diseases strains have been susceptible to said the 
studys primary author dr sandra k schwarcz also of the cdc 
but the practice has not caught on yet in many areas said dr 
jane schwebke assistant director of programs for sexually 
transmitted diseases at the harborview medical center in seattle 
in the outlying areas a lot of people are still using 
penicillin which can be a problem she said

five senators asked federal health officials 
tuesday to investigate a california foundation that allegedly 
misused funds it raised to help patients needing bone marrow 
transplants 
the senators said in a letter they were disturbed about 
complaints from transplant patients and their families who said 
they had difficulty getting lifesavers foundation of america to 
account for funds contributed for specific patients 
by mid1990 the foundation reported it had raised more than 
76 million under a contract with the national marrow donor 
program the lawmakers said 
under the 500000 contract signed in may 1989 the foundation 
was to recruit bonemarrow donors conduct public education 
campaigns about the need for donors and raise money for testing of 
potential donors said douglas a shaw executive director of the 
marrow donor program 
the program terminated the agreement june 27 this year charging 
the foundation breached the contract by failing to submit the names 
of thousands of recruited donors to the programs national 
registry 
by withholding the names it meant that when we searched 
our computers for names of potential donors we were missing about 
21600 names shaw said 
the donor program went to court to force the foundation to turn 
over the names shaw said it appeared the foundation was trying to 
start its own donor registry he said about 10000 names have been 
turned over so far 
spokeswoman susan rafkin said officials at the covina 
califbased foundation could not comment because they had not 
received the senators letter she said the foundation welcomes any 
inquiries into its activities 
the program established by congress in 1984 and partially 
finance with federal funds has about 200000 names of potential 
donors in its registry it is based in st paul minn 
the foundations contract involved working with patients trying 
to find a suitable bonemarrow donor shaw said the funds raised 
by the foundation were to be used to offset laboratorytesting 
costs incurred by patients searching for an appropriately matched 
donor shaw said 
however families have complained that lifesavers refused to 
pay some laboratory bills incurred by patients for whom the group 
had received contributions and then refused to turn over the funds 
contributed for that patient to another organization the senators 
said 
we find such charges deeply disturbing said the letter to 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
sullivans office had no comment 
the letter was signed by sens edward kennedy dmass barbara 
mikulski dmd al gore dtenn orrin hatch rutah and dave 
durenberger rminn

the senate passed a 4 billion spending bill 
for the district of columbia tuesday but disputes over abortion 
language gay rights and aid for artists at a city university must 
still be worked out between house and senate lawmakers 
the senate version of the bill passed without debate contains 
abortion language that prompted president bush to twice veto the 
bill last year 
the bill also contains a controversial amendment that permits 
private volunteer organizations in the district such as the big 
brothers to set their own policies on whether to allow homosexuals 
to serve as mentors for minors 
gay rights groups vehemently opposed this measure introduced by 
sen william armstrong rcolo the house version of the bill 
contains no such provision 
the legislation passed by the senate also restores 16 million 
for the university of the district of columbia that the house had 
blocked the house struck the money after some members complained 
that the dinner party was erotic and should not receive 
federal support 
the senate bill restored that money and required the university 
to make quarterly financial reports to the house and senate 
appropriations committees 
the senate abortion language however may prove to be the most 
controversial amendment in the package 
the bill would allow the city to use locallyraised tax money to 
pay for medicaid abortions and would allow the federal government 
to reimburse the city for the costs of abortions performed in cases 
where the pregnancy either endangered the life of the mother or is 
the result of rape or incest 
the white house has said that bushs advisers will recommend a 
veto unless it prohibits the use of all funds federal or local 
to pay for abortions except where the mothers life would be 
endangered 
the house version of the bill contained more restrictive 
abortion language 
house and senate conferees must meet to resolve these 
differences 
the federal government will pay the city 4305 million for tax 
revenue lost on federallyowned property congress has not 
increased its contribution to the city tax base since 1985 despite 
a surge in local property values 
the senate version of the bill would authorize 371 million more 
than the previous year

butte county supervisors narrowly 
averted the nations first county bankruptcy tuesday by approving 
an 111 million bailout offered by gov george deukmejian 
the board voted 32 to accept the republican governors 
proposal which local officials said will avert immediate 
bankruptcy but wont stave off the possibility of bankruptcy next 
year 
were only putting off the inevitable said supervisor hack 
mcinturf 
county officials blamed the expense of programs required by the 
state 
under the agreement deukmejian proposed deferring payment of 
more than 63 million owed the state for fire protection services 
postponed the states demand for payment of a 2 million matching 
share for a new butte county jail and offered a 115 million 
direct cash grant 
the proposal also calls for the county to raise some 165 
million by boosting local fees including property tax collections 
and jail booking fees the payment deferrals will allow the county 
to use those funds for local programs and services 
in return the county agreed to scale back requests for new law 
enforcement services increases in pay for county workers and other 
programs the county said earlier it needed 141 million to keep 
from going bankrupt a figure that included expanded jail 
facilities and more deputies 
the agreement followed weeks of acrimonious negotiations between 
the state and the county which is last among californias 58 
counties in the amount of money it spends per capita on government 
services and last in the proportion of sheriffs deputies to 
population 
the county in northern califrnia is largely rural with an 
economy based on ranching and farming and has less than 200000 
people oroville the county seat is 66 miles north of sacramento 
the crisis arose after county officials were unable to balance 
this years 155 million budget 
they complained that fully 85 percent of their money was locked 
into existing programs by state statute such as welfare and 
health care for the poor and fire protection services 
board chairman ed mclaughlin along with the county supervisors 
association of california said that since the state didnt fully 
reimburse the county for the mandated services the county was 
forced to cut local services in order to finance the states 
demands 
mclaughlin voted against accepting the agreement saying the 
county had earlier pledged to declare bankruptcy unless the state 
offered the full 141 million

makers of toothpastes and mouthwashes claiming 
to prevent plaque and other dental conditions must prove their 
products work federal health officials said tuesday 
the food and drug administration told manufacturers to submit 
data supporting their claims within the next six months 
several toothpaste and mouthwash manufacturers have been heavily 
promoting their products ability to reduce or prevent plaque 
tartar and other deposits on teeth and guard against gum disease 
and other dental conditions 
the fda said these statements amount to drug claims because they 
deal with the treatment or prevention of disease and because they 
affect the structure or function of the body 
under the federal food drug and cosmetic act manufacturers 
making drug claims must show that the ingredients in their products 
are safe and effective the agency said 
if the claims cannot be supported with scientific data 
manufacturers would have to remove such claims from the labels of 
their products the fda said 
the american dental association welcomed the fdas action 
its well known that many of these products are effective in 
reducing plaque and problems related to plaque said philip 
weintraub a spokesman for the association 
the association has given its seal of acceptance to several 
toothpaste and mouthwash manufacturers that make antiplaque 
claims he said 
weve looked at their extensive clinical data and determined 
their products are safe and will perform as the manufacturers say 
they will he said 
the fda request for data was to be published in the federal 
register on wednesday 
the agency considered oral healthcare products years earlier in 
its review of nonprescription drugs but much research has been 
conducted since then on plaque and its prevention an fda 
spokeswoman said 
plaque is a thin deposit on teeth that promotes bacteria growth 
studies have implicated plaque in the development of cavities and 
to gingivitis a painful inflammation of the gums 
some manufacturers claim that the abrasives in their toothpaste 
scrapes off plaque some mouth rinses claim to remove plaque 
through antimicrobial or chemical activity

industrial products has more than 64000 lawsuits pending and is 
being named in 20000 more a year

the commander of syrian 
troops in the saudi desert described his men tuesday as a buffer 
between the feuding arab brothers of arabia and iraq and said of 
saddam hussein i hope that he dies very soon 
gen mohammed deeb dhaher opening his camp to reporters for the 
first time said his battlehardened commandos could shift quickly 
into offensive posture if their orders were changed 
the syrians are here for the defense of saudi arabia but if 
they have to go for offense they will be ready said dhaher who 
said all of his men have experience fighting in lebanon 
the syrians who have photographs of president hafez assad at 
the entrance of their camp are the fittestlooking and most 
experienced of all the arab forces on the front lines in the 
multinational defense of saudi arabia but their numbers are low 
pending reinforcements 
while several hundred of his colleagues jogged across the desert 
in formation soldier ramzi salim said the syrians would have no 
problem fighting with americans if hostilities erupt with the iraqi 
forces to the north in occupied kuwait 
everyone in the world is against saddam hussein salim said 
kuwait will be kuwait again 
nodding nearby was another commando mohammed nosra who said 
the syrians were proud to be in saudi arabia to defend the holy 
mosques and ready to stop any army that makes aggression against an 
arab 
gen dhaher wearing a skull and sword inginia on his uniform 
nodded yes when asked if he would have fought wth iraq if assad had 
ordered him to do so we are soldiers he said adding we 
would not have been as enthusiatic about our mission 
saddam and assad head rival wings of the baath party prior to 
the invasion of kuwait assad figured more prominently on the list 
of us troubles in the mideast than did saddam us 
administrations accuse syria of harboring terrorists 
the saudi government the past month has been taking reporters on 
weekly trips to arab camps near hafr al batin in the northern 
arabian desert about 65 miles from the kuwaiti border but until 
tuesday the syrians had not opened their camp which is near camps 
of saudi kuwaiti and egyptian forces 
the syrians are about 1200 strong with armored units said to 
be on the way at the moment the commandos have virtually no 
equipment other than what they carry on their backs and belts 
for now the syrians and 2000 egyptian frontline forces are 
more a political statement than a military force 
the american forces which have been fortifying their forward 
positions with tanks and other heavy armor and artillery in the 
past two weeks remain in most areas about 30 miles behind the arab 
forces 
at the kuwaiti camp officers acknowledged that about 70 percent 
of the 20000strong army has been lost as a result of the aug 2 
iraqi invasion including a good number of kuwaiti troops who were 
on vacation when iraq invaded 
but the kuwaiti commanders said they wanted to lead any 
offensive action to force iraq from kuwait

the unarmed rebels were apprehended planting a car bomb 
staffordshire police were searching for a man seen running from 
the terrys home

maybe its a little early to draw that conclusion and no one has 
claimed responsibility at this stage but of course it has the 
obvious connotations of similar events 
the ira has attacked british targets overseas in its campaign to 
drive the british out of the province of northern ireland and unite 
it with the irish republic

the netherlands offered tuesday to send a squadron of 18 f16 
jet fighters to turkey if the united nations declares an air 
blockade 
france and britain the other western european power with 
significant forces in the region wanted their weu allies to send 
at least token ground troops according to diplomatic sources 
the weu is the sole european body dealing with defense issues 
its members include nine of the 12 european community nations 
neutral ireland greece and denmark are not members 
un diplomats on sunday began drafting a new resolution to 
close iraqs air routes and punish nations flouting the economic 
embargo us officials said 
an air blockade would involve the interception of planes 
approaching iraq and would pose a far greater danger of triggering 
hostilities than the boarding of ships in the persian gulf

the senate endorsed a measure tuesday that 
would allow states to close their borders to other states garbage 
to protect shrinking landfill capacity 
sen dan coats rind said the proposal would give every 
state the right to determine its own destiny in managing trash 
through bans or higher fees for outofstate waste 
i wanted a fair shot at this the freshman senator said 
after prevailing over the objections of new jersey democratic 
senators bill bradley and frank lautenberg on a 6831 vote im 
content with it 
under coats proposal offered as an amendment to the district 
of columbia appropriations bill states could block garbage imports 
as long as they had a 20year solid waste plan in place 
bradley and lautenberg concerned their state would be overrun 
by trash if the measure were to become law promised to continue 
fighting when the appropriations bill reaches a housesenate 
conference committee 
the dc appropriations bill is also in danger of a presidential 
veto because it contains abortion funding language that led to two 
vetoes last year 
coats promised a tough fight to keep his measure alive 
if its knocked out well be back next year at minimum we 
have established a 2to1 majority to do something about this 
problem 
lautenberg has accused coats of playing electionyear politics 
with the garbage issue we knew we were on the lesspopular side 
of the issue he said 
new jersey is the largest exporter of solid waste to indiana 
landfills which are eight to 10 years from reaching their 
capacity coats said 
the amendment would give any state the power to impose 
unlimited punitive fees on outofstate garbage said 
lautenberg who said bans could be imposed suddenly and without 
environmental protection agency review a state writes its own 
ticket 
bradley and lautenberg charged the coats measure would block 
development of a comprehensive national solid waste policy by 
pitting state against state they said it also would undermine 
recycling new jersey has set a 60 percent recycling goal by 1995

the house judiciary committee on tuesday 
approved a plan under which makers of computer softwear could bar 
video stores and others from renting them to customers 
manufacturers have complained that the rentals of video games 
are cutting into sales 
the bill sponsored by rep mike synar dokla is similar to a 
law already passed by congress under which record manufacturers are 
allowed to bar rentals 
the measure sailed through judiciary committee on a voice vote 
despite objections from video rental store operators 
sponsors are expected to push for early action on the measure 
with congress expected to leave washington for the campaign trail 
in a matter of weeks the senate already has passed similar 
legislation 
the idea behind the bill is that it is easy to copy both records 
and computer softwear stored on floppy discs the rentals are 
therefore considered to undercut the copyrights held by the 
manufacturers 
games often cost between 40 and 50 
under the bill manufacturers would have the option of allowing 
rentals or barring them 
in the case of records most makers do not allow rentals 
actually the bill applies to a wide range of computer softwear 
in addition to video games but the rental of games by stores that 
specialize mainly in renting movies is the main focus of the issue 
the japanese manufacturer nintendo asked to have its games 
included in the bill but the committee balked at that lawmakers 
said nintendo games are not readily copied and therefore the 
companys copyrights are not endangered by rentals 
the bill specifies that the measure not only does not apply to 
nintendo but also softwear embodied in machines such as cars and 
microwaves

a man accused of slaying a leading 
presidential candidate whose death led to a yearold war between 
the government and drug traffickers escaped tuesday from a bogota 
prison police said 
jaime rueda rocha was one of three suspects being held in the 
shooting death of liberal party candidate sen luis carlos galan on 
aug 18 1989 
radio reports said rueda rocha used documents provided by his 
lawyer to persuade prison workers to let him leave the facility 
a police spokeswoman said officials were investigating how rueda 
rocha escaped she confirmed on condition of anonymity that rueda 
rochas lawyer carlos caicedo had been visiting him at the time 
of his escape 
rueda rocha was arrested a month after galans murder the 
government blamed the medellin cocaine cartel for masterminding the 
candidates slaying which led to a major crackdown on drug 
traffickers 
one of the tactics used by the government in its crackdown that 
most angered the drug kingpins was extraditing traffickers wanted 
in the united states on drugrunning and money laundering charges 
the cartel responded with an assassination and bombing campaign 
which in the past year killed about 550 people including three 
presidential candidates during that period the group reportedly 
detonated 300 bombs nationwide 
a domestic airliner also exploded in air shortly after takeoff 
from bogotas airport killing more than 100 people 
on july 27 the medellin cartel declared a unilateral truce in 
its war against the government 
on tuesday a statement signed by cocaine barrons calling 
themselves the extraditables said despite army claims they did 
not intend to resume their bombings of government targets for now 
last weekend the army found 1000 pounds of dynamite in a 
northeastern colombian region where the leader of the medellin 
cartel pablo escobar is said to own vast tracks of land

supreme court nominee david h souter was 
praised by friends tuesday as a strong supporter of civil 
liberties but a feminist leader called him a total disaster for 
civil rights and womens rights 
the senate judiciary committee which completed three days of 
questioning souter on monday turned its attention to about 40 
witnesses testifying for and against him 
his confirmation as the high courts 105th justice and a key 
vote on such divisive issues as abortion civil rights and 
churchstate relations seemed certain 
before tuesdays hearings began molly yard president of the 
national organization for women told reporters her group had begun 
a major drive to block souters confirmation 
we know that man will be a fifth vote to overturn roe vs 
wade ms yard said referring to the 1973 supreme court decision 
legalizing abortion our lives are on the line women in this 
country are going to die were talking about your daughters your 
granddaughters he is a disastrous choice a total disaster for 
civil rights and womens rights 
during the hearings ms yard appeared on the verge of tears as 
she told the senators all of them men none of you will ever 
face that problem of an unwanted pregnancy not one of you 
eleanor smeal of the fund for the feminist majority held up a 
bracelet bearing the name of a 17yearold becky bell she 
identified as a victim of the parental consent law of indiana 
she said the girl died after obtaining an illegal abortion 
sen orrin hatch rutah said he was impressed by the testimony 
of ms yard and ms smeal but added there is another point of 
view that is equally as moving 
jerry diamond like souter a former new hampshire attorney 
general praised his friends honesty and integrity diamond added 
his central tenet is the dignity and freedom of the individual 
he is a strong supporter of civil liberties 
steven mcauliffe of the new hampshire bar association whose 
schoolteacher wife christa died in the 1986 explosion of the 
challenger space shuttle spoke of souters compassion 
i have some experience with personal pain mcauliffe said 
i know many of you share my pain as i share yours i want you to 
know that david souter feels and shares and understands the pain of 
others with great compassion and great dignity 
the 14member committee was expected to conclude its hearings 
wednesday and vote on souters nomination next week the 
committees recommendation then will go to the full senate 
tuesdays first witnesses kate michelman of the national 
abortion rights action league and faye wattleton of planned 
parenthood urged souters defeat 
judge souters personal qualifications are not at issue ms 
michelman said the issue is whether or not the supreme court 
will continue to uphold the fundamental constitutional right to 
privacy including the right to choose 
ms wattleton asked the senators to send a message that the 
period of tolerance for political gamesmanship around our 
fundamental reproductive rights has ended 
in three days of testimony souter steered clear of giving his 
personal views on abortion or stating how he might vote if asked to 
overturn roe vs wade 
but some of his answers made him appear more moderate than his 
staunchly conservative reputation in fact several conservative 
senators appeared concerned by some of souters testimony 
two senators on record as supporting abortion rights said 
tuesday the souter opponents were engaging in poor strategy 
i really believe youre making a big mistake said sen alan 
simpson rwyo im on your side but i think youre hurting your 
cause 
sen arlen specter rpa said its not realistic to expect 
that if judge souter is turned down we will get a nominee who 
will commit in advance to uphold roe vs wade 
specter noted that president bush who nominated souter favors 
overturning the 1973 ruling 
howard phillips chairman of the conservative caucus said in 
written testimony prepared for delivery wednesday that souter 
should be opposed because he hasnt fought against abortion 
phillips cited souters tenure on a hospital governing board 
during which he voted to allow abortions at the facility in light 
of the roe v wade ruling 
if mr souter believed each fetus to be a human person and 
failed to act against the performance of abortion he was morally 
delinquent phillips said 
those testifying in favor of souters nomination were former 
attorney general griffin bell and former virginia gov gerald 
baliles 
bell said souter has the right vision of our country and the 
law of our country baliles who has known souter since both men 
were deputy attorneys general of their respective states said i 
believe he will serve with distinction 
norma mccorvey the woman who used the pseudonym jane roe when 
her challenge to a texas abortion law led to the supreme courts 
1973 ruling attended the hearing and urged souters defeat 
ms mccorveys lawyer gloria allred told the committee 
david souter claims that he may or may not sign a decision 
returning millions of women to the fear and secondclass status of 
17 years ago perhaps he would relegate women to backalley 
abortions and unwanted pregnancies perhaps not hes not quite 
sure 
the leadership conference on civil rights a leader in the 
successful campaign to defeat robert h borks supreme court 
nomination in 1987 urged the senate to recall souter for more 
questioning 
joseph rauh the conferences chief lawyer said souters 
testimony that new hampshire has no racial problems indicates 
that souter is insensitive to discriminatory practices and cannot 
see what is right under his nose 
rauh said there is ample proof that new hampshire has racial 
problems

the united states soviet union britain 
france and china have agreed on the basic guidelines for an air 
embargo on iraq to cut it off from the rest of the world a top 
soviet official said tuesday 
those nations which are the five permanent security council 
members are now refining the language of a council resolution so 
it conforms to international air traffic laws said soviet deputy 
foreign minister yuli vorontsov 
we dont want anyone to be hurt he said and then added 
we just want to hurt iraq just a little 
un diplomats and officials from the permanent five met tuesday 
to continue refining the text of the resolution 
defense ministers from nine west european nations agreed tuesday 
at a meeting in paris to coordinate their air and ground forces in 
the gulf and enforce the un air embargo when it takes effect 
vorontsov and other diplomats said the full 15member security 
council is expected to pass the resolution within days before 
french president francois mitterrand arrives to deliver a speech 
condemning iraq on monday before the general assembly 
mitterrand was outraged by iraqi raids last friday on the 
french belgian dutch and canadian missions in occupied kuwait in 
which three frenchmen were abducted and diplomats were temporarily 
detained 
the council passed its seventh resolution condemning iraq last 
sunday when it denounced the violation of diplomatic privileges 
the next resolution sources said will extend the current naval 
embargo to air traffic block iraqi goods shipments among other 
nations and call on all nations to restrict the operations of 
iraqs embassies 
all countries would have to close their airspace to planes 
approaching or leaving iraq or occupied kuwait 
only flights carrying refugees out of iraq or kuwait or 
bringing in medical supplies and food specifically authorized by 
the security council would be allowed to travel to those nations 
planes could not be shot down that is banned by the 1944 
international civil aviation convention 
the resolution would also make it clear that the trade embargo 
resolution adopted on aug 6 covers commerce in services which 
will be specifically banned under the new resolution 
at least one western dredging company is still working in iraq 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev said the 8000 or so soviet 
civil and military advisors in iraq were working there on service 
contracts 
western diplomats said they hope the soviet union will use the 
new resolution as the pretext for withdrawing its advisors in iraq

iraqs terrorist capabilities chemical 
weapons and missiles pose a serious international threat but it is 
more difficult to determine whether saddam hussein intends to use 
them the cia chief said tuesday 
even before the crisis triggered by iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait the cia was concerned about saddams links to palestinian 
terrorists who have attacked western targets cia director william 
h webster said in the text of a new york speech 
now he has both strong ties to palestinian terrorists and an 
elaborate network within his own intelligence service capable of 
planning and carrying out terrorist attacks against a variety of 
international targets webster told the foreign policy 
association 
but the intelligence official added that capability whether 
in iraq or in other nations is easier to measure than intent 
knowing the intent of world leaders requires the knowledge 
that comes from human intelligence which is often difficult ot 
acquire he said 
webster said h is putting additional emphasis on the cias 
human intelligence capability to measure the intentions of 
leaders involved in conflicts he gave no details of how such 
information might be acquired 
iraqs sizable stockpile of chemical and biological weapons is 
the largest in the third world and can be delivered by a wide 
variety of weapons including bombs shells and artillery rockets 
webster said 
what is even more troubling is iraqs ambitious missile 
development program the most aggressive and advanced in the arab 
world he added 
in general weapons of mass destruction are becoming easier to 
obtain and terrorism could extend the battlefield worldwide in 
future conflicts webster said 
based on intelligence assessments of iraq webster said united 
nations sanctions have cut off 95 percent of iraqs oil exports and 
halted its efforts to recover from the eightyear war with iran 
the exodus of thousands of foreign workers he said has 
hampered nearly all of iraqs domestic industries 
webster said the cia gets regular reports on more than 60 iraqi 
army divisions and on every tanker in iraqs merchant marine fleet 
as well as information about the effectiveness of economic 
sanctions and the condition of foreign hostages in iraq and kuwait 
cia agents also are looking at us relations with other arab 
countries whose populations saddam is trying to influence 
saddams ability to sway arab public opinion to convince 
them that he is the hero of the masses could over time 
destabilize the region webster said 
on us relations with the soviet union webster said the recent 
helsinki summit between president bush and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev indicates a new world order 
but he said some concerns remain over soviet actions including 
concerns among some asian nations over the fact that reductions of 
forces in soviet asia have been slower than those in areas near 
europe 
in this era of new relationships however an understanding 
between moscow and some of these asian countries is likely 
webster said

the publisher who threatened to close the new 
york post unless unions accepted 19 million in job and wage cuts 
predicted tuesday that profits will soon begin rolling in 
more than 30 employees resigned and took sweetened severage 
packages the day after the union holding up the concession deal 
voted to take the cuts those leaving will get standard severance 
pay along with two months pay they would have received if the 
189yearold paper had shut down 
publisher peter s kalikow surrounded by union leaders and post 
managers said he expected the tabloid known for racy headlines and 
focus on urban crime to turn a profit by oct 1 if his prediction 
is correct it would be the first time since the 1970s the paper 
became profitable 
kalikow said the post has been losing about 27 million a year 
to secure 19 million in union concessions he promised the unions 
20 percent of company stock and a representative on the board of 
directors 
the remaining 8 million will be saved by other operating cost 
reductions including management wage cuts 
at a news conference in his office he thanked those assembled 
for helping him save the nations oldest continuously published 
daily paper 
we sat in meetings with these guys we sat in halls we sat in 
bathrooms with them they did a fabulous job kalikow said also 
thanking more than 100 departing employees and the hundreds who 
will make less money 
its in no small part that we owe these people some thanks for 
the sacrifices they made kalikow said the mortgage rate 
didnt go down the price of food didnt go down the price of gas 
didnt go down 
the newspaper guild which represents 350 news advertising and 
clerical staff voted monday to accept job reductions and a 20 
percent pay cut by switching to a fourday workweek top pay for 
reporters had been 853 a week 
ten other unions accepted concessions friday 
kalikow said all the unions had to agree to concessions or he 
would shut down the paper two years ago kalikow won 24 million 
in concessions from the unions as a condition of his purchase of 
the post 
some guild holdouts had said they would rather see the paper 
close because they would get severance money and 60 days shutdown 
pay kalikow countered by offering severance and shutdown pay to 
anyone who resigns before 5 pm wednesday 
daniel f cremins post executive vice president said that in 
addition to the guild offer four other unions will receive a 
similar enhanced departure package 
more than 30 guild members had resigned by tuesday afternoon 
kalikow spokesman howard rubenstein said adding that an 
undisclosed number of executives would be let go and others face 
pay cuts 
i cant see going through this again said henry scott 61 
a publications clerk at the post for 18 years who said he resigned 
although his wife is fighting cancer i think its my best bet to 
get out now i cant take it anymore 
he expects to get more than 30000 plus the 60 days pay 
some post reporters were in tears tuesday and refused comment 
colleagues said they were upset because they were resigning 
i have a morale problem right now theyre angry and they have 
a right to be said editor jerry nachman in the news business 
these days he said you learn sadly that the operational word is

brazil on tuesday scrapped a nuclear 
test site at an air force base deep in the amazonian jungle in a 
ceremony to show the governments peaceful intentions in its 
nuclear program 
president fernando collor de mello acompanied by his three 
military ministers tossed a handful of dirt into a 
1000footdeep concrete and steellined hole that officials said 
was constructed 10 years ago to test bombs it was never used 
the hole was adequate for an eventual nuclear test but this 
will not occur in the brazil of president collor de mello said 
spokesman claudio humberto rosa e silva 
the hole on the serra do cachimbo air force base 930 miles 
northwest of brasilia was excavated in 1979 when brazil was ruled 
by its last military president gen joao figueredo its existence 
was a secret until four years ago even then base officials 
claimed it was used for testing equipment for a brazilian space 
program 
rosa e silva said the hole was secretly constructed by the 
national security council a military agency that has since been 
disbanded 
civilians took the reins of government in 1985 but full 
democracy was not restored until last decembers election victory 
by collor 
the spokesman said collor confirmed the existence of the hole 
last week and decided to go personally to the site to signal his 
position against secret military adventures 
in 1987 brazil developed the means to enrich uranium a crucial 
step towards the construction of nuclear bombs and the country now 
has the capacity to make such weapons according to the brazilian 
society of physics 
historically the countrys nuclear development programs have 
been under control of separate branches of the armed forces 
independent of civilian control 
brazil has refused to sign the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty and as a result its nuclear program is not monitored by the 
international agency of atomic energy 
brazilian officials say the treaty is discriminatory because it 
discourages the transfer of nuclear technology to developing 
countries 
last week brazil and argentina the only two latin american 
countries that possess nuclear knowhow released a statement 
promising not to utilize their knowledge to produce atomic wepaons

a cherryflavoring plant that may have 
been used by an iraqi investor to acquire a poison gas ingredient 
for libya has been inspected by local regulators looking for 
hazardous chemicals 
but louis champon owner of product ingredient technology 
defended his chemical productin process and wastedisposal methods 
during mondays inspection and once again said he had nothing to 
do with his late iraqi partners links to libya 
champon opened the product ingredient technology factory last 
year with 5 million from investor ihsan barbouti 
champon invented a process to extract bitter almond oil a 
natural ingredient used in cherry flavoring from apricot pits a 
byproduct of the process is a cyanide compound 
champon said he unwittingly became involved in an effort by 
barbouti to export the factorys cyanide compounds to libya where 
us officials say they could be used in toxic weapons 
champon said he was unaware of barboutis alleged role as 
contractor for the libyan chemical weapons plant at rabta but 
barbouti an iraqi made no secret of his affection for libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi champon said 
dr barbouti wanted me to fly the libyan flag next to the 
american flag at our building champon said monday he always 
said how friendly he was with gadhafi but we kept politics to a 
minimum 
champon said seven barrels that stored ferric ferrocyanide the 
plants byproduct are missing he was unsure if they were full 
when they left the property 
although that cyanide compound is relatively safe environmental 
officials said it can be refined into deadly hydrogen cyanide and 
other toxic compounds 
champon said his cyanide disposal method was simple he poured 
it down the drain boca raton firerescue public information 
officer mike duane said monday that could have been illegal 
depending on the concentration of cyanide 
fire department inspectors and the state department of 
environmental regulation took samples monday of unidentified raw 
materials from the plant inspectors were uncertain when test 
results would be available 
fire inspectors on monday cited the buildings owner norman 
stolack of clark nj for having a fire alarm system that doesnt 
work champon said the alarms dont work because electricity was 
turned off in july when the plant closed for lack of money 
champon said he refused barboutis efforts to export the cyanide 
byproducts to west germany he said he also refused to increase 
barboutis share of the company from 50 percent to 80 percent 
disagreements between the men led champon to file suit in july 
1989 to sever their business relationship champon is seeking 100 
million in damages which he said is the potential value of his 
business 
us customs service officials interviewed champon last week 
about his relationship with barbouti champon said he had called 
the state department two weeks earlier to tell them that barbouti 
who died in july and also has been linked to a chemical weapons 
plant in iraq was his partner

four manufacturers of smoking implements 
pleaded guilty tuesday to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia 
through the mail in the first court victory for the federal 
government in a nationwide investigation called operation pipe 
prosecutors said the pleas undermined the traditional defense 
among such manufacturers that their products are meant to be used 
with tobacco and how the buyers use them is their own business 
the four businessmen and several others not yet prosecuted in a 
302count federal indictment were wholesalers of water pipes 
roach clips crack pipes and other items they claimed were used for 
smoking tobacco 
these people knew they were selling items used to ingest 
drugs they cant hide it any longer said henry hudson us 
attorney for the eastern district of virginia 
the government agreed to drop charges of money laundering and 
conspiracy cases against other defendants in exchange for the four 
guilty pleas said prosecutor larry leiser 
defense attorneys said their clients also agreed to the deal in 
light of the high cost of appeal 
randall dyer operator of tobacco accessories distributing co 
doing business as choice supply inc in alexandria va pleaded 
guilty tuesday along with page e weincek william l love and john 
m burgess 
weincek is the principal in rpm associates inc doing business 
as penguin feather in virginia and the district of columbia love 
was doing business as octopus garden in manassas va with its 
principal owner burgess 
all four defendants face a maximum of three years in jail fines 
of 250000 and forfeiture of up to 20 percent of their assets 
their businesses could be fined an additional 500000 hudson 
said 
this case is significant because its the first major 
prosecution of the purveyors of drug paraphernalia in the 
country he said 
hudson said operation pipe has confiscated more than 100 
million nationwide with 3 million of that in the washington dc 
and virginia area

british prime minister margaret 
thatcher pressing for close links between eastern europes new 
democracies and the west arrived tuesday in hungary after a 
rousing speech to the new czechoslovak parliament 
in budapest mrs thatcher inspected a guard of honor lined up 
in kossuth square before the ornate parliament building she dined 
later at a city restaurant with hungarian prime minister jozsef 
antall 
she received a standing ovation in the czechoslovak federal 
assembly after apologizing for the 1938 munich treaty and 
expressing remorse that the west did nothing when in 1968 soviet 
tanks crushed the prague spring 
she also told the assembly she would urge the 12nation european 
community which so far has offered only loose association to the 
eastern european democracies to quickly offer them full 
membership 
apologizing for britains appeasement of adolf hitler before 
world war ii mrs thatcher said the world was not making the same 
mistake over iraqs annexation of kuwait with europe the united 
states and the soviet union acting in concert 
in that new willingness to act together lies great hope for 
future peace particularly here in europe she said 
we failed you in 1938 when a disastrous policy of appeasement 
allowed hitler to extinguish your independence she said 
churchill was quick to repudiate the munich agreement but we 
still remember it with shame 
the munich treaty signed by britain and france endorsed 
hitlers invasion of northern czechoslovakia a year later he 
invaded poland to begin world war ii 
turning to alexander dubcek who led the 1968 reforms mrs 
thatcher said the pictures of that brave venture are etched in 
our memory and our inability to help remains a burden on the free 
worlds conscience 
dubcek now president of the newly elected czechoslovak 
assembly made no reference to 1968 but he said mrs thatchers 
visit has put a full stop to the memories of munich 
underlining the healing of preworld war ii wounds and the end 
of decades of postwar communist rule mrs thatcher was present for 
the renaming of a square in prague after winston churchill it was 
formerly named for a communist party chief antonin zapotcky 
she proposed to the czechoslovak parliament that a 35nation 
eastwest summit adopt a universal standard of rights 
if we can create a great area of democracy stretching from the 
west coast of the united states right across to the soviet far 
east that would give us the best guarantee of all for security 
because democracies dont go to war with each other the british 
leader said 
before coming to budapest mrs thatcher conferred with leaders 
of the slovak assembly in bratislava capital of czechoslovakias 
slovak republic

defense minister moshe arens asked the united 
states tuesday for a special 1 billion grant in military aid to 
defray the costs of an israeli alert during the gulf crisis israel 
radio reported 
the grant would be in addition to 18 billion in annual us 
military aid to israel the radio said 
the report said that arens who is in washington also asked 
us defense secretary richard cheney to increase israels yearly 
aid allowance to 25 billion no other details were given 
arens requests appeared to be also in addition to israels 
earlier appeals to lease more american fighter jets and other 
military equipment to balance out a proposed 18 billion us arms 
package to saudi arabia 
israeli officials the past two days have spoken out strongly 
against the sale to the saudis announced last week 
also tuesday finance minister yitzhak modai indicated he will 
ask the united states to forgive israels 45 billion debt with 
the united states if washington erases egypts loans modai spoke 
at a press conference 
modai argued that egypt received increased us aid because it 
signed a usmediated peace accord with israel in 1979 egypt is 
the only arab nation to make peace with the jewish state 
can you imagine that now the egyptians loans would be waived 
and israel would be stuck with its loans modai asked 
rhetorically at a news conference 
modai said egypt faces rising military expenses because it has 
sent troops to assist in the persian gulf crisis israel he said 
also faces rising costs because of repeated threats from iraqi 
leader saddam hussein 
saddams forces overran kuwait on aug 2 and baghdad later 
annexed the emirate the united nations has condemned the invasion 
and imposed economic sanctions on iraq that also hurt several of 
iraqs arab neighbors 
modai reiterated the government stance that israel while not 
eager for bloodshed would be unhappy with a negotiated gulf 
solution that leaves saddam in power 
what will happen next everybody will go back home the 
embargo will be stopped and israel will have to face alone this 
wild beast modai said 
president bush earlier this month recommended that egypts 67 
billion debt with the united states be forgiven to help the arab 
state cover expenses incurred in the gulf crisis 
the proposal already has run into opposition in the us 
congress where legislators have said such a move would invite 
similar requests from israel and other countries 
israel is americas largest foreign aid recipient receiving 
besides the military aid 12 billion in economic assistance 
egypt is second at 22 billion a year

a man described as head over heels in 
love with a woman who dumped him should get his 15000 engagement 
ring back a jury has ruled 
robert bowersox also should get back 7200 in cash he gave 
susanne clair the douglas county district court jurors said 
monday 
bob bowersox was very taken by susanne this man sort of 
tumbled head over heels with her bowersoxs lawyer michael 
lazar said of the two omaha residents 
his heart was on the table folks lazer told the jury 
where was her heart 
but ms clairs attorney warren zweiback said the nurses aide 
made it clear she never planned to marry bowersox and that he knew 
she was seeing another man 
bowersox who is retired also named ms clair as a joint tenant 
on his home 
the couple declined to give their ages 
she testified monday that she returned the interest in the house 
when she broke off their relationship in may 1989 but decided to 
consult with her lawyer about the money and the 323 carat 
pearshaped diamond ring 
judge james murphy told the jury during instructions that he 
knew of no nebraska case law on the issue 
apparently lovers in nebraska never have fights or ask 
for the return of engagement rings because our supreme court has 
not had the burden of laying down a path for me to follow he

despite tensions created by his drug and 
perjury trial racial relations are better in the nations capital 
than in chicago new york lots of places mayor marion barry 
said tuesday 
i think race relations in america are getting worse barry 
told a mostlywhite group of students at george washington 
university my trial certainly brought to the fore some tensions 
but if i were taken from here i guarantee you a year from 
now you would still have racism 
in his most expansive comments on racism since he was convicted 
of a cocaine possession charge last month barry stressed several 
times during a 45minute speech that the atmosphere surrounding his 
legal drama was just another example of racism in america today 
there are some people who would like to make marion barry 
responsible for this but im not in chicago new york lots of 
places where everyone thinks things are worse the mayor said 
but barry who was convicted of a misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charge and acquitted of another last month acknowledged that his 
dwindling number of supporters now are mostly black 
during the trial his attorney complained repeatedly that barry 
was prosecuted because of his position jurors later said they felt 
barry was prosecuted because he is black 
barry did not make reference to recent criminal trials like the 
central park jogger case that have been blamed for heightening 
racial tensions instead he listed only political examples 
take andy young said barry of the former civil rights 
leader and mayor of atlanta who recently lost a bid for georgias 
democratic gubernatorial nomination politically middle of the 
road no controversy yet he gets only 14 percent of the white 
vote i believe race was a significant factor in that 
barry concluded his formal remarks by issuing a call for racial 
unity this prompted a standing ovation from about two dozen black 
students scattered throughout the auditorium where the speech took 
place about 200 whites sat quietly 
there were more blacks who stood than whites barry said in 
response to a later question what that shows i think is that 
we need to do some healing here at george washington too 
in his first public address since learning that he would not be 
tried on a dozen drug and perjury charges his jury could not 
resolve the mayor seemed relaxed and even made some unusual 
selfdeprecating remarks 
a lot of you have seen me from a distance barry said at the 
beginning of his remarks primarily on television or 
videotape 
that comment which referred to the undercover fbi videotape 
that showed him smoking crack cocaine on the night of his arrest 
drew laughs from the crowd

soldiers fired tear gas into a crowd of 
mohawks and clashed with indians at a reservation where soldiers 
were searching tuesday for weapons three mohawks and five soldiers 
were injured authorities said 
in one of the most violent clashes since the mohawk standoff 
began more than two months ago soldiers used rifle butts to keep 
back indians protesting the raid on small tekakwitha island 
one soldier was dragged to the ground kicked and struck 
repeatedly over the head with his helmet that soldier and at least 
four others were injured according to military spokesman maj 
rusty bassarab 
a 15yearold girl and two other indians were injured said 
louis montour medical director of the nearby kateri memorial 
hospital located on the kahnawake reservation south of montreal 
at least 75 people including several indian children received 
treatment for the tear gas montour said 
tuesdays clash began when about 200 mohawks gathered on the 
bridge to the indian island in response to the army search about 
25 soldiers had gathered outside the kateri hospital near the 
bridge 
tell them to get the hell out of here one mohawk man 
shouted at the soldiers many of whom wore gas masks 
kahnawake chief joe norton tried to calm the crowd which 
instead grew more restless 
stay back someone is going to get shot norton warned the 
crowd which surged forward pelting soldiers with rocks punches 
and shoves were exchanged as mohawks battled with troops 
the soldiers fired several volleys of machinegunfire into the 
air and then shot tear gas into the crowd forcing the indians back 
across the bridge 
but many of the gagging coughing mob were unable to retreat 
because mohawks inadvertently blocked their path with a dump truck 
they had brought in to blockade the bridge witnesses said 
dozens of men women and children leaped into the st lawrence 
river to escape the stinging gas 
we jumped into river and tried to wet our clothes to get it 
off our skin and to hold wet cloth over our mouths and noses so we 
wouldnt be overcome one person said of the tear gas 
struggling to overcome the effects of the gas the mohawks 
regrouped and made another charge as army helicopters buzzed back 
and forth 
they are invading our territory it is an outright invasion of 
our land one mohawk man said 
mohawk peacekeepers intervened to keep the crowd from the 
soldiers 
bassarab said about 50 weapons were discovered in the raid 
including shotguns handguns hunting rifles and ak47 assault 
rifles 
another military spokeswoman capt yvon desjardins said eight 
helicopters and about 100 troops participated in the search 
the dispute came in the aftermath of plans by town officials in 
oka 18 miles west of montreal to expand a golf course onto what 
the mohawks said was tribal land 
indians at kahnawake and another mohawk community kahnesatake 
near oka built barriers that blocked traffic on an oka highway and 
on the mercier bridge over the st lawrence which connects 
montreal with its southern suburbs 
the dispute became violent after oka obtained a court order 
demanding the mohawk barricade be dismantled quebec provincial 
police tried and failed on july 11 to enforce the court order 
a police officer was shot and killed in the attempt and mohawks 
set up more barricades in oka and around the kahawake reservation 
south of montreal blocking traffic and holding off the police and 
army for more than six weeks 
the kahnawake barriers sparked an angry reaction from local 
residents who saw their 20minute commute to montreal grow to two 
hours several nights of protests and riots occurred during the 
blockade removed a month ago after a deal was reached between the 
indians and the canadian forces 
on the kahnesatake reservation 50 indian men women and 
children have been barricaded behind army barbed wire since sept 1 
in an alcohol and drug treatment center 
the army has cut off supplies and communications from about 12 
journalists with those mohawks 
on monday the federal government was officially registered 
owner of 92 acres of land near oka that fueled the standoff ottawa 
paid 278 million for the property 
the government now can offer it to the mohawks as part of a 
package in a negotiated settlement but quebec has ruled the 
mohawks cannot receive the land as long as the standoff continues

voted 225189 to make a deeper cut in the program than its armed 
services committee approved last month 
in crafting a 283 billion defense bill the panel adopted a 
budget for sdi in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 of 29 billion 
the house agreed to reduce the programs budget by an additional 
600 million for a spending level of 23 billion 
bush has requested 47 billion for the antimissile shield 
commonly known as star wars 
twenty republicans joined 205 democrats in voting for the 
measure while 39 democrats and 150 republicans voted against 
passage 
the house also 
narrowly defeated 216200 an amendment to allow abortions at 
military hospitals abroad currently a ban exists on using defense 
department money to pay for abortions except when the life of the 
mother is in danger the ban does not say whether military 
personnel who pay for the procedure can use government facilities 
it is simply to give our military personnel the same rights 
that the rest of us have as long as theyre willing to pay for 
it said rep vic fazio dcalif 
but a longtime abortion opponent rep christopher smith 
rnj questioned his colleagues will the us government 
provide the facilities to destroy children at will 
the senate faced with a similar measure to its bill 
sidestepped the issue in their rush to adjourn for the summer 
recess 
approved a measure using 200 million in defense department 
funds to create a program to assist workers communities and 
businesses hard hit by reductions in military spending the vote 
was 288128 
approved by voice vote a measure transferring 46 million that 
was unused in fiscal 1990 for the mx nuclear missile railgarrison 
program to environmental cleanup 
turned back an attempt to eliminate 357000 the army will have 
to reimburse north american van lines for property losses incurred 
during the us invasion of panama last december 
the government does not reimburse claimants who suffer losses or 
damages in a combat situation but indiana lawmakers urged their 
colleagues to help this hoosier company the reimbursement 
stands based on a 228189 vote 
on sdi the house approved the lowest level for the program 
since 1985 when a spending level of 14 billion was adopted 
we know that nations around the world are going to have the 
capacity to target our cities mr hussein said five months ago if 
i had one missile i would hit new york said rep bob mcewen 
rohio referring to iraqi president saddam hussein 
rep jon kyl rariz said the united states should not be 
held hostage by some tinhorn dictator with an arsenal of 
missiles 
but rep ron dellums dcalif a member of the armed services 
committee questioned why only a fraction of the administrations 
request for sdi would go to research that would knock down or 
intercept missiles 
terrorist delivery of a nuclear weapon would likely come by 
aircraft or a ship sailing into a us harbor dellums said 
quoting testimony from us military officials before congress 
face the reality dellums urged his colleagues 
the vote to reduce significantly spending levels for sdi 
provides house members with a bargaining position in negotiations 
with the senate on the final defense bill 
the house is expected to complete action on its version of the 
defense bill on wednesday and talks between the house and senate 
will begin later this month 
the senate adopted a 289 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991 
that trimmed about 1 billion from the sdi budget proposal 
rep charles bennett dfla argued that the sdi budget should 
total about 3 billion traditionally house and senate negotiators 
have agreed to a number midway between the two budget totals 
this figure compromised with their figure would give us 3 
billion bennett said of the 23 billion total 
the cut in the sdi program marked the second time in two years 
that lawmakers have targeted the system last year congress 
approved the first reduction in the program since former president 
reagan introduced it seven years ago the fiscal 1990 budget level 
for sdi was 38 billion 
earlier tuesday the house rejected 33883 an amendment by 
rep robert dornan rcalif to increase the sdi budget in the 
house bill to 42 billion it also turned aside 285136 an 
attempt by dellums and rep barbara boxer dcalif to cut the 
program to 15 billion the vote was 285136 
a measure that would provide 36 billion for the program the 
amount approved by the senate failed 273141 
the house also approved by voice vote a measure requiring the 
defense department to submit two sdi budgets for fiscal 1992 a 
spending plan for six years and an alternative which keeps the 
budget at fiscal 1991 levels for the next five years 
originally rep john spratt dsc proposed a lineitem for 
the sdi program a more stringent approach than that adopted by the 
senate however spratt modified his measure in anticipation of the 
housesenate conference

district lines drawn after the 1990 census are expected to reduce 
or eliminate the black majority

elvira elguera wants to wash her hair store 
owner ricardo correa would love to sell her shampoo but therell 
be no sale today the shampoo has no price 
absurd miss elguera declares as she stalks out of the shop 
i dont know what my costs are correa tries to explain 
its better not to sell than to sell at a loss 
peruvians have lived for years under the shelter of price 
controls and subsidies but when president alberto fujimori took 
office in july and 11 days later announced sweeping reforms peru 
took a dizzying leap into the economic unknown a freemarket 
economy 
peruvians are baffled neither stores nor consumers seem to know 
what things should cost 
at first prices soared a pound of beans from 40 cents to 3 a 
bottle of beer from 33 cents to 4 but when sales lagged many 
storeowners dropped their prices 
still prices in one store can be five times higher than those 
in a shop across the street and as in correas store many 
products simply have no price 
chaos read a recent headline on the front page of a top 
lima daily 
even before the reforms perus economy was headed for disaster 
inflation averaged more than 3000 percent a year and only one in 
five workers had a steady job 
the countrys gross national product has shrunk 20 percent since 
1988 
fujimoris reforms were aimed at halting rising prices by 
drastically cutting consumption and closing a large fiscal deficit 
caused in great part by subsidies previous governments have 
bridged the gap simply by printing more money 
prime minister juan carlos hurtado who also is economy 
minister predicts the economy will stabilize by yearend 
but the first 45 days of the plan will be tremendously 
recessive said felipe ortiz de zevallos an economist close to 
the government 
government services such as telephone water light and fuel 
cost 10 to 30 times more this has pushed prices skyhigh throughout 
the economy inflation in august was nearly 400 percent highest in 
perus history 
supermarkets are spilling over with unbought goods stores in 
luxury shopping centers are boarded up many factories are closed 
and others are preparing to shut 
its no longer a matter of lowering prices people just dont 
have money said carlos chavez whose mens clothing store is 
full of sale signs the only thing anyone thinks about is 
eating 
graciela elias shoe store hasnt sold anything in days if 
things continue as they are well all go under she said 
a smallbusiness association warns that thousands of companies 
verge on bankruptcy 
the measures will kill off all but the most efficient companies 
says javier silva ruete economy minister in a military government 
from 1978 to 1980 
what about the workers and the violence the only way to 
impose this plan in peru is with a dictatorship he said in an 
interview 
the measures have left millions of peruvians hungry with wage 
increases far below inflation they simply cant afford sufficient 
food 
so far there have been few violent protests but just how long 
poor peruvians will wait for any improvement is unknown 
the actions of wealthy industrialists may presage problems 
after the new measures were announced perus six main 
pharmaceutical manufacturers jointly raised prices six to 10 times 
this put many lifesaving medicines out of reach of all but the 
rich 
the prices have not dropped despite complaints even from 
fujimori 
silva ruete says pricefixing by perus many monopolies and 
oligopolies will continue until protectionist tariffs are reformed 
to allow imports to compete fujimori has promised such reforms 
but so far there has been no change 
even some retailers have trouble coming to terms with the ways 
of supply and demand 
i dont understand where my customers went said one 
restaurateur staring at trays of pasta that hes charging five 
times more for than before the reforms 
across the street a restaurant is packed prices there have 
only doubled 
other retailers have adapted oncedour market venders now smile 
more often at prospective customers waiters seem more solicitous 
and some private bus companies have begun offering candies to 
attract riders

efforts by the international 
monetary fund to restructure the economies of struggling third 
world countries have led to widespread resentment and even domestic 
upheaval in the caribbean 
several of the 14 nations in the region have undertaken 
belttightening programs designed and monitored by the imf in 
conjunction with the world bank many of the countries complain 
they are being forced to impose unpopular measures to qualify for 
loans and foreign investment 
unless we are committed to a fund program our debts will not 
be rescheduled we will not have access to the resources of 
multilateral financial agencies donors will not support us 
and investors will tend to shy away from us said president 
desmond hoyte of guyana 
guyana a founding member of caricom haiti jamaica the 
dominican republic jamaica and trinidad and tobago have signed 
agreements or begun talks with the imf to implement programs of 
currency devaluations price hikes and wage freezes in hopes of 
cutting inflation and promoting economic growth 
critics say the price of a blessing by the imf is too high 
social unrest radical politics and a sharp decline in living 
standards 
the imf says either you swallow that bitter pill or we wont 
give you a cent said paul latourtue a haitian economist at 
the university of puerto rico but you cant give medicine thats 
worse than the disease and you cant kill the patient to save it 
in its 1989 annual report the imf said its economic 
surveillance programs are designed to help impoverished developing 
nations to raise domestic savings reduce inflation and 
foster growth 
with economic growth creditors respond by rescheduling or 
reducing debts and granting new loans the report said it added 
the washingtonbased institution is increasingly aware of the 
social implications of economic reforms 
dennis pantin an economist at the west indies university in 
trinidad said the imf only provides limited relief because it 
doesnt take social factors into account 
the imf option is the most attractive in the narrow sense of 
permitting debt rescheduling said pantin but will todays 
relief turn out to be tomorrows burden 
in august the dominican republic was rocked by violence after 
president joaquin balaguer imposed belttightening measures 
recommended by the imf at least 11 people were killed and 50 were 
injured in protests against food and gasoline price hikes 
balaguer has said he will have to sign an imf agreement to 
qualify for new loans and meet payments on a 41 billion foreign 
debt 
signing a new accord with the fund will mean total misery for 
dominicans warns francisco antonio santos secretary of the 
central workers general the countrys largest labor union 
elsewhere in the caribbean 
trinidad and tobago one of the regions most stable 
democracies was plunged into turmoil in july by a coup attempt 
moslem insurgents blamed the government for widespread poverty in 
the once oilrich nation off venezuela an imf agreement to 
reschedule the countrys 24 billion foreign debt brought sharp 
devaluations wage freezes and cuts in social programs 
guyana which has had one of the steepest economic declines 
among western nations the past decade signed a threeyear imf 
accord in june 1989 to reschedule its 19 billion foreign debt 
the currency was devalued 70 percent and salaries for public 
workers were slashed by half but a year later the economy of 
guyana shows little sign of improving 
jamaica with a foreign debt of 45 billion 45 percent of 
which is owed to the imf the world bank and other lending 
institutions is the caribbeans most indebted country in january 
prime minister michael manley imposed harsh austerity measures 
including a 195percent increase in basic food prices as part of 
a 15month standby agreement with the imf manley says jamaica is 
recovering because of a tourism boom but complains that virtually 
all the islands earnings are used to pay its debt 
in haiti one of the worlds poorest and most politically 
volatile nations a 50 percent currency devaluation based on imf 
recommendations was not publicly announced for fear of strife at a 
time when the provisional government was trying to organize 
elections the government recently said it had a 31 million budget 
deficit and was unable to collect sufficient taxes haitis foreign 
debt is relatively small 16 million because of a suspension of 
foreign aid in retaliation for rights abuses

if it werent for two unusual factors that 
developed during the 1980s the sharp decline in popular stock 
market averages since midyear might have been sharper still 
not much attention is given to these factors important as they 
are but were they absent it is likely that the latest slump might 
have seemed more like a collapse 
factor one is the concentration of investments in bigcap 
stocks 
in the 1980s the big institutional investors concentrated their 
funds more narrowly than ever in the stocks of the biggest 
companies those with the greatest capitalization and sales 
reported in nine digits or more 
this concentration might have had the effect of pushing up 
prices of the big stocks which comprise the dow jones industrial 
average and the standard amp poors 500stock average but it also 
put a cushion beneath them 
the latter effect results from the narrowing of institutional 
investment parameters rather than moving funds to other stocks 
when bad news hit the institutions simply shifted their money from 
one bigcap stock to another 
asa result many of the largest companies fared better than 
their smaller cousins small stocks indicators for instance 
trailed those of bigcap stocks in 24 of the past 28 quarters 
why the concentration in part at least because of the 
tendency of many institutions to index portfolios to the popular 
averages thereby assuring themselves that they wont fare any 
worse than the averages 
some critics regard this as a copout contending that fund 
managers should do more than average to earn their keep others 
defend the practice as simple common sense they argue that if an 
institutions wealthy neighbor is buying huge blocks of certain 
stock it is smart to jump aboard for the ride 
factor two is the shrinking supply of stocks 
yes the supply of equities declined during the 1980s and it 
might still be declining that was the direction through the first 
quarter of this year 
shares available for trading decline for two major reasons 
companies may buy back shares if funds are available and they feel 
the shares are a bargain and corporate mergers and acquisitions 
often substitute debt for equity 
since 1983 more than 500 billion of us equities have 
disappeared from the stock market thats the net amount after 
accounting for new stock issues brought onto the market the 
decline may continue for many months more 
but merger mania may have run its course the common denominator 
of merged companies is a debt burden that becomes heavier during 
economic downturns such as now many companies have learned a 
painful lesson 
conceivably there could even be a reversal in the trend with 
privately held companies companies that had been removed from the 
market through leveraged buyouts once again seeking to sell 
shares to the public 
meanwhile the narrowed universe of investment possibilities 
resulting from institutional indexing and from the substitution of 
debt for equities may be cushioning the decline in the popular 
stock averages

one doctor stopped eating in his hospitals dining 
room when he finally tired of hearing other physicians brag about 
their fat incomes megabuck retirement funds and money money 
money 
another remembers a colleagues shock at learning her salary 
how could she be happy when her pay more than comfortable by most 
americans standards seemed so low 
money it seems is becoming an obsession for many in medicine 
doctors long have made lucrative livings but huge fees 
especially for surgery and hightech procedures have turned 
medical pay into a subject of intense fascination both for those 
who pull down skyhigh incomes and those who are jealous of the 
doctors who do 
greediness is becoming more and more an issue said dr 
michael v buenaflor of northampton penn guys are a lot more 
cynical and are turning to the american way of go for it 
but in the medical world at least money does not always buy 
happiness many doctors say they are fed up with their profession 
they complain of secondguessing insurance companies burdensome 
paperwork miserly medicare fees high malpractice rates and the 
constant fear of being sued among other things 
some argue that practicing medicine has become so unsatisfying 
that many are bent on making sure the work is financially 
rewarding even if its no longer fun 
and rewarding it is the latest statistics show that monetarily 
at least doctors are doing very well indeed their pay is going up 
far faster than almost everyone elses last year according to a 
survey their net income rose 125 percent almost triple the rate 
of inflation 
the survey conducted among 6484 doctors by the magazine 
medical economics found that the median net income of all us 
doctors rose almost 15000 in 1989 to 133000 
among other figures from the survey 
annual incomes ranged from 87000 for general practitioners 
to 296000 for cardiovascular surgeons 
one in five cardiovascular surgeons makes more than 600000 
annually 
the typical obstetricians pay soared 36000 last year more 
than any other specialty 
only 6 percent of doctors make less than 50000 a year 
many doctors contend they studied hard and put in long hours 
they deserve to make a good living they say 
when you consider that we work a 60some hour week that we 
put 12 years of training in and we owe 50 grand when we start on 
average i dont think anybody is robbing the bank said dr 
philip r alper an internist in burlingame calif 
we dont make an excessive wage he said i dont have an 
apology to make 
some in fact fear they are falling behind 
nobody feels bad for physicians we do make a good living 
said dr craig czarsty a family practitioner and doctors son in 
oakville conn but is my earning power the same as my fathers 
was 20 years ago probably not 
specialists are particularly well off but they contend they 
deserve to make more than other people including doctors in 
general care their work is often tedious and exacting they say 
and requires technical skills that take many years to perfect 
dr thomas purdon of the university of arizona health science 
center notes the special pressures faced by his colleagues in 
obstetrics and gynecology whose earnings the magazine survey pegs 
at 194000 
besides the many hours seeing women through their pregnancies 
labor and early motherhood there is a real possibility that each 
is a potential courtroom opponent 
the public expects an absolutely perfect product and doesnt 
want to recognize that there can be genetic problems and other 
things that the obstetrician has no control over said purdon 
if things dont turn out just aok the first thing they do is 
try to find a lawyer to sue him 
yet an undercurrent of feeling remains both inside and outside 
the profession that some doctors are just plain money hungry a 
survey conducted last year for the american medical association 
found that twothirds of americans think doctors are too interested 
in making money 
some of the criticism even comes from the wellpaid specialties 
dr peter s czachor of kittery maine notesthat when he retired 
five years ago he was charging 700 for complete obstetrical care 
now doctors in his area are charging 2000 for the same thing and 
their malpractice rates are the same 
those complaining loudest about physician avarice often are 
doctors in the lowerpaying primary care specialties 
buenaflor is the doctor who grew weary of dining room talk of 
physicians financial conquests the final straw for him was an 
ear nose and throat specialist who said hed finished the year 
with an extra 160000 that he couldnt figure out how to spend 
buenaflor is a family practitioner traditionally the 
lowestpaid medical specialty last year according to the 
magazine survey they netted an average 97000 
often when these doctors on the front lines of medical care 
talk about money the conversation turns to specialists in more 
technical fields 
im going to be in my office 12 hours today buenaflor said 
i will net less than a colorectal guy across town will do for a 
20minute colonoscopy a routine diagnostic procedure 
dr lorilee smith a rheumatologist in modesto calif said she 
believes the financial attitudes of many young doctors who set up 
practice in the 1980s simply reflect the decades fixation on 
money she was struck by a conversation with a young dermatologist 
who moved into her building 
after she had been here for a while i told her what i made 
she was shocked she said but you seem so happy compared to 
dermatologists im making povertylevel wages even though i make 
great money smith said 
insurers have long paid high fees for technical procedures and 
operations and much less for the hours that primary care doctors 
spend figuring out which of these treatments their patients need 
but that will change at least a little 
beginning in 1992 medicare will reimburse doctors more for 
their time managing and evaluating patients and less for technical 
services and operations private insurance companies are expected 
to make similar changes 
this will raise the pay for family doctors and lower it for many 
surgeons and radiologists while the changes will narrow the 
spread it certainly will not eliminate it doctors who deliver 
babies will still make considerably more than say the 
pediatricians who care for them later is the pay of such 
specialists as obstetricians fair 
whats fair payment asks dr john graham an official of 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 
he offers a sports analogy to bolster his pointis joe montana

black african nations still 
call for sanctions to punish south africa for apartheid but the 
pretoria government says every one takes part in rapidly growing 
trade with the whiteled country 
black africa has consistently been one of south africas 
harshest critics and one of its steadiest partners buying food 
mining equipment guns and luxury goods such as designer clothes 
and mercedesbenz cars to keep their economies afloat 
president fw de klerks political reforms combined with 
rising economic desperation in much of the continent have helped 
south african exporters reach african markets heretofore closed 
the star newspaper of johannesburg reported recently that south 
african businesses now maintain warehouses in the ivory coast 
togo zaire and rwanda to export goods throughout the continent 
the south african government also funds more than 100 
development projects in 15 african countries ranging from 
cattleraising in equatorial guinea to training midwives in the 
comoros islands 
markets that were closed yesterday are open today said 
martin smith of the south african foreign trade office a private 
consulting firm 
smith said his company meets up to 10 businessmen a week from 
african countries who are seeking possible deals with south africa 
the 51nation organization of african unity in july made its 
annual call for sanctions against south africa to protest 
apartheid 
but while egyptian president hosni mubarak the oaus outgoing 
leader presided over the meeting businessmen from his country 
were visiting south africa in search of deals 
only 13 oau members officially acknowledge trading with south 
africa but in practice every member does according to rusty 
evans deputy director general of the department of foreign 
affairs 
political obstacles arent going to stop trade said sally 
gallagher head of the consulting firm business development africa 
if someone has the products available and someone has the money 
to pay then the goods will be sold 
south africas total trade with africa exceeded 3 billion in 
1987 according to evans 
the figure was less than 10 percent of the trade conducted that 
year by south africa which has the most powerful and diversified 
economy on the continent its leading trade partners are western 
europe the united states japan taiwan and other asian nations 
southern african countries trade openly with south africa and 
say it would be economic suicide to cut business ties as a protest 
against the apartheid system of racial segregation 
but the south african government refuses to divulge specific 
figures on its african trade saying it does not want to embarrass 
those who prefer to conduct business secretly 
several factors favor south africas effort to improve business 
diplomatic and cultural links with africa 
de klerks reforms and stated intention of ending apartheid 
have dramatically improved the countrys international image 
though antiapartheid groups have successfully lobbied for the 
maintenance of virtually all existing sanctions 
most african economies performed miserably during the 1980s and 
no major improvements are forecast for the 1990s south africa is 
the closest and cheapest source of goods particularly manufactured 
items 
there is widespread belief that western investment and aid will 
increasingly be diverted toward newly democratic eastern europe and 
away from africa south africa says it wants to help fill the gap 
though its resources are limited and its economy in mild recession 
south africa must persuade its neighbors by its actions that 
it is not intent on their destruction said evans we have to 
persuade our neighbors that we are partners in the interest of 
development 
the inability of african countries to pay in hard currency and 
not political barriers is the biggest obstacle to increased trade 
ms gallagher said the trade has always been unbalanced south 
africa imports only a fraction of what it sells to the rest of the 
continent she added 
one unlikely example of growing business contacts is angola two 
private south african charter airlines have been delivering freight 
there and mineral and energy affairs minister dawie de villiers 
held exploratory trade talks recently with angolan president jose 
eduard dos santos 
just two years ago south african troops were fighting alongside 
rebels battling dos santos marxist government but the two 
countries signed a regional peace treaty in december 1988 and 
angola now looks to south africa to help rebuild an economy 
devastated by a 15yearold civil war that continues 
since de klerk came to power last year he has traveled to five 
african nations and met several more african leaders in march when 
south africa granted independence to namibia the territory it 
ruled for 75 years 
but open governmenttogovernment contacts remain the exception 
south afica has full diplomatic relations with only one african 
nation malawi and trade offices in at least eight countries from 
botswana to zimbabwe

ali hussain goes to school by 
candlelight he works all day punching holes in tin for toy 
harmonicas and daylight has faded before he gets to his books 
electricity is in short supply 
so are schools until six years ago tikea para one of the 
poorest areas in a city notorious for its slums had no elementary 
school 
the predominantly moslem residents took matters into their own 
hands chipping in manpower and a few rupees today 400 children 
go to a oneroom school built run and taught by people from the 
neighborhood 
another 80 child laborers go to night class not always winning 
the struggle to stay awake ali 8 says he earns 184 a week 
this is a very backward area these are poor people and there 
are too many child workers said sekander khan secretary of the 
residents committee 
we cant stop child labor khan said if we cant give 
them an education they will be like this all their lives 
the residents of tikea para have gone farther than most to 
collectively help themselves in a city incapable of coping with its 
population explosion 
in the last 50 years waves of migrants from bangladesh and from 
indian villages have swollen calcuttas population to 12 million 
an estimated 43 percent live in slums or bustees uncounted 
thousands camp on the street 
tikea para is a bustee of about 100000 people in howrah a 
municipality across the hooghly river from calcuttas business 
district 
the slum dwellers were galvanized into community action when a 
woman in the neighborhood was raped by a gang of hoodlums running 
an illegal liquor store khan said with police help they cleaned 
out the area fenced off their bustee and took a hard look at their 
childrens future 
the school began in 1984 with 20 children sitting on the dirt in 
the neighborhood courtyard they applied for municipal help but 
were told other education projects had higher priority khan said 
now kids in tidy uniforms attend classes taught by young 
unemployed university graduates from the neighborhood they sit on 
wooden benches jostling papers on their laps because they have no 
desks 
the school operates two daytime shifts with two grades sitting 
in the same room each shift a row of sewing machines occupies the 
back 
the courtyard has been taken over by a homemade merrygoround 
with wooden horses 
twice weekly a volunteer doctor from a nearby germansponsored 
clinic visits the bustee receiving patients in a tiny back room of 
the school 
tikea para has about 70 small factories worked mostly by 
children as young as 5 the most recent estimates say india had 
166 million child laborers in 1986 
the bustees of calcutta and howrah mark the decline of a 
oncegreat city some call it the lowest form of urban life 
until 1912 calcutta was the capital of india the second 
city of the british empire after london its gracious gothic 
buildings green lawns wide boulevards and exclusive clubs 
provided the backdrop for a lifestyle that symbolized the peak of 
the colonial age 
the victorianstyle buildings are eroding under an assault of 
grime and neglect shantytowns have sprung up in the open spaces of 
welltodo areas 
howrah is a warren of celllike shacks separated by open sewers 
but inside the shacks the stone floors are spotlessly clean 
residents bathe openly partially dressed under water pumps 
which kids usually turn into a game 
hunger is rife ragdraped people can be seen picking through 
mounds of garbage for scraps of food competing with mangy dogs 
crows and cattle 
it was here that mother teresa a frail catholic nun became 
known as the saint of the gutters for giving dying homeless 
people a bed succor and dignity in their last hours 
but the 800000 people of howrah show a surprising resilience 
and acceptance in the face of crushing poverty and hunger 
people are not unhappy here especially the children said 
helgo meyerhamme a west german doctor on a sixweek volunteer 
stint in the clinic 
in germany people are rich live in nice houses and have 
plenty to eat but they are not happy here the children laugh all 
the time they can play with anything even a little piece of paper 
can be a toy we can learn from these people said meyerhamme 
the doctors say most of their patients suffer from hunger and 
hygienerelated diseases worms tuberculosis skin diseases and 
respiratory illness leprosy is common 
these people have nothing to look forward to concluded 
meyerhammes colleague bettina borgmann but the people 
surprised me most seem quite happy

ken burns sprinted up a gettysburg slope in 
the footsteps of gen picketts screaming confederates and burst 
into tears after climbing the hilltop wall that was the highwater 
mark of the confederacy 
he mourned the deaths of friends ranging from abraham 
lincoln to ordinary soldiers who dropped on battlefields 125 years 
ago and he was kept awake by the deafening sounds and vivid images 
of americans killing americans 
after 5 years of work the awardwinning filmmaker is bringing 
the sights sounds words and emotions of the civil war into 
millions of living rooms in a landmark public television 
miniseries 
weve made a film that has attempted to tell the whole story 
and acknowledge that it is as dramatic as hollywood or anyone could 
dream up burns said the civil war an 11hour documentary 
will be broadcast on five nights beginning sunday 
the boyishlooking 37yearold said emotions are the key to his 
work and to seeing the war in which 620000 americans died in a 
new light 
we were constantly made aware of how poignant this story was 
how tragic it was he said in his hilltop editing studio in 
southwestern new hampshire the depth and profundity of that 
emotion is what affected me more than anything else 
burns tapped the emotions by peering into the innermost thoughts 
of his subjects from presidents lincoln and jefferson davis to 
ordinary soldiers who died in the mud their diaries and letters to 
loved ones are the script 
we get to know two dozen people so intimately that we had to 
take one of the final half hours of the film to consider their 
fates he said 
to have met this man abraham lincoln and gotten to know him 
i consider one of the great honors of my life to have met robert 
e lee and ulysses s grant and countless minor soldiers who could 
write and speak and fight and kill and die has been the 
greatest thing 
burns traversed the country seeking information for 
authenticity he filmed at battlefields on the anniversaries of the 
fighting 
at times he had to stop 
i would dream so vividly about the battles that it was too 
much he said 
at gettysburg where lee brought his army as far north as it 
would get and where george pickett led his doomed charge emotions 
overcame him 
i ran the last several hundred yards of picketts charge and 
went up and over the wall and burst into tears with the sense of 
this being the most important moment he said 
burns hopes his series will strip away the gallant bloodless 
myth of the civil war and show that television can entertain and 
inform at the same time 
his cinematography brings still photographs alive dragging 
viewers along as frightened soldiers feel their way forward looking 
for the enemy in gettsyburg and antietam battle scenes his 
zooming cutting and panning move viewers through a kaleidoscope of 
sights toward victory death or panicked retreat 
burns studied and recorded sounds of the birds and insects the 
soldiers would have heard and just how it sounded when 200 cannons 
fired at the same time 
if the images are powerful the words cut even more deeply 
rather than use actors as most documentary filmmakers do burns 
uses only their voices 
here is part of a soldiers letter home after the second battle 
of bull run sunday a soldier in company a died and was buried 
everything went on as if nothing had happened for death is so 
common that little sentiment is wasted it is not like death at 
home 
history has long been a fascination for burns in his filmmaking 
his first two documentaries the brooklyn bridge 1981 and 
statue of liberty 1985 were both nominated for academy 
awards the brooklyn bridge and 1985s huey long won the 
eric barnouw prize for historical films 
the american film festival awarded its blue ribbon to the 
statue of liberty thomas hart benton 1988 the brooklyn 
bridge and 1984s the shakers hands to work hearts to god 
burns who studied at hampshire college in amherst mass also 
did the documentary the congress 
the filmmaker is overwhelmed that pbs for the first time is 
pitting a miniseries against the commercial networks new fall 
shows the decision is more remarkable because television 
essentially abandoned documentaries 20 years ago he said 
the commitment to a lengthy and complex primetime documentary 
is particularly rewarding when much of television has been reduced 
to 30second glimpses and rock videos 
we have to first admit that television is where our children 
are getting most of their information he said if you lament 
this and merely abdicate it to those who promote its baser 
instincts weve lost the battle 
the battle metaphor is no accident 
we are in the front lines attempting to remind people that 
television can be used in an honorable as well as entertaining and 
nutritional way and thats what this series is burns said

robert rhodes never knew his 
greatgrandfather elisha hunt rhodes but listened intently when 
his father told stories about their ancestors civil war exploits 
this month the rest of the country will hear about those 
exploits in words the rhode island volunteer wrote from the 
battlefields 
rhodes is one of the main characters of the pbs miniseries 
the civil war which will be broadcast beginning sunday 
filmmaker ken burns searched all over the country for photos and 
accounts of the fighting and found a gem not more than a mile from 
his southwestern new hampshire home it was a collection of rhodes 
letters and diary entries compiled by robert rhodes a college 
librarian who had inherited them in the mid1960s 
here in my own home town was this soldier who could epitomize 
the northern grunt the struggle of the ordinary man burns 
said 
rhodes enlisted as a private at age 19 after the first shots at 
fort sumter he was mustered out in 1865 as a colonel after 
witnessing major battles and the surrender at appomattox 
he learned to be a soldier in providence 
we drilled all day and night he wrote in 1861 standing 
before a long mirror i put in many hours of weary work and soon 
thought myself quite a soldier i was elected first sergeant much 
to my surprise just what a first sergeants duties might be i had 
no idea 
rhodes said the film brings his greatgrandfather to life 
it put him more in the context of his times which was good 
for me he said i think we are the product of our times and i 
had to overcome that some of his remarks might be called racist 
now 
he said his dad told stories of visiting elisha as a youngster 
and hearing stories about johnny mud a union soldier whom 
rhodes believes was elisha himself they were bogged down in the 
mud quite a lot 
rhodes noted that his family tree would have stopped growing in 
the civil war if elisha hadnt survived 
it shows how one person can make quite a difference hundreds 
of peoples lives were affected and thats just family members 
well never know who he may have shot whose other families he may 
have changed 
rhodes said his ancestor made no direct mention of killing 
anyone he would just say we had lot of bad dirty work to do 
today and we did it 
when writing of hardship he often said he didnt mind because 
it was all for the union which is also the title of the 
published collection 
elisha hunt rhodes returned to providence after the war where 
he held a number of veterans and community posts and was even 
urged to run for governor he was an internal revenue service 
official from 1875 to 1885 and the citys tax assessor in 1887 
he also was a member of the school board and an official of the 
central baptist church where there is a stained glass window in 
his memory he died in 1917 at age 75

when annie honeycutt became a foster mother to 
two retarded brothers she knew it would be an allconsuming job 
but she also knew it carried a bonus freedom 
when ruth bell turned her baking talents into a business she 
realized it would be a dawntodusk sevenday work week but it 
too had a longterm reward an easier life 
two different paths the same destination these detroit women 
hunger for selfsufficiency to be free of the stigma and shame of 
welfare theyre among the thousands of people on public aid 
nationwide experimenting with new ways to escape their 
skinoftheteeth lives some are becoming entrepreneurs others 
students a few even are opting for motherhood again 
theres a welfare revolution going on said richard nathan 
director of the rockefeller institute of government at the state 
university of new york the question is how far will it go 
every state is doing something 
in michigan former welfare mothers are paid to be foster 
mothers to disabled children in iowa the onceunemployed now are 
selfemployed in one indiana county mentors advise those on 
the public dole in ohio some teen parents earn money for 
attending school and in wisconsin some poor families lose money 
if their kids dont 
were trying to change the signals and services and mindset 
so that the welfare bureaucracy cares more and does more for 
people to make it on their own instead of just paying them 
money said nathan do you give people fish or do you teach 
them to fish now what were trying to do is teach people to 
fish 
most of the ventures arent traditional workfare programs 
trading government welfare checks for jobs many emphasize 
counseling and training theres also a bigger push for education 
a california program makes reading and math instruction mandatory 
for example for people on public aid found to lack those skills 
part of the impetus is the family support act a 33 billion 
federal initiative passed in 1988 and touted as the biggest welfare 
reform in 50 years states are required to have programs in place 
by october to prepare public aid recipients for work and help them 
get jobs 
about 38 million families or about 11 million people 
twothirds under the age of 18 received 175 billion in aid to 
families of dependent children benefits in 1989 experts say 
some already have made the transition from welfare check to 
paycheck in a most unusual way 
in michigan 12 women who once lived off afdc now earn 18000 
to 21500 a year as foster mothers to hardtoplace disabled 
children in the life or living in family environments program 
its a winwin situation said program director diane 
devineabdullah it empowers them it raises their selfesteem 
it gives them a meaning in life they didnt have before theyre 
not only helping themselves but theyre helping a child 
thats the case for annie honeycutt 34 and fletcher an 
epileptic retarded 6yearold who already had lived in five 
places no one wanted the little boy who was so angry he tried to 
choke people so aggressive he was tied down with restraints and 
so destructive he ripped apart furniture 
when he first came fletcher was a monster said miss 
honeycutt no more hes calmer and happier with the woman he calls 
mama he also has been united with his retardedepileptic 
brother rico 3 who recently joined the family 
as a foster mother miss honeycutt has more responsibility but 
more independence too 
i never liked the sense of somebody giving you something for 
nothing im working for what i get said the mother of four 
welfareturnedfoster mother beverly street knows the feeling 
raising two retarded teens kevin 17 now reads and counts quite 
a feat considering that three years ago he pulled the toilet from 
the floor and knocked holes in the wall michelle 15 can now feed 
herself 
mrs street feels better about herself noting that living off 
handouts sent the wrong signals to her two other children 
how in the world can you as a parent tell your children 
finish your education i want you to make something out of 
yourself when youre out hustling food stamps she asks its 
a mockery 
though this seemingly odd pairing has drawn inquiries from 27 
states its not a likely largescale solution for shrinking 
welfare rolls 
but another partnership that could encompass more people 
recently began in montgomery county ind a mentor system 
matching welfare recipients with community members 
keith weedman who heads the county welfare department said 
some people get stuck on welfare because they dont see the 
possibility of success 
by being engaged with people who see the world differently 
its a stimulation weedman said each gets to be more tolerant 
and accepting of the other 
mentors range from factory workers to corporate executives and 
crawfordsville ind mayor philip michal who says so many 
people on welfare lose hope they need a friend they need somebody 
in the system to care thats what this does 
other new projects focus on teen parents those at high risk of 
becoming trapped in the welfare quagmire one study found that at 
any time half the afdc recipients were longtermers 
in ohio leap learning earning and parenting program offers 
child care transportation and 62 a month extra for teenage 
parents who return to or stay in school and have good attendance 
theyve become parents at a very young age said ellen 
seusy who coordinates research for the program their earning 
power is zero 
in wisconsin the controversial learnfare program reduces family 
benefits if their children play hooky 
though a judge in july partially suspended the program citing 
recordkeeping errors the state plans to make changes believing 
learnfare offers hope for breaking the generational welfare cycle 
not so said dennis fengier whose family has been repeatedly 
sanctioned 
youre picking on poor people he said how are you 
helping families by taking money from them 
another welfare experiment has the jobless bring in money by 
creating their own jobs 
minnesota mississippi iowa michigan and maryland have small 
entrepreneur projects in which welfare recipients receive benefits 
past the point where money earned from their businesses would make 
them ineligible the checks continue for a year after they reach 
that point under a federal waiver that allows them to try to become 
selfsufficient 
critics argue this approach is too costly too limited and too 
risky starting a business is tough enough for those with jobs 
they say but proponents argue that welfare ironically is a good 
training school 
welfare recipients can be more enterprising than some people 
in business the way they have to wheel and deal their resources 
said sheila das of the corporation for enterprise development 
coordinator of the programs

more than 100 businesses have been started including 
restaurants repair and cleaning services and caterers and 
dozens more are ready to go 
though aspiring entrepreneurs receive training develop business 
plans and sometimes are helped with loans obstacles remain 
when ruth bell tried to buy equipment for her detroit bakery 
chuggas one store demanded full payment in advance another 
accused her of doing something illegal 
what people think about the system burns me up said ms 
bell 42 whos too embarrassed to tell her three children she 
receives welfare they think were all ignorant sons of guns 
they dont think we want to go anywhere or do anything 
and sometimes discouragement comes from a surprising source 
when they try to break out theyve got family and friends 
saying you cant do this what makes you think you can said 
cheri huber who runs the iowa program 
experts say its too early to gauge success or the impact on the 
welfare rolls 
nobody has really tried many of these things before we really 
dont know how theyre going to work said fred doolittle of the 
manpower demonstration research corporation which is evaluating 
some programs very few people think its going to eliminate the 
public welfare system entirely 
but ruth bell is confident shell make the break 
last year she started by peddling her homemade bread to one 
store now she helps cater luncheons and has more than 100 
customers buying her pies and breads she hopes to move soon from 
her basement to a rented store 
i have come a long way she said im on the road to 
success

its an experiment in education that offers 
promise for the poor or punishment and pain 
learnfare the only statewide program in the nation that ties 
benefits of welfare families to their teens school attendance has 
been praised panned and put to a court test leading to a partial 
ban 
though learnfare has a simple focus keeping kids in school 
it stirs thorny debate about some hotbutton issues the role of 
government the responsibility of parents the rights of the poor 
learnfare allows the state of wisconsin to cut a familys 
monthly aid to families of dependent children check if a teenager 
has more than two unexcused absences a month a mother of two for 
instance can lose 77 of her 517 monthly check and sometimes 
more 
learnfares boosters including gov tommy thompson say this 
cornerstone of wisconsins welfare reform package is the first step 
toward cracking the cycle of poverty 
the goal is to get these teenagers back in school so they 
wont need welfare in the future said diane waller director of 
the office of welfare reform without a high school education 
their chance to ever be selfsupporting as adults is very 
limited 
us health and human services secretary louis sullivan has 
praised the programs goals his agency has approved wisconsins 
request to expand it to younger children but the state says there 
will be no monetary penalties 
the state has plenty of success stories the truant who kicked 
drugs returned to school and graduated teen mothers who write the 
governor saying they now have a future for their children hundreds 
of dropouts in alternative programs all courtesy of learnfare 
if we can stop this cycle when they are younger and give them 
careers they wont have this terrible situation by the time 
theyre 36 and grandmothers still trying to pursue their 
education said kathy harrellpatterson head of an alternative 
school for teen parents attending because of learnfare 
but opponents including church and community groups and 
parents say learnfare penalizes those living a meager 
checktocheck existence 
we have families whove been evicted because of this said 
pat delessio attorney for legal action of wisconsin which has 
represented about 300 families sanctioned they cant buy 
clothing for their kids they run out of food they have to go to 
food pantries 
beyond that some claim it just doesnt work 
some kids are bigheaded about welfare they say i dont 
care if my mother gets cut off or not said pamela cooper 17 
who contends her familys benefits were cut when she was 
legitimately ill some people got kids who just wont listen 
they just wont go to school 
others complain it smacks of discrimination 
what are they doing to keep the children not on welfare in 
school not a damn thing said dennis fengier whose family has 
been repeatedly sanctioned because of what he says are 
recordkeeping errors 
his wife geneals assessment learnfare they dont learn 
and its not fair she said 
the fengiers are among six milwaukee families named as 
plaintiffs in a classaction suit contending the learnfare program 
violates constitutional rights 
in a july decision stemming from the suit us district judge 
terence t evans ordered learnfare suspended in milwaukee county 
citing administrative errors while its goals are worthy he said 
welfare families should not be made homeless and hungry in the 
name of social experimentation 
however evans also said he would lift the ban if changes were 
made to improve the system monitoring absences in milwaukees 
public schools where the board has opposed the program 
about 48 percent of 27000 students ages 13 to 19 subject to 
learnfare live in milwaukee county some threefourths of the 
penalties have been imposed there 
in june a state audit found significant weaknesses in the 
way learnfare is run citing paperwork errors causing some people 
to be unfairly penalized 
some have branded learnfare an administrative nightmare but 
state proponents insist it works well everywhere but in milwaukee 
county 
the people can argue about how many and what percent but 
learnfare is getting kids back in school said miss waller 
theres no question about it

graffiti bridge paisley park prince 
 
prince is back lets haul out the adjectives thrilling 
audacious breathtaking frustrating aggravating they all apply 
in fact they all apply to the first 17 songs on graffiti 
bridge setting this albums tone cant stop this feeling i 
got is a unique combination of 50s rock and 90s funk that 
immediately indicates prince is taking this project seriously but 
just when you expect the song to kick into overdrive comes an 
annoying slow break ushered in with the prophetic words pardon 
me for living but this is my world you cant make me change 
ok were willing to accept prince on his own terms he hears 
things others dont tries things others wont when he succeeds 
it opens the endless possibilities of music that retread workers 
such as mc hammer cant even comprehend 
thats part of what made batman so disappointing for prince 
fans it was paintbynumbers funk seemingly written in princes 
sleep the preceding lovesexy may have been an ungodly mess 
but at least he was trying 
graffiti bridge is a comeback because prince indulges 
himself while still worrying about public taste and the exciting 
moments simply outnumber the boring 
lets catalog some of the successes shake is an updated 
trashy rocker from the 60s with a huge beat love machine 
sizzles with morris day and elisas sexy dialogue the stately 
voice of mavis staples combines deliciously with princes 
playfulness on melody cool 
round and round sung by the youthful tevin campbell is a 
mesmerizing piece of funky reggae graffiti bridge is a ballad 
that compares favorably with purple rain 
prince is usually a doityourself musician but he benefits 
here from collaborations particularly with his minneapolis cohorts 
in the time who are at the top of their game 
the 68minute disc is not without its disappointments we can 
funk the fascinating collaboration with george clinton comes 
out sounding better in theory than in practice elephants and 
flowers and tick tick bang are unwelcome selfindulgences 
lyrically theres hardly a memorable moment here its a 
testament to princes musical ability that he can maintain interest 
despite this handicap the cosmic sexandspirituality dichotomy is 
showing frays around the edges 
and by the way what the heck is graffiti bridge guess 
well have to wait for the movie

sitting pretty new world john mcglinn conductor 
 
john mcglinn has built a career out of resurrecting broadway 
musical comedy treasures of the past the conductor and musical 
archivist has had his greatest success with a complete recording of 
show boat a monumental effort that will be the definitive 
version of the musical for years to come 
now he has tackled sitting pretty an almost unknown jerome 
kern musical that the composer wrote in 1924 three years before 
show boat much of the score was missing for years turning up 
only eight years ago in a secaucus nj warehouse and while 
sitting pretty isnt the groundbreaking masterpiece show 
boat is the musical deserves the attention and love mcglinn has 
lavished on it 
the musicals book by guy bolton is sweet silly and 
irresistible so are the lyrics by pg wodehouse the plot 
involves orphans twins no less new jersey millionaires 
neerdowell nephews show girls con men and of course mixedup 
romances 
and kerns music is breathtakingly melodic ranging from 
touching romantic duets to toetapping comedy and dance songs much 
of the score and its all here in more than 100 minutes of 
playing time is rooted in the conventions of the time still you 
can hear the composer trying to break out of the straitjacket of 
1920s musical comedy 
instead of stringing together musical numbers from the show for 
the overture kern composed what mcglinn calls a symphonic 
poem the overture is a musical train ride complete with 
whistle bell and the sound of a steam engine coming to a halt it 
mirrors a train trip that takes place between the first and second 
acts of the musical 
listen to the heros lament there isnt one girl and you 
can hear whispers of the blues that found their way into show 
boat or the simple yet affecting a year from today 
prefiguring such kern standards as ive told every little star 
and the last time i saw paris 
the cast is headed by young mostly unknown musical theater 
performers including judy blazer davis gaines paige ohara and 
jason graae they carry the majority of the score and all are 
superb singers 
mcglinn and substantially the same cast performed sitting 
pretty in concert last year at carnegie hall this year he did 
kerns the cat and the fiddle there lets hope it too makes 
its way into the recording studio

standard time vol 3 the resolution of romance columbia 
records wynton marsalis 
 
wynton marsalis blew with technical virtuosity as a 19yearold 
trumpet player making his recording debut in 1982 form dominated 
soul and it was unclear where the long road ahead would lead 
through nearly a decade of playing and learning marsalis has 
sacrificed none of his technical prowess while adding life to his 
horn 
the evolution of marsalis soul to date can be found on his 
latest album a collection of 20 standards in marsalis earlier 
playing the smoky 3 am half light of the blues was an image 
here it is real phrasing and tone suggest light and shadow as 
marsalis explores the heart of the music 
it is no accident that this exploration is so successful given 
that marsalis father ellis is on piano to help guide his 
talented son marsalis the elder is at the heart of this record 
tutoring his young master in the fine art of subtlety the lesson 
seems well learned

texas tornados reprise texas tornados 
 
african rhythms are terrific and the brazilian beat is burning 
hot but you could travel the world over and never find a more 
enticing sound than the one blowing in through americas own back 
door the texasmexico border 
and no one does texmex better than the texas tornados a 
genuine supergroup featuring freddy fender flaco jimenez augie 
meyers and doug sahm 
hearing fenders plaintive tremolo on the hearbreak ballad if 
thats what youre thinking is just one of the many pleasures of 
this 10song collection 
another is the bouncy vox organ of augie meyers whose stylings 
on the instrument were the signature of the sir douglas quintet a 
1960s band founded by meyers and sahm that produced the hits 
shes about a mover and mendocino 
accordionist flaco jimenez is perhaps the worlds bestknown 
player of the mexican polka and waltz music called conjunto 
sahm whose broad musical vocabulary encompasses all these 
genres stands solidly at the center of the texas tornados he 
plays a variety of instruments on the record and sings lead on more 
than half the songs 
sahm never hits a false note whether hes whooping it up on the 
cajunflavored who were you thinking ofor playing the part of 
an unrequited lover on she never spoke spanish to me 
texas tornados is one of those rare albums without as bad 
song its being played mostly on country stations but with a 
little wider exposure these gracefully aging sons of the southwest 
could cut a broad path into the mainstream

paul klee mortally ill knew that the end was near 
but he was determined to finish his work 
durchhalten keep going he penciled under a drawing he did 
three months before his death an exclamation mark was added the 
drawing portraying a contorted figure reflects the tenacious mood 
of the artist who had a prodigious ability to translate emotions 
into pictorial language 
fifty years after the genius of abstract art succumbed at least 
seven european museums have mounted commemorative exhibitions but 
the show at the kunstmuseum of his native bern is likely to remain 
unique 
it took the organizers two years to assemble virtually all the 
work klee completed in the last few months before he died june 29 
1940 aged 60 
he had been on what he once termed the tragic path since 
1936 when he learned that he was suffering from scleroderma a 
rare often fatal disease affecting the mucuous membranes 
that path was marked by an intensified pace in the work of the 
artist who was never idle in a career spanning four decades he 
produced some 9000 paintings waterolors and drawings 
the pace appeared to be fastest in 1940 the year of his death 
attesting to it is a catalog meticulously kept by klee himself in 
typical thoroughness it lists a total of 366 works finished in 4 
months on view at bern are 328 
many of the works are from the collections of his son felix an 
art historian who died three days before the exhibition opened aug 
17 and from the bernbased paulkleefoundation the exhibition 
runs through nov 4 
but almost 100 exhibits were assembled from museums and private 
collectors in the united states japan and europe klee foundation 
curator josef helfenstein who organized the show said only 10 
works could not be sent to bern being too fragile 
one drawing was destroyed in a fire 15 years ago in the united 
states and 27 could not be located despite intensive research 
according to helfenstein 
plenty of sheets of drawings have pointed the way and said 
the time has come klee wrote early in 1940 sensing the nearness 
of death the title of one tod und feuer death and fire 
seems to have foreshadowed his cremation sick man in a boat 
and rowing desperately are others suggesting death was the 
dominating theme 
but helfenstein says the show disproves the widely held belief 
that the thought of approaching death is reflected throughout his 
final oeuvre 
in many aspects this latest period is representative for his 
entire work he said 
to stress his point helfenstein notes that the last number on 
klees personal list is yellow house ii a rather mysterious 
than tragic motif cheerfully colored 
helfenstein says it is hardly a coincidence that klee whose 
symbolism is a main feature of many of his compositions completed 
exactly 366 works the curator notes that 1940 was a leap year with 
366 days 
klee must have supposed that in a figurative sense this was 
his leap year too he wrote in the catalog 
on may 11 1940 klee left bern for a sanitarium in southern 
switzerland where his condition suddenly worsened he never again 
touched his brushes and crayons 
i cannot be grasped in this world said a passage in his 
diary a few months before he died for i am as much at home with 
the dead as with those beings who are not yet born these words 
were later inscribed on the stone marking his grave at berns 
schosshalde cemetary 
there is no record of it but the final weeks of his life must 
have been also depressing because of the german blitzkrieg defeat 
of france 
klee of germanswiss parentage had left his fathers country 
in disgust when the nazis took over in 1933 the new leadership of 
germany where he had spent most of his career and where he had 
risen to international fame declared his works degenerate 
although most sources list him as a swiss swiss authorities 
never granted klee citizenship

one of the most popular songs on college 
radio stations these days is a partly fond partly unsentimental 
look back at youth from a man whos feeling his age 
the ironic success of we dont do that anymore hasnt 
slipped by david slutes coauthor of the song and singer in the 
arizonabased rock band sidewinders slutes is 27 years old 
if anything they shouldnt relate to that at all he said 
all the classic rock stations should be playing it for the older 
people 
we dont do that anymore is a hard rocking take on aging a 
subject rock n roll hasnt treated with particular grace in the 
past both in song and in real life 
its a tale of a group of college friends who stay up all night 
and drink wine with nothing but dreams and things on our mind 
advance a few years later to preoccupations with jobs and rent and 
its clear from the songs title those days are past for slutes and 
his friends 
you look back and say my god i miss those times he 
said but you also look back and say thank god im not doing 
those same things 
the tempered idealism of the song is an apt metaphor for the 
sidewinders own career slutes richard hopkins mark perrodin and 
bruce halper realized a dream when rca signed them to a majorlabel 
contract but theyre finding theres a lot of hard work and no 
guarantees involved in becoming a rock n roll success story 
that work recently involved networking at the new music seminar 
in new york city and their fourth appearance at a converted 
hamburger stand turned rock club in albany thousands of miles from 
home 
veterans of the punk rock scene in tucson ariz the 
sidewinders are trying to make it as a hardedged traditional rock 
band disdaining the heavy metal scene and the studied weirdness 
of many college radio favorites musician magazine described them 
as an unholy cross between rem and husker du 
sidewinders arent doing their own growing up in the obscurity 
that characterizes many similar bands 
the band put out its first album by itself and expected several 
other years of recording on independent labels before anyone in the 
big leagues noticed them slutes said instead rca signed them 
after seeing the band at a showcase in austin texas 
auntie ramos pool hall named after an place near where the 
band rehearses back home is the sidewinders second rca album 
were growing as songwriters and players with every album 
slutes said lyrically for me im writing a lot better im 
learning how to explain things better to music and mark is writing 
better music 
the brutally brief saras not sober is about impatience 
directed toward a drunken friend slutes charitably describes 
sara as a composite of several people he knows 
with we dont do that anymore slutes said he had to walk 
the fine line between making the song maudlin or a joke 
it comes about as close to any song weve done to life he 
said as you get older your priorities change its something i 
live with everyday 
the band produced auntie ramos pool hall themselves 
although rca recently pressured them to hire a manager and make the 
next record with an outside producer slutes said 
the company said look you guys you have to grow up youre 
not an indie independent band anymore he said 
but slutes appears to have picked up on the type of work bands 
have to do offstage to get ahead he quickly recites the call 
letters of local radio stations that have been playing we dont 
do that anymore he was following a recent interview with dinner 
hosted by an albany college radio station 
you look at radio and it seems its gone from being 
songoriented to being soundoriented having a certain production 
quality he said you dont seem to hear real songs anymore and 
were a real songoriented band 
that sounds kind of preachy but there are a lot of great 
bands out there that have good songs that you dont hear on the 
radio because they dont have the right sound we havent had a 
producer yet so we havent gotten our radio ear yet or whatever 
you need 
while hopkins jokes about sidewinders plans for world 
domination the band seems content with gradual career 
advancement 
were really happy especially at the college level with how 
weve been received slutes said we seem to have gotten a 
decent fan base now that so when we go to a town we have a certain 
number of people waiting to see us

author dani shapiro does not keep a box for old 
rejection slips there are none to fill it with her first 
published novel was the first one she ever wrote 
its not supposed to happen that way she should have attempted 
to write six or seven novels supported herself by moonlighting as 
a bank clerk or editing at a publishing house and finally made it 
around age 40 
instead shapiro is just 25 and wrote playing with fire 
doubleday 1795 in a small room at the dakota in manhattan one 
of the citys most exclusive apartment houses whose residents 
include yoko ono carly simon and lauren bacall 
you knock on wood a lot shapiro said but in some ways i 
feel like ive paid my dues i have written for many many years 
ive just never tried to get anything published thats one of the 
great ironies 
playing with fire a comingofage story set in the east 
quickly became a mystery for doubleday press releases state the 
publishers couldnt decide whether the novel was commercial or 
literary 
shapiro worked on it like any other fiction writer starting 
with characters based on real people and gradually using more of 
her imagination but the packaging is as slick as any fashion 
magazine 
a models seductive stare and bare leg are visible on the front 
and a carefully coiffed shapiro is on the back her blond hair 
layered rather than straight and brushed back as she appears in 
person 
what do you think is that picture going to end up in spy 
magazine or what laughed shapiro looking at a copy of the book 
i think that is part of selling the book she added 
theres a funny story with this book theres a picture on the 
spine of the book that shows the models whole body that was 
originally the front i was really grateful they changed it because 
she looked like me 
in some circles commercial can mean derogatory in other 
circles it can mean it sells a lot of books i just knew that if 
this got published i would be the happiest girl in the world 
forever 
shapiros real life is a mix of the literary and the commercial 
or commercials born in new york city and raised in an orthodox 
jewish household she had tried short stories in high school but 
was too scared to let anyone see them she attended sarah lawrence 
college hoping to develop her writing skills but became an actress 
instead 
i met this friend of my family who was a commercial 
producer she recalled i did start doing commercials the 
kind of things you need to do to get in the actors union i kind 
of fell into it the years i was acting i thought that i wanted to 
do serious work but i didnt have a facility 
shapiros credits included spots for candy bars soda a board 
game and gasoline not exactly the iowa writers workshop kirk 
douglas may be able to write novels but shapiro insists acting is 
the worst kind of preparation for being an author 
theyre opposites she said a friend of mine said that 
writers write because they dont want to be heard saying what they 
say the method of acting i was studying had everything to do with 
the person with their history plotting out their life 
its very autobiographical while as a writer you try to get 
further away from your own life 
shapiro got back to writing and eventually showed some of her 
work to an agent esther newberg who got her a deal at doubleday 
the book was sold in february 1989 film rights have been acquired 
by a pair of independent producers and shapiro revied it over 
the summer 
playing with fire is narrated by lucy greenberg the only 
child of a prominent new york city family she attends smith 
college and rooms with the beautiful and mysterious carolyn ward 
they soon begin a passionate affair which becomes even more 
complicated when lucy starts seeing carolyns wealthy stepfather 
shapiro changed the novel considerably with each draft taking 
characters once based on herself and friends and adding details she 
would have never wished or imagined otherwise 
doubleday never said do this or do that we would sit at 
breakfast and talk for hours about the characters and id go home 
and work on them she explained wed have all these corporate 
breakfasts and talk about lucy and carolyn and people would be 
really interested 
playing with fire was a comingofage experience for shapiro 
as well writing the book aged her five years she says and 
publicizing it added five more shes now at work on a second 
novel quickly gathering material for a box that will someday be 
filled with evidence of dues even the luckiest writer has to pay

the new book aint nothin as sweet as my 
baby contains a picture of country singer jett williams at the 
age of 2 playing a toy guitar 
it is a telling photograph because jett grew up to discover 
that she was the daughter of country music legend hank williams 
that fascinated me when i knew that hank williams was my 
father to think back on how i always played guitar and always 
sang she says it made me feel really good as if it was 
something he left me 
jett williams tells her story in the book how she was adopted 
first by hank williams mother and after her death by a mobile 
ala couple named deupree who tell her that hank might be her 
father but theres no proof and nothing can be done 
jett launches a search and learns that shes the daughter of 
bobbie jett and hank williams in the last five years she has been 
through many courts theres big money involved but jett says that 
finding her roots not money was paramount her legal name is 
cathy deupree adkinson her stage name combines the last names of 
her parents 
don helms and jerry rivers longtime members of hank williams 
band the drifting cowboys have embraced her so far this year 
jett and the drifting cowboys band have played some 40 dates i 
really love it she says of her traditional country show im 
having the time of my life 
the hardest thing in her search jett said was discovering that 
her mother had died i had put so much stock in that she was 
going to be able to answer all my questions it was also 
difficult to accept that her mother voluntarily gave her up 
the best thing about williams search she says was meeting 
keith adkinson the washington lawyer who took her case and is now 
her second husband he calls her bj because documents that he 
found read in re the matter of baby jett he manages her 
career and practices law with jett law taking the largest 
share of his time 
also wonderful was finding the prebirth contract and finding 
out that hank williams was my father and that he wanted me she 
said in an interview it was a wonderful emotional cushion for me 
to land on 
on oct 15 1952 bobbie jett and hank williams signed a 
threepage notarized document which said that he would give her a 
plane ticket to california within a month after she gave birth and 
he would pay hospital and doctor bills and support their child who 
would live with his mother for two years then live with him 
i think it tells a lot about my father as a human being he 
loved me before i was born he took me sight unseen to me its the 
greatest compliment a father could give a child hank williams 
died jan 1 1953 five days before his daughter was born 
in 1985 hank williams jr sued in alabama and jett williams 
sued in federal court in new york over williams estate in 1987 
the lower court in alabama said hank williams jr was sole heir to 
the estate of hank williams who died without a will and jett 
williams was named a child of hank williams in 1989 the supreme 
court of alabama ruled that jett had been the victim of fraud by 
people who tried to keep her from finding out her parentage and 
said she can share in the estate 
still to come is a trial in new york regarding copywright of 
williams songs will his two children and second wife share song 
royalties equally or will the widow get half and the children get a 
quarter each and from what year shall the daughter start collecting 
her share 
among williams some 150 songs are your cheatin heart 
hey good lookin jambalaya settin the woods on fire 
and im so lonesome i could cry his daughters favorite 
yet to be decided in alabama is how jett williams shares in

ibm and microsoft corp say their relationship 
has never been better as they sought to quiet talk that a rift was 
developing between the computer hardware and software giants 
millions of personal computer users worldwide use machines 
designed to ibm and microsoft standards 
ibm today reaffirmed its relatioship with microsoft the 
computer company said monday 
microsoft chairman bill gates said in a separate statement 
microsoft and ibm have played a key role in the development of 
the pc industry and we will continue to cooperate to provide the 
best operating system solutions to our customers 
talk that ibm and microsoft were at odds has peppered trade 
journals in recent weeks 
in an interview steve ballmer a microsoft vice president 
disputed reports that the two companies had stopped working 
together on new versions of operating systems the base layer of 
software that controls a computers internal functions 
but the companies announced they would divide responsibility for 
developing new versions of two operating systems os2 used on 
ibms personal system2 computers and dos the operating system 
for ibms older personal computers and many brands of 
ibmcompatible machines 
previously each company worked separately on developing new 
versions of os2 and dos under the new arrangement ibm will have 
primary responsibility for developing os2 while microsoft will 
have the primary role in improving dos william bluestein an 
analyst at forrester research inc in cambridge mass interpreted 
that as an admission the two companies had gone separate ways 
it basically is a form of divorce he said what really is 
being fought over is who controls the industry who controls the 
direction 
by controling the development of operating systems and the 
timing of their release microsoft could influence sales of ibm 
computers while ibm could affect sales of the applications 
software microsoft makes analysts say 
but aaron goldberg an analyst at international data corp said 
he believed the explanation by ibm and microsoft that they only 
wanted to improve the development process for operating systems 
they have agreed to split the load a little better he said 
microsoft doesnt have all the resources to chase every product 
this to me is a perfect case in where our comptuer industry 
trade press is trying to find a fire where there is no smoke he 
added 
as part of the new arrangement microsoft will have the main 
responsibility for developing a version of os2 for computers whose 
central processor uses a technology called reducedinstructionset 
computing or risc which primarily is used in powerful desktop 
workstations bluestein called that a bone ibm threw microsoft 
os2 was jointly announced by ibm and microsoft in 1987 as their 
answer to the easeofuse of apple computer incs popular 
macintosh 
but the operating system has been slow to catch on in part 
because it cant be used with applications software such as 
spreadsheets designed for dos it also is limited because it must 
be used on machines that have a certain memory capacity more than 
many older computers have 
additionally microsoft has been heavily promoting a software 
product called windows that provides much of the macintoshs 
features on a dosequipped machine 
ibm also said monday that it would license the windows software 
from microsoft however ibm did not say whether it would provide 
the feature with their machines 
last fall to dispel similar rumors of a rift ibm and microsoft 
jointly announced their strategy for os2 and windows they said 
windows was aimed at lesspowerful computers using dos and os2 
was designed for machines with greater memory 
but ibm has said it is developing a version of os2 for older 
computers that have less memory 
that decision caused some industrywatchers to question its 
support of windows analysts also say windows poses a threat to 
os2 since it gies owners of older machines less incentive to 
upgrade to models that could use os2

winning a lottery jackpot such as floridas 
1065 million bonanza drawing can be a sweet dream but for the 
average person the temptations and mysteries of newfound wealth 
can become a nightmare 
the advice from most financial experts after all the hoopla dies 
down is simple take things real slow 
preserving your capital is the first thing youve got to do 
youll have plenty of time to invest it david mclaughlin a 
financial adviser with chase investment counsel in charlottseville 
va said monday you must make sure your money is safe and 
earning something 
such is the problem for at least half a dozen florida 
lottery players six tickets matched the winning numbers drawn on 
saturday in the florida lottery estimated at 1065 million a 
state record and the second largest in us history behind 
pennsylvanias 115 million jackpot last year each florida ticket 
is worth about 1775 million over 20 years or 887500 annually 
before taxes 
many investment counselors suggest that for the first couple of 
years lottery winners or anyone with a sudden windfall for that 
matter keep a portion of their loot in liquid assets such as 
certificates of deposit or treasury bills until they can figure 
out what they want to do with it 
some banks such as northern trust co in chicago even offer 
special accounts for clients who suddenly have 1 million or more 
and need a place to park it 
the rest can go into longerterm bonds including taxfree 
municipal issues or growth stocks experts say 
for mclaughlin the mix would be divided equally among treasury 
bills treasury notes or bonds and stocks for the first few years 
of course a very small portion may be splurged he said 
charles clough the chief investment strategist for merrill 
lynch amp co would recommend that 45 percent of the winnings go 
into intermediate and longterm bonds 10 to 15 percent in cash 
or 90day tbills and 40 to 45 percent in stocks 
but stay away from stocks of companies that depend on 
cyclical consumer spending he warned 
state lottery officials often dont provide financial advice to 
winners except to sometimes explain tax liabilities and urge 
winners to hire a good accountant those who fail to take such 
advice run the risk of falling prey to peddlers of bogus 
investments 
but among the biggest problems most lottery recipients will face 
is having to sift through all the solicitations from various 
financial brokers 
theyre going to be getting a lot of calls said mclaughlin 
who recommends winners get an unlisted telephone number for 
starters 
there will be a lot of pressure added michael naste an 
independent financial planner from deland fla and a 25 million 
lottery winner himself if theyre not careful they can easily 
overextend themselves 
such was the case of a young new york beautician who won 7 
million about five years ago said naste who says he has 73 
lottery winners as clients 
before the young woman came to him for help he said she had 
made several poor investments like putting her money into strip 
shopping centers 
shes half a million dollars in debt right now and 
shell barely come out ahead even after receiving all her 
lottery payments naste said she had quit her job and now shes 
gone back to work 
a middleaged construction worker who won 4 million in the new 
york lottery four years ago also ran into probolems said naste 
after receiving a check for around 148000 the first of his 
20 annual aftertax installments he quit his 38000ayear job 
threw a party and put 10000 down on each of 10 new cadillacs he 
said 
but in the next eight months six of the luxury cars were 
repossessed and the man had to borrow 200000 to hold him over 
between lottery checks naste said 
most biglottery winners though are fairly conservative 
financial advisers and state lottery officials say 
michigan for example found in a 1987 survey that nearly three 
quarters of its 1 millionplus lottery winners had sought expert 
financial advice 
the majority used their first check to pay bills or splurge on a 
new home or car but later most made longterm investments saved 
for retirement or established trust funds the survey showed

the labor department says it is examining 
whether banks that hold securities for pension funds are getting 
proxy ballots to the funds managers in a timely fashion 
assistant labor secretary david george ball said the department 
also will examine whether the proxies absentee ballots for 
shareholders are being delivered to the person responsible at a 
fund for voting them 
shareholders are entitled to a say in the running of a company 
through their vote at annual shareholders meetings proxy ballots 
are sent to those not attending a meeting in person 
like political democracy for corporate democracy to work 
well persons entitled to vote need to be able to get relevant 
information in a timely fashion and to receive their ballots in 
time to cast them ball told a meeting in washington of the 
united shareholders association on monday 
the association is a grassroots organization founded by texas 
oilman t boone pickens in 1986 to fight for shareholder rights 
the group has sponsored numerous proposals at the annual meetings 
of large corporations 
ball said the labor departments office of enforcement will be 
contacting a small sampling of bank trustees to see how they handle 
proxies for pension funds 
he added that if past experience is any indicator i would 
expect that the fact that we are making these inquiries will lead 
to an internal review of procedures by bank trustees to assure 
compliance with the law 
after his speech ball explained that the labor department was 
focusing on banks because banks are the custodians of the large 
pension plans 
he said department statistics show that 90 percent of the 
assets representing 85 percent of plan participants are 
concentrated in just 6 percent of the nations pension plans 
ball said the review to be completed by years end will screen 
200 or 300 banks 
itll be the big ones the ones that are likely to have the 
custodianship of pension plans he said 
the labor department maintains that those who invest the money 
of pension funds have an obligation to manage the assets so they 
retain or increase in value that includes carefully voting their 
proxies 
therefore a fiduciary would be derelict in his or her duty if 
he or she did not vote plan shares on matters which might affect 
the value of shares ball said in his speech

federal regulators are avoiding a potentially 
chaotic standoff by compromising in a dispute over the most 
important soundness standard for financial institutions 
comptroller of the currency robert l clarke announced monday 
that he was backing down in his contentious feud with other banking 
agencies over how much capital banks must hold as a cushion against 
losses 
clarke had pushed for a slightly more lenient standard if he 
had stuck to his position the nations banks would have faced the 
confusing prospect of having different standards apply to different 
institutions depending on which agency served as primary 
regulator 
the comptroller oversees about 4000 nationally chartered banks 
including the nations largest institutions while the fdic 
supervises about 8000 statechartered banks 
the federal reserve regulates some of the state and federal 
banks already overseen by the other two agencies if the 
institutions are members of its system 
capital representing the investment of a banks owners is the 
basic yardstick for measuring a financial institutions soundness 
the more capital a bank has the more losses it can absorb without 
failing and requiring money from the federal deposit insurance 
fund 
meanwhile the house on monday put aside its normal order of 
business and by voice vote adopted legislation removing the legal 
ceiling on insurance premiums levied on banks and savings 
institutions by the federal deposit insurance corp 
the senate is expected to begin considering the measure next 
week congressional leaders the bush administration and the fdic 
are supporting passage before congress adjourns early next month 
starting next year banks will have to pass a twopart capital 
test on a riskadjusted basis they will be required to hold 
capital equivalent to 725 percent of their asses after 1992 
that will rise to 8 percent 
the riskadjusted capital offers institutions a break for 
holding lowrisk investments such as home mortgages and government 
securities regulators have agreed on that part for months 
however they have been feuding over the socalled leverage 
ratio which represents the smallest amount of capital a bank may 
hold no matter how safe its investments 
fdic chairman l william seidman had been pushing for a 45 
percent minimum while clarke wanted 3 percent seidman argued that 
clarkes proposal would lower capital for 90 percent of the nations 
banks and would permit the industrys capital to shrink by 8 
billion 
he said that was the wrong move in the wake of the savings and 
loan crisis one of the causes of that debacle was lax standards 
which allowed sampl owners to operate their institutions with little 
of their own money at risk 
clarke had argued that setting the leverage ratio too high would 
negate the beneficial effects of the riskbased standard designed 
to nudge banks into safer assets 
the federal reserve in a compromise adopted last month said 
only the strongest banks about one in five would be permitted a 
3 percent minimum others would have a minimum ranging between 4 
percent and 5 percent the fdic is scheduled to pass the compromise 
at a board meeting today the new guideline would become effective 
jan 1 
meanwhile the office of thrift supervision which regulates 
savings and loans announced it would tighten its rules to conform 
with the new commercial bank guidelines currently its core 
capital requirement analogous to the leverage ratio is 3 percent

two credit rating services have lowered their 
assessments of sears roebuck and cos ability to repay its debt 
jerry buldak spokesman for chicagobased sears said monday 
that the giant retailer doesnt comment on ratings adjustments 
in new york moodys investors service lowered sears longterm 
debt rating from a1 to a2 while duff amp phelps inc of chicago 
downgraded the companys senior debt from aaminus to aplus 
also lowered were some debt ratings for sears subsidiaries 
including discover credit corp sears roebuck acceptance corp 
sears overseas finance and allstate insurance co 
the rating actions are based upon moodys opinion that 
improvement within the intensely competitive merchandising sector 
has not been nor will be achieved as quickly as originally 
anticipated moodys said in a statement monday 
duff amp phelps said its rating changes will affect about 28 
billion dollars of debt securities 
the reason for the downgrades is the continued subpar 
performance of the merchandising group duff amp phelps said 
monday 
in july sears reported a 39 percent drop in secondquarter 
profits blaming high insurance payouts and a decline in retailing

ncr corp said today it would become the first 
computer maker to offer an entire product line from laptop 
computers to giant mainframes based on intel corp microprocessors 
and standardized software 
using the same type of microprocessors the chips that are 
the brains of computers would make the entire line compatible 
meaning a laptop computer could get at information stored on a 
mainframe 
the computer lines of most major makers are divided between 
proprietary or companyspecific processing systems and open 
systems such as those based on intel chips the differences mean 
various computers sold by the same company often are incompatible 
the industry has moved toward open systems in recent years as 
companies want to use the same applications software such as 
spreadsheets or word processing programs on all computers no 
matter what the brand in addition computer users increasingly 
want to connect machines in networks which can be troublesome with 
incompatible models 
ncr though not a major player in generalpurpose computers 
could reap major rewards from its new direction said analysts 
you cant write these guys off as a nonfactor anymore said 
don young of the investment firm sanford c bernstein amp co i 
think its a pretty bold move on their part 
ncr said it eventually would provide computers in seven 
levels or performance and size ranges today it announced six 
machines in three of those levels including workstations and 
servers powerful computers that link networks of lesspowerful 
machines the models released today cost 10000 to 800000 
the higherend models of the new line derive their power by 
linking multiple intel microprocessors in a technique called 
parallel processing ncr says it will power the giant mainframes at 
the top of the line by hooking together thousands of the same chips 
that run tiny laptop computers 
dayton ohiobased ncr long has specialized in computers for 
banks and retail stores and is a major maker of cash registers and 
automated teller machines in recent years it has enjoyed success 
with a line of personal computers built to industry standards using 
intel chips 
it now plans to phase out its old computers and use those 
standards and intel chips on its entire product line 
ncr would become the first company to sell highend mainframe 
computers based on open systems analysts said the models would be 
ncrs entry into the market for extremely powerful computers 
the new strategy will potentially open up their rather narrow 
market into a broad market said rick martin an analyst at 
prudentialbache securities inc the question is can they be one 
of the major players the answer is you just dont know 
in coming weeks ncr also is expected to announce software and 
networking systems that will allow the new computer line to be 
connected throughout a company martin said 
ncrs new direction would be another boon to intel the santa 
clara calif chip company that is enjoying phenomenal success 
its chips are so popular with computer makers that it cant make 
enough to satisfy demand 
but the news could be troubling to motorola inc which makes 
the chips used in some ncr computers ncrs move signals the 
increasing dominanace of intels chips in computers already 
intel chips are the dominant processors in desktop machines 
motorolas microcomputer business is headed for some tough 
times young said 
ncr sells less than 5 billion worth of computers a year out of 
a global market of 200 billion he said by comparison 
international business machines corp the industry leader has 
sales of about 60 billion 
earlier this month ibm announced a new generation of mainframe 
computers based on a proprietary standard ibm also said it plans 
to provide systems that would allow the mainframe computer to 
coordinate corporatewide computing networks 
next month unisys corp the no 3 computer maker also is 
expected to announce products for connecting computers throughout a 
company

the bush administrations demand to slash the capital gains tax for 
the breakdown of budget talks just two weeks from the start of the 
new fiscal year 
but president bush asked if capital gains was the stumbling 
block told reporters not as far as im concerned bush said 
he talked with his budget negotiators today and were going back 
were staying with it i cant really predict whats going to 
happen 
the problem is the insistence of the administration to reduce 
the capital gains tax house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
told reporters 
the real difficulty and the major obstable to agreement is the 
tax issue said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
the rest would come together quickly 
participants said they still hoped to try to work out a budget 
deal but it was unclear how quickly they could do so 
congressional leaders planned to meet in the capitol today with top 
administration officials to discuss the impasse 
its not total gridlock said foley 
asked whether he was optimistic bush said everybody involved 
agrees weve come quite a ways but its not done by a long 
shot 
republicans insisted that there were other important differences 
between the two sides over spending cuts but democrats insisted 
these were relatively minor democrats harped on their oftrepeated 
theme that a capital gains tax cut which republicans say would 
spur the economy would simply cut taxes for the wealthy 
its not quite an impasse but its pretty close to one 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said after the talks 
ended 
at this point weve reached an impasse said another 
bargainer sen phil gramm rtexas 
todays session in the capitol took on a sense of heightened 
urgency on oct 1 the start of fiscal 1991 the grammrudman 
law will slash the 12 trillion budget by about 100 billion 
unless a deficitcutting deal is in place a cut that deep would 
violently disrupt government services 
the breakdown of the talks at andrews represented a major 
disappointment to budget bargainers who initially hoped that three 
or four days of meetings at the airfield would solve the fiscal 
standoff that has lingered all year 
but after meetings scheduled during varying intervals since 
sept 7 neither dole nor gramm would rule out an eventual budget 
pact but neither could suggest how it could happen 
its going to be tough but its still not impossible and no 
one is giving up said dole the problem is were running out 
of time 
the most profound gap between the two sides was over president 
bushs insistence that the package include a cut in the capital 
gains tax rate the tax is levied on sales of property supporters 
say the reduction would invigorate the economy by spurring sales 
democratic leaders have long insisted that the idea would be a 
windfall for the wealthy who own most property they have said 
they would only accept a capital gains tax cut if other taxes on 
the rich were boosted in their final offer monday the democrats 
demanded that the capital gains rate remain unchanged 
the only way you can say were at an impasse is if you know 
you wont back off from the capital gains demand said a 
democratic official involved in the talks who asked to not be 
identified 
republicans complained that there were other important 
disagreements as well democrats wanted to rely on higher energy 
taxes for about 49 billion during the next five years seven times 
the amount republicans sought 
the gop offered to cut pentagon spending over the next five 
years by 170 billion below the amount needed to stay even with 
inflation democrats said their reduction would be close to that 
figure but offered to lock in cuts for only the first two years 
10 billion next year and 232 billion the following year 
republicans wanted to hold domestic programs to the rate of 
inflation over the next five years democrats wanted to increase 
that amount by 5 billion 
for benefit programs like medicare and farm price supports one 
of the fastest growing parts of the federal budget republicans 
wanted to reduce growth by 1233 billion through 1995 the 
proposed democratic cut was less deep to the tune of 27 billion 
the two sides also never reached agreement on how to control 
spending in future years for example they continued to clash over 
whether and how the grammrudman balancedbudget law should be 
extended beyond its scheduled 1993 expiration 
despite those differences the two sides had moved closer in a 
number of areas 
for example they had tentatively agreed to about 59 billion in 
tax increases said one official who demanded anonymity these 
included higher levies on beer wine spirits tobacco and luxury 
items such as fancy cars private boats and planes electronic 
equipment furs and jewelry 
they also agreed that about 25 billion in firstyear savings 
would come from new taxes and fees democrats wanted 130 billion 
in new taxes and fees over five years republicans 1381 billion 
and although the two sides still differed over the size of 
spending cuts the gap between them in each area was dramatically 
smaller than it was when the bargaining at andrews began 
without action next years federal deficit is expected to be a 
record 250 billion or more

the new york post trumpeted yes one day 
after its front page had asked will the presses ever run 
again 
the affirmation in todays editions of the saucy tabloid came 
after newspaper guild members voted 24245 monday night to accept a 
fourday work week which will mean a 20 percent pay cut 
publisher peter s kalikow had threatened to close the nations 
oldest continuously running daily immediately if the 350 guild 
members news advertising and clerical workers rejected the 
concessions the paper is losing 27 million a year 
today speaking in his office kalikow praised the unions for 
accepting his conditions and predicted a bright future for the 
paper the post should begin turning a profit next month he said 
of the three tabloids in new york youre now standing in the 
only profitable one kalikow told reporters at a news conference 
you feel like the executioner has loosened the noose said 
jill brooke a post tv and radio reporter who voted for approval 
but we still have a life sentence a 20 percent pay cut 
nearly 1000 people would have lost their jobs had the 
505000circulation paper known for dishing up stories of sex 
murder and mayhem under screaming headlines had gone under 
lets go to press kalikow said after the vote this is 
not a management victory it is not a labor victory it is a 
victory for all new yorkers who deserve the honesty and diversity 
offered in the pages of the new york post 
the guild was the last of 11 unions to approve concessions 
designed to help kalikow break even he is said to have lost more 
than 100 million personally since buying the paper from media 
baron rupert murdoch in 1988 two years ago kalikow won 24 
million in concessions as a condition of the purchase 
mondays vote was taken by hand after a 90minute meeting 
punctuated by boos applause and speeches for and against the 
proposal there was some blood on the floor said reporter 
kieran crowley 
reporter peter moses voted for the pay cut despite reservations 
we accepted a package that none of us liked we accepted a 
package that made no sense to any of us and we accepted a package 
that makes us less than middle class he said 
before the pay cut top salary for reporters was 853 a week 
kalikow promised the unions 20 percent of company stock and a 
representative on the board of directors in exchange he got 19 
million in union concessions and 8 million in other cost 
reductions including management wage cuts 
sentiment swung in favor of the concessions when kalikow also 
said employees could approve the plan then resign by wednesday and 
receive the same severance and termination pay as if the paper had 
shut down 
theodore kheel an adviser to the unions said kalikow also 
dropped his demand that 43 jobs be eliminated instead he will 
settle for how ever many resignations he gets kheel said 
a diversity of editorial voices is important in a democratic 
society daily news publisher james hoge said in a statement 
congratulating the post 
that diversity may be diminished yet however a regional 
economic slump has hurt advertising revenue at all the citys 
papers newspaper analysts say that in the long haul there arent 
enough ads to keep all four major dailies alive 
the new york times is in the black but turning less of a profit 
than a year ago times spokesman william adler said the newspaper 
would seek some of the concessions the post got 
the daily news a tabloid like the post said it has a me 
too clause in contracts with its unions that entitles it to the 
concessions the post got talks at the moneylosing news have 
stalemated and unions are urging advertisers to boycott it 
new york newsday the citys third tabloid is losing money 
also but its profitable parent times mirror co is keeping the 
paper alive 
the post has a long history of money woes and owners with the 
deep pockets and the patience to take heavy losses its founder 
alexander hamilton was in debt in 1801 when he persuaded a group 
of merchants to finance the paper 
banking heiress dorothy schiff bought the post in 1939 turned 
it into one of the nations most liberal newspapers and brightened 
it up with a tabloid format it was losing money when she sold it 
to murdoch in 1976 
the posts fortunes seemed to have dimmed for good in the 1970s 
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs recently the slump 
has deepened as an economic decline in the new york city further 
cut advertising revenues 
murdoch transformed the post into a politically conservative 
paper albeit one that featured sexy pictures racy headlines 
like the famous headless body in topless bar and lots of 
crime stories 
in the past year the post ran such headlines like bastards 
over a photo of a hanged hostage and best sex i ever had 
accompanying a picture of a smirking donald trump 
murdoch said the paper lost 150 million before he sold it for 
37 million to kalikow a real estate developer 
post editor jerry nachman on monday likened the post to a 
bumblebee 
aerodynamically bumblebees ought not fly the ratio of their 
body weight to wingspan would make it physically impossible he 
said but they absolutely refuse to understand that so they fly 
thats the post 
and like the bumblebee he added we keep stinging 
people

president bushs urgent request for 19 
billion to help pay for the us military deployment in the middle 
east is running into trouble on capitol hill among lawmakers of 
both parties 
the biggest obstacle is a white house plan to forgive 67 
billion in debts egypt owes the united states for past military 
equipment purchases 
but lawmakers also are objecting to a proposal to set up a 
national defense gift fund to receive money from allies that 
then could be spent by the pentagon apparently without any control 
by congress 
rep william broomfield the senior republican on the house 
foreign affairs committee dealt th package a blow on monday when 
he announced his opposition to canceling egypts debt 
broomfield rmich said the debt forgiveness would prompt a 
wave of requests from countries that see it as a way to get more 
foreign aid as budget negotiators seek to cut the deficit 
i cant imagine a worse time for the administration to be 
recommending forgiveness on this debt he said in an interview 
asked to assess the proposals prospects on the house floor he 
said i would say it would go down the tubes in its present 
form 
israel poland and other countries already are lining up for 
similar treatment broomfield said in a statement on the house 
floor he added the simple fact is that america cant afford 
outright cancellation of egypts debt 
broomfields opposition came on the heels of skepticism by the 
democratic chairmen of the house and senate appropriations 
subcommittees that must approve the package sen patrick leahy of 
vermont and rep david obey of wisconsin 
obey said monday that new figures from the congressional budget 
office show the debt forgiveness would cost 24 billion in lost 
payments over the next five years in contrast to the 
administrations assertion that the move would have no budget 
impact 
other influential lawmakers including senate armed services 
committee chairman sam nunn dga have expressed wariness about 
seeking contributions from other countries to offset the cost of 
the persian gulf military mobilization 
they worry that the situation smacks of the mechanism used 
during the irancontra affair to insulate executive branch 
decisions and actions from congressional oversight 
ollie north would have absolutely loved it obey said of the 
administrations proposal to set up a new fund at the pentagon out 
of congress reach 
when bush sent his request to congress on friday the request to 
cancel egypts debt was linked to the supplemental money bill for 
operation desert shield a senior administration official speaking 
on condition of anonymity said the link was intended to improve 
the prospects for forgiving the debt which the white house knew 
would be unpopular so close to congressional elections 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger sought last week 
to persuade key lawmakers that egypts support in the gulf was 
crucial to us success according to participants in the 
discussions 
egypt has led the way in providing arab troops to the deployment 
in saudi arabia and has lobbied other arab states to isolate iraqs 
saddam hussein eagleburger pointed out 
broomfield said he welcomed those moves and added i am sure 
there are other ways america and other nations can help them 
alleviate some of the economic problems caused by this crisis 
perhaps the debt could be restructured or the united states 
could waive a requirement that all payments be up to date before a 
country can receive new foreign aid he said 
to forgive all the debt however would be a sign that we may 
have lost our senses broomfield said this comes at a time 
when our budget negotiators are figuring out ways to squeeze a few 
more tax dollars out of americas sales clerks and farmers and 
mechanics

iraqs invasion of kuwait sent energy prices 
spiraling pushing the cost of living up a steep 08 percent in 
august the government said today 
in a separate report the commerce department said the us 
merchandise trade deficit jumped a dramatic 75 percent to 933 
billion in july the month before the invasion analysts expect the 
deficit to climb further as the oil shock drives up imports 
the gain in the labor departments consumer price index was 
double the 04 percent rise in july and the largest since january 
when a severe cold snap pushed costs up 11 percent 
financial markets turned down in response to the double dose of 
bad economic news in the first 90 minutes of trading the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2377 points to 
254356 
i think well have two maybe three more months of high 
inflation numbers said economist mark zandi of regional 
financial associates in west chester pa 
the department attributed nearly half of the august increase to 
the oil shock excluding energy prices which jumped 43 percent 
consumer costs rose 04 percent 
the aug 2 invasion sent gasoline prices up 76 percent while 
fuel oil prices jumped 154 percent it was the steepest increase 
in those categories since january 
for the first eight months of 1990 prices rose at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 62 percent up sharply from the 46 
percent rise for all of 1989 
more bad news is coming over the next several months economists 
believe crude oil prices have continued to rise in september and 
will work their way through to the gasoline pump increases are 
also ahead for chemicals plastics and other petroleumbased 
products 
however many analysts believe economic growth is too slow and 
demand too weak to support a sustained inflation burst once oil 
prices stabilize 
in another report the labor department said americans 
inflationadjusted earnings fell a seasonally adjusted 06 percent 
in august earnings fell 05 percent in each of the two previous 
months 
a bright spot in the august report was a moderation in food 
price inflation food prices held back by a decline in fruit and 
vegetable prices rose 03 percent the smallest since may 
fresh fruit prices tumbled 4 percent but dairy costs rose 13 
percent prices in other food categories were up 
the cost of housing up 07 percent and transportation up 18 
percent were both driven by rising energy prices gasoline 
accounted for nearly 90 percent of the transportation rise the 
department said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in other categories medical care rose 09 percent in line with 
a long string of sharp increases tobacco was up only 03 percent 
after having risen more than 2 percent in both july and june and 
clothing and upkeep costs were up a slight 01 percent 
the various changes put the index for all consumer goods at 
1316 in august that means that a hypothetical selection of goods 
costing 100 in the 198284 base period cost 13160 in august up 
from 7 from a year earlier 
the recent combination of oilinduced inflation and slow 
economic growth has put monetary policymakers in a quandary the 
federal reserve normally pushes interest rates higher to fight 
inflation and lower to stimulate lagging growth

3275 per barrel in late morning trading dolan said november 
crude which was limited to a rise of 1 in mondays trading under 
the exchanges rules was catching up with the higher price of 
october contracts 
other crude futures were higher on near months and lower for 
distant months 
petroleum product futures were higher today 
unleaded gasoline was up 128 cents to 9295 cents per gallon on 
october contracts while home heating oil was up 239 cents to 
8770 cents per gallon on october contracts

approaching 
natural gas prices showed little change rising to 1540 per 
1000 cubic feet from 1537 on october contracts 
on monday crude oil hit its alltime intraday high on the 
mercantile exchange trading late in the day at 3375 per barrel 
on october contracts the previous high 3235 had stood since 
aug 2 1983 and was matched once since iraq invaded kuwait last

go after heading into uncharted territory amid the volatility of 
the persisting persian gulf crisis

general motors corp is free to close plants at 
will but will spend 42 billion to protect the income of employees 
affected by cutbacks under its new labor agreement a newspaper 
said today 
the tentative agreement covering 300000 workers in 29 states 
was reached early monday after 41 hours of nonstop talks between 
the united auto workers and the worlds biggest automaker 
this morning the 300member gm bargaining council met to 
discuss the contract the first step toward submitting the pact to 
the membership 
the meeting was closed but a summary of contract details given 
to group members included wage increases of 3 percent the first 
year and lumpsum payments equal to 3 percent of wages in the 
second and third years and increases in monthly pensions for 
workers with 30 years on the job from 1500 to 1800 
the summary also cited 42 billion in income guarantees and 
indicated that language curbing the companys right to close plants 
was eliminated the detroit free press reported today that the new 
provision in effect gives gm the right to close plants at will 
pete kelly president of local 160 at gms technical center in 
warren mich had some criticism for the settlement but said today 
that he expected it would be overwhelmingly approved 
i think for what general motors got the economic package was 
not sufficient kelly said 
under the pact gm will guarantee workers laid off for up to 12 
weeks in a year 95 percent of their wages by supplementing their 
unemployment benefits the newspaper said anyone laid off for more 
than 12 weeks will be guaranteed full pay for the duration of the 
contract the paper said 
many analysts say gm will have to close at least four assembly 
plants and lay off tens of thousands of people in an industry 
threatened by a sluggish economy and foreign competition 
if the bargaining council approves the agreement it will be put 
to a rankandfile vote to be completed by the end of the month 
were all starving for information over here said joe 
garcia financial secretary for local 645 in van nuys calif 
assembly workers earn 1527 an hor at gm and costofliving 
allowances that carry over from the previous contract would add 
215 an hour by 1993 if inflation runs at 5 percent a year the 
free press said 
the 1987 contract expired at midnight friday and negotiators 
worked under a daybyday extension through the weekend 
the unions contracts cover more than 450000 active workers at 
gm ford motor co and chrysler corp talks between the union and 
ford and chrysler have been on hold while the union concentrates on 
gm hoping to use the pact reached there as a pattern for 
agreements with the other automakers 
chrysler and ford said they would not comment on the uawgm 
agreement until it was ratified 
ford is dealing with a strike at its canadian plants by the 
canadian auto workers union that entered its fourth day today 
the principal issue in canada is money in the united states it

trading was suspended today at the chicago board 
of trade after an electrical problem knocked out power to most of 
the 40story downtown building officials said 
the power failure hit about two hours before the first trading 
of the day was scheduled to begin at 720 am cdt in financial 
contracts such as treasury bonds said frederick grede the 
exchanges vice president of administration 
most of the buildings electrical systems were knocked out of 
commission including electronic trading mechanisms phones and 
elevators grede said power also was out on the buildings fourth 
floor where the trading pits are located he said 
although few people were in the building initially employees 
and traders began arriving for work a short time later and scores 
of them waited in the lobby rather than attempting to climb the 
stairs to their offices he said 
no one was stuck in any of the elevators that stopped when the 
power went out grede said 
commonwealth edison co blamed the failure on a possible 
electrical cable malfunction and had restored power to all but 
three floors by 740 am said utility spokesman bill harrah 
trading began in financial contracts at 845 am more than an 
hour late but trading in agricultural contracts began on time at 
930 am 
the power failure was confined to the bot building which houses 
offices of the exchange and member firms harrah said 
there appears to have been a cable fault of one kind or 
another inside the building he said 
edison crews have done some switching around a damaged section 
of cable and were working on a transformer in an effort to 
restore power to the remaining three floors harrah said 
the power failure was the latest of several glitches that have 
hit the edison system this summer the previous problems affected 
several residential neighborhoods and knocked out power to 
thousands of residents

the unions at united airlines plan to meet with 
banks this week to discuss a new offer of as much as 392 billion 
for uniteds parent ual corp according to a published report 
today 
the wall street journal said the new offer the latest in a 
series of onagain offagain deals for one of the nations biggest 
airlines could amount to 175 a share to 180 a share or 382 
billion to 392 billion 
that would be well below the 201 a share or 438 billion 
offer from a labor group that uals board accepted last april that 
pact has been scuttled by the financial uncertainty created by the 
crisis in the middle east 
citing unidentified officials close to the proposed deal the 
newspaper said the new offer probably will include participation by 
a foreign airline 
the story said a logical possibility would be british airways 
plc which was a principal equity investor in a 300ashare 
labormanagement bid that collapsed last october 
the journal story said british air declined to comment and 
leaders of the buyout group declined to identify the foreign 
carriers they say have expressed interest in backing the new offer 
last week a united airlines workers group announced it was 
ending an agreement with an investment partnership to acquire ual 
in a filing friday with the securities and exchange commission 
the worker group united employee acquisition corp said it was 
still interested in acquiring the chicagobased airline however 
the disclosure ended an agreement between ueac and coniston 
partners in april to help ueac a company formed by uniteds 
unions acquire ual 
the wall street journal story said the unions have invited about 
two dozen banks to this weeks meeting where their financial 
advisers are expected to outline plans for a new offer consisting 
of cash and securities 
one individual familiar with the agenda the story said 
cautioned that plans for the new offer are still evolving and are 
subject to change 
it also noted that it was unclear how the ual board will greet a 
lower offer

computer pioneer steve jobs unveiled four 
new products today that he hopes will salvage his new company next 
computer inc 
the products included a more powerful colorscreen version of 
the next computer as well as an entrylevel under5000 model 
half the cost of the current machine 
jobs said the company already has received orders for more than 
15000 of the new products 
in addition lotus development corp creator of the popular 
123 spreadsheet announced a new spreadsheet for the next 
computer called lotus improv 
the product provides a new approach to spreadsheets by enabling 
users to click a mouse to view information the software designed 
specifically for the next computer uses plain english formulas 
many other software developers were expected to announce new 
applications programs for the next throughout the allday news 
conference 
the new products were designed to answer critics who say the 
next is too expensive too slow in need of a color monitor and 
lacking imaginative software that would give people a compelling 
reason to buy it 
the next machine was supposed to revolutionize personal 
computers much as did the apple computer invented by jobs and 
steve wozniak in 1976 and jobs later macintosh 
to store data the next uses a removable optical disc which 
provides far greater capacity than the magnetic floppy discs found 
on most personal computers it also can reproduce sharp graphics 
and has a builtin system that makes it easier for software 
developers to write new programs 
while next has been praised for these hightech innovations 
only several thousand of the machines have been sold and next has 
failed to generate great interest among breadandbutter corporate 
computer users analysts say 
businessland a computer store chain that signed an exclusive 
deal with next in march 1989 to sell its machines domestically to 
corporations had predicted sales would hit 100 million in the 
first year 
but international data corp a hightech research firm 
estimates that fewer than 7000 nexts were sold as of june 
at less than 5000 the price tag makes the new machines 
competitive with both the highend personal computers of apple 
computer inc and international business machines corp and the 
lowend workstations of companies like sun microsstems inc 
next which is privately held does not disclose its sales or 
finances 
despite its sluggish start no one is predicting nexts demise 
the company is heavily capitalized and one of its principal 
owners the japanese hightech company canon inc paid 100 
million for a onesixth share last year 
jobs founded next in 1985 after leaving apple in a dispute

a top american trade official said tuesday that 
the united states is ready to relax its demands for abolishing farm 
export subsidies a step that could help resolve a dispute 
threatening world trade talks 
us trade representative carla hills said that washington would 
propose reductions of up to 70 percent in domestic farm supports 
and import duties and more than 70 percent in export assistance 
the proposal is to be submitted to the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade which is sponsoring the latest round of trade 
liberalization talks the talks are to conclude early december 
the 105nation negotiations launched in uruguay four years ago 
are deadlocked because of disagreement between the united states 
and the european community over farm supports 
there also are significant differences on how to liberalize 
trade in textiles and over the scope of new rules to cover trade in 
services such as banking 
on textiles hills said that the united states was ready to 
accept that the existing system of protection should be phased out 
but she defended the us view that aviation should be exempt from 
a services agreement 
at the heart of the farm trade dispute is the ecs refusal to 
dismantle its system of export subsidies to help farmers compete on 
foreign markets the united states backed by farm exporting 
nations led by australia has until now insisted on a complete 
phaseout 
a text being used as the basis of negotiations in geneva 
provides for substantial progressive reductions in support 
with the greatest cuts in export subsidies 
hills said the us proposal would achieve the goal all 
proposals have to be submitted to gatt by october 15 
trade ministers are to meet in brussels for final talks in less 
than two months hills was in geneva with a delegation of top us 
businessmen on the first leg of a weeklong european trip 
she dismissed an ec proposal for overall reductions of 30 
percent as inadequate adding that the 12nation trading bloc 
wanted to use as abase year 1986 when levels of support were 
particularly high 
hills said the united states would compromise on a method of 
liberalizing trade in textiles if that pushes us further down the 
road toward an agreement 
third world textile exporters have argued that trade worth some 
177 billion annually should be liberalized by winding down an 
existing system under which import quotas are fixed in bilateral 
deals

soybean futures prices rose moderately tuesday on 
the chicago board of trade recovering most of the ground lost in 
the previous session amid talk of possible frost in the midwest 
early next week 
most corn futures also advanced but wheat futures retreated 
slightly 
victor lespinasse an assistant vice president for grain trading 
with dean witter reynolds inc said some private forecasters 
predicted frost in the midwest by monday fueling fears of damage 
to the slowly maturing soybean and corn crops 
a weekly government report on monday showed leaves dropping in 
22 percent of the soybean crop as of sunday compared with an 
average of 39 percent for that date 
thirtythree percent of the corn crop was in the mature stage as 
of sunday compared with the average pace of 61 percent according 
to the agriculture department report 
even before frost entered the forecasts traders were concerned 
that the current spate of cool rainy weather in the midwest would 
continue to slow crop development 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 1 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in september at 259 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 1 cents higher with september at 237 a bushel 
oats were cent to 1 cents higher with september at 110 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 7 cents higher with september at

the european community declared tuesday that the 
gulf crisis should not be allowed to derail an international 
freetrade accord due to be reached this december 
the message we wish to pass to everyone is that this crisis 
cannot have a protectionist response italys foreign trade 
minister renato ruggiero said 
the foreign trade ministers of the 12 ec members met to discuss 
the latest round of trade liberalization talks the talks is being 
held under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade 
the 105nation negotiations are blocked mainly because of 
disagreement between the united states and the ec over farm 
supports 
ec members fear that some countries will be reluctant to commit 
themselves to strict trade agreements when their economies are 
suffering from higher oil prices due to the crisis prompted by 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
to resolve the problem the ec ministers discussed providing 
greater access to the markets of industrialized countries for 
textiles a major product of the developing world 
certainly we are ready to move on access to our markets but 
on this question we need the cooperation of other industrialized 
countries ruggiero said he singled out the united states which 
he said had maintained too many barriers to textile imports 
ruggiero spoke on behalf of the 12 ministers since italy holds 
the presidency of the ec 
frans andriessen the vice president of the ec commission told 
reporters the willingness by the united states to move away from a 
system of global textile quotas had brought washington and the ec 
closer together on the issue 
under the system now in place the multifiber arrangement 
import quotas are fixed in bilateral deals the ec wants to 
dismantle the system gradually

in the fiercely competitive greeting card 
industry among friends is a grain of sand on a beach dominated by 
giants like hallmark cards american greetings and gibson 
greetings 
but the alternative card company which was formed two years ago 
by three women in this lake of the ozarks community in central 
missouri has set some lofty goals 
people say oh is your goal to have hallmark buy you out i 
say no our goal is to buy hallmark claudia parrish one of 
the companys founders said with a poker face 
she quickly breaks into a smile and laughs at the thought of the 
tiny anonymous firm gobbling up hallmark the industry leader 
which reportedly notched 125 billion in greeting card sales last 
year 
but parrish and her partners roxie kelly and shelly 
reevessmith are serious about carving their own niche in a market 
ruled by huge corporations 
in just a couple of years among friends has expanded from 
selling a few cards in local shops to marketing a line of 36 
alloccasion cards gift tags decorative bags and a 
cardorganizing notebook in 48 states japan and england the 
company is working to expand that line 
parrish the companys business manager says among friends 
tripled its sales in the past year and now has about 1300 
accounts she refused to disclose any figures 
we dont even want them to know we exist added 
reevessmith 
rudolf hokanson who tracks the greeting card industry for blunt 
ellis amp loewy in milwaukee said the company has one advantage 
alternative cards are the fastest growing segment of the industry 
its impossible to say whether among friends will survive 
hokanson said its a competitive field and there are a lot of 
quality players like with any business if they have a good 
management team and marketing people i think theyve got a 
chance 
the women say they are somewhat surprised at the companys 
limited success considering the mistakes they made in the early 
going 
we knew nothing about the greeting card industry kelly 
recalled we made some of the worst mistakes you can imagine but 
the cards sold anyway it was amazing how much people liked them 
the women say the company name was a natural because of their 
long friendships 
kelly 35 a former physical education teacher used to own a 
popular restaurant and a combination gourmet bakerygift shop at 
the lake she handles marketing duties and maintains contact with 
about 35 sales representatives 
parrish 49 was a hostess at the restaurant and a business 
partner in a cookbook kelly wrote and sold she keeps a close eye 
on the finances 
the artist reevessmith 24 was a student of kellys and later 
worked in her restaurant and bakery a longtime friend of the 
parrish family reevessmith also designed the cover of her 
friends cookbook 
kelly and parrish credit reevessmith a 1988 art graduate for 
much of among friends success 
reevessmith works with colored pencils and ink to design 
subjects that conjure up soothing pleasant feelings like a hat 
box an old clock a new england house thats the style i feel 
most comfortable with 
the result is detailed intimate cards featuring a soft 
watercolor appearance 
the message inside is often inspirational featuring classic 
poems or a verse the women came up with themselves some contain a 
favorite recipe like kellys blueberrypeachcinnamon muffins 
the women say that even though they work so closely together 
theyve managed to stay good friends 
we dont always agree but we respect each other for our 
individual talents and opinions kelly said we were friends 
before we were partners and we want it to stay that way

ual corp stock jumped tuesday on a report that 
unions might propose a new buyout offer for as much as 392 
billion once again prolonging the takeover maneuvering for the 
parent of united airlines 
the wall street journal said a union group seeking to acquire 
the company might propose buying it for 175 to 180 a share in 
cash and securities about 20 a share less than the groups 
earlier 438 billion offer that collapsed last month 
but the journal said it could include participation by british 
airways plc a financially powerful foreign airline that could make 
the takeover offer more feasible british airways had an equity 
stake in a 300ashare offer for ual that died last october 
partly because it heavily relied on debt financing 
officials at the unions united and british airways declined 
comment on the journal story and industry analysts expressed 
skepticism about the latest reported offer 
the lower the price the more difficult it is for the board to 
justify taking it having already said 300 per share was 
adequate said robert j joedicke an airlines analyst for 
shearson lehman brothers in new york 
still word of a possible new deal boosted the value of ual 
stock which has languished since the last offer fell apart the 
journal said the unions planned to meet with banks this week to 
discuss the idea 
ual advanced 825 a share to 10562 in lateafternoon trading 
on the new york stock exchange 
the new proposal would be the latest in a series of onagain 
offagain deals for one of the nations biggest airlines it would 
be well below the 201ashare or 438 billion offer from a 
labor group that uals board accepted last april 
that pact has been scuttled by the financial uncertainty created 
by the crisis in the middle east 
one individual familiar with the agenda the newspaper said 
cautioned that plans for the new offer are still evolving and are 
subject to change 
it also noted that it was unclear how the ual board would greet 
a lower offer 
last month ual directors gave the union group until oct 9 to 
secure financing for the deal but they also indicated that any 
restructured offer would have to retain the shareholder value 
contemplated in the 201ashare bid made in april 
some analysts said that any participation by british airways 
likely would help the unions secure additional financing 
if thats true and if british airways puts some equity into 
the deal that will make it easier to sell to the bank group 
said robert decker an industry analyst with duff amp phelps in 
chicago 
but decker added my impression is that its going to be 
difficult for the unions i think they have to bring a done deal to 
the board 
according to the newspaper the unions have recruited first 
chicago corp to join three other institutions as lead banks for a 
proposed bank credit of about 2 billion 
first chicago spokeswoman lisabeth weiner would neither confirm 
nor deny the report

ncr corp said tuesday it would replace its 
entire computer line with industrystandard machines that all could 
communicate with each other a first for an oldline computer 
maker 
the new models from a company better known for its cash 
registers and automated teller machines could strenghten ncrs 
presence in the computer industry where it has only done well 
among retailing and banking customers analysts said 
what we are about to see is whether a standard opensystems 
product line can get them into the mainstream or not said rick 
martin who follows computers for prudentialbache securities inc 
ncr said it would produce the entire computer line from tiny 
laptop models to extremely powerful mainframes from the same intel 
corp computer chips that would make ncr the first company to use 
the same microprocessor for a product line this broad analysts 
said 
using the same microprocessor the computeronachip that is 
the brain of modern computers would make the line compatible 
meaning a laptop could get at information stored on a mainframe 
ncr also said the computers would run industrystandard 
operating systems which control a computers internal functions 
the computer lines of most major makers including ncr are 
divided between proprietary or companyspecific processing 
systems and open or industrystandard systems that means 
various models sold by the same company often are incompatible 
applications software such as database or wordprocessing 
programs must be tailored to a specific operating system if the 
software is designed for a proprietary system it cant be used on 
any other type of computer 
but corporations increasingly want to be able to use the same 
applications software on all their machines and to connect 
computers in networks which can be troublesome with incompatible 
models 
ncr executives speaking at a new york news conference said 
their new line would address those concerns 
the dayton ohiobased company said it eventually would provide 
computers in seven levels or ranges of performance and size 
on tuesday it announced six machines in three levels ranging from 
desktop workstatons to mainframeclass machines priced from 
10000 to 800000 
the higherend models of the new line derive their power by 
linking multiple intel microprocessors in an emerging technique 
called parallel processing 
ncr said it will power the models planned for the top of the 
line by hooking together thousands of microprocessors however ncr 
didnt say when those models would be available 
ncr said the most powerful model will process more than 100000 
million instructions per second or mips a standard measure of 
computing speed by contrast ibms new topoftheline model 
announced earlier this month will operate at about 230 mips 
analysts say 
but operating systems and applications software need to be 
developed to exploit the parallelprocessing technology analysts 
say software used for standard mainframes which have up to eight 
processors would not run on machines with thousands of processors 
in related news tuesday the unix development unit of american 
telephone amp telegraph co said would modify the unix operating 
system for use on multipleprocessor computers unix was created by 
atampt 
in coming weeks ncr said it will announce software and 
networking systems that will allow the new computer line to be 
connected throughout a company 
ncr sells less than 5 billion worth of computers a year out of 
a global market of 200 billion according to the investment firm 
sanford c bernstein amp co by comparison ibm the industry leader 
has sales of about 60 billion

the jump in oil prices caused by the persian 
gulf crisis should make big oil companies at least a little fatter 
but the size of any windfalls will vary experts say 
companies that pump plenty of their own crude should bring in 
the most extra cash for the third quarter those more heavily 
involved in selling refined products such as gasoline will not fare 
as well 
major oil companies like other corporations refuse to make 
public predictions of their earnings 
but this fall when big oil reports its profits from the weeks 
following iraqs invasion of kuwait industry observers will have a 
heightened interest in the bottom line 
the political turmoil in the mideast has pushed oil prices to 
the highest levels since the mid 1980s and there have been 
warnings of a public outcry if oil companies appear to be making 
too much money by exploiting the situation 
analysts predict stronger earnings although the size remains 
uncertain some say oil companies might try to lessen the potential 
negative publicity from higher earnings by setting aside more money 
into reserve funds that will be used for such items as future 
litigation or oilspill containment 
the companies are going to be very sensitive to the public 
view of making profits or larger profits in this environment 
said jim murchie an oil analyst with sanford c bernstein amp co 
inc 
they will scour their liabilities and reserve requirements and 
maybe take larger reserves for cleanups and that kind of thing 
so as to serve if you will to dampen the reported earnings 
murchie said tuesday they have to not be seen to be profiteering 
from this and theyre really not if you look at these earnings 
theyre really getting hammered at the pump 
although oil companies are making more money for the crude they 
sell they also end up paying more for the oil they buy the full 
costs of higher crude have not been passed on to consumers who buy 
gasoline which cuts the profit margins of retail operations 
other industry observers doubt the companies will seek to dilute 
higher profits through fancy accounting techniques saying such a 
move would be easily detected by critics 
i dont think therell be any special shenanigans among the 
big guys said professor james m patterson of the indiana 
university school of business that would be so obvious that it 
would be more trouble for them than to just show the increased 
profits 
even though the price of oil has shot up from about 20 per 
barrel to more than 30 per barrel since iraq invaded kuwait aug 
2 analysts are divided over how much money that will mean for the 
majors 
for companies that are sensitive to crude oil prices its 
going to be very good said philip l dodge an oil analyst with 
nomura securities international inc for refiners its going to 
be temporarily lower for the quarter they havent been able to 
pass on all the increase 
robin shoemaker at shearson lehman brothers inc does not think 
the companies will be able to turn profits that are notably bigger 
in terms of earnings theyre going to show very modest if any 
improvement over the second quarter shoemaker said 
but even companies that are heavily involved in the 
lessprofitable businesses such as retail gasoline sales should 
come out of the oil crisis with a better bottom line patterson 
said 
basically theres been a windfall due to the increase in 
price and the increase in demand as well patterson said

united mine workers president richard 
trumka rebuffed in efforts to merge with the main oil industry 
union said tuesday a national energy union is the only way to win 
concessions from big business 
trumka addressing the umws 100th anniversary convention said 
only a unified labor organization can combat multinational oil and 
coal conglomerates with diversified interests 
he said it unions had to do what we must to challenge those 
corporate goliaths on their own turf not only as the union of the 
coal fields but as the union of energy workers 
dividing workers in oil coal power and petrochemical 
industries is the modern equivalent of craft unionism trumka 
said referring to the policy of having a separate union for every 
task at a job site 
at its 1986 convention the umw gave its governing body the 
international executive board authority to seek a merger with 
other energy unions a proposed merger with the oil chemical and 
atomic workers however collapsed in 1987 when the ocaws board 
balked at the proposal 
talks between the unions later resumed but the two sides were 
unable to reach an agreement before the coal miners convention 
began monday 
also tuesday the umws chief financial officer asked the 1000 
convention delegates for permission to use interest from a strike 
fund to pay legal advertising and negotiating costs associated 
with strikes 
the strike fund at 574 million as of aug 31 was set up 
during the 1983 convention but it was limited to paying strike 
benefits directly to miners 
umw secretarytreasurer john banovic said those pay and health 
benefits totaled 5 million during 1989 including payments to 
workers during the 10month strike against the pittston co in west 
virginia virginia and kentucky that ended last february but he 
said the total cost of strikes in 1989 was 60 million to 70 
million 
in addition the union faces 52 million in fines levied by a 
virginia judge for pittstonrelated strike activities banovic said 
the strike fund generates about 4 million a year at current 
interest rates 
delegates are to vote later on that proposal plus another that 
would give the unions international executive board authority to 
close or merge some of the 21 union districts in the united states 
and canada

african countries tuesday appealed for the return 
of export quotas to lift and stabilize the depressed price of 
coffee because of the huge losses they are suffering in the 
present free market for beans 
the objective of the continents producers was a new 
international coffee agreement among exporting and importing 
countries to regulate supplies and prices said filomeno ceita the 
angolan president of the 25nation interafrican coffee 
organization 
he said african producing countries had lost 12 billion in 
export revenue since the suspension 15 months ago of the present 
coffee agreements export quota system which stabilized prices by 
matching supplies to demand 
colombia the worlds secondbiggest producer behind brazil 
also wanted to see quotas back under a new pact said jorge 
cardenas the countrys chief coffee executive 
the main obstacle to the opening of negotiations on a new coffee 
pact was uncertainty over brazils position said ceita who is 
attending a twoweek meeting here of the 72nation international 
coffee organization 
no new pact could work effectively without the participation of 
the worlds biggest producer and exporter delegates said 
brazil is expected to disclose its attitude toward calls for 
negotiations on a new international agreement next week when the 
head of its delegation arrives for producerconsumer talks 
the coffee organization meeting opened sept 17 and is 
scheduled to end sept 28 
the present coffee agreement which lacks powers to regulate 
supplies and prices expires sept 30 1991

the september contract traded as low as 1282 a pound during

expected strong gains

expiration

play had fizzled prompting many traders who had bet on higher 
prices to exit the market

stocks heating oil supplies rose as expected 
light sweet crude oil futures settled 22 cents lower to 53 cents

trending hatcher said predicting the us currency would remain 
in a broad trading range

charles h keating the man blamed by the 
government for the nations biggest savings and loan collapse was 
jailed in lieu of 5 million bail tuesday after he was indicted on 
criminal fraud charges 
it was the first criminal case filed against keating who has 
become a symbol of the national thrift scandal because of his high 
pay lavish personal habits investments in risky real estate and 
junk bonds and alleged use of accounting gimmickry to conceal 
wrongdoing 
the former chairman of american continental corp and three 
other executives were charged in a 42count state indictment with 
selling securities by false statements or omissions selling 
securities without qualifications and lying to the california 
department of corporations 
the department approved the sale of the highrisk highyield 
junk bonds technically known as unsecured debentures at branches 
of the failed lincoln savings and loan of irvine which keating 
controlled through american continental 
more than 200 million worth of junk bonds were sold to 22000 
investors many of them elderly 
i dont know how many bondholders are out there but 
theyre dancing in the street tonight wed like to get our money 
back bondholder shirley lampel said monday after the district 
attorneys office said it had completed its presentation to a 
special state grand jury 
the government seized control of lincoln in april 1989 
regulators estimate the bailout could cost taxpayers as much as 2 
billion last month a federal judge in washington upheld the 
government takeover of lincoln saying the operation of the thrift 
by keating and others amounted to looting 
keating already is charged in several civil cases including a 
11 billion racketeering case filed by the agency responsible for 
the thrift bailout the federal government is conducting a separate 
criminal investigation into the alleged looting of lincoln 
the indictment was handed up late last week but kept sealed 
until tuesday it focuses on 20 alleged victims a case narrow 
enough that los angeles district attorney ira reiner said it could 
be presented without confusing a jury 
we could have named 22000 victims reiner said but that 
would have created an unwieldy case that would have gone on forever 
and a day 
the felony charges do not seek to recover money for the bond 
buyers but a judge could theoretically order restitution as part 
of sentencing if keating and the others are convicted prosecutors 
said 
keating 66 a phoenix developer has contended that the 
government has attempted to make a scapegoat out of him because he 
was an outspoken critic of the thrift regulatory system he 
maintains the bondholders would never have lost money if the 
government hadnt seized lincoln last year and forced american 
continental into bankruptcy court 
also indicted were judy elizabeth wischer 42 of paradise 
valley ariz former president of american continental ray 
charles fidel 32 of newport beach former president of lincoln 
and robin scott symes 37 of malvern ohio former chief executive 
officer of lincoln 
all four appeared in los angeles county superior court but judge 
gary klousner postponed their arraignment to oct 5 because they 
had not yet read the indictment 
klousner ordered all four held bail was set at 1 million 
apiece for wischer fidel and symes 
five us senators who received campaign contributions from 
keating are currently under investigation by the senate ethics 
committee the keating five sens alan cranston dcalif 
dennis deconcini dariz john glenn dohio and john mccain 
rariz and donald w riegle jr dmich helped arrange a 
meeting between keating and federal regulators during the time 
before the savings and loan collapsed 
symes attorney don smaltz called the bail amounts 
outrageous saying they were motivated only by hysteria and 
politics of the case 
the judge said it appeared that if convicted the maximum 
exposure of each defendant would be approximately 10 years in 
prison 
keating has frequently said he is broke and that friends are 
paying the mortgage on his paradise valley ariz home 
reiner said the investigation revealed that elderly lincoln 
savings investors were regularly steered into risky american 
continental securities when it came time to renew certificates of 
deposits 
they put their money in lincoln savings they put their faith 
in them reiner said he declined to describe in detail how the 
bonds were misrepresented 
asked what happened to the investors money reiner said the 
money was transferred to american continental and from there to mr 
keating 
the department of corporations has already sued keating on 
behalf of the investors however the bondholders themselves at one 
point filed a claim against the department saying it should never 
have allowed the bonds to be sold in the lincoln branches because 
they constituted an extreme risk to the investing public

30 years according to union and company officials who spoke to the 
newspaper on the condition of anonymity 
health insurance provisions remain unchanged the officials 
said 
the union and the no 1 us automaker negotiated well past the 
midnight friday expiration of the old contract and produced a 
tentative settlement after 41 hours of nonstop talks 
uaw president owen bieber said details of the agreement had to 
be delayed until the information could get out to the 300000 
affected union members the tentative settlement was announced 
after 2 am 
therefore we couldnt proceed without having the normal 
material that we would provide for them before they made a decision 
on the recommended agreement he said 
about 300 members of the uaws gm bargaining council met 
privately in suburban dearborn monday but postponed review of the 
agreement until tuesday morning in detroit 
the absence of public posturing was conspicuous in these talks 
which were conducted under a news blackout in the final stages but 
gm and the uaw may need all the cordiality they can muster to get 
through the next three years 
gm faces the prospect of shrinking its number of factories 
many analysts believe it will have to close at least four assembly 
plants and reducing its hourly work force by tens of thousands of 
people 
bieber told a predawn news conference he was very very 
satisfied with the agreement on pensions and gm vice president 
alfred warren said the contract gives the company latitude to 
reduce its work force 
across the border in canada where the canadian auto workers and 
ford motor co have been negotiating a new contract relations were 
more strained the caw struck fords canadian operation saturday 
but electe not to break off talks after learning that the company 
would offer a revised package tuesday 
caw president bob white had said if an offer was not 
forthcoming he would recess the talks on wednesday ford spokesman 
jim hartford said the offer would include new economic proposals 
because of the lack of details reported on the us agreement 
it was difficult to tell what kind of effect the settlement would 
have on the economy or on pending contract negotiations with ford 
and chrysler corp 
gm common stock closed down 37 cents to 3712 on the new york 
stock exchange 
the gm bargaining council made up of union presidents and 
bargaining committee chairs will vote on the tentative pact before 
its sent to the rank and file for formal ratification that 
process is expected to be completed by the end of the month 
if ratified the contract will be used by the union as a model 
for agreements with ford and chrysler union agreements with those 
two companies which cover more than 150000 active workers also 
expired at midnight friday the union put talks with those 
automakers on hold pending the outcome of the gm ratification vote 
it was expected that ford would have little trouble matching the 
gmuaw agreement but there was a question for chrysler which is 
in the worst financial shape of the big three and may report a loss 
in the third quarter 
the average hourly wage with cost of living adjustments for gm 
workers is about 1575 under the expired 1987 agreement fringe 
benefits particularly health care costs boost that to nearly 30 
per hour the company has said 
at ford the figure is about 31 per hour and chryslers was 
just more than 33

local 22 in detroit said of members reaction to the proposed 
threeyear contract reached early monday theyre hoping our 
president comes back and tells us weve got a good agreement 
smith a quality operator at gms cadillac plant and a 26year 
union member is one of about 300000 uawcovered workers who 
worried over the weekend about the negotiations the 1987 agreement 
expired at midnight friday but was extended while bargainers 
worked on a new deal details of which are to be announced tuesday 
uaw contracts at ford motor co and chrysler corp also expired 
at midnight friday the union targeted the no 1 automaker to reach 
a contract it could use as a pattern for pacts with ford motor co 
and chrysler corp 
after 41 hours of bargaining uaw president owen bieber 
announced at 210 am monday that negotiators had reached an 
agreement 
i was kind of scared we were going to be off today but since 
we settled im glad said jd boatman 61 a worker at gms 
cadillac plant in detroit 
the unions 300member gm bargaining council met in suburban 
dearborn on monday to get a look at the deal but bieber 
rescheduled the meeting for tuesday because copies of the lengthy 
agreement still were being printed 
if the contract is approved by the council it will be sent to 
rankandfile members for ratification a process expected to be 
completed by the end of the month 
details havent been officially announced but the detroit free 
press reported in its tuesday editions that the agreement contains 
42 billion in income guarantees eliminates weak plantclosing

30 years according to union and company officials who spoke to the

said 
local officials said monday they were anxious to hear what gains 
if any had been made 
were all starving for information over here said joe 
garcia financial secretary for local 645 in van nuys calif we 
want to know what kind of job security they have to offer what 
kind of wage increases what kind of pension increases what kind 
of incentives for people that want to retire 
those are just some of the questions that are floating in our 
minds now waiting to be answered 
paramount among the unions concerns was job security an 
emotional issue in an industry with a history of unexpectedly 
severe layoffs 
its hard to send kids to college when you dont have a 
paycheck said local 22 vice president frank serazio who has 
seen his locals membership fall from almost 12000 in 1978 to 
5200 in 1990 
in 1987 the uaw built on jobsecurity language introduced in 
1984 which prohibited closing a factory unless its product or 
products suffered a slump in sales 
since then gm has closed four assembly plants one each in 
atlanta framingham mass leeds mo and pontiac mich 
uaw members have said they felt betrayed by the automaker the 
union challenged the closing of the pontiac plant before an 
arbitrator but lost 
serazio said the 1987 plantidling agreement which has 
allowed almost 9000 layoffs was stressed in this years talks 
serazio added that union vice president stephen yokich the 
uaws top negotiator at gm wouldnt let the uaw be entrapped in 
terminology that not everybody has a clear idea on like plant 
idling 
paul mitchell financial secretary of local 645 in lake orion 
agreed 
that really killed us in 1987 he said the language 
wasnt defined so i would hope and pray that they did try to 
redefine the meaning of different terms

a connecticutbased satellite company said 
tuesday it would appeal a federal courts dismissal of the firms 
15 billion antitrust suit against comsat corp 
pan american satellite said the suit was dismissed thursday in 
us district court in manhattan on grounds that comsat a 
congressionally created corporation was immune from such antitrust 
suits 
rene anselmo the chairman of pan american said its just a 
question of law i would expect we would prevail on appeal 
pan american based in greenwich conn filed suit in july 
1989 charging comsat with fixing prices and blocking competition 
for international satellite communications services 
comsat which stands for communications satellite corp sells 
to us companies access to intelsat the 117nation consortium of 
satellite telecommunications users 
pan american satellite is the first privately owned 
international satellite communications company 
anselmo established pan american in 1984 after thenpresident 
reagan signed a presidential determination that it would be in the 
national interest to allow socalled alternative satellite systems 
such as pas to compete with comsat and intelsat 
pan american launched its pas1 satellite in june 1988 and began 
service in september to latin america and europe 
congress created comsat in the communications satellite act of 
1962 comsat is a private publicly traded company that leases 
intelsat circuits to companies such as american telephone amp 
telegraph co mci us sprint and television networks 
pan americans suit sought 500 million in actual damages which

eastman kodak cos new photographic 
compact disc system is a shrewd move to preserve the companys 
traditional film market while taking advantage of new electronic 
technologies industry watchers said tuesday 
concerns about the threat to kodak from electronic imaging 
will subside for a while said eugene glazer an analyst with 
dean witter reynolds 
the photo cd system introduced tuesday at news conferences in 
new york london tokyo and rochester is being developed jointly 
with dutch electronics company nv philips the system stores 
photographic images from standard 35 millimeter film onto compact 
discs and the pictures can then be replayed on television screens 
the system will be available in 1992 kodak said 
as was obvious at kodaks product demonstration photographs 
taken on film are still far superior to those taken electronically 
nothing even remotely comes close to conventional film and 
photo papers in terms of quality and price said barry harrand 
director of marketing research for the michiganbased photo 
marketing association 
the photo cd system is kodaks first consumer product that 
combines conventional picturetaking with the conveniences of 
electronics glazer said investors have been concerned about the 
threat posed to kodaks basic silverhalide film business by new 
technologies he said 
theyve essentially successfully defended the role of silver 
halide technology as the capture medium said mark obenzinger an 
analyst with trinity trading co 
most analysts said it was too early to predict how many people 
will want to watch their photographs on television there may be 
more demand for the systems applications in desktop publishing 
said financial analyst brenda landry of new yorks morgan stanley 
kodak officials said the system could be made accessible to almost 
any computer 
it can make virtually any computer an electronic fullcolor 
photo editing workstation said larry matteson vice president 
and general manager of kodaks imaging information systems 
obenzinger said the system is wellpriced for both consumers and 
photofinishers kodak estimated that the photo disc players which 
would also plays audio discs would cost less than 500 while the 
discs would cost less than 20 
the photofinishing system including a discwriter computer 
thermal printer would cost about 100000 kodak said 
a 1988 survey by the photo marketing association showed that 57 
percent of americans would be interested in looking at their 
photographs on television harrand said 
harrand said he expects to see all kinds of hybrid technologies 
introduced onto the photographic market in the next few years 
he said he expects such systems should expand the market for 
photo sales as consumers gain more control over what they can do 
with their photographs

amdahl corp a maker of ibmcompatible 
mainframe computers announced a new line tuesday it said includes 
the most powerful computers ever for the ibm market 
the top model of the 10model line will include eight processors 
two more than international business machines corp says will be 
in its nextgeneration mainframe due out next year 
according to international data corp a market research firm 
amdahls new top model will process about 332 million instructions 
per second or mips a standard computer performance measurement 
by contrast ibms new top model announced sept 5 will run at 
about 203 mips idc says

will run at about 150 mips idc says 
mainframe computers are used by large corporations to manage 
hugh amounts of data such as millions of customer accounts at an 
insurance company or reservations at an airline 
since mainframes are so costly companies must make longrange 
plans for their purchase burris said but he said amdahls 
announcement of a topend model that wont be ready for more than a 
year and a half may be too much lead time 
amdahl based in sunnyvale calif is 43 percent owned by 
japans fujitsu ltd hitachi data systems is partially owned by 
hitachi ltd another japanese electronics company 
hitachi and amdahl traditionally undercut ibms prices and 
their share of the us mainframe market has grown while ibms

the latest list was expanded to 75 companies from the 60 a year 
earlier and more than double the 30 companies that appeared in the 
initial ranking published in 1986

increased number of companies that have grown sensitive to the 
needs of the working mother one of the fastest growing segments of 
the american work force 
these people see the writing on the wall and it doesnt 
matter if theyre small or large she said 
the companies were evaluated on compensation opportunities for

continental airlines easterns parent 
company on tuesday agreed to immediately pay 80 million to an 
eastern pension plan underfunded by as much as 720 million the 
government said 
continental airlines holdings inc also agreed to shoulder most 
of the future financial responsibility for the plan the government 
said 
under the settlement continental will pay 805 million to 
cover part of a payment that had been due monday to easterns 
pension plan said the pension benefit guaranty corp the federal 
agency that guarantees pension payments 
eastern now in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings has also 
agreed to pay 30 million by jan 15 the pbgc said 
continental has agreed to assume responsibility for about 600 
million in remaining underfunded liabilities less whatever amount 
the pbgc gets back from its bankruptcy claims the agency said 
pbgc which had faced a potential loss of nearly 720 million in 
eastern pension liabilities said it would not suffer a loss under 
the agreement the deal provides full uninterrupted pension 
benefits to easterns 51000 workers and retirees pbgc said 
under the plan pbgc will terminate seven eastern pension plans 
and take over the plans 
while we believed continental could assume the yeomans share 
of the pension debt in the interest of fairness and to prevent an 
unreasonable risk that continental could not afford the total 
obligation some payment was required from eastern diane 
burkley the pbgcs deputy executive director said of the 
agreement 
negotiators had been working on the matter for nine months she 
said 
pbgc will establish a separate trust to hold pension assets and 
to receive the eastern and continental payments it is expected 
that several of the plans will be funded within a couple of years 
with the rest fully funded by the year 2002 the pbgc said 
the agreement must be submitted to a federal bankruptcy court in 
new york for approval pbgc said it would terminate the pension

general motors corp threw more than 4 billion 
at the united auto workers to mollify labor and clear the way for 
closing unprofitable plants under a threeyear deal the unions 
bargaining council approved tuesday 
the worlds largest automaker will make the money available to 
assure workers will be paid if they are laid off when plants close 
analysts say such closings are inevitable if gm is to become more 
competitive and regain market share lost to us and foreign 
rivals 
the union made job security its top priority in this years 
talks and said that objective was achieved in the talks with gm 
job security and income security go handinhand when you make 
the income security so high that they have got to make sure that 
theyre going to work on job security uaw vice president stephen 
yokich said 
gm closed four assembly plants in the last three years putting 
about 9000 employees out of work the 1987 contract language that 
allowed the closings remains in the tentative agreement this time 
gm will pay dearly to close a plant an affected worker 
may be laid off for no more than 36 weeks from a plant closed 
because of slow sales of a product made there 
would be paid 95 percent of base wages from a companypaid 
supplemental employment benefits fund 
must be recalled after 36 weeks or be placed in a jobs bank 
also paid for by gm the jobs may have nothing to do with the auto 
industry workers could stay in the job bank for the life of the 
contract 
gm will spend 335 billion on the supplemental benefits fund 
and the jobs bank and 663 million on other incomeprotection 
programs the 300000 uawrepresented workers will vote on the 
contract over the next two weeks 
its a sweetened buyout based on the framework already in 
place said harley shaiken a labor professor at the university 
of california at san diego it gives gm a lot of flexibility 
the agreement also provides 
a 3 percent base wage increase in the first year and onetime 
payments equal to 3 percent of annual salary in the second and 
third years 
continued costofliving adjustments 
union officials said an assembler who now makes 1401 an hour 
would receive 1653 an hour under the new contract counting both 
the raise and costofliving increases based on an assumption of 
44 percent annual inflation based on that assumption the wage 
would rise to 1719 in the contracts second year and 1788 the 
third year 
bargaining council members who received details in a threehour 
meeting tuesday were largely impressed the contract will fly with 
the rank and file they said 
its an ok contract said local 594 president don douglas 
an outspoken critic of uaw leadership 
if gm shrinks as expected in the next three years so will the 
union 
here the uaw has achieved some measurable increase in job 
security at the price of accepting the continued erosion in 
employment levels shaiken said 
assuming approval of the agreement the uaw will move onto ford 
motor co or chrysler corp where negotiations have been suspended 
since aug 28 when the uaw picked gm as its bargaining target 
the union probably would prefer to take the pattern to ford 
next but that may depend on whether a canadian auto workers strike 
of fords operations there has been resolved the strike reached a 
fourth day tuesday 
i would think that unofficially wed be next in the barrel 
uawford vice president ernie lofton said 
chrysler in the worst financial shape of the big three has 
said it probably couldnt afford a contract tailored at gm or ford 
the no 3 automaker has plenty of cash on hand from the sale of 
subsidiaries and interest in other ventures but it needs the money 
to develop new cars and trucks buying out workers the way gm 
agreed to could leave chrysler cashpoor and with no new products 
bieber said he didnt know how much more this contract would 
cost gm than the 1987 agreement the income protection commitment 
alone is three times greater than the last contract however 
overall its a good agreement very solid said jerry 
melillo president of uaw local 1250 in cleveland and a member of 
the unions ford bargaining committee 
fords use of overtime to avoid building new plants in the 1980s 
is targeted in the pattern agreement the new contract would 
provide for a 5percent shift premium for some overtime work 
thats pointed directly at ford shaiken said those 
overtime provisions are meant to establish a pattern 
ford presented the caw with a new economic package tuesday but 
it was not favorably received 
the best i can say is it forms a basis for continuing talks 
not a basis for settlement caw president bob white said
