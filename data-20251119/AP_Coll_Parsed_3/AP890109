stripped of his american citizenship in 1986 for his role as a nazi 
propagandist in the soviet union during world war ii has asked for 
refugee status in canada a report said monday 
vladimir sokolov disappeared in july when he was scheduled to 
appear at a deportation hearing in hartford conn

in montreal sometime before jan 1 claiming that his life would be 
in danger if he was forced to return to the soviet union the 
canadian broadcast corp reported 
no date has been set for an immigration hearing the report said 
from 1942 to 1944 sokolov was a writer and editor of a russian 
language newspaper published by the german army in his hometown of 
orel 220 miles south of moscow antisemitic articles appeared 
under his name although he has maintained that the most offensive 
tracts were written by nazi censors 
his canadian lawyer julius grey said sokolov faces almost 
certain death if deported to the soviet union 
the soviet press has been gloating over his return and have 
called him a traitor grey said he would likely be put to death

an agriculture department analyst says the 1986 
tax reforms can mean substantial savings to farmers when incomes 
rise but that the old federal rules allowed bigger breaks as 
earnings decline 
clifford v rossi of the departments economic research service 
said the tax reform act of 1986 can reduce overall tax liability for 
farmers by an average of 45 percent from previous levels 
rossi used a computer model and information from more than 15000 
federal tax returns of farm sole proprietorships for 1982 to 
come up with the estimates his findings were in a new staff report 
circulated by the agency 
farm sole proprietorships were defined as selfemployed 
individuals filing a schedule f federal tax form which is the 
basic paperwork required of farmers by the internal revenue service 
in general lower marginal tax rates and generous expensing 
provisions will offset repeal of the investment tax credit and 
capital gains preference the report said taxpayers with high 
offfarm incomes receive little benefit from the new law 
rossi noted that farm incomes can vary greatly because of 
weather economic conditions and other factors so he performed a 
sensitivity analysis that includes a 25 percent increase and 
another that includes a 25 percent decrease on farm income 
the increase in net farm income resulted in a 109 percent 
increase in federal tax liability under the old rules and only an 
83 percent increase under the 1985 law he said 
by contrast rossi showed that a 25 percent drop in income would 
result in a decline of 87 percent in taxes under the old federal 
system and only 77 percent less under the new reforms 
in terms of net winners and losers from tax reform taxpayers 
engaged in field crop and general livestock operations benefit more 
from the new tax laws than other farm groups he said all 
sectors with the exception of the dairy sector experience net 
reductions in tax liabilities under tax reform 
rossi said dairy farmers suffer under the new tax law because 
of low taxable incomes that consequently cannot offset the loss of 
capital gains preference and investment tax credit two of the 
major writeoffs under the old law 
farm enterprises with relatively high capital intensities are 
burdened more by the loss of certain preferences for capital 
intensities than other farm operations he said there is also 
some evidence that more generous expensing and depreciation 
provisions are of greater consequence to capitalintensive 
operations than other farm types 
rossi said the 1986 law tends to reduce tax burdens for 
taxpayers with low and moderate levels of income and that those 
whose taxable incomes were more than 500000 showed the smallest 
decline in taxes 
according to rossi the new study is the only comprehensive 
assessment of tax liability in the agricultural sector and will 
aid in future policy considerations 
if history is any indicator of future activity in tax policy 
the tax reform act of 1986 will undergo refinement or overhaul in 
the years ahead with accompanying effects on agriculture he said

tokyo continues to be the most expensive world 
capital for groceries according to the agriculture department 
a 16city survey by the departments foreign agricultural service 
in november showed that a retail market basket of selected food 
items cost more than 144 in tokyo while the lowest cost was in 
brasilia at 27 in washington dc the same items were about 53 
in order the 16 capitals and market basket costs included 
tokyo 14410 stockholm 9992 bern 9662 seoul 6325 
madrid 5964 paris 5689 rome 5864 london 5563 
washington dc 5326 bonn 5159 canberra 4977 ottawa 
4941 buenos aires 4099 mexico city 3194 pretoria 3117 
and brasilia 2708 
the agency said the food items reflect purchases more typical 
of us consumers rather than those of other nations and that 
caution should be used in making comparisons differences in 
quality packaging and seasonal variations in supply were cited 
among the items sirloin steak was shown at 1071 per kilogram 
or about 487 per pound in washington dc and 5706 per 
kilogram or 26 per pound in tokyo in brasilia sirloin was 275 
per kilo or 125 per pound 
the comparisons were begun by usda many years ago to bolster 
claims that americans pay lower prices for food than many other 
people in the world

rising food prices in china may help spur 
greater interest in imported us farm commodities according to an 
agriculture department trade report 
the combination of rising incomes inflation fears and the 
expression of pentup consumer demand for almost everything has 
created a sellers market for most agricultural goods as well 
according to the report in the january issue of ag exporter magazine 
higher prices for grain livestock and dairy products are 
expected to encourage imports of breeding animals feed grains 
soybeans and meal and wheat and wheat flour the report said

one of every three men and women walking down 
the aisle in the united states has been married before but the 
remarriage rate for divorced americans has been declining according 
to a national center for health statistics report 
the government report also shows that most divorced men marry 
divorced women and that of those divorced americans remarrying in 
1983 the women were on the average 34 years old and the men an 
average 37 years old 
the report is based on samples of records from states that 
compile marriage and divorce statistics it studies data collected 
from 1970 to 1983 the latest year for which most of the figures 
were available 
the number of remarriages increased during the period studied 
rising from 404000 in 1970 to 736000 in 1983 for divorced women 
and from 423000 to 773000 over the 14year period for divorced men 
but although the number of remarriages was growing over those 
years the pool of divorced men and women was growing faster the 
report said 
in 1983 the remarriage rate for divorced women was 916 per 
1000 compared with 1233 per 1000 in 1970 the rate for divorced 
men was 1421 per 1000 compared with 2045 per 1000 in 1970 the 
report said 
thus only 9 percent of divorced women and 14 percent of 
divorced men remarried in 1983 compared with 12 percent of divorced 
women and 20 percent of divorced men in 1970 the report said 
the figures also show that most women marry men of the same 
marital status in 1983 the report said 55 percent of all women 
and men who married were both single 19 percent were both divorced 
and 2 percent were both widowed 
men traditionally are older than the women they marry and this 
generally holds true for remarriages as well as first marriages 
according to the study the only combinations in which that trend is 
broken is for divorced and widowed women who marry single men in 
1983 widowed women were an average 2 years older and divorced women 
were an average 1 year older than the single men they married 
many of the patterns for first marriages dont hold up for second 
and subsequent marriages the report noted 
while more than threequarters of first marriages are performed 
in religious settings the proportion drops to about 60 percent for 
marriages involving divorced men and women 
also first marriages have a typical seasonal pattern many more 
are performed in the summer than in the winter the report said but 
second and subsequent marriages tend to be spread more evenly 
throughout the year

fear that the us government will go it alone 
in world trade is discouraging other countries from joining in an 
accord that could cut spending on farmers by tens of billions of 
dollars every year according to a report published by the 
international monetary fund 
fund experts see a possibility that james m baker iii 
designated as secretary of state by presidentelect bush will 
single out favored countries as trading partners instead of 
promoting us trade with the whole world 
the organization for economic cooperation and development whose 
members include the governments of the major industrial countries 
says farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers 185 billion a year 
between 1984 and 1986 the biggest costs are in the united states 
western europe and japan 
the imf report cites a speech last year by baker then secretary 
of the treasury baker spoke of what the us government would do if 
there were a failure of the trade talks now being held by 
representatives of 96 countries 
we might be willing to explore a market liberalization club 
approach through minilateral arrangements or a series of bilateral 
agreements bush was quoted as saying 
bilateral agreements are like the new one between the united 
states and canada freeing up trade between two countries but 
tending to freeze out others a similar deal with israel was made 
earlier last year a minilateral arrangement includes not just 
two but a group of countries like the 12 in the european economic 
community 
groups of this kind encourage trade among members at the expense 
of those outside the club 
the report was written before last months meeting in montreal of 
representatives from the 96 governments they agreed on how to 
negotiate 11 different kinds of trade issues in the remaining two 
years of talks but they failed to agree on four others including 
agriculture 
us trade representative clayton yeutter insisted that other 
governments especially the europeans promise to join in a 
longterm phaseout of subsidies before he would talk about cutting 
them in the immediate future bush has picked yeutter as his 
secretary of agriculture 
on thursday alan holmer yeutters deputy as trade 
representative said he was optimistic about agreement being reached 
on farm issues by april a new deadline set at montreal but 
negotiations are being soured by a fight between the european 
community and the reagan administration over the hormones that us 
farmers use to make their cattle grow faster 
last sunday the community which tries to keep its own farmers 
from using hormones banned imports of us beef and veal worth over 
100 million a year the reagan administration retaliated with 
increases of 100 percent in import duties on such items as danish 
hams and sundried tomatoes from italy a measure designed to make 
them too expensive for americans to want to buy the europeans are 
threatening a counterreprisal and us officials say they have a 
list ready should that happen 
a truce is in effect at least until jan 23 when ministers of 
foreign affairs from the 12 countries are due to meet in brussels 
bush will have been inaugurated three days earlier and the new 
administration may have some ideas for getting the talks back on the 
rails yeutter is to be replaced as trade representative by carla 
hills 
the report published by the international monetary fund is called 
issues and developments in international trade policy it was 
written by a team under margaret kelly an australian who heads the 
funds trade and payments division 
the fund is owned by 151 countries with the united states 
holding the biggest block of votes

general douglas macarthur and others directing 
the occupation of japan after world war ii resisted powerful us 
and allied opposition in keeping the late emperor hirohito on the 
chrysanthemum throne where he reigned for another 43 years 
the emperors prosecution for war crimes execution imprisonment 
or exile was favored by 70 percent of americans in a public opinion 
poll seven weeks before the end of the war some allied governments 
had similar views 
macarthur supreme commander of the us occupation of japan was 
the best known of those resisting demands for punishing the monarch 
who died in tokyo saturday at the age of 87 after a 62year reign 
marked by military expansion crushing defeat reconciliation 
dramatic economic growth and new heights of prosperity and prestige 
for his country 
prime minister hideki tojo and six other japanese officials were 
convicted and hanged as a result of the tokyo war crimes trials 
tojos testimony at one point threatened to implicate the emperor in 
whose name the militarists had overrun east asia 
documents released in washington 25 years ago by the state 
department show that macarthur and other us officials decided 
retention of hirohito was vital to maintaining order in the former 
enemy country and carrying out their mission of democratic reform 
but those planning japans future were also aware that the 
emotions of war had generated powerful sentiment in america and 
other allied countries for prosecuting and ousting the mikado as 
responsible for aggression and atrocities of the imperial military 
command the documents showed 
george gallup director of the american institute of public 
opinion declared june 23 1945 that the average american 
thinks hirohito should be treated like any other war criminal 
in his latest gallup poll he said 33 percent of those 
questioned said hirohito should be executed 17 percent said let 
the court decide his fate 11 percent said keep him in prison 
the rest of his life and 9 percent wanted to exile him only 4 
percent favored ignoring him as a mere figurehead 3 percent said 
use him as a puppet to run japan other replies or no opinion 
accounted for 23 percent 
macarthur wrote in his memoirs that hirohito had already been 
stricken from the list of potential war crimes defendants when the 
monarch first visited him sept 30 1945 hands trembling the 
emperor offered to bear sole responsibility for the war macarthur 
wrote adding that i knew i faced the first gentleman of japan in 
his own right 
four months later the fivestar general messaged washington that 
hirohitos indictment and execution could trigger a convulsion 
potential chaos and guerrilla warfare in japan one million 
occupation troops might be needed and all hope of introducing 
democratic methods would disappear macarthur said 
george atcheson jr macarthurs state department adviser told 
truman in 1946 there is no question that the emperor is most 
useful he is obeyed he manifests sincerity in wishing to aid in 
the accomplishment of our general objectives and is seemingly more 
anxious to be democratic than some of the people around him 
a specialist strongly advocating retention of the emperor was 
hugh borton member of the us statewarnavy coordinating 
committee in washington that began studies before the end of the war 
on occupation policy and sent its findings to macarthur 
reached at his home in conway mass borton now 83 said the 
committee favored keeping hirohito on the basis of expert opinion 
that he was one who could more influence the japanese populace 
than anyone else and the important thing for the united states was 
to make the occupation as effective as possible rather than a 
continuation of the war 
first indications in august 1945 that the emperor might be 
retained produced a strong but mixed reaction in congress sen tom 
stewart dtenn said the emperor is a war criminal and id like 
to see him hung up by his toes 
sen william langer rnd said the emperor ought to be 
treated like hitler 
sen richard russell dga who later introduced an unsuccessful 
resolution urging trial of the emperor called anything less than 
unconditional surrender a terrible mistake 
but sens styles bridges rnh elbert thomas dutah and 
robert taft rohio said it should be possible to deal sternly and 
effectively with japan and simplify military operations by working 
through the emperor

president reagans submission today of his 
115 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1990 triggers a work 
schedule that is specified by law cited with reverence by lawmakers 
and then routinely ignored 
this year should be no different 
the law calls for congress to have completed work on the spending 
plan by april 15 in addition all 13 appropriations bills that 
finance the federal government are supposed to be in place by the 
oct 1 start of the new fiscal year 
but that rarely happens and ingredients for delay abound this 
year 
congress will be treating reagans proposal as largely 
inconsequential and waiting for a new plan from presidentelect bush 
after his inauguration the house budget committee isnt even 
planning any hearings on reagans blueprint and will wait instead 
until it receives something from bush 
in addition bushs repeated pledges to avoid new taxes puts him 
in direct conflict with many congressional leaders who say the 
additional revenues will be unavoidable 
there probably hasnt been a year in the last five where the 
likelihood of keeping to the budget schedule is less likely says 
stanley e collender the washingtonbased director of federal 
budget policy for the accounting firm of price waterhouse 
this hasnt stopped top members of congress from their usual 
pledges to move quickly on the budget 
last monday congress first day in session house speaker jim 
wright dtexas set a goal of meeting budget deadlines and said 
so far as the speaker can influence the schedule we shall perform 
our work on time 
and new senate budget committee chairman jim sasser dtenn 
expressed the same desire in a telephone interview last week adding 
that the delay caused by the presidential transition doesnt waive 
the provisions of the law setting the budget work schedule 
but history shows that fiscal and political crises not 
timetables govern the budget process 
budget deadlines set by law come and go with no real consequences 
if they are missed 
but three key fiscal events are scheduled to occur roughly 
simultaneously this fall and are likely to spur action in what 
collender borrowing from the language of new age adherents calls 
the political equivalent of the harmonic convergence 
sometime this august or september the government is expected to 
reach its debt ceiling of 28 trillion meaning that legislation 
will be needed for it to be able to borrow more money 
at the same time if there is no budget agreement between 
congress and the white house the mechanism will begin that 
ultimately triggers the dreaded automatic spending slashes required 
under the grammrudman balanced budget law those cuts which are 
seen by most people as draconian would take effect oct 1 
in addition september is the last month of the fiscal year some 
sort of legislation that provides money must be in place by oct 1 
or the government cannot function 
stalemates are common when it comes to the budget because the 
blueprint is the most basic statement of the governments 
priorities it not only perpetually creates institutional struggles 
between the executive and legislative branches but it is a 
battleground for democrats and republicans positioning themselves 
for future elections 
last year was unusual for its budget harmony because most of the 
crucial decisions were made at a summit among reagan administration 
officials and congressional leaders shortly after the october 1987 
stock market crash it was the first year in 12 in which all 13 
spending bills were finished by oct 1 
in 1987 spending legislation was not completed until nearly 
christmas three months into the fiscal year

prince charles has angered british farmers by 
linking intensive farming methods with erosion and the destruction 
of wildlife 
people are becoming increasingly concerned about the damage to 
the environment arising from the application by farmers of the 
principle of the maximization of production he said in an address 
to an organic food production conference this weekend 
it is increasingly felt by members of the public that 
largescale soil erosion the destruction of wildlife habitat and 
the excessive use of chemicals and unnatural substances are 
unacceptable and cannot continue without ruining the countryside for 
future generations and probably causing longterm health hazards 
national farmers union president simon gourlay said the prince 
had gone over the top in sounding the alarm bells and i do not 
think hes justified in saying theres a buildup of longterm 
environmental problems 
charles has shown a penchant for voicing public concerns most 
notably in the field of urban development and architecture

the city manager is on the verge of flipping a 
switch that will send electricity flowing through cityowned power 
lines a change he says will save money for residents of this 
northern ohio town 
but officials for the toledo edison co which now supplies 
electricity to the towns 5600 residents say a municipal power 
system will be unreliable and electric rates will eventually 
increase and surpass their rates 
city manager nelson summit admits that the clyde light and power 
co is a gamble 
what it boiled down to was i felt there was a better way to 
provide electricity it turned out that it is going to be cheaper 
and rates will get a lot better in the future summit said in a 
recent interview 
but toledo edison is putting up a fight 
it filed a lawsuit last month after the city refused to start 
negotiating the renewal of the private companys franchise to serve 
the city the contract expires in june 1990 
toledo edison wants to force clyde to explain to the state public 
utilities commission why the company should not be allowed to 
compete with the new municipal system in clyde about 30 miles 
southeast of toledo 
toledo edison will lose about 7 million to 8 million annually 
in revenues if the franchise is not renewed said mark everhart 
general manager of the utilitys eastern district 
the utility has 275000 customers in northwestern ohio losing 
clyde is kind of like cutting the heart out of a distribution 
system he said 
the conversion to a cityowned system had its beginnings five 
years ago when summit moved to clyde and saw his electric bills 
double 
voters in november 1987 approved a 10 million bond issue to set 
up the utility company early last year the city agreed to buy 
power wholesale from the cantonbased ohio power co at 31 cents 
per kilowatt hour 
the city wanted to buy toledo edisons distribution system but 
the companys selling price of 30 million was too high summit said 
now clyde is building a new substation distribution and 
transmission lines its first customer a whirlpool corp plant is 
expected to be on line in early march summit said 
the city council recently set rates for the new system at 7 cents 
per kilowatt hour the current rate is 95 cents and the average 
household pays 52 a month thats expected to drop to 39 
more than 80 ohio communities have municipal electric systems 
most buying power wholesale from utilities but no municipal system 
has been set up since the early 1900s 
clydes operation is being closely watched by other ohio 
municipalities interested in cutting electric rates 
there is no doubt about it a precedent has already been set 
and toledo edison is worried summit said 
but there are several inherent problems with municipal power 
systems everhart said in coming years some cities may have 
trouble buying power wholesale because supplies will diminish the 
utility company official said 
a nofrill utility company will work fine until the wind blows 
hard until there is a major accident and until something goes 
wrong and then all of a sudden you are left holding the bag 
said everhart

a belfastbound jetliner carrying 126 
people crashed beside a highway in central england on sunday and 
broke into pieces killing at least 37 people and injuring 76 
officials said 
the airline said the crash was caused by engine failure and ruled 
out sabotage 
the british midland airways boeing 737400 was en route from 
londons heathrow airport to northern ireland when it developed 
engine trouble the civil aviation authority said 
the jet attempted to land at east midlands airport near 
nottingham about 100 miles north of london but undershot the 
runway by a halfmile and crashed alongside a highway smashed into 
an embankment and broke apart police said 
witnesses reported seeing an engine in flames as the aircraft 
came in low dropping bits of debris and shearing off treetops as it 
careened toward the highway cars swerved to avoid the hulk and 
there were a few minor injuries from auto collisions police said 
we believe that 37 people have died as a result of this 
accident but there are still some people in the wreckage 
leicestershire assistant chief constable tony butler told a news 
conference 
he said he did not know whether the trapped people were dead or 
alive it was also not certain that all 37 were aboard the plane 
since police reported there may have been casualties in cars on the 
highway 
after nearly eight hours of rescue efforts at the edge of 
englands busiest northsouth highway one of the people aboard was 
still trapped alive in the wreckage and two bodies awaited recovery 
the leicestershire ambulance service said 
police in the county of derbyshire reported several bodies 
scattered on each side of the highway two nearby hospitals reported 
a total of 76 people injured 
all of them seemed to have smashed ankles and legs and with a 
lot their faces were badly damaged too said joe westonwebb 50 
who lives in the nearby village of sutton bonningale and was among 
the first on the scene he helped rescue several people and saw many 
bodies in the wreckage 
it seems a miracle that any one got out alive though and i 
cant believe that it all didnt go up in flames it was 
horrendous 
the plane a new aircraft that only had been in service for three 
months was carrying 118 passengers and eight crew the airline said 
the crash was the second major air tragedy in britain in three 
weeks on dec 21 a pan am boeing 747 bound for new york blew up 
over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people on board and 11 on 
the ground that jet had also left heathrow a bomb was blamed for 
the crash 
the flight sunday took off from heathrow airport at 752 pm and 
its engine caught fire 10 minutes later the department of transport 
said 
the pilot told the control tower he had the engine fire under 
control but when the plane was still one to two miles out it was 
clear that there would be an accident airport official michael 
cowan told a news conference 
as the plane approached the control tower it was apparent it was 
too low he said 
airline executive colin roberts told relatives at belfast 
airport there was absolutely no question of sabotage and there 
was nothing to indicate that whatsoever 
the accident was caused by a technical fault in one of the 
engines of the new plane which had made seven flights on the 
londonbelfast route he said the weather was reported good 
the 737 crashed at about 830 pm 330 pm est about a mile 
outside the village of kegworth inspector neville cotterill of the 
leicestershire police said 
the tail section as embedded in the ground and the fuselage broke 
into several parts spread over fields cotterill told the associated 
press 
but he added that no cars were known to have been hit as the 
plane thundered alongside the m1 englands main northsouth highway 
the highway was closed as dozens of ambulances and fire engines 
converged on the scene cries for help could be heard from inside 
the fuselage personal belongings littered the highway 
rescuers dug steps into the embankment and formed a human chain 
from the wreckage to the ambulances they flattened trees and hacked 
open the fuselage 
the cockpit with a large chunk of fuselage came to rest in thick 
brambles and trees near the top of the embankment 
the pilot capt kevin hunt was hospitalized with multiple 
injuries british midland said 
a local vicar the rev michael brandon said he held a 
passengers hand and whispered the lords prayer to him as he died 
it was very dignified and peaceful there is not a lot more you 
can do in a situation like this he said 
the crippled jet roared over 16yearold samantha phelbys house 
just before it hit the ground 
we looked outside as it got louder and as it was going overhead 
we saw the left engine still on fire then we heard this pop which 
could have been the crash then we heard the fire engines she 
told independent radio news 
desmond anderson who lives 400 yards from the airports main 
runway said the far side engine was on fire backfiring and 
roaring away 
an automobile association manager john mcknight said there 
are still people trapped and work is going on to free them from the 
reports i have had there is a terrific amount of wreckage its a 
hell of a mess 
british midland chairman michael bishop said said the pilot 
reported severe vibrations in one of the engines and asked 
clearance for an emergency landing at the airport 
bishop said the company had taken delivery of the plane only 12 
weeks ago 
civil aviation authority spokeswoman ann noonan said the pilot 
reported problems in his no 2 engine and was having trouble 
climbing the twoengined aircraft disappeared off ground control 
radar screens at 815 pm 
the boeing 737400 is a version of the boeing 737 with a longer 
fuselage and can carry 146 passengers it was introduced last year

political parties are struggling to emerge in 
this british colony but face the formidable hurdles of apathy 
public distrust and a wary communist china which gains sovereignty 
over the territory in 1997 
attempts to form the groups comes as britain prepares to hold 
hong kongs first general legislative elections and china appears to 
have reluctantly dropped its opposition to such activity 
the organizations will be different from westernstyle political 
parties because they will not be able to form a sovereign 
government instead they will be limited to trying to influence the 
outgoing british rulers and pursuing whatever local power beijing 
permits under the high degree of autonomy it promises for this 
capitalist enclave after 1997 
the administration of hong kong will be in the hands of hong 
kong people so in that sense we still have a lot of power said 
yeung sum chairman of meeting point a pressure group of about 300 
members that views itself as a future party 
in recent weeks businessman stephen cheong and lawyer martin 
lee both members of the colonys legislative council have 
announced plans to form political parties councilor maria tams 
progressive hong kong society also is mentioned as an emerging party 
those groups are expected to participate in general elections to 
be held in 1991 for 10 of 56 seats on the council which is 
primarily a forum to debate policy made by the british governor and 
his advisers the council now consists of government officials 
government appointees and representatives of interest groups and 
local advisory boards 
the 1991 elections will be run on party lines im quite 
sure said joseph ys cheng a political scientist at the chinese 
university of hong kong but the groups will face huge problems in 
gathering support from hong kongs 57 million people who 
traditionally distrust political parties 
families who fled to the coastal enclave blame chinas myriad 
20th century woes on both the communists and nationalists who moved 
to taiwan after the 1949 revolution both parties operate 
unofficially in hong kong 
people in hong kong feel very comfortable with the status quo 
and they are afraid of political activities political 
confrontation cheng said 
yeung acknowledged that meeting point had not clearly declared 
itself a political party for so long because all through the 
years people have been skeptical of the label cheong rejects 
the party label for his new group 
political scientist peter harris of the university of hong kong 
believes the groups will have trouble winning broad backing he said 
the mass of the hong kong people are more interested in 
getting the kids to school their understanding of issues is still 
in a very inchoate stage 
attempts by civic leaders three years ago to form political 
parties stalled not from apathy but because of chinas opposition 
according to lee 
that stance appears to have softened however with the onset of 
legislative elections that china has promised will continue after 
1997 
xu jiatun chinas main representative in hong kong said early 
this month that the new constitution being drafted for the territory 
effectively allows political parties 
many of the emerging political groups have not clearly stated an 
ideology and may be identified primarily by the personality of their 
leaders some of those leaders may seek to become hong kongs first 
chief executive which will be the top local post after the british 
leave 
cheong said his group will call for stability and only gradual 
political change while lee is the territorys most vocal advocate 
of sweeping democratic reform threeyearold meeting points goals 
include a high degree of self administration for the territory after 
1997 a central social security fund and more education subsidies 
yeung said 
lee believes the major issue dividing the parties will be whether 
they speak primarily for beijing or hong kong interests 
one big question is whether the chinese communist party in hong 
kong which now works behind the scenes will go above ground to 
openly participate in elections 
that would frighten the industrialists away immediately 
said lee 
despite the growing activity of local political groups harris 
sees little hope for them to wield real power noting that 
authoritarian communist countries such as china do not accept 
challenges to their rule

they were lukewarm about the declaration 
of independence and the constitution they opposed the war of 1812 
and in presidential elections they voted against their neighbor 
john kennedy and their governor michael dukakis 
the people of this cape cod community have never gone with the 
flow and they show no signs of changing as they celebrate 
barnstables 350th anniversary this year 
i hate to use the cliche yankee independence but i suspect 
there is an aspect of that said patricia duffy who has been 
helping compile a lengthy history of the town for use in the school 
curriculum we are cautious we dont jump on any bandwagons 
barnstable lives in the shadow of its neighbors hyannis and 
hyannisport made famous by the kennedy clan 
but hyannis and hyannisport are not officially incorporated as 
towns they are merely two of seven villages in the town of 
barnstable which occupies the midsection of the cape 
barnstable is the principal municipality of barnstable county 
which encompasses all of cape cod its the states third largest 
community geographically and has a yearround population of about 
35000 that doubles during summer 
but few outside new england know its name although residents 
hope to change that with a 12month celebration that promises much 
variety if little peace and quiet 
festivities include a summer rowing regatta a colonial costume 
day a publishing party for the cape cod almanac and a boston pops 
concert on the hyannis town green 
the big celebration comes in early september the actual 
anniversary month and includes a visit by a delegation from 
barnstables namesake barnstable england 
the events the town will commemorate began in september 1639 
when barnstable was incorporated under a land grant from the plimoth 
colony 
the town history describes reaction to the american revolution as 
mixed with wealthy tories quarreling with patriots over british 
domination john crocker whose ancestors were among the towns 
first 45 inhabitants puts it in physical terms in the crocker 
tavern still standing there is a gouge out of one of the beams 
where a couple of fellows had a sword fight over the issue 
the town neither endorsed nor opposed the declaration of 
independence a town meeting initially voted against the us 
constitution because it lacked a bill of rights 
the people were more wealthy down here and they were tending 
toward the status quo said robert oleary a social studies 
teacher 
early thriving industries included cranberry harvesting which 
survives to this day shipbuilding lumbering oystering and 
extraction of salt from the ocean today tourism dominates 
because of the importance of sea trade to barnstable the 
townspeople opposed the war of 1812 against britain this time there 
was no give to their position isaiah l green the areas us 
representative voted for the declaration of war and lost his seat 
according to the school department history 
residents remember the kennedy era fondly they speak of john f 
kennedy parading through town after his democratic presidential 
nomination and of his victory speech in hyannis after the 1960 
election 
but at the polls residents favored richard nixon by 4515 to 
2783 they had no greater favoriteson feelings last year when 
george bush beat dukakis 10026 to 9971 
joseph kennedy brought his family to hyannisport in 1926 but it 
wasnt until his son became a national figure that the sandy beaches 
and sunshine of cape cod gained national attention and later 
unrestrained development say local historians 
the beauty uniqueness and excitement of the cape portrayed by 
the press put barnstable on the map and in the world spotlight 
according to the school department narrative 
cape codders regret some of the growth as they showed last fall 
when they supported a nonbinding resolution in favor of a building 
moratorium former us sen paul tsongas a cape cod summer 
resident said the problems on cape cod are as much aesthetic as 
environmental 
much of what has been built on route 28 in hyannis is 
schlock tsongas said if the development that took place was 
architecturally consistent with the cape it would not have been 
half as offensive as it is

the number of students entering nursing school 
jumped 11 percent last year because of higher salaries and a healthy 
job market according to the magazine that surveyed more than 220 
schools 
the increase follows a nearly a onethird drop from 1983 to 1987 
schools responding to the annual survey to be published today by 
the trade magazine nursingworld journal had a total of 15494 
freshmen in 1988 up from 13970 in 1987 
probably the most important thing is that there has been so 
much publicity about the national shortage of nurses publisher 
richard a devito said friday 
but a more troubling factor devito said is that many schools 
have reduced entry level grade point averages to attract more 
applicants perhaps as a result he said graduate nurses failed 
their licensing exams at a record rate of 16 percent in 1988 four 
times the 1987 level 
the journal said it sent its survey to 1491 us nursing schools 
and received responses from 227 institutions in 44 states 
hospital officials hailed the finding as good news for the 
nations health care system which has been strained by a 
significant and persistent shortage of nurses according to a 
december report by the commission on nursing of the us department 
of health and human services 
about 300000 nursing jobs were unfilled nationwide the american 
nurses association estimated last year 
devito said the shortage has had a direct impact on wages 
pushing up starting salaries for registered nurses by an average of 
5000 to 6000 during the last five years registered nurses now 
typically start at 22000 to 28000 a year depending on region 
and experienced nurses earn up to 55000 in some cities he said 
according to the survey licensed practical nursing programs 
experienced the greatest increase in beginning students in 1988 
with a 254 percent jump hospitalbased diploma programs were next 
with a 146 percent rise 
baccalaureate programs at fouryear colleges and universities saw 
a 107 percent increase the smallest change was in associate degree 
programs offered by twoyear junior colleges which reported 87 
percent more freshmen 
devito cautioned that because of the decline in entrance 
requirements the overall increase of 11 percent may not necessarily 
translate into an 11 percent rise in the number of graduates 
the problem its going to create is that while we have roughly 
a big increase in freshman enrollees theyve lowered the admission 
standards so we may have fewer people who are going to be able to 
make the grade he said

attorney general dick thornburgh said the 
reagan administration did not try to thwart independent counsel 
lawrence walsh from pursuing his investigation of the irancontra 
affair 
thornburgh said sunday that walsh had assured him before dropping 
two key charges against oliver north that he had been dealt with 
in good faith and had gotten full cooperation from the 
intelligence community 
thornburghs comments on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley came after questions of whether he realized his 
administrations decision to withhold some classified evidence on 
national security grounds would force the prosecutor to drop some 
charges against the fired national security council aide 
the attorney general said he himself was concerned about any 
impression there was some kind of coverup or stonewalling of the 
independent counsels office 
in a meeting wednesday the day before walsh moved to drop the 
charges thornburgh said he asked for walshs personal assurance 
that he had been able to follow every line of inquiry that was 
available that he had had full cooperation from the intelligence 
community and that everyone he dealt with had acted in good 
faith 
walsh had no hesitation in satisfying my concerns on that 
score said thornburgh walsh has not commented publicly on the 
matter 
thornburgh said it was inherent that if the documents were 
withheld it would have an eroding effect on the quality of the 
governments case against north but the decision was judge 
walshs 
thornburgh said that apart from revealing national security 
secrets a criminal trial on the original charges probably would not 
have revealed anything that would surprise anybody in light of 
the tower commission report and congressional investigation of the 
irancontra affair 
north is scheduled to go on trial jan 31 on a dozen remaining 
felony counts including obstruction of congressional and 
presidential inquiries false statements to congress and improperly 
converting travelers checks belonging to the nicaraguan contras to 
his own use

americans generally agree that homelessness is 
widespread and worsening and most are dissatisfied with the 
governments response and would be willing to pay more taxes to 
combat the problem a poll has found 
a plurality of the 1084 adults surveyed in the media 
generalassociated press poll primarily faulted society rather than 
the homeless for homelessness 
a plurality also said the federal government is chiefly 
responsible for solutions 
the poll exhibited the broad reach of homelessness six in 10 
said homeless people were in their communities and threequarters 
said the problem plagues communities of all sizes not just big 
cities 
accordingly respondents rated the problem as extraordinarily 
severe sixtyeight percent called it very serious and 24 
percent said fairly serious the remainder gave it less 
importance 
the national poll conducted by telephone among a random sample 
of adults nov 1020 had a 3point margin of error it was 
completed before winters cold increased attention on the homeless 
still nearly seven in 10 respondents said homelessness was 
getting worse a quarter said it was unchanged and 3 percent saw 
improvement the remainder had no opinion 
views were divided on the responsibility for solutions 
thirtytwo percent said the federal government was primarily 
responsible 24 percent said state governments 18 percent said 
local governments and 9 percent said private charities the rest had 
no answer 
wherever prime responsibility lies only 27 percent said the 
federal government was doing enough to prevent people from becoming 
homeless and 58 percent said it was not the remaining 15 percent 
had no opinion 
a solid 60 percent said federal spending on programs for the 
homeless should be increased and 86 percent of that group said they 
would be willing to pay higher taxes for that purpose that totaled 
52 percent overall an unusually high level of acquiescence to 
higher taxes 
on specific programs 62 percent said the federal government 
should spend more on housing for the homeless and as many favored 
the preventive measure of building more federally subsidized housing 
for the poor 
in virtually all these measures homelessness was seen as severe 
and worsening by a greater share of women democrats liberals 
minorities and younger people they also were more apt to blame 
society and to favor a greater federal response 
seventyeight percent of women rated the problem as very 
serious compared with 56 percent of men for example 
eightythree percent of democrats said it was getting worse 
compared with 54 percent of republicans and sixtyfour percent of 
liberals said society was at fault compared with 37 percent of 
conservatives 
an economic division also existed among respondents with lower 
income americans more likely to view the problem as serious and to 
favor greater responses of those with family incomes less than 
25000 a year for instance 73 percent favored more subsidized 
housing but among those earning more than 50000 just 54 percent 
agreed 
the survey found split views on the issue of people living on the 
streets by choice of those with an opinion 45 percent said people 
should be allowed to live on the streets if they want to but 51 
percent said they should not have that right 
finally the survey asked who was mainly at fault for 
homelessness society or the homeless themselves fortyfive 
percent said society was primarily to blame 33 percent said the 
homeless and 22 percent had no answer

aid to education prison overcrowding insurance reform property 
tax relief and the environment are among the issues challenging 
state lawmakers this year but none looms as large as the battle of 
the budget 
its income vs spending and if revenues are up so are costs of 
services just to stay even is more expensive without talking about 
adding money for things like schools road repair or social services 
what we face in the coming months will not be easy 
connecticut gov william a oneill said last week in his 
stateofthestate address we will have to say no when we 
really want to say yes 
some states including alaska california connecticut iowa 
louisiana massachusetts montana new york and west virginia are 
running in the red or face deficits in the coming fiscal year 
others like illinois have avoided deficits by nofrills budgets 
and face a backlash from the lean years 
a lucky few are running surpluses heating up debate on what to 
do with the largesse 
caution abounds new york and massachusetts saw surpluses of a 
few years ago turn to deficits at least 636 million in 
massachusetts current 116 billion budget and more than 1 billion 
in new yorks budget of more than 28 billion 
states expecting to do well this year hawaii kansas 
minnesota nevada oregon utah virginia idaho and maryland are 
fearful of the same thing happening to them 
its real easy to make a tax cut right now and we all look 
good for reelection says hawaii house finance committee chairman 
joseph souki but is that the wisest thing 
lawmakers having read voters lips are loath to talk about 
hiking taxes the idea is being mentioned mainly in the states with 
the biggest money woes and the most likely candidates are increased 
taxes on cigarettes alcohol and gasoline rather than raising state 
income taxes 
spending on education has perhaps the highest priority even in 
west virginia with a fiscal headache totaling 680 million 
govelect gaston caperton has promised unspecified raises to the 
states teachers who rank 46th nationally in salaries illinois 
education officials who have gone two years without a significant 
budget increase are expected to seek increases totaling more than 
600 million this year 
coupled with increasing aid to education is the need in some 
states to restructure the system for public school financing to 
reduce the disparities between rich and poor districts montanas 
legislature must fashion a new system to replace one that a state 
court last year declared unconstitutional 
prisons are another bigticket item michigan is in the middle of 
a massive prison building program by 1991 the state will have 
spent 900 million to build 28 prisons and if projections hold 
true the system still will be overcrowded 
the cost of operating prisons is eating us alive said 
michigan senate appropriations chairman harry gast 
virginia is building two new prisons to increase its inmate 
capacity by 2600 but corrections officials say the state still 
will be at least 1000 beds short in a few years and more money will 
be sought 
the cost of crime is expensive so we must accept the fact that 
the money drawn to support the criminal justice system is money that 
we will not have for the wide range of other important needs 
throughout the commonwealth said gov gerald l baliles 
once lawmakers have their budget priorities settled they still 
wont lack for issues 
rising auto insurance costs are expected to be debated in new 
jersey pennsylvania and south carolina and california is awaiting 
the results of a court challenge to proposition 103 a voter 
initiative passed last november that requires a 20 percent rate 
rollback for most kinds of insurance and tougher state regulation of 
insurers 
the environment and waste disposal is another sore spot for some 
states new jersey suffered a second consecutive summer of beach 
closings because of high bacteria levels and medical waste washing 
ashore and the legislature passed a series of measures designed to 
help clean up the states ocean waters 
however other proposals to track the disposal of medical waste 
impose tougher penalties on polluters and create a powerful 
commission to protect the coast remain mired in disputes 
south carolina residents are clamoring for reductions in the 
amount of hazardous waste buried in a landfill used by more than 30 
other states and the legislature is studying ways to deal with 
rapidly filling solidwaste landfills also a consideration in new 
hampshire

a flock of ducks that waddle 
through yards and dirty the streets has prompted a neighborhood 
civil war of sorts in which both sides are crying foul about the 
others tactics 
the domesticated muscovy duck population has swelled to 200 
prompting some to begin efforts to reduce their numbers the methods 
have included egg stealing trapping maiming and ducks being run 
down by motorists 
the ducks got caught in a people problem says jim 
vanairsdale a produck member of a committee named by the city 
commission to try to resolve the yearlong dispute its sad what 
has happened 
those in favor of the ducks claim the animals were in the 
woodland neighborhood when the middle to upperclass area was 
established more than 20 years ago opponents say the birds are too 
aggressive leave droppings underfoot and mate in public 
many in this oceanside city of 3200 people agreed the duck 
population should be reduced and the dispute has been focused on 
how many ducks would be allowed for some people one muscovy is one 
duck too many 
a duck trapper was hired to relocate the ducks to georgia but 
there were questions about the humaneness of his trapping methods 
the st augustine humane society helped catch others but they 
relocated them too close enabling some to return 
the ducks are such an emotional issue here that they dominated 
three monthly meetings of the st augustine beach city commission 
one meeting erupted into namecalling before commissioner pete 
dodson suggested last summer that a committee find a solution 
i agreed to act as a moderator two people from each side were 
appointed to act as a committee he said 
weve got to live together and stop this monkey business 
at the committees first meeting dodson asked each member to 
tell him how many ducks should be allowed 
the numbers began at zero with the average being 17 which 
became the standard 
then bill van marter a former city commissioner who had 
supported ridding the neighborhood of muscovy ducks complained in 
august that his wife and granddaughter were attacked by a rogue 
drake in their back yard 
mrs van marter who declined to be interviewed told officials 
at the time that she was forced to fling the bird as big as a 
turkey into a nearby palm tree to stop the attack 
after the attack the committee voted to reduce the muscovy 
population to nine adult birds where it stands 
efforts also were started to filch eggs from nests 
but when reports surfaced that motorists were purposely running 
down the ducks and that ducks were being maimed by having their legs 
hacked off the dispute intensified 
kathryne grove who witnessed one of the ducks being run down 
said i was sick at my stomach why would anyone have to murder 
them or run them down 
during a recent 30minute tour of the 80home area only six 
ducks were spotted including one getting a douse from a hose 
wielded by a woman trying to get it off her property 
the florida aubudon society has little good to say about the 
muscovy ducks a domesticated version of the wild ones in mexico and 
south america 
these things are a cancer they are not supposed to be here 
said wes biggs state coordinator of the societys florida breeding 
bird atlas project 
they are a real nuisance and we would be better off without 
them he said adding that little old lady bunny huggers 
compound the problem by feeding them and treating them as pets 
but now that the duck population has been lowered dodson 
believes the situation will improve 
im very optimistic the problem will be solved he said

china today released a 33yearold dissident who 
was active in the prodemocracy movement in shanghai and whose case 
was taken up by the us congress 
yang wei a former student at the university of arizona walked 
from ti lan qiao prison in shanghai today after serving one year of 
a twoyear sentence 
fu fenghao an official at the shanghai foreign affairs office 
said because yang spent about a year in custody before being 
sentenced he was let out on time 
in a telephone interview with the associated press yang said his 
first concern upon release was the health of his father who has 
cancer 
im going to see him today said yang he is in the 
hospital and he is in serious condition 
yang was sentenced in december 1987 for demagogical propoganda 
for counterrevolutionary ends 
he had been held without charges since january 1987 in connection 
with prodemocracy student demonstrations in shanghai in 1986 
yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing 
for china spring the banned periodical of the chinese alliance 
for democracy a new yorkbased dissident group but he said he was 
unclear whether he would continue working for political change in 
china 
i just got out he said so i dont really understand 
whats happening in society when i determine that then i will make 
a decision 
yang described his treatment in prison as pretty good 
it seemed that i was given special treatment he said 
yang who received a masters degree in molecular biology from 
arizona said he wanted to return to the united states to continue 
his studies 
sources close to the family said yangs release was delayed by 
several hours today because three members of the chinese alliance 
for democracy were apprehended in shanghai over the weekend with 
copies of china spring and a letter for yang 
the alliance was set up in 1983 by a former chinese citizen to 
promote democracy in china chinese officials have declared it an 
illegal reactionary organization 
two of the men huang han of canada and bell ms wong an 
american who also goes by the name huang wencheng were ordered out 
of china and flew to hong kong the official china daily said today 
the third man tang guangzhong flew back to the united states to 
continue studies at utah state university 
the report said the three acknowledged they were members of the 
alliance it also said they had admitted breaking the law 
it was not clear why tang a chinese citizen was allowed to 
return to the united states 
during yangs trial in 1987 the court said he put up 
reactionary slogans at shanghais fudan university on dec 22 
1986 and sent letters to students in canton and beijing inciting 
them to protest 
hundreds of thousands of students marched in dozens of cities 
during the winter of 198687 calling for democracy 
on dec 3 1987 the us congress passed an amendment to a state 
department appropriations bill calling for yangs release saying he 
had broken no chinese or us laws 
china called the amendment an undisguised interference in 
chinas internal affairs 
yangs wife che shaoli lives in houston and studies 
microbiology at the baylor college of medicine 
she said she was thrilled at the news of his release 
but i am sad too she said i dont know when i will see 
him

years in a tehran jail claims he was trying to join afghan 
guerrillas when iranian border guards seized him on the 
iranpakistan frontier

britain on dec 27 after his release as saying he had been kept 
mostly in solitary confinement except for a weekly shower and 
interrogation 
he also confirmed reports that he had been tried although 
because the trial was held in the farsi language said he had been 
unaware he was serving a 3year sentence for possessing weapons 
the newspaper reported 
nicola bought a ticket to pakistan in 1986 in order to join the 
afghan rebels fighting the sovietbacked communist government the 
mail said 
my thoughts were to go and find the mujahedeen moslem 
guerrillas so i could fight against the russians the weekly 
paper quoted him as saying soviets troops have backed afghanistans 
communist government against the guerrillas in a decadeold conflict 
dressed in afghan clothes and carrying a rifle and pistol he had 
bought at a market nicola told the paper he was in pakistan on the 
border with iran when an iranian patrol began running toward him 
i think they saw my guns he was quoted as saying 
one fired two shots and without thinking i fired two shots 
into the air with the rifle he was quoted as saying

prison he said after his trial he remained at tehrans maximum 
security evin prison the report said 
nicola said he wasnt sure what to do with his life now the 
paper reported 
i have been too naive he was quoted as saying i had 
romantic ideas from the movies i know it isnt like that now 
his release was the latest sign of a thaw in relations between 
the countries since they virtually cut diplomatic ties in 1987 after 
a dispute which began when british police arrested an iranian envoy 
on shoplifting charges 
roger cooper a british businessman who has lived in iran for 
more than 20 years has been jailed there without trial for more

this normally quiet central pennsylvania 
community of about 7700 has issued a rather loud eviction notice to 
unwanted crows 
after five days last week of trying to shoo the birds with loud 
noise officials said the number of crow sightings in town markedly 
decreased 
about 35000 crows were estimated to be in the area at sundown 
friday as a propane gasfired cannon was being set up to scare them 
the birds soon flew away 
police concluded the effort against the birds saturday morning by 
firing off several noisemakers to chase the few crows that had 
returned 
various kinds of fireworks had been set off since tuesday to 
convince the birds that trees in milton are unacceptable places for 
them to roost at night 
it remains to be seen whether the crows will return so residents 
have continued their noisemaking to ensure that their unwanted 
visitors stay away 
resident vida switzer for instance bangs a wooden spoon against 
a castiron frying pan and thomas deans claps his hands when he 
walks to and from work

afghan guerrilla leaders refused today 
to resume direct talks with the soviets accusing moscow of playing 
political games aimed at securing its communist proteges in kabul a 
place in a postwar government 
the guerrillas promised not to attack departing red army troops 
but said their decision to break off negotiations means fighting is 
likely to continue after feb 15 when the 50000 soviet troops 
remaining in afghanistan are to withdraw under a unbrokered 
accord 
the pakistanbased guerrilla leaders ended talks with soviet 
deputy foreign minsiter yuli vorontsov on saturday deadlocked over 
the composition of a postwar government but saying they were ready 
to meet again 
but vorontsov later told reporters that moscow would find a way 
to support its marxist allies in kabul if a broadbased government 
that includes communists is not in place feb 15 
moslem insurgents who have been fighting the sovietbacked 
communist regime in kabul for a decade have unanimously rejected 
the participation of any of its members in a postwar government 
today the spokesman for the usbacked insurgents sibghatullah 
mojaddidi told a news conference 
because the soviets use threats look for war rather than 
peace and disrespect afghans right of selfdetermination we 
believe that negotiations are unproductive and unnecessary 
the soviets have threatened that if their terms are not 
accepted they will supply new weapons not deployed before to 
afghan president najibs regime after the withdrawal said 
mojaddidi the soviets efforts to impose a government of their 
choice on the afghan nation will protract the war and kill our 
people 
although mojaddidi ruled out the ceasefire sought by vorontsov 
but promised that moslem guerrillas called mujahedeen or islamic 
holy warriors would not attack departing soviet soldiers 
he said vorontsov was told we can only order mujahedeen not to 
attack your withdrawing troops we can give you peace to 
pass 
the soviet envoy has said moscow will meet the february 
withdrawal deadline unless departing soviet soldiers are attacked by 
guerrillas 
it could be delayed if there were all out fighting on soviet 
forces if there were attacks on soviet forces withdrawing 
vorontsov said earlier 
more than 100000 red army troops moved into afghanistan in 
december 1979 and replaced one promoscow regime with another in 
april the kremlin agreed to withdraw its forces by feb half had 
left by august 
vorontsov has been on a diplomatic mission since early december 
seeking a political consensus on a broadbased government to step 
into the breach following the withdrawal 
he has met with the iran and pakistanbased guerrilla groups 
which both agree that najibs ruling party can play no part in a 
postwar government about 3 million afghan refugees live in 
pakistan another 2 million in iran 
modaddidi said the decision to break off the talks means fighting 
is likely to continue beyond feb 15 
he predicted that the guerrillas allies most notably the united 
states and pakistan will continue their support after the red army 
leaves and predicted that the current kabul government will collapse 
within months of the final soviet pullout 
the pakistanbased guerrilla alliance the dominant insurgent 
force has said it plans to form a council that would at the 
collapse of najibs government choose a transitional government 
from within its ranks 
both pakistan and iranbased guerrillas would nominate council 
members

david o dodd took his secrets to the 
grave after he was hanged at age 17 for being a confederate spy 125 
years ago 
a coded message detailing union positions around little rock 
after the city fell to union troops in september 1863 was found in 
his boot 
but dodd refused to answer questions or testify at a 
courtmartial 
dodd was convicted of spying for the confederacy and hanged jan 
8 1864 
on sunday civil war enthusiasts gathered at dodds plot in mount 
holly cemetery to mark the 125th anniversary of his execution about 
40 people half in civil war dress stood in the cold as william 
w odonnell of little rock author of articles about dodd 
proclaimed him the boy martyr of the confederacy 
its a story of unbounded courage odonnell said 
a crowd of 6000 some of whom walked across the frozen arkansas 
river witnessed dodds hanging near downtown little rock the 
execution took five minutes and wasnt over until a union soldier 
climbed the gallows to jerk the rope odonnell said 
dodd was one of the youngest ever executed as a spy said 
jerry russell a member of the civil war roundtable of arkansas 
dodds fate began to unravel in late december 1863 he traveled 
south from little rock surrendering his pass to get through a union 
roadblock after spending the night with a relative dodd headed 
back toward the occupied city 
the union lines had moved out a couple of miles the next day 
since dodd had surrendered his pass he couldnt get through 
russell said 
there wasnt a real tight ring of steel around the town he 
might have gotten through with his information if dodd had really 
been the sneaky type he would have gone through the woods 
apparently he was not sneakily inclined and thought he could go 
through the roadblock 
the offer to betray his allies was extended to dodd by gen 
frederick steele who in his written reports felt really bad 
about it he was very anguished over this thing but they could not 
condone spying russell said 
dodd also wouldnt tell why he was carrying the message which 
was in morse code why did he do it why he never told anybody 
odonnell said he never took the stand in his own defense how 
could a 17yearold have so much courage to face the gallows without 
trying to escape 
in a letter to his family on the day he died dodd wrote i was 
arrested as a spy and tried and sentenced to be hung today at 3 
oclock the time is fast approaching but thank god i am prepared to 
die i expect to meet you all in heaven do not weep for me for i 
will be better off in heaven 
on sunday the lords prayer and a 21gun salute echoed in the 
windswept cemetery seconds passed between each of the three volleys 
as seven riflemen reloaded their blackpowder weapons 
anthony rushing 26 of west memphis who wore a gray civil war 
coat in the ceremonys color guard said his image of dodd comes as 
much from the heart as from the history books 
he was done an injustice i think they were trying to make an 
example of him he was a hero rushing said

the neglect of todays children could 
lead to deficiencies in tomorrows work force lt gov marlene 
johnson of minnesota warned participants in the second womens 
agenda conference 
in the concluding session of the conference sunday participants 
also were asked for a renewed commitment to maintaining legalized 
abortion and the development of a national coalition 
johnson said a lack of adequate child care kept many parents from 
participating in the economy 
ms johnson also said there was a need for women in leadership 
positions and called on her listeners to work to develop leaders 
from within their ranks 
we need to keep fighting the battles she said but we also 
need to keep nurturing each other to become stronger and more 
effective in the larger community 
the conference organized by the national federation of business 
and professional womens clubs began friday it was sponsored by 
more than 50 organizations nationwide 
dolly adams of the black womens agenda encouraged the 
development of a national womens coalition she said such a group 
would need to have a larger vision than those of the individual 
organizations involved 
other issues discussed sunday included poverty among older women 
the need to bring divorced and widowed women into the work place 
and the possibility of a renewed campaign for an equal rights 
amendment 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said that if abortion rights are abridged 
1989 could be the year that women were put back in their place 
we are in danger right now of losing our vital right to decide 
whether to have a child or not and under what circumstances she 
said 
ms michelman told the audience that the 1973 roe vs wade 
decision by the supreme court occurred against the backdrop of the 
womens movement 
we instructed the court she said we became their 
conscience we created the context for roe to happen 
ms michelman urged the women to speak out and create a renewed 
climate of activism for the proabortion movement 
you have to go out of here absolutely committed she said 
i plead with you to be a part of millions of voices silent no

investigators today recovered the flight 
recorders from the wreckage of a new boeing 737 that crashed along a 
highway after one engine and possibly both failed at least 43 
people were killed and 83 injured 
firefighters pumped foam onto the crumpled jet to prevent seeping 
aviation fuel from catching fire the belfastbound jet carrying 126 
people broke into three pieces on the edge of britains main 
northsouth highway the m1 in central england on sunday night 
the twinengine boeing 737400 narrowly missed the small town of 
kegworth and plowed into an embankment just a few hundred yards 
short of the runway as the pilot struggled to make an emergency 
landing at east midland airport 100 miles north of london 
one engine was on fire and transport secretary paul channon said 
it certainly looks probable there was a problem with the second 
engine 
british midland airways said sabotage was not suspected in the 
crash which came less than three weeks after a bomb blew apart pan 
am flight 103 over a scottish village lockerbie killing all 259 
people on board and 11 on the ground 
witnesses and a radio operator who monitored the pilots final 
exchanges with air traffic controllers sunday also said both engines 
appeared to have failed 
british midland said the jet was delivered just 12 weeks ago and 
had flown less than 500 hours it grounded its other 737400 for 
inspection 
at the moment it does seem to be a technical problem said 
paul beaver a managing editor of aviation for janes publications 
i think they have ruled out pilot error and almost definitely 
ruled out sabotage 
beaver interviewed on abctvs good morning america said 
the chances of both engines failing were something like a 10 
million to one chance and of course sometimes those chances come 
up 
at least four british soldiers serving in northern ireland were 
among the 43 killed police said 
its amazing no motorists or nearby residents were killed 
leicestershire assistant chief constable tony butler told a news 
conference today its a very busy road 
channon said the fast response of emergency services saved lives 
the airport fire brigade was there within minutes a number 
of people are living as a result 
police said the last person was taken from the wreckage more than 
seven hours after the crash they said it took 2 hours to extract 
the pilot kevin hunt a spokeswoman for the leicester royal 
infirmary said hunt was in poor condition with multiple injuries 
the plane took off from londons heathrow airport at 752 pm 
and about eight minutes later reported severe vibrations in one of 
the engines said airline chairman michael bishop 
the pilot reported an engine on fire then said he had it under 
control and asked for clearance to make an emergency landing at east 
midlands airport the airlines home base 100 miles north of london 
witnesses said the left engine was on fire as the plane crashed 
about a halfmile shy of the runway ham radio operator mervyn 
solloway said that from what he could hear both engines were in 
trouble 
suddenly there was not a shouted message but a bit of a 
frantic one to say weve got problems with the other engine that 
was the last i heard from the aircraft he said 
the aircraft sheared tree tops and plowed into a steep embankment 
by the m1 highway outside the town of kegworth a piece of the jet 
lodged in the highway divider and bodies and personal belongings 
spilled from the plane 
motorists swerved in terror and some cars collided police said 
the tail section embedded in the ground while the fuselage tore 
apart the nose section coming to rest in a bramble thicket 
dozens of fire engines ambulances residents and motorists 
rushed to the scene the engine fire was quickly extinguished and 
rescuers cut passengers loose surgeons performed amputations on the 
spot 
a local episcopal vicar the rev michael brandon recited the 
lords prayer as a man died clutching his hand 
the whole plane is carnage said vic milner an automobile 
association worker people were strapped into their seats dead in 
the tangled body of the plane 
several people in kegworth a town of 2000 residents said that 
when the plane crashed their first thought was of lockerbie the 
little scottish town that bore the brunt of the crash of pan am 
flight 103 on dec 21 
all 259 people aboard that boeing 747 were killed along with 11 
lockerbie residents investigators said a bomb blew up the plane 
in sundays crash there nothing to indicate sabotage 
whatsoever said the airlines marketing director colin roberts 
david learmount of the respected journal flight international 
said the british midland plane must have developed more than just 
a simple engine failure or the pilot could have gotten the plane 
down safely 
he told british broadcasting corp television said the boeing 
737400 has the most brilliant safety record in the world today 
if an airplanes engine catches fire one of the reasons why is 
that the engine which has very fast spinning parts literally 
breaks apart and bits come out through the casing and this can cause 
a fire he said 
in seattle boeing spokesman jack gamble said sundays crash was 
the first involving a 737400 the model had its first flight in 
march and airlines are flying 17 of the jets he said

all five candidates for chairman of the democratic 
national committee played to their southern audience at a weekend 
meeting with the stress on luring moderate and conservative 
southern whites back to the party 
the five candidates met about 100 committee members and party 
activists sunday 
i dont want to run a party that writes off the south said 
washington lawyer ronald h brown who has served in top party posts 
and served as jesse jacksons 1988 convention manager it doesnt 
make sense you cant do it that way 
brown and michigan party chairman richard n wiener who is 
president of the association of state democratic chairs are 
considered favorites but neither candidate has a majority of the 
404member dnc and party leaders believe one of three dark horses 
could win the feb 10 election 
they are former reps michael d barnes of maryland james r 
jones of oklahoma and james v stanton of ohio 
while many party chairmen in the west and midwest have rallied 
around wiener most southern chairmen have remained uncommitted 
much of the talk sunday concerned changing the publics 
perception of the democratic message presidentelect george bush 
swept the south in the november elections just as most republican 
candidates have done for a generation 
the perception is that we are to the left are much more 
liberal than the mainstream voters jones said unless and 
until we recognize that unless and until we bring the party to a 
position that is viewed as centrist and representing the vast 
majority of this very diverse country were not going to win 
elections 
jones advocated a threeyear advertising campaign that would 
attempt to make it respectable to be a democrat again 
wiener said republicans have put six hurdles in the path of 
democrats running for president the issues of national defense 
patriotism crime gun control school prayer and abortion 
we dont have to be to the right of the republicans on those 
issues he said but we need to pass a certain threshold on 
those issues 
he suggested imitating the gop practice of spending heavily on 
issues research to identify democratic strengths and republican 
weaknesses 
southerners remained uncommitted after the meeting 
james van hecke jr the north carolina party chairman said the 
southern chairmen may hold a telephone conference later this week to 
explore the possibility of a group endorsement 
several of the southern party leaders in the audience said they 
appreciated the lip service paid to regional concerns but heard few 
specific solutions 
everybody has said to us for years that the south is the key 
and not one of these candidates disagreed said alan diamonstein 
chairman of the dncs southern caucus but you cant keep saying 
that mathematically the south is the key while not saying how to do 
anything about it

here is the text of the budget message which 
president reagan sent to congress on monday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
eight years ago many in this country were concerned about the 
future of our economy our government and indeed the nation itself 
unemployment was high and rising 
inflation and interest rates were reaching record levels 
our nations defense capabilities had been weakened by neglect 
the international prestige of the us was at low ebb 
to resolve the economic problems then facing us our 
administration proposed a recovery program centering on four 
fundamental principles 
reduce personal and business tax rates 
reduce the rate of growth of federal spending 
reduce the federal regulatory burden by eliminating unnecessary 
restrictions while protecting the publics interest and safety 
support a moderate and steady monetary policy to bring inflation 
under control 
to rebuild our defense capabilities and restore americas 
standing in the world we proposed expanded national security and 
international programs 
we also initiated the largest management improvement program ever 
attempted in order to restore the proper relationships among the 
federal state and local governments and the private sector to 
eliminate waste in federal programs and to introduce management 
controls and efficiencies while improving services 
today the american people can be proud of the progress that has 
been made on each of these fronts 
as a result of this progress america is internally stronger 
internationally more secure and stands taller in the eyes of the 
world than it did eight years ago

entering college freshmen are getting less aid 
from the federal government and are increasingly interested in 
making their educations pay off in cold cash according to a survey 
of more than 300000 students 
the annual survey nonetheless found that students entering 
college in 1988 were more likely than their 1987 counterparts to 
want to pursue graduate study despite the financial obstacles 
and although students are more interested in making money they 
seem less interested in business careers as a means of reaching that 
goal the survey said 
at the same time a record proportion of freshmen reported 
themselves feeling frequently depressed stress over paying for 
college and attaining advanced degrees were possible contributing 
factors 
the findings released sunday by the american council on education 
and the higher education research institute at the university of 
california at los angeles are based on questionnaires filled out by 
308007 freshmen entering 585 twoand fouryear colleges and 
universities the results were adjusted to reflect the total 
population of 164 million firsttime fulltime entering students 
and have a margin of error of plus or minus two points 
only 156 percent of freshmen entering school last fall received 
pell grants the governments major aid program for low and 
middleincome students the survey found that was the lowest level 
since the survey began 23 years ago and less than half the 315 
percent who received pell grants in 1980 
freshman participation in other federal aid programs also fell 
while students reported greater reliance on family contributions 
savings loans and institutional grants 
the amount of pell grant aid awarded to students actually rose 
nearly 57 percent from 1980 to 1988 or 17 percent taking inflation 
into account according to the college board a new yorkbased 
lobbying group 
but during the same period the aid was more sharply aimed at the 
very neediest postsecondary students many of whom shun college in 
favor of vocational schools that teach cosmetology art drama auto 
mechanics business skills or other trades 
victoria tripp an education department spokeswoman said 11 
percent of pell money went to vocational students in 1980 compared 
with 27 percent in 1988 that figure will increase to onethird in 
the early 1990s she predicted the money is targeted to those 
students and there has been a proliferation of those schools 
despite the falloff in college aid a record proportion of 
freshmen said they were interested in pursuing advanced degrees 
587 percent compared with 483 percent in 1980 
the rising degree aspirations suggest that a growing proportion 
of students feel the bachelors degree will not be an adequate 
credential in the job market during the next decade and into the 
next century said kenneth c green associate director of the 
survey 
in line with that a record 726 percent of the freshmen 
indicated making more money was a very important factor in their 
decision to attend college by contrast the proportion who said 
they were going to college to gain a general education declined 
for the 11th straight year to 601 percent 
examining personal habits the survey also found that a 22year 
decline in smoking may be reversing itself in 1966 166 percent of 
the freshmen said they were frequent smokers that fell steadily to 
89 percent in 1987 but rose to 101 percent among those entering 
college last fall 
a record high percentage of freshmen 105 percent said they 
frequently felt depressed while there was no real change in those 
rating their emotional health as above average 561 percent as 
opposed to 568 percent in 1987 
survey director alexander astin of ucla said the survey revealed 
several potential sources of increased stress for students 
including concern about paying for college increased interest in 
advanced degrees and tougher competition for admission to selective 
institutions 
on the career front the survey found that freshman interest in 
entering the business world to be leveling off 246 percent in 
1987 and 236 percent in 1988 after two decades of steady gains 
the results suggest that student interest in business careers may 
have reached a plateau after the dramatic increases of the 1970s and 
1980s survey officials said 
student interest in teaching rose from 81 percent in 1987 to 88 
percent in 1988 reflecting a trend that started in 1983 after 
interest had bottomed out at 47 percent in 1982 
but interest in science careers steadily falling in popularity 
for the last 20 years remained low only 58 percent of the 
freshmen said they planned to pursue science majors compared with 6 
percent in 1987 and 115 percent in 1973

irans foreign minister said today that prospects 
for success in iraniraq peace talks are dim but he said his 
country is ready to agree to an international ban on chemical 
weapons whether or not iraq signs 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati attending an international 
conference on chemical weapons said he had met with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to discuss the 8yearold 
iraniraq war 
a ceasefire began aug 20 and negotiations aimed at achieving a 
lasting peace began a few days later 
the situation remains volatile and prospects for progress are 
dim velayati told reporters five months after the ceasefire 
iraq is still in our territory 
tehran radio said today the islamic republic has always 
demonstrated its willingness to participate in the talks but until 
while iraq continues to introduce subterfuges a resumption of 
talks will achieve nothing 
the commentary monitored in nicosia gave the strongest 
indication yet that iran may not return to the negotiating table 
without guarantees of concrete results 
the un security council and all countries which support its 
ceasefire resolution must not expect iran to be optimistic about 
the talks until while iraq still refuses to withdraw from iranian 
territory said the broadcast 
tehrans accusation that baghdad is dragging its feet comes 
several days after iraqi president saddam hussein claimed iran was 
massing troops along the 730mile border and probably planning new 
aggression he also accused tehran of stalling in the peace talks 
in paris velayati said perez de cuellar is sending highlevel 
envoys to baghdad and tehran soon and we welcome them 
iraq has used chemical weapons and velayati called his 
countrymen the most conspicuous victims of violations of the 
1925 geneva protocol which bans the use of such weapons iraq 
admitted using chemical weapons in the war but said iran used them 
first 
velayati repeated iranian claims that his country did not use the 
weapons 
asked if iran would be willing to sign an accord expanding the 
chemical weapons ban if iraq refused to sign velayati said we 
are ready to participate in any global or regional activities on 
chemical weapons 
velayati also said he met early today with william waldegrave 
head of the british delegation to discuss british hostages being 
held in lebanon 
he said iran had been asked for help and that in the past they 
had tried to assist france west germany even the united states 
in obtaining freedom for hostages held in lebanon 
we do hope all nationals will be released he said 
fifteen foreigners including nine americans are held hostage in 
lebanon the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was abducted march 16

seven palestinians were 
reported shot and wounded in clashes with israeli troops today and 
a general strike shut down the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the daily haaretz newspaper said defense minister yitzhak rabin 
had renewed secret contacts with palestinians to discuss holding 
municipal elections in the occupied territories for the first time 
since 1976 
meetings at rabins tel aviv office were held in secret to 
protect arab participants from attacks by palestinian nationalists 
the hebrewlanguage paper said 
the plobacked underground leadership of the 13month uprising 
rejected israeli moves for elections and called for escalation of 
the arab revolt in a leaflet distributed in the territories 
the army imposed curfews on four gaza strip refugee camps and two 
neighborhoods of gaza city and rafah confining 135000 palestinians 
to their homes 
a military spokesman confirmed four palestinians were wounded 
during clashes with troops in the west bank refugee camp of farah 
near nablus he said the army was checking other reported casualties 
arab hospital officials said two of the wounded were in critical 
condition with bullet wounds to the stomach 
three other teenagers were hospitalized with less serious bullet 
wounds according to hospital officials 
also today arab residents of the west bank village of kfar nakif 
threw a firebomb at an israeli car which exploded but caused no 
damage arab reports said the attack prompted a raid on the village 
by a group of jewish settlers who threw rocks that damaged two 
palestinian cars the reports said 
the army said it was investigating the report 
in gaza city residents hung outlawed palestinian flags and 
photographs of plo chief yasser arafat from electricity lines 
according to arab reporters 
troops used tear gas to break up a demonstration in the west bank 
refugee camp of dheishe near bethlehem after youths began stoning 
soldiers guarding the camp entrance 
by official count 348 palestinians and 15 israelis have been 
killed in the uprising 
the strike call by the plobacked leadership came after a 
shutdown was ordered by a rival islamic fundamentalist group hamas 
which means zeal in arabic 
past hamas strikes have sparked confrontations with plo 
supporters who demanded merchants not obey the orders but 
palestinians close to the leadership said the group decided to avoid 
confrontation this time 
the united leadership has started to realize that hamas has the 
power to enforce a strike and they wanted credit for todays 
strike said a proplo activist who gave his name only as ghassan 
hamas supporters warned merchants with graffiti in the west bank 
city of nablus any merchant who opens his shop will find it 
torched to the ground said the warnings painted in red 
other slogans signed by hamas and the extremist popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command criticized recent moves 
for a negotiated settlement of the arabisraeli conflict 
no to negotiation no to recognition of israel said one 
slogan

as a result of our greater strength we were able to negotiate 
with the soviet union a verifiable treaty that completely eliminates 
an entire class of nuclear missiles 
we began the strategic defense initiative research and 
technology program that offers our best hope of a safer world in 
which our security and that of our allies no longer rests on 
deterrence through the threat of nuclear retaliation but on 
defenses that threaten no one 
our willingness to defend freedom throughout the world has met

the one area in which i have been persistently disappointed 
throughout my term of office has been in the efforts to bring the 
budget under control 
time and again i have proposed measures to help curb federal 
domestic program spending time and again these proposals have been 
rejected by congress 
the reasons for the rise in the federal deficit in the early 
1980s are simple 
first we experienced one of the most severe recessions of the 
postwar period 
it has been estimated that 81 percent over 640 billion of 
the growth of the deficit over the 19811986 levels originally 
projected in my march 1981 budget was attributable to that recession 
the second reason is that even after including necessary 
increases for defense my march 1981 budget called for net spending 
reductions totaling 331 billion over five years but congress 
approved less than 40 percent of those reductions 
wasteful programs continued to be funded 
the necessary reductions have still not been made 
if the deficit is not curbed by continuing to limit the appetite 
of government we put in jeopardy all that we worked so hard over 
the years to achieve 
large deficits brought on by excessive domestic spending undercut 
the incentives to work and save by absorbing the savings that would 
otherwise lead to productive investment 
we cannot allow this to happen

maintaining peace and protecting our country are the foremost 
responsibilities of the federal government 
defense budget authority declined in real inflationadjusted 
terms for the fourth straight year with funding of 299 billion for 
1989 
this trend cannot continue without severe impact on combat 
readiness 
therefore my budget requests defense funding of 315 billion in 
budget authority and 303 billion in outlays for 1990 and 331 
billion in budget authority and 314 billion in outlays in 1991 
these amounts provide 2 percent annual real growth in budget 
authority over the 1989 level bringing it back up to the 1984 level 
in inflationadjusted terms by 1991 
the budget also projects 2 percent real growth in these programs 
in future years 
we must continue to maintain our nuclear deterrent 
for 1990 the budget proposes 9 billion for atomic energy 
defense programs a 09 billion increase over 1989 
a total of 28 billion is dedicated to the modernization of the 
nuclear materials production complex and to increase environmental 
cleanup and waste management efforts

the supreme court today barred local 
governments from receiving 180 million in federal revenue sharing 
funds withheld by the reagan administration 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that the money 
properly was withheld under budget cuts imposed by the socalled 
grammrudman act 
congress appropriated more than 4 billion for revenue sharing 
for the 1986 fiscal year 
after grammrudman was enacted a law aimed at eliminating the 
federal budget deficit by 1991 president reagan ordered 180 
million in revenue sharing funds withheld in 1986 
later that year congress passed and reagan signed a law 
repealing the revenue sharing program 
representatives of local governments in early 1987 asked the 
reagan administration to pay the 180 million that had been held 
back the previous year the administration refused the request 
the local governments then went to federal court and a judge 
ordered the government to pay the 180 million 
but the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last march that 
the administration acted properly 
the appeals court said the intent of grammrudman was not merely 
to freeze budget cuts temporarily 
merely freezing the fiscal year 1986 entitlements and 
resuscitating them in fiscal year 1987 would not result in any 
meaningful deficit reduction and could be characterized by critics 
to be a sham the appeals court said 
barring the local governments from receiving the money may be 
harsh the appeals court added but we believe it is consistent 
with congressional intent 
the case is national association of counties vs brady 88505

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether congress may outlaw all sexually explicit telephone dialup 
message services known as dialaporn 
the justices will rule sometime by july on the validity of a 
1988 law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages 
available through dialaporn services 
a federal judge in california ruled that the law could be applied 
to ban all obscene messages but he struck down the laws ban on 
messages deemed merely indecent 
us district judge a wallace tashima in los angeles based his 
july 19 ruling on past supreme court decisions that excluded obscene 
material but not all sexually explicit or indecent material from 
constitutional freespeech protections 
the reagan administration appealed directly to the supreme court 
challenging the part of the july ruling that protects indecent 
material 
sable communications of california inc a major purveyor of 
dialaporn services in that state filed a counterappeal 
challenging the part of tashimas ruling that allows the ban on 
materials judged to be obscene 
today the justices granted review to both appeals 
twice in 1988 the justices had refused to review dialaporn 
controversies in cases from arizona and new york 
obscenity is a legal term that does not apply to all sexually 
explicit material 
the supreme court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that 
appeals to a morbid interest in sex with patently offensive 
depictions or descriptions of sexual conduct and one that taken as 
a whole has no serious literary artistic political or scientific 
value 
sexually explicit material often called pornography may or may 
not be legally obscene 
in 1978 the high court drew a distinction between obscene and 
indecent expression when it allowed federal regulators to 
restrict the broadcast of indecent language 
upholding the governments power to punish use of dirty words 
over the airwaves at times when children might be listening the 
court seemed to adopt the federal communications commissions 
definition of indecent patently offensive references to 
excretory and sexual organs or activities 
congress in 1983 imposed restrictions on the dialaporn business 
but did not seek a total ban until enacting the 1988 law 
congress concluded that there was no sufficiently effective 
measure to eliminate access of children to dialaporn short of an 
outright ban justice department lawyers told the court 
they said the courts 1978 decision restricting the broadcasting 
of indecent language suggests that the 1988 law is consistent 
with the first amendment the constitutional protection of freedom 
of speech 
the governments appeal acknowledged however that the fccs 
general counsel has said the commission believes the 1978 supreme 
court ruling does not authorize a total ban on merely indecent 
language 
lawyers for sable communications argued that the entire 1988 law 
should be struck down 
dialaporn companies make their services available to callers 
through 976exchange numbers and atampts area code 900 longdistance 
lines 
the telephone company typically charges callers according to 
percall rates retaining a portion of the charges and giving the 
remainder to the dialaporn company 
the 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other 
noncontroversial types of messages such as sports scores time 
checks and stock market reports 
the cases are fcc vs sable communications 88525 and sable 
communications vs fcc 88515

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether the justice department must supply a weekly tax magazine 
with copies of all federal trial court opinions and orders in tax 
cases 
the justices said they will review a ruling that the freedom of 
information act imposes such an obligation on the justice 
departments tax division 
government lawyers warning of enormous administrative costs 
and burdens at taxpayer expense contend that the 1966 law imposes 
no such obligation 
tax analysts a washingtonbased weekly magazine reporting 
legislative judicial and regulatory developments in federal 
taxation first invoked the foia in 1984 in seeking timely copies of 
federal court opinions and orders from the justice department 
such opinions and orders are available to the public from the 
individual courts but the magazine had difficulty in obtaining them 
quickly 
the justice departments tax division turned down the magazines 
foia requests and a federal trial judge upheld the denial 
but the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last april 29 
that the government must comply with the magazines foia requests 
imposing an enormous and costly administrative burden on the 
justice department to secure already publicly available material for 
a commercial publication is certainly not the commonly perceived 
purpose of the foia the appeals court said nonethleless we 
cannot find in the words of the statute any exemption to cover such 
a situation 
the appeals court added that the burden in this case may not be 
so excessive as the department makes out 
government lawyers estimate that complying with the tax analysts 
requests on a regular basis would cost nearly 75000 a year for 
search time alone 
they say commercial publishers and law firms would flood the 
justice department with similar foia requests if the appeals court 
ruling is not overturned 
the appeals court ruled that federal trial court opinions and 
orders sent to the justice department are agency records under 
the foia and that they are being improperly withheld from the 
tax magazine 
in the appeal acted on today government lawyers said the appeals 
court was wrong on both points 
the case is justice department vs tax analysts 88782

seven skiers spent a night in a makeshift snow 
shelter and then survived an avalanche after getting lost during a 
sudden storm on mount rainier 
it was an extremely calm and wellorganized group which really 
made a big difference lonnie rosenwald 33 of seattle their 
ordeal ended safely sunday when the group members met up with a 
rescue team on their way down the mountain 
still she said there were lots of times we thought our lives 
were in danger there were times we didnt think we were going to 
get out of there 
the skiers all experienced at wilderness survival left saturday 
on what was supposed to be a oneday backcountry ski trip to the 
muir snowfield on the south flank of the 14410foot mountain while 
they were attempting to return that afternoon a storm closed in and 
they got lost in a steep valley rosenwald said 
the skiers on a trip sponsored by the seattle mountaineers club 
tried until midnight to climb out of the valley and then decided to 
build a structure and a small fire to survive the night 
it was a wonderful structure said rosenwald it was a 
sixfoot by threefoot hole in the snow with a roof consisting of 
skis poles and pine boughs covered by snow it was rectangular it 
snowed all night and we stayed dry 
the group members ranging in age from 31 to 68 was experienced 
and fit and had proper clothing rosenwald said no one panicked 
and no one got dangerously cold 
on sunday morning as the skiers set out to return five of them 
were caught in an avalanche rosenwald said everyone was able to 
swim through the 200foot slide safely except for one man who 
hit a tree and was slightly injured 
they then opted to ski down the creek valley correctly guessing 
that it would take them to a road that leads to a national park 
service facility at paradise 
just before dusk the group met a rescue team that had been 
searching for them in heavy snow and winds since daybreak sunday 
it was nice to see the rescuers but we would have made it 
rosenwald said there were 12 of them they had food and water and 
dry clothing the park service brought us to paradise and let 
us warm up 
park ranger bill dengler said the skiers were in good condition 
and delighted to get back inside and get into a warm area out of 
the cold

a mother jailed since august 1987 for refusing 
to disclose the whereabouts of her daughter whom she says was 
sexually abused by the childs father lost a supreme court appeal 
today 
the justices without comment let stand a contempt citation 
against dr elizabeth morgan a district of columbia plastic surgeon 
morgan 41 was imprisoned in august 1981 for defying an order by 
district of columbia judge herbert b dixon jr that she allow her 
daughter hilary then 5 to spend a twoweek unsupervised visit 
with dr eric a foretich 
foretich is hilarys father and morgans former husband 
morgan sent the child into hiding to protect her she said from 
sexual abuse by foretich who has denied abusing his daughter 
the judge last dec 15 refused to free morgan after more than 15 
months in jail saying he is not convinced her imprisonment will 
fail to coerce her into disclosing hilarys whereabouts 
the coercion has only just begun dixon said he added it 
could be a month it could be a year it could be more than that 
before he is convinced there is no realistic possibility of her 
relenting 
morgan has been held in civil contempt imposed to coerce someone 
into complying with a court order the citation requires 
imprisonment for an indefinite period criminal contempt by 
contrast is imposed for a limited sentence as punishment 
in her supreme court appeal morgan said her rights were violated 
because dixon conducted much of the hearing that led to the contempt 
citation in private 
the judge said he was trying to protect hilary from public 
disclosure of the details of her fathers alleged sexual abuse many 
of the specific charges were made public in a separate federal court 
suit against foretich by morgan 
dixon ruled in 1986 that morgan failed to prove foretich had 
abused hilary he said there was equal evidence on both sides of the 
case the judge permitted brief supervised visits for the father 
and in august 1987 granted foretich a twoweek unsupervised visit 
that led morgan to send her daughter into hiding 
morgan said dixon was biased against her and wrongly refused to 
believe evidence indicating hilary had been abused 
an appeals court here ruled last august that morgans rights were 
not violated 
a review of the record shows that there was proabable evidence 
on both sides of the issue of abuse the appeals court said it 
added that it is unable to conclude that dixon was clearly 
erroneous in granting foretich a twoweek visit 
the appeals court noted that a courtappointed guardian for 
hilary opposed the visit but had not argued that dixon abused his 
discretion in ordering the visit 
the appeals court also upheld dixons decision to bar the public 
from hearing morgans testimony about specific alleged acts of 
sexual abuse 
morgan said the public has been prevented from hearing crucial 
evidence that is vital to an issue of national debate 
her lawyers said studies show that sex abuse charges are made in 
some 2 percent of contested custody and visitation cases 
calling the figure one of alarming frequency they said 
doubts have been raised about the ability of judges to referee such 
disputes 
growing numbers of desperate parents have taken their 
children and disappeared because the parents have lost faith in 
the willingness and ability of the judicial system to protect their 
children morgans appeal said 
the case is morgan vs foretich 88737

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether federal courts should referee some disputes over electric 
power rates between public utilities and local or state regulatory 
agencies 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by new orleans public 
service inc a utility company seeking to pass on to its customers 
135 million in costs 
the high court in a related ruling last june severely limited 
the authority of states to lower electric rates that public 
utilities charge as a result of agreements with federal regulators 
but that decision left unanswered whether federal judges should 
rule in such disputes or leave these matters to state courts 
the case acted on today stems from a nearly decadeold dispute 
between new orleans public service or nopsi and the city council 
which under louisiana law sets utility rates charged consumers in 
new orleans 
the council barred nopsi from charging customers for the costs 
the utility incurred in buying electric power generated by the 36 
billion grand gulf 1 nuclear power plant in port gibson miss 
the rates charged nopsi to purchase power from grand gulf were 
set by the federal energy regulatory commission 
therefore nopsi argued city and state officials are powerless 
to prevent it from passing on the costs to its customers 
the federal commission in 1985 ordered nopsi to pay 17 percent of 
the cost of constructing grand gulf 1 
nopsi in a partial settlement with the city council in 1986 
agreed to absorb 512 million of the costs of grand gulf 
nopsi said the city gave assurances it would be allowed to 
recover the remaining 135 million share of its costs through higher 
retail rates over a period of time 
but the council said the utility acted imprudently in failing to 
resell the power it agreed to purchase from grand gulf and blocked a 
passthrough 
nopsi sued in federal court for permission to pass on the 135 
million to its customers arguing that the federal commissions role 
in the matter preempted the city councils power 
a federal judge denied nopsis claim and the 5th us circuit 
court of appeals upheld the ruling last july 
the appeals court said a federal court with jurisdiction over 
a matter that also lies within the jurisdiction of a state court or 
agency should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction new orleans 
public service must seek relief elsewhere 
the reagan administration urged the supreme court to overrule the 
5th circuit court and order the federal courts to decide the dispute 
the justice department said that at the very least it should be 
made clear that federal courts have power to allow utilities to pass 
on such costs temporarily to customers while the case is pending in 
the courts 
a delay in passing those costs through in retail rates will 
often have consequences that are irreparable government lawyers 
said it may create immediate cash flow problems and uncertainties 
that may threaten bankruptcy impede securities offerings and force 
compromise settlements 
the case is new orleans public service vs new orleans city

george bush today studied president reagans 
115 trillion budget and a transition official said the 
presidentelect agrees with its intent although still planned to 
submit his own modifications 
bush transition spokeswoman sheila tate said that the vice 
president himself might issue a brief statement on it later in the 
day 
but another transition official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said that bush was prepared to say that reagans spending 
outline says for one thing that you can meet the 
grammrudmanhollings targets without raising taxes 
it was a reference to the federal spending law that limits the 
deficit in the fiscal 1990 year the one the new budget covers to 
no more than 100 billion the reagan document envisions a 925 
billion deficit 
its a good budget that does that the bush transition 
official continued naturally he agrees with its intent and 
naturally hell have his own recommendations or put forth 
potential amendments once he takes office 
but he wont be presenting any of those recommendations until 
hes prepared to present all of them to the congress whatever time 
that might be the official said 
the reagan budget was designed in part to smooth the way for 
the upcoming bush budget plan reagan administration and bush 
transition officials said 
outgoing budget director joseph r wright jr said sunday the 
final reagan budget was designed with a dual purpose in mind 
summing up reagans philosophy while providing bush with a good 
base to begin negotiations with congress 
bush himself has said he wont submit a completely new plan of 
his own but will outline what hell add here and take off 
there much of it to be spelled out in an address to a joint 
session of congress in early february 
congressional democratic leaders have indicated they would like 
to get bushs final budget plan by no later than feb 20 so congress 
can begin work on its own budget and meet the goal of finishing work 
on spending bills before the august recess 
and leaders are indicating they are giving bush the benefit of 
the doubt on his muchtouted concept of a flexible freeze to 
hold overall spending increases generally to the rate of inflation 
but without a tax increase 
my own view is that is very difficult senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine said sunday on nbctvs meet the press 
but he continued bush has said it can be done and that he 
will do it my feeling is lets give him a chance to see if he 
meant what he said and if he can do what he promised 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas appearing on the 
same program said he believes bush is committed to his campaign 
pledge not to raise taxes i think george bush meant it and if 
people dont read lips in this town i think they are going to be 
left out somewhere dole said 
reagans final gift to bush is a fiscal 1990 budget document that 
appears to meet that mathematical goal reagans plan calls for 
spending increases of 45 percent comparable to the 1988 rate of 
inflation of about 44 percent 
under the bush flexible freeze any increased spending must 
be offset in general by reductions in other areas 
and while bush is certain to come up with his own specifics to 
bring about some of the kinder gentler nation programs he 
talked about in his campaign reagans budget appears to open the 
way for such changes 
rather than calling for wholesale elimination of agencies and 
programs as past reagan budgets have done the new plan was 
expected to be more selective singling out specific programs and 
spending items instead 
that will make it easier for bush to shape his own budget outline 
by offering amendments to the reagan plan 
and some of bushs pet campaign themes including more funds for 
education were already contained in the reagan proposal 
theres no question his bushs first test of leadership will 
be on this issue rep leon e panetta dcalif chairman of the 
house budget committee said 
the real question will not be the news in the reagan budget 
but how the new president responds to the challenges contained in 
the reagan budget panetta said in an interview 
bush and his lieutenants have maintained a low profile in the 
preparation of the reagan budget however his choice for budget 
director richard g darman has made frequent trips to capitol hill 
to meet with republican budget writers 
in the meetings darman indicated the forthcoming bush proposals 
would be general and that the incoming president would put greater 
emphasis on negotiations with congress according to participants 
bush has said he would send his budget negotiating team headed 
by darman to meet with congressional leaders at the outset of his 
presidency 
darman was kept closely informed on details of the preparation of 
the final reagan budget and treasury secretary nicholas brady a 
close bush confidant whom the vice president has announced he will 
retain also played a role in shaping it 
wright the outgoing reagan budget director said in an interview 
on sunday that the reagan budget satisfies two requirements very 
well 
it is president reagans last budget he said it is a 
responsible conservative budget but it has also been put through a 
reasonable test if presidentelect bush wants to use it that way 
it provides him with a good base to begin negotiations with congress 
during a very tough year

other areas of federal responsibility receive priority funding in 
this budget 
to continue the federal aviation administrations multiyear 
program to increase its controller and inspector workforces and to 
modernize the nations aid traffic control systems the budget 
provides 77 billion a 17 percent increase over the 1989 level 
to alleviate the problems facing our savings institutions i 
propose that the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
fslic spend 16 billion in 1989 and 9 billion in 1990 to address 
the most serious thrift institution problems 
the secretary of the treasury is developing a comprehensive plan 
to resolve the savings industrys problems and reform the financial 
institution regulatory structure and deposit insurance system to 
prevent a reoccurrence of these problems 
i expect the secretary to submit his proposals to the new 
president shortly 
to improve coordination of federal rural development programs 
and to redirect funding toward needy rural areas and program 
recipients i am continuing support of the rural development 
initiative coordinated by the secretary of agriculture 
by emphasizing housing vouchers i would provide housing 
assistance to 132000 additional lowincome households in 1990 5 
percent more than the 126124 additional households receiving 
housing subsidies in 1989 
housing vouchers can serve more lowincome households at a lower 
federal cost and provide greater opportunity for these families to 
rent housing of their own choosing 
to maintain the progress we have been making in fostering state 
and local education reform i would sustain the present level of 
spending on discretionary education programs at 185 billion but 
refocus those funds to put more money where the needs of the 
disadvantaged and students with handicaps are greatest 
to continue the significant progress we have made in cleaning up 
the environment i recommend a 153 million increase for the 
environmental protection agencys regulatory research and 
enforcement programs 
i also recommend an increase of 315 million for the superfund 
hazardous waste cleanup program in order to maintain the programs 
momentum and support a stronger enforcement role 
because changes in the earths natural systems can have 
tremendous economic and social effects global climate change is 
becoming a critical concern 
our ability to understand and predict these changes is currently 
limited and a better understanding is essential for developing 
policies 
the budget proposes a coordinated and effective federal research 
program on global change

the supreme court today refused to revive 
lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages in behalf of 
children with birth defects allegedly caused by the antinausea drug 
bendectin 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by more than 800 
families who sued merrell dow pharmaceuticals the maker of 
bendectin in federal court in ohio 
merrell dow had agreed in a 1984 settlement to create a 120 
million fund to compensate children with birth defects alledly 
caused by their mothers use during pregnancy of bendectin 
under the terms of the settlement the company did not admit the 
drug had caused the defects 
the settlement later was rejected by a federal appeals court 
which reinstated the suits against merrell dow a federal jury 
decided after a 22day trial in 1985 that bendectin did not cause 
birth defects when taken in prescribed doses 
the case was tried in ohio because merrell dow has its 
headquarters in hamilton county there 
the families that sued said they were denied a fair trial in part 
because the presiding judge barred children under 10 and all 
children with visible deformities from attending the trial the 
judge said allowing the young children and deformed children to 
attend could inflame the jury and prejudice the case against merrell 
dow 
those children were permitted to watch the trial on 
closedcircuit television elsewhere in the court building 
also the trial judge limited the trials focus to determining 
whether the families could prove that bendectin causes birth defects 
only if the families were successful on that issue and they 
were not would they then have had the opportunity at subsequent 
trials to show that merrell dow was legally responsible for the 
defects and to establish how much money the company must pay 
the families said splitting up the issues in this manner unfairly 
prevented them from presenting evidence that merrell dow was 
negligent guilty of fraud failed to warn mothers of the drugs 
dangers and violated a federal law on branding of drugs 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled last august that the 
trial judge did not act improperly in imposing the restrictions 
the appeals court rejected arguments that splitting up the trial 
and barring young children and those with deformities from attending 
created a sterile atmosphere that was unfair to the plaintiffs 
sterility is not necessarily the inevitable 
consequencemerely because the jury may not hear the full evidence 
of defendants alleged wrongdoing the appeals court said 
the case is hoffman vs merrell dow 88704

the supreme court today turned away arguments 
that judges violate freespeech rights when keeping secret the names 
of people selected as grand jury members 
the justices without comment let stand a missouri judges 
decision to bar public inspection of the names of grand jurors in a 
doublemurder investigation 
st charles county judge lester w duggan convened a grand jury 
last june to investigate james h williams sr and his wife joann 
williams 
the couple was accused in the murder of walter scott mrs 
williams first husband 
williams also was accused of killing his exwife sharon williams 
after a reporter for the st louis postdispatch asked for the 
names of the grand jury members duggan ordered the names be kept 
confidential in the interest of the safety and welfare of each 
grand juror 
the pulitzer publishing co which owns the newspaper sought to 
force duggan to release the names but a state appeals court voted 
21 to uphold his orders 
the missouri supreme court turned down the newspapers appeal 
last sept 13 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the postdispatch 
argued that access to the names of those serving on the grand jury 
should be presumed open 
they said any judge should be required to explain the special 
circumstances existing before the presumption of openness could be 
overriden 
a practice of keeping the names of grand jury members secret 
may lead to the erosion of public confidence in both state and 
federal grand juries the appeal said 
past supreme court rulings relying on the historical 
openness of court proceedings and the freespeech guarantees of 
the constitutions first amendment have recognized the publics 
right to attend criminal trials including jury selection and 
pretrial hearings 
the newspapers appeal said those decisions should be extended to 
include access to grand jurors names 
but st charles county prosecutors urged the justices to reject 
the postdispatchs appeal 
they drew a distinction between open trials and traditionally 
closed grand jury proceedings saying the latter are not subject 
to the same rigid procedural safeguards 
the previously most recent grand jury in st charles county had 
been convened in 1978 and names of grand jurors were made public 
then 
but county prosecutors said the 1978 grand jury was investigating 
the purchase and renovation of a building not a highly 
publicized gruesome double homicide 
public policy dictates that jurors investigating a double 
homicide would reasonably require a greater level of protection 
from possible reprisals or pressure the prosecutors said 
the case is pulitzer publishing co vs duggan 88770

the owner of the towns only theater 
vowed not to show the film mississippi burning a fictionalized 
account of the killings of three civil rights workers here 25 years 
ago 
were not going to show it no way its not worth it lula 
ellis who owns the ellis theater said sunday i just see no 
reason why we should play it 
ellis had said that church groups were threatening to boycott the 
theater if it showed the movie directed by alan parker and starring 
gene hackman and willem dafoe 
on june 21 1964 civil rights workers james earl chaney 21 who 
was black and whites andrew goodman 20 and michael schwerner 24 
disappeared after they were released from jail in philadelphia they 
had been stopped on speeding charges after they had been 
investigating the burning of a church by the ku klux klan 
the three were found 44 days later shot to death and buried in a 
soggy earthen dam in neshoba county 
ellis who earlier this week said she hadnt made up her mind 
about showing the film said sunday she reached a decision against 
the movie after after discussing it with her son shelly steiger the 
theater manager 
the movie has refocused national attention on this town of 6800 
people which is 70 miles northwest of jackson the film has been 
released in five cities and is scheduled for nationwide release 
friday 
during most movies at ellis cinema blacks customarily sit in 
the balcony with whites a few blacks and choctaw indians sit down 
in the orchestra seats steiger said this was by custom and was not 
required by the theater management 
other theaters in mississippi will run the movie 
monte royal owner of two cinemas in meridian which is about 40

the supreme court today refused to grant a 
college professor access to sealed grand jury records in the case of 
owen j lattimore a china scholar accused in the 1950s of being a 
communist sympathizer 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by prof robert p 
newman of the university of pittsburgh who is writing a lattimore 
biography 
lattimore 88 and now retired in pawtucket ri was accused by 
the late sen joseph r mccarthy rwis of helping to lose 
china to the communists 
a professor at johns hopkins university in the 1950s and an 
expert in asian affairs lattimore was indicted on perjury charges 
by a federal grand jury after the justice department accused him of 
lying to a congressional committee 
before that committee he had denied ever being a communist agent 
or sympathizer 
parts of the governments case were declared unconstitutional in 
1952 and again in 1955 a judge threw out another indictment the 
government then dropped lattimores prosecution 
public citizen an organization representing newman said the 
grand jury records could provide valuable insights into the mccarthy 
era 
the lattimore indictments call into question the extent to 
which unchecked prosecutorial power and congressional influence may 
have been used to engineer a political prosecution and to employ the 
grand jury for improper purposes lawyers for public citizen said 
newman said the public has an important interest in being 
informed about what happened in the grand jury probe 
but the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last april that 
the rule for preserving grand jury secrecy makes no provision for 
disclosure of transcripts to a private party for historical research 
purposes 
newman and public citizen said the ruling places critical 
information about historically important chapters of history off 
limits to historians and the public 
they said other courts have allowed public disclosure of grand 
jury testimony when it is in the public interest even if federal 
rules do not authorize specifically opening the files to help 
historians 
the reagan administration urged the supreme court to reject 
newmans appeal 
even if dressed up as a significant project of historical 
scholarship requests of this typecould not easily be 
distinguished from journalistic inquiries into subjects of public 
interest or requests based simply on individual or public 
curiosity the justice department said 
the case is newman vs us 88548

last years fires on federal forestlands indicated the need for 
more timely funding for annual firefighting costs 
i therefore propose that two new federal wild land firefighting 
accounts be established in the departments of agriculture and 
interior 
to further strengthen our energy security i propose legislation 
authorizing the sale of the naval petroleum reserves to the private 
sector in exchange for cash and oil to be added to the strategic 
petroleum reserve 
i also propose the establishment of a separate 10 million barrel 
defense petroleum inventory 
to provide for the timely completion of my reform 88 management

the program structure and incentives underlying many domestic 
federal programs need to be altered to promote greater efficiency 
and costeffectiveness 
current farm price support programs are far too costly 
for the period 198689 an estimated 130 billion in federal 
spending for farmrelated assistance programs provided an average of 
nearly 600000 per farmer 
much of this assistance goes to farmers with high incomes more 
than twice the us family average 
i therefore propose outlay reductions for the price and income 
support programs of 2 billion in 1990 and additional annual 
reductions of between 2 and 25 billion in each year from 1991 
through 1994 
in addition i urge reform of the counterproductive sugar price 
support program 
the rapidly rising costs of the medicare program need to be 
moderated 
i propose a reasonable increase in the medicare prospective 
payment system rate and reductions in hospital capital payments and 
special graduate medical education payments 
also in an effort to restrain excessive growth in supplementary 
medical insurance smi costs i propose extension of the current 
law smi premiums limitations on physican payments reductions in 
payments for certain overpriced procedures and reforms in the 
durable medical equipment payment system 
medicare spending would still grow by 9 percent between 1989 and 
1990 under these proposals but not by the 13 percent that would 
occur under current law

the supreme court today refused to bar 
cityowned water systems from charging some nonresident customers 
higher rates than other nonresidents even if there is no 
costrelated reason 
the court without comment turned down an appeal by summit 
county ohio officials who said they are being charged unfair rates 
by akron ohio 
the case began in 1981 when akron officials sued summit county 
for allegedly breaking a 1979 contract between the two governmental 
bodies the city said the county illegally wittheld payment for 
water supplied by the city 
the county countersued claiming it entered into the contract 
under duress and was being charged unreasonable and discriminatory 
rates by akron 
the county said it was being charged rates some 90 percent higher 
than another akron water customer in the area the neighboring city 
of tallmadge 
summit county said it was forced to pay more because it has no 
alternative source of water 
the ohio supreme court upheld the higher rates for summit county 
ruling county officials signed a contract with the city they must 
honor 
the degree of control which the courts will exert over such 
cityowned public utilities is strictly limited to protecting 
residents of the municipality from the imposition of rates which are 
unreasonable or which discriminate among such residents the state 
court said 
the ohio court said it presumed that the contract signed by the 
county was made through the normal give and take of contractual 
negotiation the county entered the bargaining process freely 
and without duress 
the state court added there is nothing wrong in charging the 
county higher rates based on its need for the water even if akrons 
cost of supplying it is no greater than in providing water for 
tallmadge 
where rates for water from a municipally owned public utility 
are set forth in a contract such rates will not be struck down as 
discriminatory even where no factor exists which could justify the 
rate discrimination the state court said 
the case is summit county vs akron 88596

the reagan administration today proposed 
eliminating two dozen federal education programs while slightly 
increasing overall education outlays from 206 billion this year to 
212 billion in fiscal 1990 
some 541 million saved by the cuts plus another 212 million 
from cost savings officials hope to achieve from the guaranteed 
student loan program would go to expand existing programs for 
disadvantaged students from kindergarten to graduate school 
the proposed budget does not incorporate any of the education 
spending ideas set forth during presidentelect bushs campaign 
they included a 500 million merit schools program for schools 
serving disadvantaged children and a 50 million infusion for a 
magnet schools program designed to encourage parental choice 
but bush who pledged during the campaign to be the education 
president is expected to rework the budget in the weeks following 
his jan 20 inauguration the education community asserted last week 
that he needs to request an extra 25 billion for fiscal 1990 in 
order to begin to fulfill his pledge 
education secretary lauro cavazos said last month that i did 
the best i could to secure the best possible budget for his 
department 
the document does not contain specific new initiatives reflecting 
his own priorities cutting illiteracy and the dropout rate but 
that could come later cavazos has said that after bush takes over 
we will be getting into some rather specific kinds of programs 
among the programs on the chopping block under the reagan plan 
are the womens educational equity act research program which 
officials complain has outlived its purpose and a twoyear dropout 
prevention demonstration project due to expire 
also suggested for extinction are programs the administration 
considers duplicative and programs officials say should be financed 
by the private sector the latter include impact aid to school 
districts serving areas with taxexempt federal installations star 
schools which would put satellite technology in schools and a 
number of scholarship and fellowship programs 
the largest dollar increase under the reagan plan and one of 
the only boosts higher than the anticipated 34 percent inflation 
rate would go to pell grants the chief federal assistance program 
for lowincome postsecondary students 
current budget authority for the program is nearly 45 billion 
that would rise by 256 million under the reagan plan a 57 
percent hike the maximum grant amount of 2300 would stay the same 
and the number of students receiving aid would rise 46000 to 31 
million 
reagan would increase outlays for chapter 1 the major federal 
program for lowachieving children in poor neighborhoods from the 
current 42 billion to 43 billion in fiscal 1990 most of the 
extra money would be for grants funneled to areas with the highest 
concentrations of needy students 
the reagan budget would hike spending authority for vocational 
and bilingual education programs by about 34 percent spending 
authority for vocational education would rise to 949 million while 
bilingual would increase to 157 million outlays are anticipated to 
be slightly less 
the administration is hoping to save 212 million on the 
guaranteed student loan program by reducing special allowance 
payments used as an incentive to lenders to participate and by 
reducing guaranteed reinsurance to lenders and state guarantor 
agencies from 100 percent to 90 percent on the dollar congress 
would have to approve both moves 
the entitlement program currently costs the government about 32 
billion in interest and default payments officials expect loan 
volume to rise from 115 billion this year to 125 billion in 
fiscal 1990 adding another 278000 students to the 4 millionplus 
already participating in the program

the archdiocese of detroit softened a proposal to 
close or merge 48 city parishes but cardinal edmund szoka said more 
than a quarter of the citys 112 parishes still would close by june 
30 
szoka announced sunday that 30 mostly innercity churches would 
be closed while an additional 25 parishes would be given a year to 
prove their viability in september a task force had recommended 
that 43 churches be closed and five others merged into parishes with 
more members and greater resources 
even with the reduced number of parishes involved there is no 
precedent in the us roman catholic church for such largescale 
closings msgr john tracy ellis a historian at the catholic 
university of america in washington said today 
the situation was entirely different in the past he said 
it was a question of how many new parishes to open not to close 
insofar as i can recall there is nothing like this 
the church closings were necessary officials said because of a 
white flight from the city that reduced detroits catholic 
population from 100000 housholds in 1976 to fewer than 50000 today 
the church especially the church in the city of detroit finds 
itself in much different circumstances in 1989 than those that 
existed in 69 or 59 or 29 or 1909 szoka said it cannot 
act as though nothing has changed 
szoka who had defended the earlier church closing plan said 
sunday the 25 churches whose survival is in doubt would be asked to 
increase membership services and parish staff 
all we are ask is that they try i mention to them that in 
no way is there a damocles sword hanging over their head he 
said it is meant rather to be a stimulus 
the cardinal called for more blacks to enter religious life in 
his announcement sunday and said he also intended the closings to 
help end a plantation mentality with white parish leaders 
running churches attended largely by blacks 
one of the 30 closing churches is expected to become a black 
catholic historical museum he said 
the announcement in september resulted in a wave of protest 
against the 15 millionmember archdiocese which takes in six 
counties in the detroit area there are an estimated 50000 to 
60000 black catholics in the archdiocese church officials said 
on sunday at our lady of the rosary one of many churches that 
appealed the closing plan parishioners were elated at the oneyear 
reprieve 
theres a year and a pronouncement by the archdiocese to work 
with parishes to see some sort of improvement said patrick 
gossman a member of our lady of the rosary well go on with a 
certain sense of hope and work at it 
but there was bitterness at churches slated to close 
at st philip neri sniffling could be heard among the 70 people 
attending mass as the rev donald walker announced that the east 
side church would close 
this wasnt supposed to happen walker said referring to the 
difficulty he had in making the announcement i guess you just 
resent it when someone comes in and tells you its time to die

bestselling author clive cussler and some 
300 volunteers found no signs during a weekend search of a 
locomotive believed buried in a dry creek bed during an 1878 flood 
but he says they have not given up hope 
in order to find it we need to know where it isnt craig 
dirgo of cusslers national underwater and marine agency said sunday 
after the search ended thats the key to any search 
searchers braved 20degree weather and gusty winds to sift 
through a halfmile area near here for remnants of the 
kansaspacific locomotive 
the engine 19 cars and a caboose fell 30 feet from a railroad 
bridge in 1878 when a flood struck the area 30 miles east of 
denver twelve of the cars and the locomotive were reported to have 
been buried in the sand 
some researchers believe that the railroad subsequently salvaged 
the expensive engine but cussler and his band of searchers are 
still hoping its still in the ground the group hopes to squeeze in 
one more weekend of hunting before spring to search a twomile area 
downstream from the original bridge 
we know its here and we will be back dirgo said 
volunteer eric walker of darwin australia found a part from a 
railroad flat car others found slag and coal which officials said 
may have been used for ballast by the railroad 
cussler said if the locomotive is found it will belong to the 
landowner mike pinzenscham who watched the digs progress with his 
8yearold son justin said his family has owned the land for about 
25 years 
through the arvadabased agency cussler the author of raise 
the titanic has located 54 sunken vessels including a dirigible 
but this is his first buried train hunt 
the agencys next project will be a search for the steamship new

i also propose reforms in the medicaid program to reduce 
spending growth between 1989 and 1990 to 17 billion or 5 percent 
rather than the 33 billion or 9 percent that would occur under 
current law 
these reforms reinstate successful incentives employed in the 
early 1980s 
my budget also proposes restructuring federal financing of 
administrative expenses to give states greater incentives to operate 
their administrative systems as efficiently as possible 
the government often continues programs at the federal level 
that are either duplicative or are no longer needed or more 
appropriately undertaken by other levels of government or the 
private sector 
this is the case with the economic development administration 
amtrak urban mass transit discretionary grants and most operating 
subsidies for the postal service 
efforts to reverse this situation have been undertaken by prior 
administrations as well as my own 
these programs should be eliminated 
the budget proposes termination of 82 programs that are not 
needed to satisfy national priorities 
under current law outlays for federal employee retirement and 
health benefits are estimated to grow from 513 billion in 1989 to 
559 billion in 1990 
i propose freezing retirement costofliving allowances colas 
and other reforms to hold the 1990 level to slightly above that for 
1989 reducing the growth that would otherwise occur by 44 
billion

the federal government should not be involved in providing goods 
and services where private enterprise can do the job cheaper and 
better 
accordingly my budget proposes that a number of federal 
enterprises be opened to the private sector through public 
offerings or outright sales 
following our success in the sale of conrail and the sale of 21 
billion in selected loan portfolios i am proposing sale of the 
naval petroleum reserves the alaska power administration and the 
southeastern power administration 
i also propose sale of the federal governments heliumprocessing 
assets excess real property and a further 43 billion in loan

an african student arrested in a racial brawl while other african 
diplomats urged their students to end a class boycott begun by the 
fighting 
we are not satisfied the case has not been handled properly 
said ghanas charge daffaires kwadwo kwakye we want him to be 
released 
alex dosoo of ghana a student at hehai university in eastern 
nanking city was arrested dec 31 and charged with beating and 
seriously injuring a hehai employee during the dec 24 clash 
police gave two other african students from gambia and benin 15 
days disciplinary detention as punishment for having tried to 
stir up trouble 
in a development apparently unrelated to the racial tensions an 
ugandan medical student jumped from a sixthfloor dormitory window 
at a campus in southern canton city friday killing himself 
xinhua the official news agency said nsubuga david mugwanya 
26 had been depressed about financial problems and examination 
failures 
the clash between african students and chinese school workers and 
students began when the africans brought chinese women to a dance 
dec 24 
kwakye said the fight happened on a campus and should have been 
handled by the university and not handed over to the police 
in a telephone interview he said he did not think dosoo should 
face criminal charges 
he said authorities took three days to inform the embassy of 
dosoos arrest and still have not advised them of any formal charges 
or what punishment the student might face 
we have protested his detention and the fact that we were not 
notified said kwakye 
he was among 11 african diplomats who met chinese authorities and 
african students in nanking over the weekend 
kwakye said he told ghanaian students today that it was within 
their rights to boycott but that they must be careful not to 
contravene the law 
the official xinhua news agency quoted other diplomats as saying 
they plan to advise their students to return to classes and obey the 
law the approximately 140 african students in nanking have not 
attended classes since the clash 
about 500 african students at beijing languages institute have 
boycotted classes since dec 4 to protest charges by chinese 
students that an african man assaulted a chinese woman in her 
dormitory the africans say the story is fabricated and demand an 
apology 
institute president liu bisong sent a letter today urging 
boycotting students to return to class liu said chinese students at 
the school were wrong to protest last week but that the class 
boycott also was erroneous 
ghana is the only african country that has said it is considering 
bringing its 26 students in china home

president reagan today asked congress to 
increase spending on aids research by 24 percent and trim the growth 
of the huge medicare and medicaid health programs by cutting 
payments to states and fees to hospitals and physicians 
overall the proposed fiscal 1990 budget for the department of 
health and human services would increase 57 percent to 4244 
billion in fiscal 1990 
the department is the largest cabinet agency in terms of 
spending accounting for 37 percent of federal outlays including an 
anticipated 257 billion on social security for the next fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 
the budget proposal would add 311 million to the fight against 
the spread of the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome our 
highest public health priority the increase would raise spending 
for research education and prevention of the disease to 16 
billion 
the department estimates another 925 million will be spent on 
treatment and income support to aids victims through medicaid 
medicare disability insurance and other service programs 
the overwhelming bulk of the departments spending is earmarked 
for entitlements social security medicare and medicaid over 
which the agency has little budget control since eligibility for the 
programs is set by congress 
if no changes were made medicare which pays for the health 
care of about 34 million elderly and disabled americans would grow 
by 14 percent in fiscal 1990 
however reagan proposes trimming that growth rate to 10 percent 
by cutting 35 billion from fees paid to physicians and hospitals 
his medicare budget would total 949 billion 
about a third of the medicare cut 1 billion would come from 
reducing the additional disbursements that teach hospitals receive 
to cover their costs of training interns and residents 
other reductions would be made in payments to hospitals for 
capital costs and fees to physicians for certain procedures 
including radiology anesthesiology and surgery under the medicare 
payments system 
a new part of medicare is the catastrophic health insurance 
program which is intended to be entirely selfsupporting it is 
financed by premiums paid by medicare recipients which are 
projected to total about 86 billion in fiscal 1990 but the 
program is projected to spend only 4 billion that year 
medicaid the program that provides health care for about 26 
million lowincome americans would grow about 9 percent next year 
if unchanged the administration however is proposing to slice the 
growth to 5 percent growth or by about 14 billion to a spending a 
total of 36 billion 
much of the reduction would come from reducing payments to the 
states which administer the program under federal guidelines by 
about 11 billion 
benefits under the social security program are protected and 
recipients based on administration estimates of what inflation will 
be this year the budget projects social security recipients getting 
a 36 percent costofliving increase in their benefits in january 
1990

the supreme court acting in an appeal urging 
reversal of its landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion 
nationwide today agreed to review a missouri law regulating 
abortions 
the justices said they will study a federal appeals court ruling 
that struck down key provisions of the state law 
even before todays action in the appeal filed by missouri 
officials the case had become the mostwatched battleground in the 
continuing political war over abortion justice department lawyers 
also are urging the high court to use the case as a means of undoing 
its 1973 ruling called roe vs wade 
but nothing in the brief order issued today suggested that the 
justices will reconsider roe vs wade 
the courts eventual decision expected by july could resolve 
the missouri controversy without significantly changing the 1973 
decision or other past rulings on abortion 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last july 13 struck down 
among other aspects of the missouri abortion law these five 
provisions 
a ban on using public hospitals or other governmentrun 
facilities for abortions not necessary to save a womans life 
a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or 
assisting an abortion 
a ban on using taxpayer money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions 
a requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed to 
be older than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity to 
determine whether the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb 
a declaration that the life of each human being begins at 
conception 
the appeals court upheld a provision in the state law that bans 
the use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion 
but it said use of a public facility or the services of a public 
employee cannot be banned if all such costs are reimbursed by a 
patient 
in the apppeal acted on today missouri attorney general william 
l webster said the 8th circuit courts ruling expands supreme 
court precedents in favor of abortion on demand further contracts 
the states compelling interest in the life of viable unborn 
children and disregards this courts holdings that abortion is a 
private matter which government need in no way subsidize 
the 1973 decision should itself be reconsidered if it cannot 
be squared with the disputed missouri law webster said 
william bradford reynolds then chief of the justice departments 
civil rights division wrote to missouri officials last summer 
urging them to include a challenge of roe vs wade in the states 
appeal 
i felt this was the best case on the horizon to undertake 
reconsideration of roe reynolds told the wall street journal in a 
recent interview 
in a brief filed two days after the presidential election ast 
nov 8 justice department lawyers supported missouris appeal 
that sparked molly yard president of the national organization 
for women to accuse the justice department of declaring war on 
the women of this country 
eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist majority 
said there will be no honeymoon on the issue of abortion for 
presidentelect bush because of the justice departments involvement 
in the missouri case 
in its 1973 ruling the supreme court said women have a 
constitutional right of abortion based on the right of privacy the 
court most recently reaffirmed that ruling in 1983 
todays court is viewed as deeply divided on the abortion issue 
justice harry a blackmun told a law school audience last 
september that the 1973 decision he authored could be overturned in 
the courts 198889 term 
the next question is will roe vs wade go down the drain i 
think theres a very distinct possibility that it will this term 
you can count the votes he said 
while blackmun and justices william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and john paul stevens have resisted attempts to reverse or greatly 
modify the 1973 decision antiabortion forces are hoping some day 
to attract five votes for such a result 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice byron r white 
dissented from the 1973 ruling and several subsequent abortion 
decisions 
justice sandra day oconnor in past decisions has questioned the 
courts reasoning in its 1973 decision 
justice antonin scalia who has not yet voted in an abortion 
decision since being named to the high court by president reagan in 
1986 is thought to favor overturning or curtailing roe vs wade 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court last feb 18 
likewise has not voted in an abortion decision his views on 
abortion and the roe vs wade decision are not known in any 
significant detail 
in other action today the court 
agreed to decide whether congress may outlaw all sexually 
explicit telephone dialup message services dubbed dialaporn 
the justices will judge sometime by july the validity of a 1988 
law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages available 
through dialaporn services 
allowed criminal defendants to exclude potential jurors because 
of their race 
in a case involving a black mans murder by ku klux klan members 
rejected arguments by alabama prosecutors supported by law 
enforcement officials nationwide that defense lawyers unlawfully 
are seeking to impanel an allwhite jury in the klan case 
refused to review lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in 
damages in behalf of children with birth defects allegedly caused by 
the antinausea drug bendectin 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by more than 800 
families who sued merrell dow pharmaceuticals the maker of 
bendectin in federal court in ohio 
let stand a contempt citation against a mother jailed since 
august 1987 for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of her 
daughter whom she says was sexually abused by the childs father 
the justices without comment let stand the contempt citation 
against dr elizabeth morgan a district of columbia plastic surgeon 
barred local governments from receiving 180 million in federal 
revenue sharing funds withheld by the reagan administration 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that the money 
properly was withheld under budget cuts imposed by the socalled 
grammrudman act 
turned away arguments that judges violate freespeech rights 
when keeping secret the names of people selected as grand jury 
members 
the justices without comment let stand a missouri judges 
decision to bar public inspection of the names of grand jurors in a 
doublemurder investigation

president reagan is recovering quite well 
from successful surgery to correct a curvature of his left ring 
finger white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today 
he was making jokes about it fitzwater told reporters at his 
daily news briefing the bandage will become progressively smaller 
in the next few days although reagan will wear a support splint 
for several months 
reagan returned to the white house from walter reed army medical 
center on sunday a day after undergoing nearly three hours of 
surgery under local anesthesia 
the president accompanied by first lady nancy reagan lifted his 
left hand with a bulky bandage on it as he stepped out of the 
emergency entrance of the hospital in northwest washington 
asked how he felt he replied fine in a vigorous booming 
voice after raising his bandaged left hand he waved with his right 
the operation was to alleviate a worsening condition known as 
dupuytrens contracture which caused the presidents fingers to 
curve inward in a clawlike configuration 
dr john hutton the white house physician said last week the 
operation would not interfere with the presidents performance of 
his duties 
in a statement after the operation on saturday white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater described the surgery as successfully 
completed 
since recovery normally takes two to three weeks the president 
may still be wearing the bandage when he turns over the reins of 
government to presidentelect bush at inauguration ceremonies on 
jan 20

in 1981 i made a promise to the american people to limit 
government to its proper role and make it the servant not the 
master of the people 
my management improvement program reform 88 has helped make 
government more efficient and more responsive 
we reduced waste and fraud in federal programs by combining the 
efforts of the inspectors general into the presidents council on 
integrity and efficiency resulting in over 110 billion saved or 
put to better use and their efforts are continuing 
i saw that the federal government did not have effective cash 
management practices for dealing with what is now a 2 trillion 
annual cash flow nor did it have a governmentwide credit management 
program for what is now a 1 trillion portfolio 
this resulted in the waste of billions of dollars each year 
we built the necessary governmentwide controls in both areas and 
stopped the drain 
moreover we began the establishment of the first governmentwide 
financial accounting system consolidating and making uniform over 
400 previously incompatible individual agency systems 
this was essential for any wellmanaged government and is 
presently being implemented 
the federal government has a major effect on our daily lives 
through the collection of taxes and fees the direct provisions of 
services the payment of financial assistance through various 
entitlement programs and the regulation of commercial enterprises 
through modernization improved administration and automated 
services the government has made substantial reductions in the time 
it takes to provide services to the public 
as the 21st century approaches the federal government must adapt 
its role in our society to changing conditions and changing 
technology 
at the turn of the century the us population will exceed 268 
million with a larger proportion of elderly citizens 
changes in technology and communication will increasingly link 
the worlds economies trade capital flows and travel as never 
before

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states generally are immune from being sued for money 
damages by bankruptcy trustees 
the court said it will use two cases of bankrupt businesses in 
connecticut to determine whether states and possibly the federal 
government also enjoy such immunity 
the justices will hear an appeal by martin w hoffman a 
courtappointed trustee supervising payment to creditors of 
willington convalescent home inc and edward zera who ran a 
maintenance service 
the nursing home which shut down in april 1983 said connecticut 
officials owed it 64010 in medicaid payments for patients treated 
at the home 
zera who declared bankruptcy in 1983 sought to recover 2100 
in taxes paid to connecticut 
hoffman invoked federal bankruptcy law to recover the money in 
behalf of the nursing home and zera and use it to help pay their 
creditors 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled last june that the 
immunity from money damages states generally enjoy extends to 
federal bankruptcy law 
the reagan administration said it agrees with the 2nd circuit 
court ruling but urged the supreme court to hear arguments in the 
case because other federal appeals courts have taken an opposite 
view 
such disputes arise frequently and the conflict should be 
resolved by the high court the justice department said 
the department said the reasoning of the 2nd circuit court 
appears to apply to federal agencies as well as to states 
the supreme court is expected to announce a decision by july 
the case is hoffman vs connecticut 88412

the supreme court today let stand a ruling that 
expands the right of allegedly abused or mistreated foster children 
to sue their social workers 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that workers may 
be sued for damages under a key federal civil rights law by foster 
children in federally funded programs 
the court rejected an appeal by maryland social service employees 
seeking greater legal protection 
the reagan administration joined in urging the court to review a 
ruling by the 4th us circuit court of appeals justice department 
lawyers said the appeals court ruling would expose thousands of 
state and local social welfare workers to personal financial 
liability for injuries suffered by children in foster homes 
the government said the appeals court ruling could have even more 
farreaching impact if it is extended to apply to other federally 
funded social welfare programs 
state and local workers who administer aid for dependent 
children medicaid and food stamp programs also could be exposed to 
the risk of bigmoney damages the government said 
the maryland case stems from a suit against 21 officials 
caseworkers and supervisors who help administer the states 
federally funded foster care program in baltimore 
they were sued by children who say they were victims of physical 
and sexual abuse and medical neglect 
a federal judge ordered officials to submit a plan for improving 
conditions in foster homes and for at least monthly monitoring of 
the placement of children in the homes 
the judge also required the officials to improve medical services 
for foster children and to report instances of poor medical care to 
the childrens attorneys 
the judge also ruled that social workers who place or keep 
children in foster homes are not entitled to immunity from lawsuits 
in such cases 
the 4th circuit court upheld the decision in february 1988 
the appeals court rejected the social workers claims that a 
federal law providing funds for foster care created no duty on their 
part to know whether a child would be exposed to mistreatment or 
abuse 
the appeals court said the social workers right to claim 
immunity from suit must be based on more than their own belief that 
they acted properly it is up to a trial court examining the facts 
to decide whether the social workers permitted mistreatment the 
appeals court said 
the national association of social workers in supporting the 
appeal by the maryland employees said the 4th circuit court ruling 
places social workers at risk for alleged abuses that occurred 
decades earlier 
no professional consensus exists even now on how to assure 
foster children will not be harmed the association said 
maltreatment of children in foster homes often is difficult and 
at times impossible to prevent by even a very highly skilled and 
welltrained social worker 
the supreme court already is studying a related issue in the case 
of a wisconsin boy who suffered severe beatings by his father 
in that case the justices are expected to decide whether public 
officials may be sued when their alleged gross negligence permits a 
child to be abused by a parent 
social workers were accused of failing to come to the aid of the 
boy even after they had evidence that he was beaten repeatedly 
the case acted on today focuses on whether a federal civil rights 
law enacted after the civil war permits damage suits based on 
alleged violations of a 1980 law the adoption assistance and child 
welfare act 
the 1980 law requires states to meet certain conditions before 
receiving federal funds for foster care the 4th circuit court said 
the 1980 law creates a basis for private citizens to sue if those 
conditions allegedly are not met 
the case is massinga vs lj 871796

defense secretary frank c carlucci is asking 
congress to increase defense spending by 2 percent above the rate of 
inflation for the next two years in a proposed military budget 
likely to change after george bush becomes president 
in proposing 3152 billion in budget authority for 1990 and 
33089 billion for 1991 carlucci is requesting an increase in star 
wars spending authority from 41 billion in 1989 to 59 billion in 
1990 and 7 billion in 1991 
under the proposed defense budget for the fiscal year beginning 
next oct 1 although 3152 billion would be authorized 303 
billion would actually be spent the spending authority includes 
funding for longterm projects and weapons buying in future years 
the lower figure outlays includes only the funds to be spent 
during the 12 months of the 1990 fiscal year 
the 303 billion in 1990 outlays includes pentagon spending and 
92 billion for energy department nuclear weapons and research 
programs and is projected at 47 billion above actual spending 
during this fiscal year 
among the requests likely to be changed by congress or bush are 
946 million in spending authority in 1990 and 1243 million the 
next year for research on a new navy antisatellite asat weapon 
and elimination of a proposed singlewarhead intercontinental 
ballistic missile the midgetman 
in other areas of national security the reagan administration is 
asking for an increase of 56 billion to a level of 84 billion 
in security assistance programs to other nations the whopping 200 
percent jump comes in part because loan repayments from other 
nations go down next year 
the administration is asking for 38 billion for grants to 
foreign countries mostly in the middle east so they can buy us 
weapons 
another 35 billion is being sought in nonmilitary aid mostly 
for central america and the middle east the budget message 
forecasts the request of additional money for the contra guerrillas 
of nicaragua 
the proposed pentagon budget also continues production of the 
newly unveiled b2 or stealth bomber designed to elude enemy radar 
the exact annual cost of that program remains classified although 
the air force announced dec 16 that each b2 would cost 516 
million a total of 681 billion for 132 planes by 1995 making it 
the most expensive plane in the world 
the b2 program may face trouble following disclosures of 
inadequacies in electronic equipment designed to enable newly 
acquired b1b bombers to penetrate enemy defenses 
it is also far from clear whether bush and congress will agree to 
cancel the midgetman which would be designed to be fired from 
mobile trucks last year the air force volunteered to drop the 
midgetman in favor of a railmobile version of the 10warhead mx or 
peacekeeper 
the air force argued that 500 warheads could be deployed on 50 
peacekeepers for 10 billion vs 447 billion for the midgetman 
but congress restored money for research on midgetman arguing 
that more missiles would be harder to track and destroy and that a 
singlewarhead weapon made more sense under a proposed strategic 
arms limitation treaty limiting the number of launchers 
bush was expected to submit a revised version of the budget and 
the retired air force general he has named as national security 
adviser brent scowcroft has publicly endorsed the midgetman over 
the mx and has suggested lower levels of funding for star wars 
formally known as the strategic defense initiative 
the active duty strength of the armed forces would increase by 
5000 in 1990 to a level of 2138300 then decrease the following 
year to 2134600 
the force level in the army and marine corps remain the same at 
772000 for the army and 197000 for the marines that of the air 
force would decline slightly from 571000 in 1989 and 1990 to 
567000 in 1991 and that of the navy would grow from 593000 to 
598000 to provide crews for the addition of new aircraft carriers 
to the current fleet of 13 flattops 
the navy must postpone its plans for a 600ship fleet although 
adm stephen loftus told reporters that goal could be achieved 
sometime in the 1990s the number of ships would drop to 574 next 
year and 571 in 1991 with retirements that include two ballistic 
missiles submarines and the conversion of another into a moored 
training ship in 1990 
one submarine armed with trident class ballistic missiles is to 
be added each year with 63 trident ii missiles delivered in 1990 
and 52 in 1991 
the navy as expected will acquire two ssn688 nuclear attack 
submarines in 1990 and two ssn21 seawolf nuclear attack submarines 
in 1991 
the budget calls for pay raises of 36 percent in 1990 and 32 
percent in 1991 for uniformed military and of 2 percent and 3 
percent for civilian employees of the defense department 
as the number of men and women in active service declines the 
number in the national guard and reserves is to increase by 7600 to 
1178300 in fiscal 1990 and to 1181700 the following year

received no reports of serious damage or injury 
my kid came in the living room screaming that his bed was 
moving said adam churchin who lives four miles southeast of 
downtown las vegas it scared the living daylights out of him 
the temblor centered 10 miles northeast of las vegas struck at 
908 pm sunday and measured between 32 and 35 on the richter 
scale according to seismologists at the us geological survey 
offices in menlo park calif and boulder colo 
earlier sunday the alaksa tsunami warning center reported two 
moderate earthquakes in an area southeast of adak in the aleutian 
islands the quakes registered 56 and 48 on the richter scale but 
neither was felt at adak the nearest populated area 
the las vegas quake was felt most strongly in suburban north las 
vegas where a police department switchboard operator reported 
receiving at least 500 telephone calls from worried citizens 
some callers including municipal court judge gary davis 
reported cracked windows but there were no reports of serious 
property damage or injuries according to the operator who declined 
to identify herself 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude or the height of quakegenerated shock waves recorded 
on a seismograph 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage

congress as part of the 1990 budget submission reflects the 
highlights of ombs report to me on government of the future 
that management report has been expanded as a beginning to a 
planning process that has in part shaped the proposals in this 
budget and should become a part of the annual budget process

the persistence of the budget deficit is overwhelming evidence 
that the federal budget process is fundamentally flawed 
past efforts at reform have been directed largely toward 
protecting a large portion of domestic spending from real fiscal 
discipline 
fourteen years after passage of the congressional budget act and 
three years after enactment of the balanced budget and emergency 
deficit control act the federal budget process remains unwieldy and 
undisciplined 
the american people expect better of their political system and 
they deserve it 
under the congressional budget act congressional budget 
resolutions congress proposed budgets are passed each year 
they are not sent to the president for approval and therefore 
are not law 
they provide guidance to the committees of congress but the 
guidance is often late and ambiguous 
the resolutions are usually passed well after the dates required 
by law and well after they are needed by the finance authorizing 
and appropriations committees 
moreover there is little agreement within congress on the 
guidance provided 
the house of representatives and the senate do not agree except 
in the most general terms on the priorities implied by resolutions 
both have approved 
except for last years ontime performance congress 
selfimposed budget deadlines have usually been missed and massive 
continuing resolutions and reconciliation bills have been the rule 
rather than the exception 
these large cumbersome bills provide cozy hiding places for 
hundreds of special interest addons which lineitem veto authority 
would permit the president to challenge 
a number of changes in the budget process most of which i have 
recommended before are needed to instill budget discipline 
throughout the legislative process 
i urge congress to adopt the following measures 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i remain committed to and urge approval of a constitutional 
amendment requiring a balanced budget 
the amendment should require a supermajority vote at least 60 
percent in the congress to increases taxes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
my successors should be given the authority subject to 
congressional override to veto lineitems in annual appropriations 
bills in authorizing legislation that provides or mandates funding 
for programs and in revenue bills 
such authority would permit the elimination of substantial waste 
and would be an effective instrument for enforcing budget 
discipline

to enhance the presidents ability to control government 
spending i recommend that lineitem veto authority be complemented 
by a change in law that would require the congress to vote yea 
or nay on any rescission proposed by the president 
current law allows the congress to duck responsibility by simply 
ignoring proposed rescissions for 45 days 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the annual budget process consumes too much time and energy 
a biennial budget would reduce the repetitive budget tasks allow 
more time for considering key spending and revenue decisions 
provide less scope for gimmicks that give the illusion of 
savings such as shifting spending from one year to another 
without affecting the underlying programs and permit the 
realization of real savings that would be possible with a more 
assured availability of funds 
for these reasons i recommend that biennial budgeting be 
adopted 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to ensure the broader scrutiny and stricter discipline that is 
needed in the congressional budget process i propose that congress 
be required to prepare a budget resolution covering a minimum of two 
years showing revenue proposals individually and showing spending 
priorities 
the congress should also be required to submit its budget 
resolution to the president for his signature or veto 
subsequent legislation which exceeds these allocations should not 
be considered without supermajority approval 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the practice of transmitting fullyear continuing resolutions 
covering a number of appropriations bills does not permit the 
legislative and executive branches to exercise proper scrutiny of 
those bills 
too often in the past such continuing resolutions have provided 
convenient cover for specialinterest spending that would not 
survive close scrutiny 
to minimize this risk i propose that appropriations bills be 
transmitted individually to the president 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the effects of credit activities are recorded imperfectly under 
current budget accounting 
the subsidy component of federal lending programs remains hidden 
to correct this major fault in the budget system i recommended 
credit reform legislation two years ago 
this legislation which i am recommending again would measure 
the true cost the present value of the subsidies provided by 
federal credit programs and put that cost on an expenditure basis 
equivalent to the cost of other federal programs 
this change must be an integral part of the reform of the budget 
process

the supreme court today agreed to use the case 
of a convicted murderer from missouri to study doublejeopardy 
protection for criminal defendants 
the court agreed to hear arguments by state officials seeking to 
reinstate a life prison sentence for larry p thomas 
thomas was convicted of murder and attempted robbery in an 
attempted holdup of an auto parts store in st louis on nov 8 1972 
mentoe vernell a customer at the store died in a shootout with 
thomas 
thomas was sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempted robbery 
and a life term for murder 
thengov christopher bond of missouri commuted the robbery 
sentence in 1981 after thomas had served about eight years he 
remained in prison on the murder conviction 
a state court subsequently threw out the sentence for attempted 
robbery and credited the time thomas had served for that crime to 
the murder sentence the state courts said he must continue serving 
the life sentence 
thomas then appealed in federal court to have the murder sentence 
thrown out 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals in a 54 ruling last 
april ruled that thomas right against double jeopardy was violated 
because he was given multiple sentences for the same crime the 
governors commutation means that thomas legally had served one of 
his sentences and must be set free the appeals court said 
we hold that thomas had legally satisfied the 15year sentence 
for the attempted robbery and that his continued confinement for the 
felony murder offense violated his double jeopardy rights the 
appeals court said 
state officials in appealing to the supreme court said the 
appeals court exceeded its authority and misinterpreted missouri law 
the state attorney generals office said the state courts 
cured the double jeopardy violation when it threw out the 
sentence for attempted robbery and gave thomas credit for time 
served 
the case is jones vs thomas 88420

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether federal magistrates are constitutionally authorized to 
preside over jury selection when delegated such duty by federal 
trial judges 
the court said it will study the case of two men convicted in 
federal court in new york city of possessing cocaine with intent to 
distribute it 
jose gomez and diego chaveztesina say their convictions were 
tainted because the judge who presided over their trial assigned the 
task of jury selection to a federal magistrate 
their appeals argue that such a delegation of authority violates 
that part of the constitution bestowing judicial power 
gomez was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 10 years parole 
chaveztesina was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a lifetime 
parole 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the two mens 
convictions last june 1 
the appeals court said the federal magistrates act authorizes 
such delegation of power for the juryselection portions of trials 
and that the federal law does not violate the constitution 
gomez and chaveztesina had argued that magistrates only could be 
assigned pretrial duties 
justice department lawyers urged the high court to use the case 
to resolve conflicting rulings on magistrates authority between the 
2nd circuit court and the 5th us circuit court of appeals based 
in new orleans 
according to court documents gomez is now an inmate at a federal 
prison in ashland ky and chaveztesina is imprisoned in milan 
mich 
the cases are gomez vs us 885014 and chaveztesina vs 
us 885158

a federal judge this morning issued a 
temporary restraining order blocking a 3weekold immigration 
service rule that opponents say has left hundreds of central 
americans living in tents and shanties in the lower rio grande 
valley 
one would be blind not to recognize that we have a problem 
said us district judge filemon vela upon issuing the order sought 
by attorneys fighting the rule 
vela set a hearing for 9 am thursday when he said he would 
consider converting the restraining order into an injunction against 
the us immigration and naturalization service 
attorney david ayala representing the ins had asked the judge 
instead to delay considering the restraining order until thursday to 
give the government a chance to prepare further arguments 
your honor the immigration service is not to blame for the 
plight of the people who are out there ayala said 
the judges restraining order restores the right of asylum 
seekers to travel farther into the united states and submit their 
applications in the ins districts where they intend to live 
hundreds of central american asylum seekers have set up camp in 
the rio grande valley to await the processing of their applications 
some 300 applicants camping in a field near brownsville have been 
ordered to leave the primitive tent city by this afternoon because 
its private property 
todays ruling doesnt affect the property owners order except 
that the 300 persons in the tent city would be free now to go to 
another part of the united states 
the 300 have been sleeping under sheets of plastic supported by 
tree limbs for the past week in a field across the street from the 
casa oscar romero shelter for central american refugees operated by 
the roman catholic church which is filled to capacity 
the ins policy which was effective dec 16 also had limited the 
aliens ability to work during the waiting period while their asylum 
applications were processed at least 30 days 
previously aliens who entered the country illegally in southern 
texas were allowed to pursue their asylum applications in other 
cities often miami or los angeles 
ins officials say the change was adopted to reduce huge case 
backlogs in those cities and curb frivolous refugee claims the ins 
maintains that most of the 300000 asylum applicants who passed 
through the harlingen district last year were ineligible for 
political asylum because they merely wanted to better themselves 
economically 
the attorneys suing ins commissioner alan nelson and us 
attorney general dick thornburgh blame the 3weekold procedure for 
an increase in the number of central americans sleeping in condemned 
buildings and camping with little or no shelter their federal 
lawsuit was filed friday 
in essence south texas has been turned into a de facto 
detention area and asylum applicants are trapped there says the 
suit filed on behalf of asylumseekers by immigration attorney linda 
reyna yanez robert rubin of the san francisco lawyers committee 
for urban affairs and the harlingenbased proyecto libertad 
immigrant advocacy group 
it accuses the ins of depriving immigrants of adequate access to 
the asylum procedure as required by the refugee act of 1980 and of 
implementing a policy change without publishing it in the federal 
register for public comment 
ins officials have declined comment on the lawsuit 
legal officer susan timberlake with the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees visited the tent city southeast of 
brownsville last tuesday and said she witnessed difficulty and 
hardship 
on sunday sheriffs deputies told those living on the 
litterstrewn campsite that they had 24 hours to vacate the private 
property or face trespassing charges 
cameron county sheriff alex perez said authorities gave the order 
to vacate after the property owner posted no trespassing signs 
in english and spanish on sunday afternoon 
maybe ill sleep in some other field said gerardo enrique 
perez 19 of honduras as a rainy cold front blew into the area 
sunday night 
the campers have been helped by area residents who have provide 
food and clothing but the field has no sanitary facilities 
but some nearby residents said the growing campground made them 
nervous 
you dont know who these people are said alma zieger 
manager of pauls rv park who said the situation creates 
uneasiness among the retirees making up the bulk of her tenants

budget discipline and lasting deficit reduction would be 
facilitated if the legislative and executive branches were to use a 
common set of principles for scoring budget proposals and actions on 
them 
i urge that the congressional budget office and the office of 
management and budget be charged with the responsibility to develop 
in consultation with the budget finance authorizing and 
appropriations committees a common set of budget scoring principles 
for use by the legislative and executive branches 
adoption of these reforms should enable the federal government to 
make informed decisions in a deliberate fashion that fosters 
rational priorities 
the american people deserve no less from their elected 
representatives 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the accomplishments of the american people in the past eight 
years will always be for me a source of pride 
however we must continue our recent progress in reducing the 
federal deficit 
deficit reduction is a key national priority written into law by 
the grh act which despite its defects legislated a process to 
achieve a balanced budget 
this budget achieves the 1990 target of the amended act and 
projects a budget balance in 1993 
it preserves legitimate programs for the aged and needy provides 
for adequate national security devotes more resources to other 
highpriority activities and accomplishes all this without raising 
taxes 
tax increases are not needed 
history shows that they would simply be used by the congress to 
increase spending 
tax increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last 
three presidential elections 
i call upon the congress to enact this budget 
higher taxes are not needed as this budget demonstrates but 
genuine deficit reduction through moderating the growth in spending 
is essential to enable the next administration and congress to 
address the nations agenda for the future 
over the past eight years we americans have made our world a 
safer place for freedom because we had the will to reinvigorate our 
economy rebuild our defenses and provide for the less fortunate 
among us 
together we achieved a new beginning for our country and 
prepared the way for the next administration to build on our 
accomplishments

both engines on a brandnew boeing 737 
apparently failed before the plane crashed along a highway killing 
46 people officials said today aviation experts said the chances 
of doubleengine failure were about 10 million to one 
so far the evidence although by no means conclusive is 
consistent with the right engine having stopped before impact and 
there are also signs of fire in the left engine transport 
minister paul channon said in an interview on british broadcasting 
corp television 
olivier fagard a spokesman for the company that makes the cfm56 
engines the jet used told the associated press it is extremely 
improbable that both motors would break down in such a short 
interval 
we have very impressive reliability statistics said fagard 
of the french company snecma which builds the engines in consortium 
with general electric co we dont know it has been established 
that there was no fire in second motor but we dont know any more 
than that he said 
officials raised the number of confirmed dead to 46 late today 
eighty people were injured 
investigators recovered the flight recorders from the wreckage 
and firefighters pumped foam onto the crumpled jet to prevent 
seeping aviation fuel from catching fire 
the belfastbound british midland airways jet carrying 126 people 
broke into three pieces on the edge of britains main northsouth 
highway the m1 in central england on sunday night 
the twinengine boeing 737400 narrowly missed the town of 
kegworth and plowed into an embankment a few hundred yards short of 
the runway as the pilot struggled to make an emergency landing at 
east midland airport 100 miles north of london 
ham radio operator mervyn solloway said he heard not a shouted 
message but a bit of a frantic one to say weve got problems with 
the other engine that was the last i heard from the aircraft 
british midland airways said sabotage was not suspected in the 
crash which came less than three weeks after a bomb blew apart pan 
am flight 103 over the scottish village of lockerbie killing all 
259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
but prime minister margaret thatcher who flew to the scene and 
visited survivors at derby hospital said we rule out nothing we 
simply cant there will be a lot of speculation but until we have 
the facts it is unsafe for me to speculate 
asked about terrorism channon replied i dont rule out 
anything at this stage but theres certainly no evidence of it 
william tench retired head of britains air accident 
investigation board said the odds against both engines failing on a 
boeing 737 were 10 million to one 
i would look for some inadvertent technical mistake such as 
something incorrect being done to the engines during turnaround 
either inadvertently or deliberately tench said 
british midland said the jet was delivered just 12 weeks ago and 
had flown less than 500 hours it grounded its other 737400 for 
inspection 
pilot kevin hunt a 25year veteran was among the badly injured 
cut from the wreckage the last survivor a woman was pulled from a 
tangle of metal and crushed seats more than seven hours after the 
crash 
the planes two giant wings heavily loaded with fuel remained 
virtually intact the severed tail section of flight bd92 loomed 
from woodland alongside the highway surrounded by wreckage from the 
severed center and nose sections 
it makes you wonder how anybody walked from it said 
leicestershire county chief fire officer barry pearson 
survivor john mccrea said passengers were being served dinner 
when the plane got into trouble soon after takeoff from londons 
heathrow airport 
the captain said prepare for emergency landing or something 
to that effect so we braced our heads and about five seconds 
afterward we were down on the ground with a crash mccrea said 
from his bed at the derby royal infirmary in nearby nottingham 
belfast lawyer mary mchugh 26 another survivor said i 
thought we were all going to get burned alive i just thought 
thats it im dead i was terrified of burning to death 
at least four british army soldiers serving in the troubled 
northern ireland province were killed the royal ulster 
constabulary the northern ireland police force said several of its 
officers were on board 
as east midland airport the airlines home base reopened today 
55 relatives of the dead and injured were flown in from belfast 
the plane took off at 752 pm and about eight minutes later 
the captain reported severe vibrations in one of the engines 
said british midland chairman michael bishop 
hunt reported an engine on fire then said he had it under 
control and asked for clearance for an emergency landing witnesses 
said the left engine was on fire as the pilot undershot the runway 
by about half a mile and crashed at 826 pm

the tobacco industry in newspaper ads running 
around the country monday touted a survey indicating three of four 
americans dont support workplace or restaurant smoking bans 
the industrys counterinitiative through its lobbying 
organization the tobacco institute comes during the week marking 
the 25th anniversary of the first of the surgeon generals reports 
to declare smoking a health hazard 
a spokeswoman for the institute brennan dawson noted some 
antismoking groups are pushing for a smokefree society to 
achieve their purposes she said antismokers are turning to 
censorship harassment punitive taxes and intrusion into personal 
and private decisionmaking 
the majority of americans according to objective polling do 
not support these antismoking efforts she said 
the institutes poll was conducted by the washington firm of 
hamilton frederick amp schneiders which said it randomly telephoned 
1500 americans over age 18 between nov 23 and dec 6 1988 the 
respondents included 1099 nonsmokers and 401 smokers the firm said 
an overwhelming number of those polled indicated they are 
satisfied with current levels of smoking restrictions and opposed 
outright bans in the workplace or public areas the survey has a 
margin of error of plus or minus three points 
among the findings 
eight of 10 people believe it should be left to employers and 
their employees to determine workplace smoking rules without 
government interference 
about 74 percent believe restaurants should be allowed to offer 
smoking and nonsmoking sections to customers 
fiftythree percent believe excise taxes amounting to about a 
third of the price of a pack of cigarettes should stay the same 
38 percent or be reduced 15 percent 
fiftyseven percent believe cigarette advertising restrictions 
should remain the same 38 percent or be lifted entirely 23 
percent as opposed to banning all advertising 
the institutes newspaper ads declared enough is enough and 
said that meant enough taxation enough legislation enough 
control enough censorship enough harassment enough 
discrimination against smokers

joe westonwebb heard the jet come low 
over his home and instantly thought of lockerbie there was a crash 
stunned silence then screams from passengers trapped inside a web 
of smashed seats 
it was horrendous he said it seems a miracle that any one 
got out alive and i cant believe that it all didnt go up in 
flames 
the british midland airways boeing 737400 jet with 126 people 
aboard crashed beside the main northsouth highway in central 
england sunday as it attempted an emergency landing at east midlands 
airport officials said both engines apparently had failed 
the second air disaster in britain in less than three weeks sent 
a collective shudder through this village of 2000 on the edge of 
the airport as residents remembered the scottish town of lockerbie 
and the dec 21 crash of pan am flight 103 
all 259 people aboard that boeing 747 died when a bomb ripped the 
plane apart in the air and 11 people in lockerbie were killed by 
falling wreckage 
we have been very lucky said george mellors 46 another 
kegworth resident it could easily have been another lockerbie 
david harris ran into his garden and watched in horror as the 
plane flew 60 feet over his head and crashed nearby turning the 
night sky red 
thoughts of lockerbie came into my mind he said the pilot 
did well to avoid our builtup area in kegworth village it was only 
seconds away from hitting the center of the community 
flight 92 from london to belfast hit an embankment on the side of 
the m1 highway about a halfmile from the airport and broke in 
pieces at least 46 people died 
rachel meadows 19 of derby said she saw the plane come down 
just yards away as she was driving on the highway 
it seemed to clip the embankment on one side of the motorway 
and then just bounce across before it plowed into the trees there 
was an almighty flash but it didnt explode a lot of cars on the 
motorway began to brake hard i thought it was going to be a massive 
pileup but luckily no cars were hit by the plane 
westonwebb 50 of nearby sutton bonningale was one of the 
first on the scene 
when he arrived everthing was silent people started screaming 
later he said 
the seats were all slapped on top of each other where they had 
gone forward and the seats had all gone forward toward the cockpit 
end and the people had all been shunted together there were people 
in a sort of concertina you had to take the seats from the back of 
the people in front to get them out westonwebb said 
many seemed to have smashed ankles and legs and facial injuries 
he said 
police inspector graham ward said it was a terrible sight 
everything was done to pull people out as quickly as possible we 
had to flatten trees across fields to get to the plane 
more than seven hours after the crash passengers were still 
trapped in the wreckage 
the episcopal rev michael brandon 32 said prayers for the 
victims 
i held one mans hand as he died and i whispered the lords 
prayer what more can you do

france told the security council today that 
all parties should show restraint following the us downing of two 
libyan migs over the mediterranean sea last week 
we hope everyone will exercise restraint and refrain from any 
act which could enhance tensions said french envoy pierre 
brochand the deputy permanent representative 
brochand spoke at an emergency session convened to discuss 
libyas demand that the united states be condemned for shooting down 
the planes wednesday 
the united states said the planes were armed and dangerous libya 
said they were unarmed and on a reconnaissance mission 
france the first us ally to speak in the debate did not 
support or criticize either side and is expected to abstain when the 
security council votes on the issue probably wednesday 
also speaking today were finland ethiopia senegal sudan 
india morocco and bangladesh the session then adjourned until 
tuesday when a resolution was expected to be submitted 
except for france major us allies like britain have not spoken 
and virtually all speakers have denounced or criticized the us 
action 
france deeply regrets the incident between libyan and us air 
forces brochand said our country which borders the 
mediterranean is particularly concerned about the maintenance of 
stability and peace in that region 
finnish ambassador klaus tornudd also urged restraint he noted 
that libya said its aircraft were on routine reconnaissance and the 
united states said its planes were on a routine training mission 
there must be something wrong with the routines if this is the 
result he said 
he said there was a need for an international code of conduct 
covering international naval forces and aircraft 
on friday us ambassador vernon a walters exhibited two

six in 10 americans say homelessness afflicts 
their own communities and a majority would pay higher federal taxes 
to help ease the problem a media generalassociated press poll has 
found 
the national survey found wide agreement that homelessness is a 
serious and worsening problem and general dissatisfaction with the 
level of the federal governments response 
sixty percent of the respondents favored more federal spending 
for the homeless with nearly all in that group saying they would 
pay higher taxes for that purpose 
accordingly respondents rated the problem as extraordinarily 
severe sixtyeight percent called it very serious and 24 
percent said fairly serious 
the poll also exhibited the broad reach of homelessness 
threequarters said the problem plagues communities of all sizes 
not just big cities and 59 percent said there were homeless people 
in their own communities 
the telephone survey conducted among 1084 randomly selected 
adults nov 1020 had a margin of error of plus or minus three 
percentage points 
the poll was completed before the holiday season and winter cold 
refocused attention on the homeless still 68 percent said 
homelessness was worsening just a quarter said it was unchanged and 
a scant 3 percent saw improvement 
a plurality said homelessness is primarily societys fault 
rather than the fault of the homeless themselves approaches such as 
more housing for the homeless and subsidized apartments for the poor 
won strong support 
views were divided on who is responsible for solutions a 32 
percent plurality said the federal government was chiefly 
responsible for helping homeless people 24 percent said state 
governments 18 percent said local governments and 9 percent said 
private charities the rest had no opinion 
wherever prime responsibility lies only 27 percent said the 
federal government does enough to prevent people from becoming 
homeless and 58 percent said it does not the remaining 15 percent 
had no answer 
of the 60 percent who favored increasing federal spending on 
programs for the homeless 86 percent said they would be willing to 
pay higher taxes for that purpose overall 52 percent said they 
would pay more to help the homeless 
on specific programs 62 percent said the federal government 
should spend more on housing for the homeless and 65 percent 
favored the preventive measure of building more federallysubsidized 
housing 
majorities of all groups favored subsidized housing including 
those least likely to support federal spending republicans and 
conservatives in virtually all measures however homelessness was 
seen as a problem by greater shares of women democrats liberals 
minorities lowerincome respondents and younger people they also 
were more apt to blame society and to favor a broader federal 
response 
for example 78 percent of women rated the problem as very 
serious compared with 56 percent of men eightythree percent of 
democrats said it was getting worse compared with 54 percent of 
republicans and sixtyfour percent of liberals said society was at 
fault compared with 37 percent of conservatives 
of those with family incomes under 25000 a year 73 percent 
favored more subsidized housing for the poor of those earning more 
than 50000 just 54 percent agreed 
respondents were divided on whether homeless people should be 
allowed to live on the streets fiftyone percent said people should 
not be allowed to live on the streets if they want to but 45 
percent said they should have that right 
on the root cause of homelessness 45 percent said society mainly 
is at fault and 33 percent said the homeless themselves are chiefly 
to blame the rest 22 percent had no answer

a trial of avowed revolutionaries that 
has already cost the government millions of dollars moved toward 
opening arguments almost a year after lawyers began selecting jurors 
the three remaining defendants of eight who were captured in one 
of the largest manhunts in us history are accused of sedition or 
conspiring to topple the government by force under a rarely invoked 
law whose meaning has been the subject of much courtroom wrangling 
it is a serious threat to fundamental liberties said peter 
avenia one of six defense lawyers 
prosecutors contend however that the charge of sedition fits 
the group they describe as a dangerous band of terrorists a boston 
courthouse worker lost a leg and 21 other people were wounded in one 
of the score of bombings the group allegedly plotted from 1976 to 
1985 
jury selection began last march with a vast pool of jurors 
selection of the final few jurors in the us district court trial 
wound up this morning with the seating of 12 jurors and five 
alternates opening arguments were slated to begin tuesday 
up to 350 witnesses could be called a closedcircuit camera has 
been installed with monitors in another room in case defendants are 
ejected for unruliness observers must pass through two metal 
detectors to reach the courtroom which an estimated 40 marshals 
take turns guarding 
the defendants each face up to 60 years in prison and 60000 in 
fines if convicted on the charges of seditious conspiracy 
racketeering conspiracy and racketeering enterprise 
their attorneys argue that the trial is a waste of money because 
their clients already have been convicted on bombing and bank 
robbery charges and all but one are serving prison sentences the 
cost so far is estimated at well over 3 million 
the defense attorneys say the seditious conspiracy statute is so 
broad that it could be used against protesters blocking streets 
if people engage in political dissent and think this cant 
happen to them they should read the statute said avenia 
the statute makes it a crime for two or more persons in any 
state or territory to conspire to overthrow or put down or destroy 
by force the government of the united states 
the government has used the statute only a few times since it was 
first invoked to punish confederates during the civil war said 
arthur d wolf a professor at western new england college in 
springfield 
it was used to keep protesters from hindering the draft during 
world war i and to prosecute puerto rican nationalists accused in an 
assassination attempt against thenpresident harry truman last 
april nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditious 
conspiracy charges in arkansas 
in the case going to trial here an fbi hunt for the defendants 
swept through hundreds of towns in massachusetts new hampshire 
vermont connecticut new york and ohio in 1983 
arrested in their cleveland house on nov 4 1984 were jaan 
laaman 40 his wife barbara j curzilaaman 31 and richard 
williams 41 agents in deerfield ohio arrested raymond luc 
levasseur 42 and his wife patricia gros levasseur 34 the same 
day carol a manning 33 and her husband thomas manning 42 were 
apprehended six months later in norfolk va christopher king 38 
was arrested in north attleboro in 1982 
the federal trial was moved to springfield in 1987 so that 
defendants could be housed together at a jail in nearby hartford 
conn 
the only defendants however are williams and the levasseurs 
the five others either have changed their pleas to guilty or been 
dropped from the case mrs levasseur is out on bail having 
finished a fiveyear term for possessing false identification and 
harboring her fugitive husband 
king was tried separately in 1987 he pleaded guilty that 
december to one count of seditious conspiracy and was sentenced to 
seven years in prison 
in august the government dropped charges against manning and 
laaman saying manning already was serving 53 years and laaman 45 
years for bombings manning also got a life sentence for the 1981 
shooting death of a new jersey state trooper 
mrs manning pleaded guilty two weeks ago to all three counts 
she was sentenced to five years to be served concurrently with her 
15year term on bombing charges 
on friday the first circuit court of appeals upheld a decision 
suppressing evidence against mrs curzilaaman because it was seized 
without a search warrant the decision meant she would be tried 
separately she is serving a 15year sentence

television portrayals of lawyers as 
aggressive loud obnoxious persons who insult judges is 
ungentle manly and womanly and the kentucky bar association wants 
to be sure life doesnt imitate tv 
the association has decreed that kentuckys lawyers should be 
courteous in the courtroom and friendly with their colleagues and 
that the lawyers should never intentionally mislead or deceive their 
adversaries 
the code of professional courtesy endorsed by the associations 
governing board in september carries no penalties 
but george long ii the associations president said it will 
remind lawyers to watch their ps and qs 
long acknowledged that the law inherently involves conflict but 
he said it should be practiced courteously 
richard frymire head of the associations committee on lawyer 
professionalism which drafted the code said it is designed to 
counter television portrayals of lawyers as aggressive loud 
obnoxious persons who insult judges and a growing sense that is 
how real lawyers are supposed to behave 
i think its terrible that a profession like the law has to 
have this type of code imposed said martin johnstone the chief 
jefferson circuit court judge but from what ive seen over the 
past few years i think its necessary 
still some practitioners say the code may clash with more 
important ethical requirements and describe it as vague and even 
silly 
why do we have to be friendly asked louisville lawyer c 
thomas hectus am i supposed to inquire as to how are the wife and 
kids 
writing in the associations magazine bench amp bar us district 
judge william bertelsman said lawyers have become more aggressive 
and harder to get along with he said judges must devote 
increasing time to refereeing abusive tactics that range from 
benign incivility to outright obstruction 
i absolutely believe a lawyer can zealously represent clients 
and abide by all precepts of the code said frymire

nickles said the bill will be an effort to put some teeth in 
a proposed international agreement banning the use storage and 
production of chemical weapons worldwide 
this is an effort to make sure that if we do catch them we 
would do something about it said nickles noting that certain 
west german chemical companies are alleged to have helped iraq and 
libya attain chemical warfare capability 
nickles who attended the ongoing conference on chemical weapons 
in paris told a news conference that while he found the meeting 
helpful he continues to believe that the utopian goal of banning 
nuclear weapons will be close to impossible 
he said that events like the use of poison gas in the iraniraq 
war show that even some signers of the 1925 international agreement 
banning the use of chemical weapons have clearly violated it 
measures are lacking that would impose some penalties if 
countries dont comply he said we have to have some teeth 
behind these treaties 
he said he will seek passage in partnership with senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas of legislation imposing 
sanctions on individual companies involved in chemical weapons 
proliferation

here are excerpts from the text of the budget 
message which president reagan sent to congress on monday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
eight years ago many in this country were concerned about the 
future of our economy our government and indeed the nation 
itself 
to resolve the economic problems then facing us our 
administration proposed a recovery program centering on four 
fundamental principles 
reduce personal and business tax rates 
reduce the rate of growth of federal spending 
reduce the federal regulatory burden by eliminating unnecessary 
restrictions while protecting the publics interest and safety 
support a moderate and steady monetary policy to bring inflation 
under control 
to rebuild our defense capabilities and restore americas 
standing in the world we proposed expanded national security and 
international programs 
today the american people can be proud of the progress that has 
been made on each of these fronts 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the one area in which i have been persistently disappointed 
throughout my term of office has been in the efforts to bring the 
budget under control 
time and again i have proposed measures to help curb federal 
domestic program spending time and again these proposals have been 
rejected by congress 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the fiscal year 1990 budget my last represents a continuation 
of my efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit through restraint 
in domestic spending 
the budget i am submitting today complies with the deficit 
targets set in the grammrudmanhollings grh act by proposing 
measures that meet the 1990 deficit target of 100 billion and 
assure a steady reduction in the deficit leading to a balanced 
budget in 1993 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is 
possible without raising taxes without cutting into essential 
social programs without devastating defense and without neglecting 
other national priorities 
it can be done in a reasonable responsible way with discipline 
and fairness 
new taxes are not required 
we have an opportunity this year to put the worst of the deficit 
problem behind us and enable the next administration to begin its 
term of office with a clean slate and with the promise of continuing 
prosperity 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to address urgent national priorities within the deficit limit 
set by the grh act my budget proposes that some programs such 
as those for aids research and prevention drug enforcement and 
technology development receive significant funding increases 
while others are reduced reformed or in some cases terminated 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
maintaining peace and protecting our country are the foremost 
responsibilities of the federal government 
defense budget authority declined in real inflationadjusted 
terms for the fourth straight year with funding of 299 billion for 
1989 
this trend cannot continue without severe impact on combat 
readiness 
therefore my budget requests defense funding of 315 billion in 
budget authority and 303 billion in outlays for 1990 and 331 
billion in budget authority and 314 billion in outlays in 1991 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this budget reflects my belief that addressing the problem of 
aids must remain a top priority 
preventing and alleviating suffering from the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes aids is our highest 
public health priority federal support for research prevention 
and treatment exceeds 21 billion in 1989 and will approach 28 
billion in 1990 this budget asks for 16 billion or 24 percent 
over 1989 for public health service hiv funding

the program structure and incentives underlying many domestic 
federal programs need to be altered to promote greater efficiency 
and costeffectiveness 
current farm price support programs are far too costly 
for the period 198689 an estimated 130 billion in federal 
spending for farmrelated assistance programs provided an average of 
nearly 600000 per farmer 
much of this assistance goes to farmers with high incomes more 
than twice the us family average 
i therefore propose outlay reductions for the price and income 
support programs of 2 billion in 1990 and additional annual 
reductions of between 2 and 25 billion in each year from 1991 
through 1994 
the rapidly rising costs of the medicare program need to be 
moderated 
i propose a reasonable increase in the medicare prospective 
payment system rate and reductions in hospital capital payments and 
special graduate medical education payments 
also in an effort to restrain excessive growth in supplementary 
medical insurance smi costs i propose extension of the current 
law smi premiums limitations on physican payments reductions in 
payments for certain overpriced procedures and reforms in the 
durable medical equipment payment system 
medicare spending would still grow by 9 percent between 1989 and 
1990 under these proposals but not by the 13 percent that would 
occur under current law 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as the federal government grew it took on improper 
responsibilities and managed its programs inefficiently 
we undertook to return the federal government to its proper role 
we also initiated a major program to improve the management of 
the remaining programs 
these priorities are continued and expanded in this budget 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the persistence of the budget deficit is overwhelming evidence 
that the federal budget process is fundamentally flawed 
past efforts at reform have been directed largely toward 
protecting a large portion of domestic spending from real fiscal 
discipline 
except for last years ontime performance congress 
selfimposed budget deadlines have usually been missed and massive 
continuing resolutions and reconciliation bills have been the rule 
rather than the exception 
these large cumbersome bills provide cozy hiding places for 
hundreds of special interest addons which lineitem veto authority 
would permit the president to challenge 
i remain committed to and urge approval of a constitutional 
amendment requiring a balanced budget 
the amendment should require a supermajority vote at least 60 
percent in the congress to increase taxes 
my successors should be given the authority subject to 
congressional override to veto lineitems in annual appropriations 
bills in authorizing legislation that provides or mandates funding 
for programs and in revenue bills 
such authority would permit the elimination of substantial waste 
and would be an effective instrument for enforcing budget 
discipline 
the annual budget process consumes too much time and energy 
a biennial budget would reduce the repetitive budget tasks allow 
more time for considering key spending and revenue decisions 
provide less scope for gimmicks that give the illusion of 
savings such as shifting spending from one year to another 
without affecting the underlying programs and permit the 
realization of real savings that would be possible with a more 
assured availability of funds 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the accomplishments of the american people in the past eight 
years will always be for me a source of pride 
however we must continue our recent progress in reducing the 
federal deficit 
deficit reduction is a key national priority written into law by 
the grh act which despite its defects legislated a process to 
achieve a balanced budget 
this budget achieves the 1990 target of the amended act and 
projects a budget balance in 1993 
it preserves legitimate programs for the aged and needy provides 
for adequate national security devotes more resources to other 
highpriority activities and accomplishes all this without raising 
taxes 
tax increases are not needed 
history shows that they would simply be used by the congress to 
increase spending 
tax increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last 
three presidential elections 
i call upon the congress to enact this budget 
higher taxes are not needed as this budget demonstrates but 
genuine deficit reduction through moderating the growth in spending 
is essential to enable the next administration and congress to 
address the nations agenda for the future

true to his word president reagans final 
budget calls for no general tax increase although it would halt a 
scheduled cut in aviation taxes and require all state and local 
government workers to pay for medicare 
the budget that reagan submitted to congress on monday includes a 
21 billion tax cut for corporations and 39 million of tax relief 
for the oil and gas industries 
overall revenues would drop by 1 billion compared with current 
law under the budget for fiscal 1990 the 12 months that begin next 
oct 1 
most of the revenue changes had been proposed a year ago in 
fact the president has submitted some of them for several years 
running only to have them ignored or rejected by congress 
reagans written message cited his final budget as evidence 
that a gradual elimination of the deficit is possible without 
raising taxes 
tax increases are not needed the president continued tax 
increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last three 
presidential elections 
however among the hundreds of tables in the budget documents is 
one showing that during reagans eight years in office congress 
passed and he signed 13 separate tax increases that will cost 
taxpayers 150 billion during the next budget year reaganera tax 
reductions will save taxpayers 377 billion next year 
in addition to the tax changes he proposed for 1990 reagan 
recommended 1 billion of fees on those who use selected government 
services the largest single provision in this package 394 
million would raise the 1 percent fee for va loan guarantees to 38 
percent and make it permanent 
another recommendation would require middle and upperincome 
veterans to pay a portion of the cost of government medical care for 
nonserviceconnected problems 
commercial and recreational boaters would have to pay a 25 
annual charge for using coast guardpatrolled waterways entrance 
fees would be imposed for corps of engineer recreational facilities 
charges at forest service facilities would be broadened and the fee 
on commodity credit corp loan guarantees would double to 12 
percent 
among the tax proposals 
repeal a law requiring that taxes on airplane tickets 8 
percent air shippers 5 percent and plane fuel be cut in half 
next jan 1 unless federal spending for airports and airways reaches 
a certain level that level is not expected to be reached but 
reagan called for keeping those taxes at current rates which would 
cost shippers and travelers 12 billion 
require all state and local government workers to pay the tax 
that funds medicare those hired before april 1 1986 are not 
paying even though most are eligible for medicare because of 
earlier nongovernment employment or through their spouses this 
would raise 2 billion 
permit corporations that operate abroad to allocate at least 
twothirds of their total research costs to domestic income saving 
them 17 billion 
make permanent a 20 percent tax credit for increased spending 
for research saving those businesses 400 milllion 
liberalize deductions permitted oil and gas producers for 
depletion at a cost to the treasury of 39 million 
increase internal revenue service enforcement activities 
producing a 300 million boost in tax collections 
reagan again proposed to sell us oilfields at teapot dome 
wyo and elk hills calif for 1 billion and all or parts of 
several powermarketing administrations including those in alaska 
and the southeast which would bring in 13 billion in 1990 
the budget also proposes to raise money by selling or allowing 
prepayment of 69 billion of government loans for 58 billion 
including those for college housing and small business 
administration loans for business and disaster relief

chinas most prominent dissident on monday called 
for the release of the nations most famous political prisoner in 
shanghai meanwhile a prodemocracy activist was let out of jail 
fang lizhi an internationally respected astrophysicist said 
freeing all political prisoners especially wei jingsheng would 
be a humanitarian gesture and would have a beneficial effect on our 
social morale 
fang made his call in a letter to chinese leader deng xiaoping 
that was obtained monday 
wei an electrician by profession wrote a series of articles on 
the need for democracy in 1978 during the beijing spring a 
period of relative political liberalization shortly after the end of 
the ultraleftist cultural revolution he was arrested on march 29 
1979 and sentenced to 15 years in prison for 
counterrevolutionary crimes 
amnesty internatiomal a londonbased human rights group has 
adopted wei as a prisoner of conscience human rights groups have 
variously reported that wei has died or is suffering from severe 
schizophrenia in custody 
amnesty international estimates thousands of chinese are in 
prison for crimes of conscience 
fang was expelled from the communist party and fired from his 
post as vice chairman of the chinese science and technology 
university in hefei in 1987 for allegedly fomenting prodemocracy 
unrest among the nations students 
he later was given a position as a highlevel researcher at the 
chinese academy of sciences and allowed to travel abroad china has 
denied fangs most recent request to go to the united states

cities and called for democracy in china 
yang wei a former student at the university of arizona was one 
of the demonstrators 
on monday yang was released from the ti lan qiao prison in 
shanghai after serving one year of a twoyear sentence for 
counterrevolutionary activities

first concern was the health of his father who has cancer 
im going to see him today said yang he is in the 
hospital and he is in serious condition

yang 33 who received a masters degree in molecular biology from 
arizona said he would like to return to the united states to 
continue his studies

several hours because three members of the chinese alliance for 
democracy were apprehended in shanghai over the weekend with copies 
of china spring and a letter for ywng 
the alliance was set up in 1983 by a former chinese citizen in 
order to promote democracy in china chinese officials have declared 
it an illegal organization 
the men a chineseamerican a chinesecanadian and a chinese 
citizen were put on flights out of china after they admitted 
breaking the law official reports said 
it was not clear why the chinese citizen who is a student at 
utah state university was allowed to leave 
yang was sentenced in december 1987 he had been held without 
charges since january 1987 in the student protests 
prosecutors accused yang of stirring up antigovernment protests 
in shanghai the court said he put up reactionary slogans at

demonstrations 
on dec 3 1987 the us congress called for yangs release 
saying he had broken no chinese or us laws 
china labeled the move an undisguised interference in chinas 
internal affairs

the soviet union is trying to foster a 
technological spurt with a proposal to offer tax breaks for 
staterun enterprises that put new inventions to use an official 
said monday 
is nayashkov chairman of the state committee on inventions and 
discoveries told a news conference that a draft law on inventions 
proposes giving a threeyear income tax exemption to staterun 
businesses that put inovations to use 
officials hope such a move will increase the interest of 
enterprises in inventive work or in research and development he 
said president mikhail s gorbachev says more modern technology is 
a key to modernizing soviet industry and providing a higher standard 
of living 
the draft law was published in the official press dec 27 and 
must be approved by the supreme soviet or parliament at one of its 
sessions in 1989 it is unclear yet when it will go into effect 
the law also would allow the establishment of venture banks to 
encourage investors and set aside patent funds to help inventors 
without the means to support their work nayashkov said 
he said there has been little movement and weak dynamics in 
recent years with the number of applications for patents and the 
number actually registered remaining virtually without change 
since 198384 soviets have applied for between 170000 and 
190000 patents annually and 7000080000 have been granted he 
said the remainder were judged not to offer anything substantially 
new or valuable 
nayashkov said the law also seeks to better protect foreigners by 
bringing soviet patent law closer to a convention signed in 
washington in 1970 and gives soviets the right to register their 
inventions in foreign countries instead of the soviet union as long 
as their inventions dont concern defense matters or state secrets

soviet officials will conduct a census beginning 
thursday that they say will give them a much broader understanding 
of the population and citizens living conditions 
more than a million students teachers and whitecollar workers 
will fan out across the vast country from jan 1219 with a 
questionnaire that for the first time will ask a series of questions 
about housing conditions 
but mikhail s korolev chairman of the state statistics 
committee said no questions will be asked about religion or about 
salaries 
previous surveys have determined that the population does not 
give reliable answers about their income he said some people 
hide their income some people increase it before other members of 
the family some people fantasize he said 
korolev pledged that all responses will be confidential sealed 
by census workers after the information is fed into computer he 
said the results will be made public but not as early as officials 
originally thought 
there will be no disclosure of personal data to anyone 
korolev told a news conference 
the census has been extended until feb 11 in armenia because of 
the dec 7 earthquake and that means initial figures wont be 
available in april as scientists originally thought korolev said 
some soviet publications contend that dictator josef stalin 
falsified census data in the 1930s and destroyed a 1937 census to 
hide massive deaths caused by his collectivization of agriculture 
and purges 
korolev said he knew of no cases of falsifying census data but 
that the results from the 1937 census were missing 
in 1934 stalin announced a population figure of 168 million 
even though the official figure was 1657 million and one scientist 
put the actual figure as low as 158 million 
soviet reference books put the population at the time of the 1917 
bolshevik revolution at 163 million and korolev said experts 
estimate the population now is about 287 million 
the head of the statistics committee said questions about housing 
that will appear for the first time include the age of housing in 
which respondents live what the buildings are made of whether the 
housing is stateowned or cooperative the number of rooms and the 
floor area 
that list of questions developed along united nations 
guidelines will give officials an idea of what kinds of housing are 
most durable as well as firm data about what kinds of housing 
soviets are living in he said 
housing is one of the sore spots in efforts to improve living 
conditions and about one in five still lives in communal housing 
much of the housing such as that which collapsed in the armenian 
earthquake is of poor construction 
the last full census 10 years ago showed a population of 262 
million a pilot census was taken five years ago

libyas official news agency on monday 
criticized foreign journalists who reported there were weapons 
around the desert factory the united states alleges is a chemical 
weapons plant 
about 100 journalists were expelled from libya on sunday and 
about 30 others were told late sunday that they had to depart monday 
they arrived last week after us fighter jets shot down two 
libyan warplanes over the mediterranean 
the expulsion orders came a few hours after the journalists were 
taken saturday evening to the plant at rabta 60 miles southwest of 
tripoli 
libya insists the plant is designed for producing medicine 
journalists were not allowed inside the plant and because it was 
nightfall when they arrived by bus they could see very little from 
the outside 
clearly visible however was a ring of surfacetoair missiles 
around the plant as well as a concretebased radar station a few 
miles away libyan officials said the defenses were put into place 
after president reagan last month said he could not rule out a 
military strike against the plant 
libyas official news agency jana on monday said the 
journalists were invited to see the plant as an expression of good 
will and out of its concern to enable them to acquaint themselves 
with the reality of a small country upon which aggression and 
confrontation are imosed by a superpower namely america 
statements in some news reports that the mere fact of the 
journalists seeing the buildings did not help determine the nature 
of these buildings and that there are weapons guns and buildings 
are inaccurate and lack objectivity jana said the journalists 
unless they are are specially qualified are not experts in 
determining the nature of the factory and its installations 
adopting the argument of the existence of guns and weapons in 
the area surrounding the factory to give it another character falls 
in line with the desires of some and the reply to it is in the face 
of the threats of america to deal a blow to the area are the masses 
who are staging a sitin there not entitled to make available the 
means to defend the area and to protect themselves the dispatch 
said 
libya it said in so far as it is concerned with enabling 
journalists to carry out their professional duties requires the 
necessary commitment to the rules of neutrality objectivity and 
impartiality from journalists 
libyas foreign minister in paris for a conference on chemical 
weapons said sunday his country had no plans to manufacture 
chemical weapons when asked if libya planned to make such arms he 
replied you will never know

president reagan on monday asked congress for a 
small increase in funding for veterans medical care and pensions as 
he proposed outlays of 299 billion for the new department of 
veterans affairs 
outlays for the veterans administration which provided benefits 
and services to veterans for 58 years are estimated to be 292 
billion in fiscal 1989 the budget for the new department which 
assumes cabinet status in march calls for a 700 million increase 
among the budget proposals are a slight increase in outlays for 
medical care including the treatment provided to veterans at 
hospitals nursing homes and on an outpatient basis in fiscal 1989 
outlays totaled 114 billion the 1990 budget calls for 115 
billion 
outlays for construction of state extended care facilities 
increased from 37 million in 1989 to 44 million in 1990 while 
outlays for major project construction was cut from 527 million to 
514 million 
the budget proposes using construction funds for two large 
hospital projects in palm beach fla and newington conn 
proposed outlays for total pensions are 4 billion a 94 million 
increase over the estimated total for fiscal 1989 veterans age 65 
or older with low incomes and wartimeservice are entitled to the 
pensions the wartimeservice does not differentiate between combat 
or noncombat duty 
the pension payments also included a 4 percent costofliving 
increase effective this month 
total outlays for income security for disabled aged or deceased 
veterans in the 1990 budget are 164 billion up from 156 billin 
in 1989 
the reagan administration in the budget also recommends linking 
future veterans compensation costofliving adjustments to annual 
changes in the consumer price index 
the administration also proposes changes in the veterans housing 
program including orgination fees for participating in federal 
credit programs the budget plan did not specify the cost of the 
fees 
two other recommendations affecting housing for veterans propose 
legislation to increase the expiring fee charged on guaranteed 
housing loans and vendee loans and to allow negotiated interest 
rates on guaranteed mortgages 
the expiring fee charge would increase from 1 percent to 38 
percent of the mortgage amount and the borrower could add the fee to 
the mortgage a vendee loan is a direct loan made to veterans and 
nonveterans who purchase property that the veterans administration 
acquired through defaults 
the administration also is seeking budget authority of 15 
million for the court of veterans appeals which would allow 
veterans to appeal some benefit decisions of the departments board

authorities arrested 61 people who rioted 
over confusion surrounding a new food subsidy program officials 
said monday 
rioting broke out in the central zambian town of luanshya on 
sunday and paramilitary police were dispatched to restore order 
said provincial political secretary boniface mapani 
no further details of the police action were given local media 
reports said the rioting followed the introduction of a coupon 
system to buy corn meal zambias staple food 
coupons were not readily available and the program created 
widespread confusion according to the reports 
the corn meal subsidy program is aimed at reducing state food 
subsidies but so far it has been plagued by coupon shortages and 
administrative inefficiency 
under the program eligible families receive free coupons to help 
them buy corn meal at statedesignated shops it replaces a broader 
subsidy program that was scrapped in response to demands by the 
international monetary fund

israels supreme court on monday cleared the way 
for construction of a soccer stadium in jerusalem a move opposed by 
ultraorthodox jews who fear weekend games will desecrate the 
sabbath 
the ruling which orders the interior ministry to sign the 
building permit ended a 15year battle to get the athletic field 
built according to the office of jerusalem mayor teddy kollek 
kollek hailed the decision as a victory for jerusalems youth 
who must travel to the coastal city of jaffa to see betar jerusalem 
the team with the largest following 
kollek along with liberal parliament member dedi zucker and a 
group of sports fans filed the petition to the high court a year 
and a half ago 
i share the happiness of the residents and sports fans of the 
capital kollek said in a statement 
he said the stadium would be built as soon as possible 
adding septembers soccer season will open in a new stadium 
construction has been blocked by the interior ministry which 
refused to sign the building permit despite approval for the arena 
from all necessary local government and planning authorities 
the ministry which traditionally is headed by an orthodox 
minister argued that noise from the stadium and its parking lot 
could disrupt religious jews on the sabbath which begins at sundown 
friday and continues until sundown saturday 
the religious also argued that building the stadium would 
encourage jews to break the sabbath by driving to see games 
most soccer games in israel are played on saturday 
interior ministry spokeswoman tova elinson said there would be no 
comment on the ruling until the minister arye deri returned from 
the united states on tuesday 
the 12000seat stadium is to be built in the malha neighborhood 
in southwestern jerusalem many residents of the bayit vagan 
neighborhood to the north are orthodox jews 
the site has a grass playing field but no seating and no parking 
facilities construction is expected to cost about 24 million 
zucker a member of the leftleaning citizens rights party 
described the ruling as a victory for secular jews he noted 18 
months ago we opened the town for theaters and movies on fridays 
and now we have given the town what it is entitled to have like any 
other city in israel a stadium

the central state archive has opened 500000 secret 
files on such subjects as the russian orthodox church and the white 
guard opposition to bolshevik revolution tass said monday 
records on organizations liquidated during the 1920s and 
1930s at the height of the stalinist repression are being 
declassified the official news agency said 
the government has opened a number of longclosed records to 
historians in the past year 
specialists may now view documents of the czarist secret 
police jails and courts tass said it did not define 
specialists 
the news agency also said a provision has been set for 
reviewing documents of the soviet unions prosecutors office its 
supreme court the ministry of health the state publishing 
committee and the central council of trade unions that seemed to 
imply that some restrictions would remain 
the white guards opposed the bolshevik revolution in 1917 and 
fought the red army in a civil war that ended in 1922 when the last 
whites were ousted from vladivostok 
tass did not define the liquidated organizations covered in 
the files but dictator josef stalin was responsible for the deaths 
of millions of his people during the 1930s he wiped out the small 
businesses of the new economic policy era a class of independent 
farmers called kulaks and various groups he considered political 
opponents 
central state archive director boris kaptelov said the changes 
will broaden the base for social sciences

the supreme court on monday agreed to study the 
power of judges to impose harsher sentences on defendants who back 
out of pleabargain agreements 
the justices said they will consider reinstating the life 
sentence of an alabama man convicted of burglary before standing 
trial in 1986 james lewis smith had pleaded guilty to the burglary 
charge and had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for it 
smith had been indicted in montgomery on charges of rape 
burglary and sodomy all arising from the same incident in a 
pleabargain agreement he pleaded guilty to rape and burglary and 
the sodomy charge was dropped 
smith was sentenced to 30 years on each of the two counts with 
the sentences to run concurrently 
he then sought to withdraw his guilty plea and a state appeals 
court allowed him to do so it ruled that smith had not been 
informed that he would be sentenced as a repeat offender and would 
be subject to stiffer penalties than he expected 
smith stood trial was convicted and then was sentenced by the 
same state judge who had earlier accepted his plea bargain 
the judge sentenced smith to separate life terms for the sodomy 
and burglary convictions and to 150 years for the rape conviction 
a state appeals court upheld the life terms for sodomy and 
burglary but set aside the sentence for smiths rape conviction 
the alabama supreme court last june 24 threw out smiths life 
sentence on the burglary conviction ruling that it represented 
judicial vindictiveness 
it is clear that the trial judge increased smiths sentence 
because of his subjective observations and not because of any 
objective evidence of events subsequent to smiths first 
conviction the state said 
the june ruling did not affect smiths life sentence for the 
sodomy conviction 
state attorney general don siegelman appealed the alabama supreme 
court ruling asking the nations highest court to draw a 
distinction between cases in which defendants withdraw guilty pleas 
and those in which they are resentenced after successful appeals 
the supreme court in 1969 limited judges power to impose more 
stringent sentences after defendants successfully appealed their 
original prison terms 
the current case is alabama vs smith 88333

irans hardline prosecutor general said monday 
more drug traffickers will be executed in a nationwide 
antinarcotics campaign the official islamic republic news agency 
reported 
more than 1000 people have been arrested and scores have been 
killed in gunfights during recent weeks of the crackdown 
we have no fear of increasing statistics on executions because 
those who become the victims of death traders are far greater in 
number than the smugglers irna quoted prosecutor general mohammad 
mousavi khoeniha as saying 
he was addressing a tehran seminar on enforcing new laws that 
take effect jan 21 they impose a mandatory death sentence on 
anyone caught carrying an ounce or more heroin morphine codeine or 
methadone or smuggling more than 11 pounds of any narcotic 
irans official media reported 19 convicted drug traffickers were 
executed friday and saturday in tehran and other cities 
khoeniha emerged as a hardliner in the 1979 revolution he 
advocated mass execution of opposition members and was mentor of 
militants who seized the us embassy in tehran in november 1979 and 
held 52 americans hostage for 444 days

americans must look to the government not the 
private sector to meet their longterm health care needs through a 
comprehensive program financed with increased taxes a national 
consumer group said monday 
in an analysis of the growing longterm care problem facing the 
nation and the major proposals in congress to address it consumers 
union recommends creation of a universal insurance program funded 
with taxes and premiums 
consumers unions criticism of private longterm health care 
insurance is based on a survey last may by consumer reports the 
groups producttesting publication but the health insurance 
association of america said the policies that were rated by the 
publication were old and are not representative of those being 
offered today 
consumers union outlined proposals for a basic program at four 
federal spending levels ranging up to 50 billion far more than 
the state and federal governments now spend on longterm care and 
said that even the more expensive proposals dont have to worsen the 
federal deficit 
revenue options include increasing the social security payroll 
tax establishing a broadbased payroll tax for longterm care 
imposing an income tax surcharge increasing gift and estate taxes 
raising alcohol or gasoline excise taxes and requiring payment of 
premiums 
we should not let the budget deficit be used as an excuse for 
no action or inappropriate action said gail shearer author of 
the report 
part of the problem the report says is the growing cost of 
longterm care financed through medicaid which diverts funds needed 
to provide acute health care to the poor 
also current policies force people to spend down their 
assets and income to qualify for medicaid benefits with annual 
nursing home charges averaging about 26000 per resident a 
condition consumers union calls longterm careinduced poverty 
comes quickly for many 
also people who care for family members at home often can get 
little or no paid assistance resulting in financial physical and 
emotional strain on the caregiver the report said 
the private insurance industry is incapable of solving the 
problem the report said too often companies reject applicants with 
higher than average health risks and policies are expensive 
costing up to 100 per month for a 65yearold and more for older 
applicants the report said 
many policies restrict benefits for more expensive custodial care 
and require prior hospitalization before paying benefits while few 
policies protect against inflation consumers union said 
private insurance is unlikely to be available to people at high 
risk and will remain unaffordable by most people the report said 
but susan van gelder associate director of policy development 
and research at the insurance association said most policies issued 
in the last six months have eliminated many of the restrictions in 
the old policies and most now recognize inflation 
longterm care according to the definition used in the consumers 
union report is the help needed to cope and sometimes survive 
when physical or mental disabilities impair the capacity to perform 
the basic activities of everyday life such as eating toileting 
bathing dressing and moving about 
the federal government in 1987 spent about 111 billion on care 
in skilled nursing facilities and intermediatecare facilities and 
states added 89 billion for these services according to hhs 
figures for 1988 were not available the department said 
consumers union said its low option would cost an additional 
10 billion in federal money which would be spent primarily to 
finance a comprehensive home health care program for people of all 
ages it also would include a voluntary longterm care policy for 
nursing home coverage 
a 20 billion program could include comprehensive home health 
care benefits as well as nursing home coverage for the first six 
months of care and a voluntary insurance program for longterm 
nursing home stays a benefits package similar to that proposed by 
sen edward m kennedy dmass 
the groups 50 billion plan would include the elements of the 
previous option with expanded nursing home care benefits

libyas foreign minister said today the united 
states has launched vile campaigns against libya while helping 
israel build a stockpile of nuclear chemical and biological weapons 
foreign minister jadallah azouz ettalhi also said us 
allegations libya has a plant intended to build chemical weapons are 
clearly false 
earlier soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said 
evidence shown him by secretary of state george shultz did not prove 
the us allegations 
addressing an international conference on chemical weapons 
ettalhi said the us position on chemical weapons is discriminatory 
how can any member of the international community proclaim a 
right it denies others and how can it stand in the way of 
international efforts at eradicating these weapons while at the 
same time launching vile campaigns of calumny on the basis of a 
discriminatory racist position basing itself on accusations which 
are clearly false he said 
the libyan minister claimed israel has nuclear chemical and 
biological weapons stockpiles and that the united states provides 
financing and technical assistance 
this power the united states doesnt hesitate to aggress the 
victim this situation is dangerous ettalhi said agreed 
international rules must be applied to all parties without 
discrimination 
the fiveday conference which began saturday was called to 
bolster flagging talks on a chemical weapons ban 
the united states and the soviet union are the only two countries 
to admit possessing chemical weapons according to us estimates 
about 20 countries possess or have the ability to manufacture 
chemical weapons 
the only existing document on chemical weapons the 1925 geneva 
protocol bans only their use and without enforcement power is 
regarded as inadequate by many nations 
vice premier tariq aziz of iraq led a move sunday against a ban 
on chemical arms unless nuclear weapons are also banned he said 
israel has nuclear weapons as well as chemical weapons and 
missiles that can reach many arab cities 
israel called the iraqi statement blatant hypocrisy iraq is 
known to have used chemical weapons in its 8year war with iran 
foreign minister moshe arens of israel today accused iraq libya 
and syria of having chemical arms telling conference delegates that 
these weapons have been used by countries that made no attempt to 
hide or disguise their hostility to israel 
shultz met shevardnadze on sunday and said he had won a promise 
from the soviets to conduct their own inquiry into the plant at 
rabta south of tripoli he said at the time he believed the soviets 
ultimately would back the us 
libya has denied its plant can make chemical weapons claiming it 
is intended to produce pharmaceuticals 
the american secretary of state showed me the building plan 
but that proves nothing shevardnadze told reporters today just 
before leaving paris for moscow 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
shultz had given shevardnadze limited information only to show the 
information was detailed and serious 
in response the foreign minister indicated the soviets took 
these issues seriously and would be looking into it and asking 
questions redman said thats whats important 
shevardnadze told reporters he had told shultz that the most 
important thing is to stabilize the situation after the air 
incident during which american fighters shot down two libyan 
warlanes over the mediterranean last week 
on sunday the soviet union announced it would start destroying 
chemical arms stockpiles us officials said the soviets were 
merely playing catchup because the united states has been 
routinely destroying stockpiles of aging chemical arms since the 
early 1980s 
shevardnadze said the soviet union will not wait for disarmament 
negotiators in geneva to reach an accord banning use production and 
stockpiling of chemical arms he said a new soviet facility to 
destroy chemical weapons will go into operation this year 
the envoy said his country has stopped production of chemical 
weapons an announcement first made in april 1987 
lynn hansen director ofthe bureau of multilateral affairs at the 
us arms control and disarmament agency said the soviet position 
now corresponds to our own position we simply dont get the 
press because for us its more routine 
when they do it all of a sudden its news hansen told 
reporters 
the united states halted production of chemical weapons in 1969 
but resumed 18 years later to counter the soviet buildup the 
soviet union says it has 50000 tons of chemical arms stockpiled 
while the united states has about 30000 tons both figures are 
thought to be largely underestimated

when eddie mcclary was found dead in two 
feet of fermenting mash at a gasohol plant nearly nine years ago 
the case was ruled an accidental drowning and his boss collected 
50000 in life insurance 
now an investigation by the the state newspaper of columbia has 
turned up suggestions that mcclary may have been murdered among 
other things the newspaper reported a statement by williamsburg 
county sheriffs deputy daniel n blunt sr which he has since 
disavowed that he had a suspect in the case 
mcclary 23 was found dead march 3 1980 in a tank at the 
carolina alcohol co plant in kingstree where he was head chemist 
the plant designed to produce ethanol for an alternative to 
gasoline known as gasohol was owned by state rep bj gordon a 
longtime political power in the area 
although relatives and rescue workers were suspicious a 
coroners inquest ruled the case an accident and gordon collected 
50000 from a policy protecting the company against the death of a 
key employee the plant later folded and the farmers home 
administration which backed 420000 in loans for the project 
footed the bill the state reported in its stories on the case 
published jan 1 
blunt concluded at the time that mcclarys death was an accident 
as did state and federal authorities the latter two said the scope 
of their investigations was limited by the rulings from local 
authorities the state reported blunt told the newspaper his own 
investigation was curtailed because he resigned his deputys post to 
run for sheriff an election he lost 
the newspaper said gordon testified the next year as a character 
witness for blunt while the officer was on trial on charges of 
official corruption including taking bribes blunt was convicted 
but pardoned by the state parole board in 1983 and rehired by 
sheriff theodore mcfarlin who said he was his best investigator 
according to the state blunt told reporters he had always been 
suspicious about mcclarys death and still had a suspect although 
he refused to identify him a lot of things about this case bother 
me the newspaper quoted him as saying 
specifically the newspaper said blunt acknowledged that during 
his investigation he didnt ask how mcclary had scaled the 
10foottall fermentation tank without a ladder didnt question 
cuts and bruises on the body and didnt try to find out how a grown 
man could have fallen through a small hatch atop the tank and 
drowned in 24 inches of mash 
after the stories appeared in the state blunt told the news and 
courier of charleston that he had been misquoted 
aint nobody murdered that boy the state reporters asked me if 
there was anything suspicious i said a lawmans always suspicious 
that doesnt mean i suspect murder in this case blunt told the 
charleston paper 
the states managing editor robert hitt said the newspaper 
stood by its story he said that although the interview with blunt 
was not taped the two reporters present took extensive notes 
the state said its stories were based on a sevenmonth 
examination of more than 3000 pages of state and federal records 
some obtained through use of the freedom of information act 
hugh munn a spokesman for the state law enforcement division 
said blunt denied having a suspect when he spoke to agents from his 
department last week 
munn said his agency also questioned several other people but 
there was no new evidence so theres nothing more we can do 
mcfarlin the williamsburg sheriff said last week he did not 
plan to reopen the case mark dillard a spokesman for state 
attorney general travis medlock said his office had examined the 
newspapers report but found nothing to warrant further action 
gov carroll campbell said he supported the decision not to 
officially reopen the case i have to trust the law enforcement 
officials campbell said 
tommy gamble one of the rescue workers who pulled mcclarys body 
from the vat said he was interviewed tuesday by three law 
enforcement division agents gamble said he told the agents that he 
would die and go to hell 40 times before theyd make me believe he 
died in an accident 
lichi boggs mcclarys mother said she remains convinced her son 
was murdered if i had millions of dollars to prove it i would 
fight it to the end she said 
gordon after repeatedly refusing calls and visits by state 
reporters told the associated press he has suffered greatly from 
mcclarys death 
i suffered a lot of pain from that business venture i suffered 
pain from the loss of a friend i feel sorry for people who 
forever try to open wounds and bring about pain 
gordon gained national attention last year when he and state sen 
frank mcgill filed charges of criminal libel against newspaper 
editor jim fitts fitts was arrested and spent a weekend in jail 
after he wrote a column critical of the two men gordon and mcgill 
who has since died later dropped the charges

while most federal agencies are struggling with 
funding cuts or small raises the census bureau would get nearly 
triple its current amount under president reagans 1990 budget 
but dont get too excited its only temporary 
reagan proposed census bureau spending of 147 billion for 
fiscal 1990 up from about 250 million in 1988 and about 559 
million in the current year 
the reason is the decennial census 
the constitution requires the bureau to count all residents of 
the united states every 10 years the next count will be conducted 
april 1 1990 
that requires opening dozens of offices across the country 
mailing out more than 100 million census forms sending an army of 
people to the thousands of homes where folks fail to respond and 
compiling the tidal wave of data to be collected 
overall the 1990 national head count is expected to cost 26 
billion but not all in one year the costs are spread over several 
years because of the lengthy preparation of forms and maps and 
offices and computers

presidentelect george bush could use a 
department of television strategy on his transition team former 
president richard nixon said in a magazine article released monday 
ronald reagan used tv so skillfully that he made it look 
effortless nixon wrote in the jan 14 issue of tv guide it 
would be a mistake for any other president to assume he will do as 
well reagan was born to the breed a performer long before he 
became a politician 
nixon whose own career included such effective television 
performances as the checkers speech and such disasters as the 
1960 kennedynixon debate lamented that the bush transition team 
didnt include a television division 
of all the institutions arrayed with and against a president 
none controls his fate more than television he wrote unless a 
president learns how to harness its power his administration is in 
trouble from the very beginning 
newspapers are important nixon wrote but only if their work 
is picked up and amplified by tv 
a newspaper story that turns a few hundred thousand heads in 
the morning can turn 40plus million that evening if the networks 
use it otherwise it is usually gone with the wind he wrote 
most tv reporters like most politicians are conscientious 
intelligent and hardworking the majority are liberal but because 
of the medias loss of credibility in recent years they are 
sensitive about appearing biased nixon wrote 
this makes them fairweather friends except during the 1981 
recession and the irancontra affair president reagan got generally 
favorable coverage on tv not because the reporters liked him but 
because the people did

the us exportimport bank on monday stopped 
offering direct loans to foreign governments for purchasing us 
goods reflecting president reagans desire to terminate the program 
next fiscal year 
reagan in his proposed budget for fiscal 1990 said he wants to 
convert the direct loans into a guaranteed loan program last year 
the government issued more than 207 million worth of loans to 
finance purchases of us exports 
the bank said it will continue its 11 billion program for 
guaranteeing such loans by private banks 
most of the loans have gone to third world counties whose total 
debt has risen largely in recent years much of through their 
failure to pay interest due on the loans 
spokesman hal sundstrom said exims board of directors acted at a 
meeting friday 
in the real world tough choices have to be made in order to 
reduce our national budget deficit exim bank president john a 
bohn jr said in a statement monday 
reagans budget proposal would keep a 100 million war chest 
for directo loans to compete with subsidized loans granted by other 
industrial governments it proposed 10567 billion for guarantees 
next year down from 11 billion this year 
as of dec 22 the bank had guaranteed 239 million worth of 
private bank loans sundstrom said the guarantees also encourage 
us exports by allowing banks to make loans to the borrowing 
country on easier terms lower interest rates and longer repayment 
periods 
reagan has tried to cut the direct loans before but congress has 
voted the money anyway 
the suspension of new loans will last until the 1990 eximbank 
loan budget situation clarifies the bank said in a statement

a nurses colleagues jokingly called 
her angel of death because elderly patients kept dying during 
her shift now she is going on trial charged with killing 17 
patients in a twoyear period 
michaela roeder admits giving the fatal doses to six of the 
patients and says she did it to spare them pain but prosecutor 
karl hermann majorowsky alleges she did it just as a demonstration 
of her power 
the accused posed as a mistress over life and death we are 
dealing here with coldblooded murder out of base motives a jan 
9 issue of der spiegel magazine quoted majorowsky as saying 
ms roeders murder trial begins tuesday in district court in 
wuppertal about 37 miles north of bonn she faces a possible 
sentence of life in prison if convicted 
the accusations against ms roeder 30 have absorbed the west 
german press who have called the alleged killings nearly the 
perfect murder because they went almost unnoticed by police 
on a tip from a hospital employee authorities had the bodies of 
28 deceased former patients of the intensive care unit at st petrus 
hospital in wuppertal exhumed 
according to court records the examinations showed that 17 of 
the patients had received a fatal dose of drugs that can 
severely affect blood pressure or the heart 
ms roeder is accused of issuing the fatal injections between 
february 1984 and february 1986 while working in the st petrus 
intensive care section 
after ms roeders arrest in march 1986 she admitted to law 
officials that she gave fatal injections to six patients because she 
wanted to spare them suffering from their ailments majorowsky says 
in court papers there are no clues that these patients would have 
died 
most of the 17 patients were elderly and had been brought to the 
intensive care section after operations for ailments ranging from 
appendicitis to cancer according to news reports the oldest victim 
was 94 according to the reports 
the official cause of death for the 17 patients was heart or 
circulatory failure the reports said 
ms roeder began working at the hospital in 1978 and was jokingly 
dubbed the angel of death by her colleagues when elderly 
patients under her care started dying according to der spiegel 
they didnt call michaela roeder the angel of death because 
they suspected foul play the magazine wrote the little joke in 
this name was meant to help console her over her bad luck and these 
unfortunate coincidences 
the magazine said majorowsky is expected to have difficulty 
proving murder against ms roeder 
the weak point of the charge is the motive brought against the 
defendant killing in order to demonstrate power to feel that she 
was a mistress over life or death the magazine asked 
rhetorically 
der spiegel said the trial will likely investigate whether ms 
roeder may have been unable to withstand the stress and demands of 
working in an intensive care unit more than 40 witnesses and 
medical experts are expected to testify 
if there is insufficient evidence for premeditated murder ms 
roeder could be found guilty of manslaughter which carries a 
minimum sentence of five years in prison

the kremlins earthquake relief commission sharply 
criticized two armenian ministries monday for failing to provide 
plans for schooling jobs and shelter to tens of thousands of 
survivors 
the politburo commission said most government agencies have 
finished detailed proposals for restoring normal life in the section 
of northwest armenia devastated by the dec 7 quake tass reported 
the earthquake killed 24888 people and left 500000 homeless 
but the armenian ministry of light industry was censured because 
it did not produce specific proposals for the employment of 40000 
people and for improvement in their living conditions the 
official news agency said 
about 80000 children remain in the disaster area but the 
armenian ministry of public education has taken practically no 
serious steps to organize their upbringing and instruction tass 
said 
the soviet ministry of railways however was praised for 
developing plans to double the freight hauled on armenias two main 
lines to 40 million tons a year the report said transport 
officials earlier came under strong criticism as thousands of 
railcars packed with relief supplies piled up at stations and on 
side tracks for lack of sufficient labor to unload them 
the first priority goals of reconstruction of housing complexes 
industry agricultural facilities and city and town buildings are 
proceeding and should be finalized within two weeks tass said 
authorities have pledged to rebuild within two years 
the first foundation stone for a new apartment house was laid 
saturday in leninakan where more than 200 buildings were destroyed

palm beach county dumped a million 
gallons of chlorinated raw sewage from an affluent suburb into the 
atlantic ocean rather than let it spill onto property and into 
canals 
the two alternatives were not very attractive said health 
department engineering director frank gargiulo one was 
discharging sewage on the ground the other was discharging it into 
the ocean 
health department officials banned swimming surfing and wading 
on 13 miles of beach from singer island to lantana for about 24 
hours 
the problem started with the shutdown of a regional treatment 
plant early sunday to bring a new section on line 
this was a planned event gargiulo said at night they 
dont generate as much sewage 
but lake worth produced more waste than expected by 2 am 
officials were worried about it spilling and seeping onto the ground 
for about three hours waste flowed from a pumping station 
through a pipe that extends about a mile into the atlantic ocean 
officials said 
dumping raw waste there is illegal but gargiulo described the 
step as the lesser of two evils 
don white a state department of environmental regulation 
official was present when the waste was discharged they had 
emergency approval from us he said monday 
up until 25 to 30 years ago all of the domestic waste from the 
lake worth area was discharged through that outflow he said 
but it has not been used for 25 years routinely 
white said he didnt know what effect the chlorinated sewage 
would have on marine life at the discharge point 
gargiulo said the action is not expected to cause health problems 
the ocean is usually a hostile environment for bacteria he 
said there is a high salt content and strong currents were very 
confident that tidal activity during the 24hour ban will cleanse 
the area 
some beachgoers seemed equally unconcerned 
despite red no swimming flags julio armas 26 of west palm 
beach took a blue raft into the ocean 
he said the water probably has been polluted on other days we 
just happened to know about it this time he said

the reagan administrations plans for a 
small increase in military spending may hurt efforts to get european 
allies to pay a greater share of the common defense analysts say 
this will create some tensions said hans binnendijk 
director of studies for the londonbased international institute for 
strategic studies 
defense secretary frank carlucci asked congress to boost defense 
spending by an inflationadjusted 2 percent for the next two years 
in the draft military budget he proposed 3152 billion in budget 
authority for 1990 and 33089 billion for 1991 
the spending plans however will likely be modified after george 
bush assumes the presidency 
there has been growing criticism in the us congress in recent 
years that americas allies in the north atlantic treaty 
organization are not shouldering enough of the burden of financing a 
common defense nato defense ministers in december released a report 
on the burdensharing issue and faulted some in the 16nation 
western alliance for not doing enough 
in the late 1970s the united states began pressing for an 
inflationadjusted 3 percent annual increase in each countrys 
defense spending a sum that has become a rough guideline for 
measuring military expenditures 
martin mccusker director of the military committee of the north 
atlantic assembly said the draft budget plan will certainly blunt 
the argument that some will make now that some europeans are not 
even keeping up with the minimum 3 percent 
it will show the united states is not reaching that level 
either he said the assembly is made up of legislators who 
represent the nato countries 
a spokesman for the us mission to nato said budgetary 
constraints have required the proposal for only a 2 percent 
increase 
given the longstanding burdensharing issue the united states 
would nonetheless hope that those countries which have not met past 
goals would not use this as an excuse for lowering their budget 
projections said the spokesman who demanded anonymity 
the nato report on burdensharing said that on average in the 
past decade canada italy luxembourg norway spain turkey 
britain and the united states generally met the 3 percent goal 
belgium denmark germany and greece posted the smallest average 
growth levels it said 
although some countries have improved performance in the last 
five years canada greece italy netherlands norway turkey and 
the united states performance in general has been somewhat less 
successful and this downward trend generally seems set to 
continue it said 
binnendijk said that although carlucci wants a 2 percent pickup 
in military spending the reality is they are not going to get any 
real increase 
because of the budget constraints on capitol hill the best 
the pentagon can hope for is a straight line in real terms growth 
of 2 percent is highly unlikely he said 
indeed congress has trimmed the pentagons wish list in recent 
years 
it approved a 13 percent inflationadjusted decrease in budget 
authority in the current 1989 fiscal year which ends sept 30 the 
administration had presented a budget proposal of 2995 billion 
under a compromise money plan worked out with congress that 
proposed spending level was not large enough to offset inflation 
congressionally approved budget authority was off 2 percent in 
1988 37 percent in 1987 and 44 percent in 1986 it soared 76 
percent in 1985 which had marked the sixth straight year of 
increases 
natos european members have responded to the us push for more 
military money with figures showing their total defense spending 
skyrocketed 34 percent after adjustment for inflation between 1970 
and 1987 us spending in contrast was up 15 percent over the 
same period 
per capital defense spending according to these figures grew 21 
percent in the european countries over the 197086 period compared 
with a 3 percent decline in the united states military manpower 
advanced 5 percent in europe over 197087 compared with a 31 
percent decline in the united states according to the european 
figures

president reagan said monday that his proposed 
115 trillion spending blueprint for fiscal 1990 puts america on 
track to a balanced budget and eventually a modest surplus 
appearing before a group of business leaders reagan defended his 
budget proposal which calls for deficit spending of 925 billion 
as an excellent document that fulfills the original objectives 
of meeting basic needs without tax rate hikes 
we even do this without touching social security weakening our 
national defense or reducing benefits to the needy and we do 
this without raising taxes said reagan 
the president who underwent weekend surgery on his left ring 
finger appeared with his hand heavily bandaged 
reagan said that thanks to our record economic expansion the 
revenue is literally rolling in 
raising taxes would be the surest way of killing the economic 
goose that lays the golden egg the president told some 150 men 
and women gathered in an auditorium of the old executive office 
building next to the white house 
reagan and white house chief of staff kenneth m duberstein told 
the group they would not be surprised to see opposition in congress 
to some of the administrations proposals for eliminating various 
federal programs 
there are some people on capitol hill who are already saying 
dead on arrival duberstein said but those people simply 
dont like hearing the message that this last budget of ronald 
reagan proclaims 
of his critics reagan said basically what they really want 
is to repudiate the last eight years and repeal the last election 
in which vice president george bush defeated massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis 
reagan again denounced what he said was an iron triangle of 
congressional democrats special interest groups and the news media 
which he predicted would be ready with a fiscal sob story aimed 
at undermining support for reagans budget 
he said that critics will say that revenue is scare here in 
washington and there isnt enough money to go around and told 
his listeners that would be a flim flam story 
reagan said that his final budget proposal places america on 
track to a balanced budget and even a modest surplus by 1993

when the rouse co designed the community of 
columbia 21 years ago no one thought about endings just beginnings 
now with a population that has grown to 70500 the community 
built on farm land halfway between baltimore and washington are 
about to be offered a place to be buried 
later this month grave sites will go on sale for columbias 
first cemetery a development that marks the communitys coming of 
age according to jerry brock vice president of senior development 
at rouse 
it represents the fact that its an established community its 
no longer a new town or an experiment brock said 
the rouse co began thinking about a cemetery for columbia in the 
late 1970s but only in the past few years has columbias population 
reached a point to make a cemetery financially possible brock said 
last year rouse officials sold 28 acres to harvey geller 58 a 
semiretired bethesda resident with more than 30 years managing 
cemeteries in massachusetts virginia and pennsylvania 
this is the first time ive ever started one brand new 
geller said its a labor of love 
a stone wall at the entrance has been built five acres of wooded 
land have been cleared and shrubs have been planted at the 28acre 
cemetery 
the cemetery should hold about 25000 graves enough to supply 
columbias needs for about 50 years geller said

about 1600 passengers climbed aboard the 
greenandwhite cars of the trirail commuter line monday eager to 
take part in the first day of regular service on south floridas new 
commuter train 
its beyond our expectations broward county commissioner ed 
kennedy said of initial response to the train line which runs 
between west palm beach and miami our objective is to hold those 
who rode it and build on that 
kennedy chairman of the tricounty commuter rail organization 
said passenger totals should grow as communities improve bus 
connections and traffic worsens on interstate 95 
the 67mile train line was born as an answer to traffic problems 
expected during almost five years of planned construction to widen 
i95 between boca raton and miami 
but officials hope it will become popular enough to survive 
beyond that 
the federal government provided 90 percent of the 118 million 
needed for the trains with the state and local governments picking 
up the rest federal transportation officials are carefully watching 
the project the largest of several in the nation using existing 
amtrak or freight tracks to create commuter lines 
the track record on mass transit in south florida is not good 
metrorail a 1 billion elevated railway system in dade county has 
failed to attract many riders 
commuter bill morgan said he was riding because the drivers in 
south florida are the worst ive ever known 
adam white a commuter who boarded in palm beach county said 
riding the train is less stressful you can think more plan 
the week more 
kennedy said he hopes to see the daily passenger total grow to 
14000 in three years 
he said he knew of only two problems monday morning a 
malfunctioning switch that delayed a train 20 minutes and a 20 mph 
speed limit on a stretch of track in dade county that needs to be 
lifted 
longer range problems include an 800000 station near the fort 
lauderdale airport that may be torn down because it is directly 
underneath the flight path of planes and a shortage of bus service 
to many of the stations 
no fares will be charged for riding the train until may 1 when a 
oneway trip of any length will cost 2

president reagan offered congress a pentagon 
budget plan monday that would move several bigticket weapons into 
production escalate star wars research and largely sustain us 
military force at its current size 
reagan requested 3152 billion in budget authority a 2 percent 
increase after inflation for national defense in fiscal 1990 
beginning next oct 1 over the past four years congress has 
trimmed defense spending increases to levels below the rate of 
inflation 
the defense budget envision that only 303 billion of the 3152 
billion will be paid out during the fiscal year the balance 
represents money that would be authorized for various programs but 
not spent until later 
of the totals 3056 billion in budget authority and 2938 
billion in outlays is earmarked for the defense department the 
remainder 96 billion in budget authority and 92 billion in 
outlays is contained in the energy departments budget to cover 
nuclear warhead production and research work 
reagans spending plan also includes recommendations for fiscal 
1991 he requested 3308 billion in budget authority then of which 
3144 billion would actually be spent during the period 
presidentelection bush is expected to amend reagans proposal 
after he assumes office bush has talked of cutting the request so 
that it just matches inflation instead of providing real growth 
many of reagans priorities however are likely to be embraced 
by bush reagans budget for example increasing funds for military 
recruiting and by proposes 36 percent pay raise for those in 
uniform compared with only a 2 percent proposed pay raise for 
civilian workers 
the budget plan also requests 500 million to begin shutting down 
unneeded military bases it would reduce the defense departments 
civilian workforce of 11 million by 5000 people and shift more 
than two dozen existing weapon programs toward multiyear contracts 
several of reagans defense proposals also are sure to stir 
controversy 
for instance reagan wants to scrap development of the 
truckmobile singlewarhead midgetman nuclear missile a weapon 
favored by some democratic leaders in congress 
his budget also would earmark 946 million to start development 
of a new antisatellite weapon that could be deployed at sea 
congress forced cancellation of such a weapon that would have 
operated from landbased jets 
and reagan would significantly boost spending on star wars 
research from 405 billion this year to 59 billion in fiscal 
1990 and 7 billion in 1991 
bush has said he supports star wars research but it remains 
unclear how fast hes willing to pursue it 
even with the spending increase outgoing defense secretary frank 
c carlucci said the administration had made some hard choices in 
setting priorities either canceling or delaying two dozen programs 
most of the affected programs were rather small but one a 
proposal to upgrade the navys a6 intruder attack jet would save 
503 million in fiscal 1990 
the moderate 2 percent real growth rate proposed in this budget 
is an attempt to steer a sustainable and fiscally responsible course 
that allows the united states to maintain its current force 
structure and to acquire the weapon systems necessary to ensure our 
national security carlucci said 
among the major defense proposals reagan urged congress to

ago into production along with the navys new trident ii 
submarinelaunched nuclear missile and a railmobile version of the 
giant mx intercontinental ballistic missile also on the nuclear or 
strategic forces side the fiscal 1990 budget calls for continued 
developed of the advanced cruise missile and construction of another 
trident submarine the marine corps would begin production of the 
v22 tiltrotor aircraft 
increase activeduty personnel strength slightly by 5000 in 
fiscal 1990 up to 2138000 then adjust it back down by 4000 in 
fiscal 1991 the small swing is needed to help the navy bring some 
new ships on line the pentagon said the reserve forces and 
national guard would increase in strength by 7600 to 1178000 
allow the navy to increase in size from 568 battle force ships 
to 574 by the end of fiscal 1990 that number would decline slightly 
to 571 by the end of 1991 with the retirement of old submarines 
however the fiscal 1990 budget also would allow the navy to begin 
construction of 19 new ships in addition to the new trident missile 
sub 
cut from 36 to 35 the number of tactical air wings in the air 
force but maintain the existing size and structure of the army and 
marine corps readiness training programs would be maintained at 
their current level army navy and air force flying hours per 
month and navy steaming days would not be changed the armys tank 
training budget which allows 850 tank miles per year would be 
reduced slightly to 800 miles per year 
maintain for the most part existing production rates for 
aircraft the army would build both uh60 blackhawk transport 
helicopters and ah64 attack choppers at the current rate of 72 a 
year the marine corps would continue to buy 24 av8b harrier jets a 
year and the air force would continue to purchase 36 f15 jet 
fighters a year the air forces purchases of f16 fighters would 
decline from 180 this year to 150 in 1990 while the navy would 
reduce its purchases of fa18 fighters from 84 a year to 72 a year 
the navy would increase from 12 to 18 the number of either new or 
modernized f14 fighters it buys annually

compass needles dont always point north a 
problem that may be eased by a new series of charts prepared by the 
federal government 
compasses are oriented by the earths magnetic field and since 
that is shifting over time the direction the needle points changes 
also 
this may mean little to most people but it can be a serious 
problem for engineers navigators mapmakers hikers scientists and 
others who need to know where they are going 
a person following the compass needle in the florida panhandle 
for example would be walking due north 
but someone following his compass in maine would be going 21 
degrees to the west while an alaskan would be heading 35 degrees 
east of north 
the us geological survey has compiled a series of 10 new 
magnetic charts five for the united states and five for the globe 
showing variances in different areas 
because of the time needed to compile these complex maps the 
charts are current for 1985 and contain correction estimates for the 
next few years so users can keep current with the changing magnetic 
field 
the united states charts cost 620 each and those for the globe 
are 310 apiece ordering information can be obtained from the us

monday that president roh taewoo must remove and put on trial 
senior officials who played key roles in the authoritarian 
government of former president chun doohwan 
kim leader of the reunification democratic party said south 
korea faces renewed political instability if the government fails to 
expose and bring to justice all those involved in corruption and 
human rights abuses under chun 
we need stability stability can only be realized through 
liquidation of past misdeeds kim said in an interview with the 
associated press 
he said roh must keep a promise to hold a referendum to give 
voters the opportunity to evaluate his performance roh made the 
promise just before the december 1987 presidential elections 
this is the promise he made to the people kim said 
kim said the nation would not wait indefinitely for a referendum 
but he declined to set any time limits for holding the measure he 
also declined to comment on whether he thought roh could win a 
referendum 
the governments democratic justice party has said a decision 
will be made in the next few months on holding a referendum 
government officials say they are confident roh would win a majority 
kim cast doubt on rohs willingness to take necessary action to 
expose and punish corruption and human rights abuses under chuns 
rule he said top chun aides remained in the government and ruling 
party and must be expelled and put on trial 
he also insisted that former president chun be made to testify 
before the national assembly inquiry into misdeeds under his 
government but kim said he opposes jailing chun because he was once 
president 
roh had to remove the legacy of the chun era and proceed against 
those guilty of abuses or his government would be rejected by south 
koreans kim said the people would never accept or tolerate 
anything else he said 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 went into rural exile in november after apologizing to the 
nation for abuses under his rule 
chun accepted moral responsibility for his governments abuses 
but denied he was involved a number of chuns relatives and aides 
have been convicted or charged with embezzlement and other crimes 
resolving the chun legacy is the main political challenge facing 
south korea and it had to be resolved soon kim said failure to 
resolve the crisis would threaten political stability he said 
the national assembly resumes its investigation tuesday into 
abuses under chuns rule the government is attempting to block 
assembly demands that chun be made to testify before lawmakers 
roh a former ally of chun wants to limit the furor over chun 
without damaging his government which is identified with his 
predecessor in the eyes of many koreans 
roh a former general defeated kim youngsam and rival 
opposition leader kim daejung in presidential elections in 
december 1987 after the two kims split the opposition vote

syria and morocco agreed monday to resume 
diplomatic relations after a 30month break the two countries 
announced 
an announcement on official damascus radio said syria and morocco 
had decided to act because of brotherly mediation by saudi 
arabia to achieve arab solidarity 
saudi arabian crown prince abdullah bin abdelaziz left damascus 
on saturday after two days of talks with syrian president hafez 
assad and flew to rabat moroccos capital for talks with moroccan 
leaders 
this decision follows a fraternal initiative undertaken by 
saudi arabia and is aimed at eliminating obstacles blocking 
concentrated arab action to face up to the dangers that menace the 
arab nation said a communique issued in rabat 
assad severed relations with rabat july 27 1986 to protest a 
meeting between king hassan and the then israel prime minister 
shimon peres 
mondays move raised speculation the syrians may be moving closer 
to ending feuds with its main arab rivals egypt and iraq 
damascus radio made no mention of those countries but abdullah 
said before he left damascus that his talks with assad had been 
aimed at bolstering arab solidarity 
he said he discussed syrias rifts with morocco egypt and iraq 
syria like most arab states severed links with cairo over the 
late president anwar sadats 1979 peace treaty with israel an arab 
summit last year gave the green light for arabs to restore ties with 
cairo 
most have done so but hardline states such as syria have refused 
and blocked moves to readmit egypt into the 22member arab league 
syria and iraq ruled by rival wings of the baath socialist 
party have been feuding for nearly a decade 
these rifts have been a major obstacle in the arab quest for long 
elusive unity to confront israel saudi arabia and jordan have been 
trying for years to reconcile syria with its rivals

authorities banned a dissident 
rally monday and the communisty partys chief ideologist warned 
that rightwing adventurism threatens the partys rule as it did in 
1968 
the speech by ideologist jan fojtik to party ideologues in 
western pilsen town suggested division among communists about how to 
proceed amid growing calls for economic and political reforms to 
match changes in the soviet union 
fojtik is among orthodox leaders who have refused to countenance 
political reforms or dialogue with increasingly active independent 
groups 
prague authorities banned a rally called for sunday by charter 77 
and four other independent groups to commemorate jan palach a czech 
student who burned himself to death in january 1969 to protest the 
warsaw pact invasion to crush polands communistled reforms 
human rights activist anna sabatova said the rally will go ahead 
in wenceslas square despite the ban which she said was made known 
friday 
fojtiks speech attacked independent groups repeating charges 
they are manipulated by anticommunist centers abroad but also 
expressed doubt about changes elsewhere in the soviet bloc 
there are voices of dissonance unusual and unexpected opinions 
reflecting not only confusion and uncertainty but sometimes also 
extreme positions including casting doubts over the entire history 
of socialism and its claims on the future he said 
even today we dont have the right to ignore the danger 
socialism is in he added warning communists not to underestimate 
forces willing to repeat the rightwing adventure of the late 
1960s 
in 1968 the soviets and their supporters charged communist rule 
was threatened by westernbacked counterrevolution and used this 
as justification to invade poland 
palach protested the invasion and continuing presence of soviet 
troops on jan 16 1969 by setting himself alight in wenceslas 
square 
he died three days later thousands of czechoslovaks shocked and 
moved by his protest attended his funeral 
meanwhile ms sabatova reported a 37yearold communist party 
member died dec 3 after he was beaten by police who accused him of 
a minor traffic offense 
in a telephone call to the associated press bureau in vienna ms 
sabatova said an autopsy showed josef babka died the following day 
from internal bleeding that caused a circulatory collapse he lived 
in mihalovce a town in east slovakia close to the soviet border 
meanwhile an emigre source in vienna said the recently formed 
czechoslovak helsinki committee has appealed to authorities to allow 
a 48yearold charter 77 signatory to emigrate to west germany for 
heart surgery 
so far authorities have refused permission to walter kaniahe 
was granted an early release from prison last may after he suffered 
two heart attacks while serving a 10year jail term 
the new committee which includes prominent activists such as 
banned playwright vaclav havel appealed to the czechoslovak justice 
ministry on jan 5 said the source

the reagan administration sought funds monday 
for 10 new flood control and navigation projects including several 
congress refused to launch last year 
it requested 885 million in its fiscal 1990 budget for the army 
corps of engineers projects six were in last years reagan budget 
but congress refused to start any the four new projects are in 
ohio texas pennsylvania and west virginia 
the number of new projects has slumped in recent years under the 
pressure of tight budgets and a 1986 law requiring local communities 
to put up a share of the initial cost 
the budget calls for a new system of paying for maintenance on 
the bureau of reclamation projects largely bypassing the 
congressional appropriations process 
for the third year in a row the bureau which operates in the 17 
westernmost states of the lower 48 proposed no new construction 
sixty percent of the bureaus construction spending would be devoted 
to three projects the central arizona project the central utah 
project and the central valley project in california 
the budget calls for no substantial construction money for the 
controversial garrison diversion unit in north dakota until 1994 
though 875 million would be earmarked to complete certain 
facilities and secure those already built 
similarly the animasla plata project in colorado and new mexico 
was allocated only 37 million to bring to a reasonable 
conclusion preconstruction activity and equipment purchases 
the bureau would spend a total of 946 million down 14 percent 
from 1103 billion this year its construction budget would be 655 
million down 72 percent from 706 million this year 
the corps spending would total 32 billion down 17 percent 
from 326 billion its construction spending would total 122 
billion up 89 percent from 112 billion 
while the 10 new projects would require 855 million in startup 
funds there was no estimate of how much the projects would 
ultimately cost 
congress must appropriate funds for maintaining the bureaus 
projects including the gigantic dams it runs in the west whose 
power is sold by the power marketing administrations of the energy 
department 
some revenues from the bureaus dams and irrigation canals are 
tagged as owed the treasury for operation and maintenance but 
congress must appropriate the money anyway the bureau wants to use 
those earmarked funds on its own 
as a result of the increased managerial flexibility afforded by 
the revolving fund the bureau will be better able to coordinate its 
plans for the operation and maintenance of existing dams power 
plants and irrigation facilities the budget document said the 
bonneville power administration and the western area power 
administration will be full partners in approving budgets 
projects and priorities 
the budget called for spending 222 million on maintenance up 
from 177 million this year but 107 million will come from the 
revolving fund 
theres quite a maintenance backlog we have to catch up on 
interior undersecretary earl geljde told reporters 
here are the 10 new corps of engineer projects if two figures 
are shown the second figure represents the amount for construction 
the administration requested last year an f denotes the project 
is for flood control an n means a navigation project 
the dollar figures are in budget authority which usually 
approximates actual outlays during the year outlay figures were not 
immediately available

the recent discovery of a black widow binary a 
star that destroys its orbiting companion like the spider that eats 
its mate may provide a missing link in the evolution of the 
heavens astronomers said monday 
the object is a rapidly spinning binary pulsar a dead collapsed 
star that is orbited by a larger ordinary star 
astronomers have discovered that the pulsar is blasting away its 
companion in the last phase of an intricate give and take between 
the two distant orbs 
the companion is being destroyed said frederic a rasio of 
cornell university it is constantly losing matter eventually it 
could completely disappear 
astronomers say it appears that the pulsar uses its companion to 
build up tremendous spinning speed then turns on its mate burning 
it up 
the pulsar is one of a small group of such objects that spin 
extremely rapidly the newly discovered pair is important because it 
seems to help explain how they get to spin so fast 
it offers a missing link between two classes of objects said 
steve maran of the goddard space flight center thats why 
astronomers are so excited 
the pulsar and its mate were discovered last spring by andrew 
fruchter of the carnegie institution in washington its implications 
were described monday at a meeting here of the american astronomical 
society 
a pulsar is an extremely dense collapsed star made up of 
neutrons it is the remains of a large star that was destroyed in a 
spectacular explosion called a supernova 
pulsars give off no light but they broadcast twin rotating beams 
of radar like lighthouses in the sky 
a pulsar is minute compared to the sun but its mass is 50 
percent greater one teaspoon of pulsar matter weighs billions of 
tons 
most pulsars spin about once a second and are slowing down 
however the newly discovered one known as psr 195720 is one of 
six discovered so far in the milky way that spin much faster in 
this case about 600 times a second 
astronomers theorize that these pulsars speed up by stealing a 
stream of matter from a companion star the companion spins up the 
pulsar like a top said fruchter 
however while some of these fastspinning pulsars have 
companions others do not 
people wondered if you spin up the pulsar with a companion 
where is the companion said fruchter this may explain that 
the pulsar has evaporated the companion 
in the newly spotted couple the companion is very near the 
pulsar just the distance of two and a half times the diameter of 
the sun yet it is being bombarded with a blaze of atomic particles 
5000 times more intense than the sun 
this is the only one mateeating one that we have seen in the 
galaxy but there is the exciting possibility that there will be 
many more said e sterl phinney of california institute of 
technology 
astronomers were able to study the pair because the companion 
regularly eclipses the pulsar the companion revolves around the 
pulsar once every nine hours and each time it blocks out the 
pulsars radar beam for about 50 minutes

the wife of lech walesa has followed him 
onto the pages of the polish press for the first time since the 1981 
martiallaw crackdown saying she is neither afraid nor hopeful 
about the future 
danuta walesa a mother of eight who generally maintains her 
privacy despite the worldwide attention focused on her husband gave 
an interview to the years first edition of the warsaw church weekly 
catholic review 
the story under the headline a normal life follows several 
interviews of walesa that started appearing in official newspapers 
after labor strikes ended in september 
they represent the first official airing of the solidarity 
leaders views in seven years but proposed government talks with 
the opposition have stalled and polands economy continues to 
deteriorate 
realistically speaking because dreaming is no good i dont 
see a way out of this situation said mrs walesa 39 i am 
looking at what is going on now what is being said and done this 
is nothing it is terrible 
mrs walesa said she sees the government involved in a 
psychological struggle to mentally destroy people 
but she said people dont let themselves be tread on not in 
these times 
mrs walesa went to oslo in 1983 to receive the nobel peace prize 
for her husband who feared he would not be allowed to return to 
poland if he left 
she called the trip a beautiful challenge and described other 
nice experiences even lofty as the wife of the leader of the 
polish opposition 
but she recalled with bitterness the imposition of martial law in 
december 1981 when walesa began 11 months of internment and his 
union was outlawed 
my martial law started in march 1982 said mrs walesa 
when her daughter maria was to have been baptized she said she 
sought permission for her husband to attend but an official told her 
the day before that her petition had been rejected 
i got so mad then i started screaming at him at soviet 
leader leonid brezhnev at everybody who came into my mind she 
said 
mrs walesa whose children range in age from 3 to 18 said it is 
difficult to raise youngsters now when the family and the school 
represent two different worlds at home one thing is said at 
school another she said 
she said her roman catholic faith gives her strength and she does 
not fear a repeat of martial law which was lifted in 1983 
maybe what i am saying will sound funny or even strange but i 
am not afraid of anything she said 
accompanying the article was a photograph of the 10member walesa 
family the first to appear in the governmentsanctioned press 
walesa said from the familys gdansk home that he was pleased 
with the article but agreed jokingly that he was fearful of 
competition from his wife 
he said she gave the interview because she expected people 
would like to read it and whatever she has to say people would like 
to hear

you get snagged figuring out your income taxes 
so you call the governments handy 800number 
that would cost you 50 cents or a dollar under the budget 
proposals ronald reagan submitted to congress monday for the last 
time in his presidency 
on page 415 it pops up a user fee on taypayer telephone 
information services is proposed for 1991 with design work and 
trial runs to be done in the interlude 
in scores of small ways people would get less from the 
government or pay more for what they get under the proposals the 
president submitted 
fend for yourself is the general theme of reagans final budget 
one sure to be modified by george bush when he takes office jan 20 
and to be looked upon skeptically by the democraticcontrolled 
congress 
congress in fact already has seen and rejected many of 
reagans economizing proposals he offered them up again monday 
anyway 
costs would go up or benefits down for boat owners veterans with 
slightly disabling war injuries commuters air travelers federal 
retirees doctors people who lose their jobs to foreign competition 
and middleclass kids who eat subsidized lunches at school 
reagan noted that even students at high tuition private schools 
can get meal subsidies and proposed to eliminate all 40cent 
lunches for kids from families well above the poverty line the 
costs would go up by about 26 cents unless the states or local 
school districts made up the difference 
for the homeless the news could be better reagan proposed a 
program under which the government would buy enough food to provide 
food kitchens and food banks with 256 million meals 
and for federal prisoners reagan called for an aggressive 
prison building program to cut overcrowding now put at 60 percent 
but military veterans with serviceconnected injuries that give 
them disability ratings of 20 percent or less would have to look to 
private health insurance for their care in veterans hospitals the 
government now pays 
the 34 million americans who ride amtrak would have to turn 
elsewhere for transportation 
reagan proposed not for the first time to blow the whistle on 
the railroad and find a customer for its northeast corridor service 
it would be cheaper to hand an air or bus ticket to every amtrak 
passenger he said than to pay a subsidy averaging 30 per 
passenger 
reagan called too for eliminating subsidies that help run 
subways and bus services and terminating a program that keeps air 
service for many small communities 
doctors would have to accept smaller fees for treating the 
elderly under medicare and the poor under medicaid radiologists 
anesthesiologists and surgeons especially would get less 
the nations six million boat owners weekend sailors and 
commercial fishermen alike would have to buy a 25 coast guard 
decal to help defray the costs of rescues in emergencies 
homebuyers would see a nearly fourfold increase in the 1 percent 
fee for va loan guarantees it would rise to 38 percent under 
reagans proposals 
he proposed eliminating the 1990 costofliving increase in 
pensions received by federal retirees and reworking the formula 
under which cola increases are granted so that the retired workers 
would have to absorb the first 1 percent increase in the annual cost 
of living 
workers who lose their jobs to foreign competition now get weekly 
benefits while they look for other work reagan proposed eliminating 
a program which he said works to benefit one group of 
underemployed workers or uncompetitive firms

the united states contends that a plant in the city of rabta 
about 60 miles southwest of the libyan capital of tripoli is a 
factory for producing poison gas libyan officials say it is a 
pharmaceutical plant 
gadhafi has offered the united states a onetime inspection of 
the rabta facility but us officials said such a visit would be 
inadequate because the plant could quickly be modified to hide 
evidence of chemical weapons production 
fitzwater said that us interests in dealing with libya are 
represented by thirdparty intermediary governments including 
belgium and the united arab emirates 
we certainly know their position and they know ours the 
spokesman said so there shouldnt be any need for direct 
discussions what there is a need for is for them to destroy that 
plant 
libyas foreign minister said sunday that his country does not 
intend to produce chemical weapons for the time being but is 
seriously worried about possible us military action against libya 
i dont think our knowhow will enable us even if we decided 
to do so to produce chemical weapons in the very near future

libya said monday the united states has launched a 
vile campaign against it with allegations over a chemical 
weapons plant and accused washington of helping israel stockpile 
nuclear chemical and biological arms 
foreign minister jadalah azouz ettalhi speaking at an 
international conference on chemical weapons dismissed us charges 
that libya has a chemical weapons plant as clearly false 
the libyan minister mentioned the united states only once by name 
to condemn the downing of two libyan jet fighters last week and 
referred to israel as the racist zionist entity 
he urged the international community to condemn the incident jan 
4 over the mediterranean as a military aggression the united states 
has said its action was in selfdefense 
charges that israel has nuclear weapons are at the heart of a 
campaign by arab states to link bans on nuclear and chemical arms 
the issue has stymied progress on a final communique to be issued 
wednesday at the close of the fiveday conference 
ettalhi said the us position on chemical weapons was 
discriminatory 
the united states and the soviet union admit to having large 
stockpiles of chemical weapons the only two countries to make such 
an admission of about 20 nations presumed to possess the weapons 
there is a widespread fear that nations without a nuclear 
capability will stock chemical arms 
how can any member of the international community proclaim a 
right it denies others ettalhi said while at the same time 
launching a vile campaign of calumny on the basis of a 
discriminatory racist position 
agreed international rules must be applied to all parties 
without discrimination the libyan minister said 
earlier monday soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told 
reporters that evidence presented to him by secretary of state 
george shultz on the alleged chemical weapons plant at rabta south 
of the libyan capital of tripoli did not prove anything 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens also attending the 
conference charged monday that iraq syria and libya three bitter 
foes of israel have chemical arms and represent a direct 
threat 
us arms control official lynn hansen asked about libyas 
charge that israel has nuclear weapons and that the united states 
helped it obtain them said im not going to get down and grovel 
with the libyans about this or that 
israel has never responded directly to allegations it has nuclear 
weapons saying only it will not be the first country to introduce 
such weapons into the middle east 
britain joined the united states on monday in rejecting a link 
between nuclear and chemical weapons bans 
ettalhis speech was widely regarded as subdued in a conference 
that has seen outbursts and public disputes since it began saturday 
most delegates walked out of the conference hall before a speech 
earlier monday by south african foreign minister rf botha 
hansen head of the bureau of multilateral affairs at the us 
arms control agency called the conference positive but admitted 
difficulty in reaching a consensus on the final statement 
the conference is aimed at reaffirming the only existing 
international document on chemical weapons the 1925 geneva 
protocol banning their use and pressing for a global 
comprehensive ban 
iraqs known use of chemical weapons in its eightyear war with 
iran has served as a macabre backdrop for delegates a top us 
expert speaking on condition of anonymity said evidence shows that 
iraq was the chief producer of chemical arms among arab nations 
followed by syria he said he had no information on israel 
a conference source said the final statement would necessarily 
have to accommodate the demands of the arab nations 
the statement will have to take into account the preoccupations 
of certain arab countries said the source speaking on condition 
of anonymity but it is a bit too early to say what form that will 
take 
a working version of the final statement obtained by the 
associated press made no direct reference to linking nuclear and 
chemical arms but it referred to the need to obtain general and 
complete disarmament 
it called on each state here to exercise restraint and act 
responsibly on the issue of chemical arms until a convention 
banning use production and stocking of chemical weapons is reached 
the final document will be of a political nature with no 
enforcement power but it is meant to pressure negotiators in geneva 
to overcome obstacles in talks that have languished for nearly a 
decade 
the geneva convention would ban use production and stockpiling 
of chemical arms by all nations but negotiators have failed to 
reach agreement on such major issues as verification

presidentelect bush bestowed cautious praise 
on president reagans parting budget monday saying he agrees with 
its intent while making clear he will develop his own proposals 
i will continue to review it for possible amendments after i 
assume the office of the presidency bush said in a succinct 
written statement on the 115 trillion spending plan reagan sent to 
congress for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
bush also said he will have nothing further to say on his own 
budget plans until after he takes office on jan 20 
craig fuller a senior bush aide read the vice presidents 
budget statement at a briefing but declined to elaborate upon it 
he said the vice president has not made any final determination 
about what shape his budget document or framework or 
presentation will take fuller said reagans budget showed that 
what bush had talked about during his campaign meeting 
deficitreduction targets without raising taxes or disturbing social 
security is doable 
treasury secretary nicholas brady whom bush has asked to stay 
on told reporters that work is actively under way on bushs 
budget modifications 
it is certainly possible that much of the current budget will 
remain on the table although it is too early at this stage to offer 
more specific details brady said 
brady also said that reagans budget by proposing the legally 
required deficit reduction without seeking higher taxes meets a 
goal fully shared by presidentelect bush 
the vice president in his statement said that reagans farewell 
budget is an excellent budget which demonstrates clearly that the 
targets set under the grammrudmanhollings law can be met and 
indeed exceeded without raising taxes 
naturally i support its intent he added 
the deficit law calls for a fiscal 1990 deficit of no more than 
100 billion the new reagan budget projects a deficit assuming 
adoption of all its elements of 928 billion for 1990 down from 
an estimated 1615 billion deficit in the current fiscal year 
during his campaign bush advocated what he called a flexible 
freeze on federal spending the concept calls for holding the 
increase in overall spending at the annual rate of inflation 
currently running at about 44 percent 
any proposed additional increases would have to be offset by 
corresponding decreases in other programs except that social 
security benefits would not be touched 
bush will have to find room in the reagan budget outline for the 
increases in spending needed for the kinder gentler nation 
programs he proposed in his campaign including expected increases 
for education child care expansion of the governments head start 
program and enviromental cleanup 
and even though reagans budget appears to smooth the way for 
some of these modifications in some cases the document appears at 
odds with bushs campaign statements 
for instance bush has proposed an increase of medicaid to help 
cover medical expenses for poor pregnant women and their babies 
reagan in the new budget has proposed over 1 billion in medicaid 
reductions 
reagans budget again calls for austerity in social programs and 
would eliminate 82 programs at the same time the plan would 
protect his defense buildup by advocating a 2 percent increase in 
defense spending authority above inflation 
congressional budget writers have said they expect defense 
spending may be one of the areas bush looks at most closely as he 
seeks to find offsetting reductions to make his flexibile freeze 
work 
both he and incoming defense secretary john tower have talked 
publicly about the need for more defense economies particularly in 
the area of troop strength 
bush aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the 
vice president did not want to upstage the president on monday by 
reacting at length to the budget document 
naturally he agrees with its intent and naturally hell 
have his own recommendations or put forth potential amendments 
once he takes office said one senior transition official 
but he wont be presenting any of those recommendations until 
hes prepared to present all of them to the congress whatever time 
that might be the official added

tens of thousands of workers in eastern 
hungary staged a 10minute warning strike monday against big price 
increases and trade unions charged the government is picking the 
pockets of the people 
the state news agency mti reported workers in szabolcsszatmar 
county started work with a 10minute delay and said local trade 
union leaders supported their action 
mti estimated the increases that took effect monday will cost 
consumers 15 a month and predicted food consumption will drop 10 
percent to 15 percent in the first half of the year 
behind these stark sets of figures there are human lives 
nepszava the official trade union daily said in a monday editorial 
trade union leaders already have warned the increases could spark 
strikes 
according to the nepszava 10 percent of families in hungary live 
on a smaller monthly income than the official subsistence level of 
72 
inflation amounted to 17 percent in 1988 when real wages dropped 
by 8 percent according to official statistics 
the characteristic feature of the governments financial policy 
will be picking the pockets of the companies and the population 
nepszava charged 
hungarian officials monday told journalists the price rises were 
needed to reduce state subsidies and balance the budget they are 
part of a series of economic reforms and austerity measures the 
government is introducing to help reduce hungarys 17 billion 
foreign debt and stimulate the stagnating economy 
trade union leaders support the idea of allowing the market to 
regulate prices but admonished the government to apply these rules 
also to wages 
on what ground does the government believe that labor can be 
bought for less than it costs the paper asked no order no 
stabilization can possibly emerge until honest work is paid by 
honest wages 
other increases planned this year include raising public 
transportation costs by 62 percent feb 1 and household water and 
sewage fees by 220 percent to 290 percent march 1 
in budapest and elsewhere citizens anticipated the price hikes 
by stockpiling leaving food shop shelves completely bare last week 
prices of pork poultry and meat preparations went up by 13 
percent to 14 percent from monday andd beef prices increased 30 
percent now consumers pay 165 for a pound of medium quality beef 
and 12 cents for a pint of milk that cost 9 cents last week

us and japanese banks may agree to 
pay part of the philippines 28 billion foreign debt if manila 
allows us bases to remain here the philippine ambassador to 
washington said monday 
two visiting us senators meanwhile pledged to persuade their 
colleagues to support an agreement under which the united states 
would pay 962 million over the last two years of the bases lease 
the agreement signed by filipino and american negotiators in 
october needs congressional approval 
ambassador emmanuel pelaez told reporters that he had received 
feelers on the debtforbases deal from japanese and 
american financiers who are proposing it as a straight commercial 
deal 
he did not give further details 
pelaez said the international monetary fund and the world bank 
probably would support such a deal as a way to ensure political and 
economic stability in the philippines 
the united states has six installations in the philippines 
including clark air base and the subic bay naval base the lease on 
the installations expires in 1991 and president corazon aquino has 
refused to say whether she will support an extension 
pelaez said that closing the bases could lead to political 
upheavals 
also on monday sens richard lugar rind and thad cochran 
rmiss said they were pleased with progess in the philippines 
since 1986 when they visited the country to observe an election 
that both mrs aquino and former president ferdinand marcos claimed 
they won

uprising that swept mrs aquino to power 
lugar the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations 
committee said that he and cochran will work for passage of the 
962 million base lease agreement 
he also said they would try to build congressional support for 
200 million in economic aid for the philippines 
the senators ended their fourday visit monday by departing for

the case that sparked the movie 
mississippi burning involving the 1964 slayings of three civil 
rights workers could be reopened but the district attorney does not 
plan to give it special attention 
theres no statute of limitations on murder so it could be 
prosecuted said neshoba county district attorney ken turner 
but turner said he was not aware of any new evidence and 
indicated he had no special interest in prosecuting the case 
im interested in prosecuting any murder case i wouldnt 
single this case out turner said we cant prosecute on 
emotion 
the slayings of andrew goodman james chaney and michael 
schwerner on june 21 1964 have received renewed attention as a 
result of publicity surrounding the release of mississippi 
burning which uses the deaths near philadelphia as the basis for 
a fictitious story on the turbulent civil rights era 
the three civil rights workers were killed by a ku klux klan 
group shortly after they arrived in mississippi the fbi found their 
bodies buried in an earthen dam in the county 44 days after the 
killings 
eight men were convicted on federal charges in 1967 of conspiring 
to deprive the three of their civil rights mississippi never 
brought murder charges in the case 
i think it was a tragic time in mississippi history said 
state attorney general mike moore what we should all remember is 
that its been 25 or so years the mississippi we have today is a 
much different brighter much more intelligent place to live 
moore said a decision to prosecute rested with turner 
turner was in meetings monday with a grand jury and had not 
returned calls from the associated press seeking additional comment 
neshoba county naacp chairman pete talley of philadelphia was out of 
town and not available for comment 
wh johnson of decatur who was district attorney from 196472 
said that at the time the state government didnt trust the 
federal government and the federal government didnt trust the 
state government he said he presented the slayings before a grand 
jury three times without success 
i felt it should be tried at the local level but you had to 
have indictments to do it he said 
six weeks after the bodies were found a neshoba county grand 
jury was impaneled and subpoenas were issued to fbi agents however 
fbi director j edgar hoover told a circuit judge his agents would 
not disclose any information 
fbi agents said they didnt turn over information because they 
had to protect their sources from possible violence 
in its report the grand jury said its investigation had been 
curtailed and in fact stymied by the failure and refusal of 
agents to testify 
the county grand jury in september 1964 defended local law 
enforcement officials saying they had done an exceptional job of 
maintaining law and order in this county even in the face of 
drastic provocation 
but retired agent joseph sullivan who led the fbi investigation 
into the murders had another view of the case 
 
neshoba was an incredibly closed and racist county he said 
recently the countys law enforcement officers knew what was 
happening the blacks and indians in the county were almost supine 
and practically none of the whites in philadelphia would cooperate 
with us in solving the case we found that almost every adult white 
male in the county had connections with the ku klux klan 
when the state of mississippi failed to indict anyone in the 
case the federal government stepped in and charged 18 men with 
conspiring to violate the victims civil rights eventually eight 
were convicted and given sentences ranging from three to 10 years

a jury was selected monday to hear the 
longdelayed trial of three avowed revolutionaries accused of 
plotting to overthrow the government 
it took 68 days in court to select jurors in a case that has 
already cost more than 3 million both sides predict the trial will 
last a year even with the number of defendants whittled from eight 
to three opening arguments were set for tuesday 
the three face charges of seditious conspiracy or plotting to 
topple the government by force racketeering conspiracy and 
racketeering enterprise they each face up to 60 years in prison and 
60000 in fines if convicted 
up to 350 witnesses could be called to testify observers must 
pass through two metal detectors to reach the courtroom which an 
estimated 40 marshals take turns guarding 
assistant us attorney michael loucks will present the 
governments case against the defendants whom he calls 
terrorists 
loucks has alleged in court documents that the defendants are 
dangerous members of an underground group that conspired to rob 
banks and carry out at least 19 bombings including an explosion 
that rocked the suffolk county courthouse in 1976 and severed a 
mans leg the bombings injured 21 others 
the indictment also alleges that the defendants plotted the 1981 
murder of a new jersey state trooper and two attempted murders in 
massachusetts and maine 
defendant raymond luc levasseur 42 of maine will represent 
himself and attorneys will represent levasseurs wife patricia 
gros levasseur 40 and richard williams 41 of boston 
the defendants have maintained that what the prosecution 
describes as terrorism is actually resistance to imperialistic 
policies of the us government in central america and other places 
their attorneys have argued against the dangers of the seditious 
conspiracy statute that makes it a crime to carry out plots to put 
down or destroy the government they maintain that the statute is 
vague and so broad that it could be used to prosecute such minor 
acts of civil disobedience as protests outside military 
installations 
whats at stake here is not just the rights of the people on 
trial its the rights of every american william newman who 
represents mrs levasseur said monday 
all but five of the 17 jurors were picked at one fell swoop 
monday from a prescreened group of 45 jury selection began in 
april attorneys depleted the jury pool before they could pick the 
alternates to sit with the panel of 12 jurors 
after the jurors were seated us district judge william g 
young explained the charges and asked them to suspend judgment until 
the evidence had been presented 
the government has to prove somebody actually did something to 
make a conspiracy come about he said on no account can a 
person be prosecuted for his political beliefs 
the three defendants are all that remain of the eight who were 
arrested in ohio virginia and massachusetts most of them in 1984 
in what the prosecution has called the largest manhunt since the 
lindbergh kidnapping 
charges were dropped in august against two of the defendants 
thomas w manning 42 of maine and jaan karl laaman 40 of east 
boston because they were already serving long sentences 
mannings wife carol 33 pleaded guilty this month and young 
decided last week to hold a separate trial for laamans wife 
barbara j curzilaaman 31 
one other defendant christopher king 38 has been tried 
separately and found guilty on the single count of seditious 
conspiracy he was sentenced to seven years in prison

president reagan proposed on monday to cut 
spending by the agriculture department in fiscal 1990 by 19 percent 
including sharp reductions for commodity programs rural housing and 
emergency disaster aid to farmers 
another proposal would eliminate federal school lunch subsidies 
for children of middle and upper income families requiring them to 
pay 26 cents more per meal the savings would amount to more than 3 
million a day 
under the proposed budget to operate usda in the year that will 
begin oct 1 total spending would be held to 424 billion down 
from the estimated outlays of 521 billion in the current fiscal 
year 
as has been anticipated this budget is largely irrelevant 
said patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee it might of course have been designed to make a bush 
budget appear kinder and gentler 
spending on the departments commodity credit corp programs 
which includes wheat corn and other major crop supports would 
decline to a sixyear low of less than 116 billion billion from 
more than 138 billion in 1989 the peak was 258 billion in 1986 
the budget for ccc spending included 11 billion of unspecified 
cuts that would be decided by the incoming bush administration and 
congress future spending reductions in ccc programs could be in the 
range of 2 billion to 25 billion annually for 1991 through 1994 
leahy said the reagan blueprint for cutting farm programs raises 
a question of whether the administration actually means to disarm 
unilaterally just two months before the next round of trade talks 
the administration has urged under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade that all subsidies and other practices that 
interfere with free trade be eliminated but the idea hasnt caught 
on 
cutting farm programs before obtaining an agreement from our 
trading partners to do the same seems likely to undermine our gatt 
negotiating position leahy said in a statement 
deputy secretary peter myers said no legislation to carry out the 
ccc proposal would be sent to congress at this time 
were not going to be that presumptive myers said were 
going to say congress heres a way you can cut 11 billion do 
you want to wrestle with it we think the bush administration 
should have the perogative to look at it its a recommendation 
its an option 
the reagan budget proposal for operating cccs farm programs 
would include a 5 percent reduction in target prices beginning with 
the 1990 crops and slightly larger cuts the following three years 
target prices are used to compute federal payments to farmers when 
market prices fall short 
robert a denman director of international and public affairs 
for the national farmers union said most recent reagan budget 
proposals have been dead on arrival when sent to congress 
anyway 
the proposed 5 percent cut in crop target prices for 1990 on top 
of reductions already specified by the 1985 farm law may be part of 
the reagan budget plan but denman hoped that it wouldnt 
necessarily be in a bush budget 
this budget is not drastically different from previous reagan 
budgets usda budget director stephen b dewhurst said the 
basic position taken on farm programs is that were spending too 
much money on them 
in many other respects the 1990 budget proposals for usda 
represent a continuation of reagan administration policies 
including some that had been rejected by congress in the past 
for example the 1990 budget seeks to eliminate school lunch 
subsidies for nonneedy children needy children would continue 
getting free or reducedprice meals 
but a child from a family having an income of more than 185 
percent of the official poverty line 21553 a year for a family 
of four would have to pay about 26 cents more per day at the 
school cafeteria unless the states or local districts made up the 
difference 
overall food and consumer services which take almost half of the 
usdas annual budget would remain mostly intact however total 
spending would be almost 206 billion down from 213 billion this 
year food stamps which serve more than 18 million people are 
expected to cost about 127 billion compared with almost 129 
billion currently 
a report by department budget analysts showed that spending for 
small community and rural development would be chopped by nearly 
twothirds from 94 billion this year to 34 billion in fiscal 
1990 existing housing loans and grants at a spending level of 
336 billion this year would be terminated in favor of a housing 
voucher program 
farm loans of the farmers home administration would be reduced to 
37 billion from 49 billion this year and will continue the 
shift from direct loans to guaranteed loans established by the 
1985 farm law the report said guaranteed operating loans are 
expected to increase to 28 billion from 26 billion this year 
but fmha disaster loans reflecting hopedfor better weather 
conditions are expected to decline to around 50 million from 600 
million this year 
the budget report said fmha will continue to help farm borrowers 
reschedule overdue loans so they can stay in business however many 
have gone under and the fmha currently holds almost 5000 farms in 
its inventory with a market value of about 650 million 
some increases were called for in a number of usda programs 
including research and education soil and water conservation and 
food safety and inspection services 
also the administration seeks 250 million in supplemental 
financing this fiscal year to help the forest service pay for 
firefighting a new plan was outlined to partially pay for 
firefighting in the future by using money collected from timber 
sales and mining on federal lands

the navy said monday it has selected the 
general dynamics corp as the lead contractor on its next class of 
nuclearpowered attack submarine the ssn21 seawolf 
general dynamics victory over archrival newport news 
shipbuilding and drydock co came despite the fact that newport news 
earlier had won the lead contract for designing the hull of the new 
sub 
general dynamics has been designing the nuclear propulsion system 
for the new boat 
the navy said monday it was awarding general dynamics electric 
boat division in groton conn a 726 million 
fixedpriceincentive contract for the lead seawolf sub 
work will be performed in groton conn 67 percent quonset 
point ri 23 percent and charleston sc 10 percent and is 
expected to be completed in may 1995 the service said 
the navy declined to say what type of bid newport news had 
submitted in its competition with general dynamics 
the two shipyards compete annually to build the navys current 
class of attack submarine the socalled 688 or los angeles 
class newport news was the lead contractor on that class 
the navy expects to award its last two contracts for 688 subs in 
fiscal 1990 and then shift production entirely to the seawolf in 
fiscal 1991 by awarding contracts for two subs 
now that general dynamics has won the contract to build the lead 
boat newport news will not be in a position to compete in the 
program until those fiscal 1991 contracts are awarded 
the navy expects the new seawolf to help rebuild the us edge in 
underwater warfare an advantage eroded over the past decade 
because of espionage scandals and soviet efforts to build quieter 
submarines of their own 
the ssn21 like the 688class sub will be designed primarily to 
hunt and kill soviet submarines it is supposed to feature greater 
speed better sensors and longerrange weapons than the 688 class 
the seawolf is going to represent a major advance in speed 
depth quieting weapons capability and supportability the navy 
said monday

pakistan will try to mediate between 
the kremlin and afghan guerrillas who say they will not continue 
talks while moscow demands a role for communists in afghanistans 
future an official said monday 
we will try to restart the process a senior foreign ministry 
official said on condition of anonymity 
about 35 million afghan refugees live in pakistan after a decade 
of civil war and moslem guerrillas use border camps and towns as 
bases and supply points the soviets have been withdrawing their 
soldiers from afghanistan and the last 50000 are to be out by feb 
15 under a unmediated agreement 
insurgent leaders met twice in islamabad last friday with yuli 
vorontsov soviet deputy foreign minister and ambassador to 
afghanistan but they told a news conference monday there will be no 
more talks until the kremlin gives up its insistence that the 
communist party be included in the next government 
sibghatullah mojaddidi chairman of the sevenparty guerrilla 
alliance said further talks were futile and give propaganda 
material to the soviets 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 
growing to an estimated 115000 soldiers before the withdrawal began 
may 15 1988 
most arms and support for the guerrillas come from the united 
states and pakistan 
the pakistani official said the guerrilla alliance had fought the 
communists in afghanistan for all these years and now is not 
prepared to give them recognition we will have to review the whole 
thing with the alliance 
vorontosov ended a fourday visit to pakistan on saturday during 
which he also met three times with foreign minister sahabzada yaqub 
khan 
we have impressed upon vorontsov the importance of recognizing 
the realities of the situation and negotiate with the guerrillas 
yaqub khan said 
in early december the soviet envoy began a diplomatic mission 
seeking consensus on a broadbased government for afghanistan after 
the soviet withdrawal 
after meetings in saudi arabia and islamabad the guerrillas 
initially agreed to another round they reversed the decision monday 
after vorontsov said moscow would find a way to support its client 
regime unless a government including the communists was in place by 
feb 15 
vorontsov also has met with afghan guerrillas based in iran 
afghanistans neighbor on the west and former king zahir shah who 
was deposed in 1973 and lives in rome about 2 million afghan 
refugees are in iran 
guerrillas based in pakistan say they will establish a council of 
more than 400 members to choose a transitional government to replace 
the communist government in kabul which they say is sure to fall 
when the soviets are gone 
the pakistani official said refugees will not be forced to return 
to afghanistan after the soviet withdrawal is completed but we 
hope there will be conditions for them to go home in peace

a 32yearold businessman was killed monday when 
he slipped and fell to the tracks while trying to board a subway by 
climbing between two cars authorities said 
about 1200 passengers had to be evacuated along a narrow catwalk 
and through an empty train and 30000 commuters were inconvenienced 
as service on part of that line was suspended for more than 2 
hours transit authority spokesman bob previdi said 
a 1984 drivers license identified the victi as john gilmore 32 
but the address listed did not check out said al oleary a transit 
police spokesman police have been unable to locate any relatives 
and gilmore carried no current employer identification oleary 
said the dead man was wearing a suit and tie his briefcase was 
found and he was carrying 194 in cash

triggered a brake switch on the underside of each car when the 
train stopped the motorman got out to investigate and found the 
body 
while rescuers used air bags to lift the subway car and retrieve 
the body about 1200 passengers had to be evacuated 
passengers in a train behind the stopped train were discharged at 
the nearest station and the empty train proceeded until it reached 
the stopped train 
passengers in the stopped train were guided back to the eighth 
car then were led out an open door onto the narrow catwalk in the 
tunnel they were led along the catwalk past the car where the 
rescue was under way then back onto the last car from there they 
were able to step into the second train walk the length of that 
train then get back onto the catwalk for the last 50 feet to a 
station platform previdi said 
a similar fatality occurred friday there were no witnesses in 
that instance but transit officials believe harry foy 27 of 
queens fell between cars

ronald reagan the most conservative president 
since herbert hoover is leaving office after eight years with the 
hallmark programs of the new deal and great society not only 
unscathed but thriving 
he is also leaving a national debt that has almost tripled during 
his time and office this mountain of debt will prove to be a severe 
constraint on george bushs room to maneuver 
persons listening to reagans first inaugural address can be 
excused for being perplexed by these developments 
on that january day in 1981 reagan denounced budget deficits and 
vowed to end them he said government was not the solution to our 
problems but the problem itself 
you and i as individuals can by borrowing live beyond our 
means but for only a limited period of time why then should we 
think that collectively as a nation were not bound by the same 
limitation reagan asked his listeners we must act today in 
order to preserve tomorrow and let there be no misunderstanding we 
are going to begin to act beginning today 
now eight years later he is leaving office after running up the 
largest budget deficits in history and with a balanced budget still 
a distant goal on the horizon the final budget projects a 1990 
deficit of 925 billion and a balanced budget by 1993 
counting mondays document reagan sent nine budgets to congress 
none of them with balanced spending and revenues each spending plan 
projected that the budget would one day be balanced but only in the 
distant fugure not in the budget year under consideration 
for example reagans first budget sent up in february 1981 
forecast a balanced budget by 1984 the last year of his first term 
instead the government suffered a deficit of 1853 billion in 
1984 an imbalance that was surpassed in both 1985 and 1986 a year 
when the deficit hit a record 221 billion 
in his final budget message to congress reagan placed the blame 
for the tide of red ink on the steep 198182 recession which 
lowered government revenues and on congress which refused to go 
along with his proposed spending cuts 
but in the area of spending reagan himself decided that it would 
be politically unwise to launch an assault against the major 
middleclass government benefit programs 
he put social security the most enduring legacy of franklin 
roosevelts new deal and the governments biggest benefit program 
off limits to budget cuts 
as a result reagans final budget projected social security 
payments to nearly 40 million social security beneficiaries would 
total 241 billion in 1990 onefifth of the total 115 trillion 
budget and a 6 percent increase over the current year a bigger 
increase than reagan awarded the pentagon 
even after removing the effects of inflation social security 
spending has grown by 27 percent from 1980 to 1988 
medicare and medicaid the two biggest programs from lyndon 
johnsons great society are also doing well 
medicare which provides health coverage for social security 
recipients has nearly doubled during the reagan years as the cost 
of health care and the elderly population have both grown at rapid 
clips 
medicaid which provides health care for the poor has shot up 50 
percent between 1980 and 1988 
reagan struggling to contain health costs did propose trimming 
the projected growth in both programs in 1990 but even with the 
cuts the governments health bill will still represent its 
fastestgrowing sector 
while reagan did trim some poverty programs including subsidized 
housing and lowincome energy assistance the budget document shows 
overall spending in these areas remained relatively stable 
representing 17 percent of the countrys total economy in 1980 and 
16 percent in 1988 
one area that showed a huge increase however was the money 
spent to finance the national debt the administration said the 
government will spend 1701 billion on interest payments in 1990 
that means that 15 cents out of every dollar of government 
spending will go to pay the interest on the 26 trillion national 
debt a debt burden which has almost tripled during the reagan years 
interest payments surged from 2 percent of the total economy in 
1980 to 32 percent in 1988 this development has crowded out 
spending for other programs and will constrain bush as he struggles 
to find the money to fulfill his campaign promises to boost spending 
for education child care housing for the homeless and cleaning up 
the environment 
the 1701 billion interest payment projected in the budget for 
1990 is more than the combined budgets of the departments of 
agriculture commerce education energy interior justice labor 
state and transportation 
this last reagan budget is a sad testament to eight years of 
borrowing from our children said jeff faux president of the 
economic policy institute a laborbacked thinktank 
but richard rahn a leading supplysider and chief economist for 
the us chamber of commerce said that history will judge the 
reagan years more kindly 
i would have liked to see more reductions in the growth of 
spending and more progress against the deficit but as the president 
leaves office it is clear that he had enormous success rahn 
said by the late 1970s people felt that the government had 
gotten out of control and that taxes spending and regulation were 
growing far too rapidly

women who drink caffeinated 
beverages may take longer to become pregnant say scientists at the 
national institute of environmental health sciences 
every epidemiologic study has limitations said dr allen j 
wilcox principal investigator the findings were strong among 
women in our study but we wont be convinced until other 
epidemiologists find the same results in other groups 
the study was published in december in the lancet a british 
medical journal 
the study of caffeines effects on pregnancy was made as part of 
a study of early pregnancy in which women planning to become 
pregnant were enrolled at the time they stopped using birth control 
a group of 104 women provided data on the amount of caffeinated 
beverages they consumed during the time they tried to conceive the 
study said women who drank more than one cup of caffeinated coffee 
a day or the equivalent in tea and colas took significantly longer 
to become pregnant than women who drank less 
the husbands caffeine consumption has no apparent effect the 
study said factors such as smoking alcohol consumption frequency 
of intercourse and womens age did not change the findings 
even if the effect is real there is no evidence that caffeine 
does permanent harm wilcox said our data suggests that it is 
the womens current caffeine consumption not her past habits that 
affects her fertility 
fortunately women can avoid caffeinated beverages if 
necessary also there were women in our study who became pregnant 
quickly even while drinking large amounts of coffee obviously if 
caffeine is an influence on fertility it is not the only influence 
some women may be more susceptible to caffeine effects than others

the announcement monday that prince philip will 
represent his wife queen elizabeth ii at the funeral of emperor 
hirohito of japan brought angry protests from lawmakers and world 
war ii veterans 
buckingham palace announced that philip who served in the far 
east during the war and was present at the japanese surrender in 
tokyo bay would attend the feb 24 services in tokyo for hirohito 
who died jan 7 at the age of 87 after 62 years on the throne 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe will represent prime minister 
margaret thatchers government 
conservative lawmaker terry dicks urged the prince to resign as 
president of the burma star association the organization of far 
east war veterans some of whom urged the royal family to boycott 
the services dicks said whoever made the decision to send him 
should be shot 
the queen who does not attend the funerals of heads of state 
acts on the advice of government ministers on such issues as sending 
representatives 
harold payne president of the national federation of far eastern 
prisonersofwar associations said he was deeply saddened by 
the decision 
opposition labor party lawmaker ron brown who described hirohito 
as a war criminal of the worst kind called for a nationwide 
campaign to change the decision 
it is a grave insult to many people who were enslaved tortured 
and killed by the japanese during the last war he said 
but david owen leader of the moderate social democratic and 
labor party described the choice of the duke of edinburgh as 
imaginative correct and courageous 
conservative lawmaker ivor stanbrook also applauded the decision 
the proper time to consider relations with the emperor of japan 
was when we invited him here in 1971 as an honored guest on a state 
visit he said 
critics say the presence of a member of the british royal family 
would dignify a monarch who oversaw japans militaristic regime 
during world war ii and its harsh treatment of prisoners 
about 27000 british prisoners died at the hands of the japanese 
in the 19391945 war and many survivors regard him as a war 
criminal 
historians generally agree that hirohito was a figurehead who 
lacked power to do anything but approve decisions of military 
leaders 
hirohito visted britain in 1971 and the queen made an official 
return visit in 1975 
a 1986 visit to japan by prince charles and his wife princess 
diana played a significant role in smoothing postwar relations 
between britain and japan 
the queen charles and diana have sent messages of condolence to 
the new emperor akihito and the dowager empress

the antiamerican rhetoric ebbed monday as 
diplomats worked to fashion a security council resolution critical 
of the us downing of two libyan migs but mild enough to survive 
us and british veto threats 
britain agrees with washingtons explanation that the libyan 
mig23s acted in a threatening manner on wednesday in flying toward 
two us f14s on patrol over international waters in the 
mediterranean 
the un charter permits use of force in selfdefense 
libya says the migs were on reconnaissance and unarmed in 
security council debate friday us ambassador vernon a walters 
showed photographs of one mig with what he said were missiles under 
its wings libyam envoy ali sunni muntasser said the pictures were 
retouched 
diplomats said on condition of anonymity that they expect america 
and britain will jointly veto any resolution critical of the united 
states the council reconvenes tuesday afternoon and a vote is 
expected later in the day 
the diplomats said the nonaligned nations were tinkering with 
the language of a critical resolution dropping condemn and 
substituting strongly deplore and referring to a us 
attack and not an unprovoked attack 
council speeches monday were more temperate than fridays heated 
exchanges between libya and the united states and some of the other 
speeches 
the speakers on monday finland ethiopia senegal sudan 
india morocco bangladesh and france contrasted the air fight 
over the mediterranean in the first week of the new year with the 
atmosphere of detente and cooperation that prevailed in 1988 
the aerial battle and the war of words between libya and america 
were like thunder in a calm sky said senegals saidou nourou ba 
we hope every one will exercise restraint and refrain from any 
act which could enhance tensions said french envoy pierre 
brochand 
a draft resolution circulated by the nonaligned nations asks the 
us navy to withdraw from international waters in the mediterranean 
libyan ambassador ali a treiki told reporters later the 
nonaligned nations were still discussing changes in the draft 
the tone was quite different today in the chamber walters 
said afterward today there was considerably more temperate 
language 
but he said the latest compromise resolution still was not 
sufficiently good for me to change my position on it meaning 
veto it 
each of the five permanent council members the united states 
the soviet union china britain and france has veto power to kill 
any resolution 
british ambassador sir crispin tickell told reporters the 
united states acted within its rights of selfdefense so 
although we like everybody else regret the incident were not in 
the business of condemning or deploring actions by the united states 
in this regard 
commenting on the more moderate speeches monday tickell said 
that perhaps even in some quarters good sense gradually creeps 
in like a tide 
china and the soviet union were expected to vote in favor of any 
resolution france was likely to abstain 
the 10 nonpermanent council members are canada finland 
ethiopia colombia malaysia algeria brazil nepal senegal and 
yugoslavia 
canada was considered likely to abstain the rest favored a 
critical resolution

the horrible deaths by poison gas of nearly 1 
million soldiers in the trenches of world war i so shocked the world 
that in 1925 a group of nations agreed never to use such weapons 
again 
but this weeks paris conference reviewing the agreement takes 
place with a clock grimly ticking each year observers say the 
list of countries owning and developing chemical weapons grows and 
the use of such weapons lies in the notsodistant past 
under strong international public pressure the 1925 geneva 
protocol was reached banning the use of chemical weapons and 118 
countries signed up sixtyfour years later delegates at the 
conference are reviewing the violations of the ban over the years 
and discussing ways to give it meaning and teeth 
the 1925 protocol covers only use most delegates here agree the 
world also needs to ban development production and storage of toxic 
agents they also agree some organization maybe the united nations 
should be able to check that countries are abiding by the ban and 
that those violating it should be punished 
the need for an expanded international agreement on chemical and 
biological arms has been recognized for a long time negotiators 
have been meeting periodically to come up with an accord for 17 
years 
when the last meeting in geneva of the ad hoc committee on 
chemical weapons under the un conference on disarmament closed 
april 28 last year nothing was ready to sign optimists said a 
convention might be ready in another couple of years 
president reagan speaking to the un general assembly last 
fall called for the international conference president francois 
mitterrand speaking a few days later agreed to host it 
the 150 countries meeting in paris hope they can find enough 
common ground by wednesdays close of their fiveday meeting to 
issue a final document sending a clear political message to the 
negotiators the world wants a new accord 
the united states and the soviet union admit to having thousands 
of tons in storage but experts say at least 20 other countries 
either have poison arms or will before long 
countries that have chemical weapons sell them to others that 
dont some experts at the meeting say and possible customers 
include terrorist groups 
who wants chemical weapons asked a us expert speaking on 
condition he not be named i cant give you a list but i can give 
you a set of criteria 
anybody whos got a neighbor who has them anybody who has a 
resistence they want wiped out anybody with no chance of having

marine commandant gen al gray on monday 
accepted an investigative report which concludes there was a total 
breakdown in accountability procedures within a unit that left a 
young enlisted man to die in the california desert during a training 
exercise 
the marine corps in a statement released at its washington 
headquarters said gray ordered a review of the conduct of some 
additional officers in the affected unit after reviewing the report 
one officer is already facing a preliminary investigation in the 
matter and two sergeants are facing special courtsmartial later 
this month at camp lejeune nc 
those three have either been charged or are facing charges of 
dereliction of duty in the death of lance cpl jason j rother 19 
of minneapolis minn rothers platoon leader and company commander 
also have been relieved of their duties and reprimanded 
based upon additional recommendations made by the investigating 
officer the commanding general of the 2nd marine division has 
been directed to review the report and take appropriate action with 
respect to the battalion commander and the battalion executive 
officer of rothers unit the 3rd battalion 2nd marine regiment of 
the 2nd marine division the headquarters statement said monday 
gen gray stated that he would not accept wasting lives in 
socalled training accidents the statement said 
quoting gray the statement continued rothers death was not 
an accident accidents happen his death didnt just happen rather 
it was the culminating event in a series of acts each consciously 
committed by human beings it was the certain and foreseeable 
result of an attitude which i intend to see erased from our corps 
rother was assigned to serve as a road guide during an exercise 
at the marine base at twentynine palms calif last august and was 
not picked up after his unit moved through the area 
despite an extensive search his remains were not discovered 
until dec 4 moreover the marine was not reported missing for 
almost 40 hours after he should have been picked up 
the investigation accepted by gray concluded that poor planning 
and direction in the placement and recovery of the marines assigned 
to the detail with rother caused the failure to pick him up and 
that a total breakdown in the chain of personnel accountability 
within rothers unit led to the delay in accounting for his 
whereabouts the corps said monday 
the actions of some individuals in the unit reflect a state of 
mind which contradicts every principle of concerned leadership on 
which we marines have traditionally prided ourselves the 
statement added 
at the direction of the commandant of the marine corps copies 
of the completed investigation were provided to the parents of lance 
cpl jason rother

state prochoice advocates said they were 
concerned about the us supreme courts decision monday to review a 
missouri law regulating abortions but also said it might fire up 
their movement 
we are hopeful that the supreme court will realize the 
importance of having the option of abortion said bj 
isaacsonjones executive director of reproductive health services 
an abortion clinic named in the states appeal to the supreme court 
she said she also saw the decision as an opportunity for 
prochoice people to keep the issue of choice in front of america 
leaders from the movement to halt abortions were elated by the 
justices decision to study a lowercourt ruling that struck down 
key provisions of the missouri law 
justice department lawyers want the high court to use the 
missouri case as a means of undoing its landmark 1973 roe vs wade 
ruling which legalized abortion 
there was nothing in mondays brief order that indicated the 
supreme court would reconsider its ruling of 16 years ago 
we hoped all along that we could get the case up to the supreme 
court and have the court look at some very important issues said 
sam lee legislative director for missouri citizens for life and 
we think with some changes in the court in the past couple years 
theres a good chance that roe vs wade may be partially or even 
completely overturned 
erika fox director of public affairs for planned parenthood of 
greater kansas city said the decision would provide a chance to 
emphasize the dire consequences on the life and health of women 
and their families if the clock is turned back to the time american 
women were mutilated and even died as a result of botched 
abortions 
isaacsnjones added people assumed that reproductive freedom 
is protected by the constitution we know that may not be the case 
it is time for us to reorganize regroup be more vocal be more 
visible 
in july the 8th us circuit court of appeals which is based in 
st louis struck down several provisions of missouris abortion 
law including 
a ban on using public hospitals or other governmentrun 
facilities for abortions not necessary to save a womans life 
a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or 
assisting an abortion 
and a ban on using taxpayer money for encouraging or 
counseling women to have abortions 
in the states appeal attorney general william webster said the 
8th circuit courts ruling expands supreme court precedents in 
favor of abortion on demand 
state rep jim barnes a sponsor of the original law said he was 
pleased with the courts decision but he said he did not believe it 
would serve to overturn the decision in roe vs wade 
he predicted that if the supreme court ruled in favor of the 
state other states would use the law as a pattern for restricting 
the use of public funds at facilities where abortions are performed 
and for employees who offer abortion counseling

aligned purely to go after major drug trafficking and money 
laundering organizations and heroin and cocaine 
so with us every incremental increase means that we can attack 
that many more organizations he said referring to a proposed 12 
million boost in fbi spending on drugs next year 
when the fbi received 15 million more as a result of the 1986 
drug bill sessions said the agency was able to mount attacks on an 
addtional 5 percent to 10 percent of the approximately 450 major 
drug trafficking organizations 
reagan requested a total of 349 billion in fiscal 1990 for law 
enforcement in the drug wars including 35 million in outlays for 
the office of the new drug czar

to finance two surveillance aircraft and two landbased balloons for 
spotting drug smugglers according to the documents

president reagan on monday proposed increasing 
by half a billion dollars the down payment on modernizing and 
cleaning up the nations atomic weapons complex a job expected to 
cost 81 billion over the next 20 years 
in his fiscal 1990 budget for the energy department which makes 
the nuclear warheads for the pentagon reagan asked for 3014 
billion for modernization environmental and safety programs at the 
weapons plants that is 478 million more than is being spent this 
year 
the proposal drew immediate criticism from sen john glenn 
dohio who charged the reagan budget was not enough to prevent 
further environmental contamination let alone clean up the mess 
produced over the past 45 years 
its just a token of what is needed for cleanup said glenn 
who said it will take at least 18 billion a year to even just 
get started he urged presidentelect bush to do more 
deputy energy secretary joseph f salgado told reporters the 
department was dealing resolutely with our safety and 
environmental problems and has established a process to address 
this problem in the long term 
the department said it plans to seek a total of 18 billion over 
the next five years to build new facilities and improve the existing 
weapons complex of 17 major factories and laboratories in 12 states 
according to budget documents 60 percent of the energy 
departments total 15 billion in requested spending authority is 
devoted to research and production of nuclear weapons and defense 
department projects 
energy officials were unable to provide a comprehensive detailed 
breakdown of requested outlays money that would actually be spent 
in the fiscal year beginning next oct 1 
those outlays usually run below the requested spending authority 
which includes planned expenditure obligations on multiyear projects 
the department is requesting spending authority of 3035 million 
for designing two new nuclear reactors to replace three 35yearold 
reactors at its savannah river plant in aiken sc which have 
been shut down since last april for safety reasons 
it is not clear when the department will restart the first of the 
savannah river reactors which produce tritium a fastdecaying 
isotope of hydrogen that is needed for modern thermonuclear weapons 
but as a replacement for the old reactors the department is 
proposing to build a new heavy water facility at savannah river at 
an estimated cost of 32 billion and a new gascooled reactor at 
idaho falls idaho costing 36 billion both would become 
operational about the turn of the century 
to clean up individual sites in the complex the department is 
requesting an increase in spending authority from 19 million this 
year to 56 million in 1990 for savannah river from 50 million to 
55 million for the feed materials production center in fernald 
ohio and from 28 million to 54 million for the hanford site at 
richland wash 
there has been no decision on shutting down fernald or 
another plant rocky flats near denver salgado told reporters 
administration sources have said that the two might close at an 
unspecified future date because they are near cities and would be 
expensive to modernize 
energy secretary john s herrington had asked the white house for 
an additional 360 million to be spent by sept 30 of this year to 
clean up the nuclear weapons complex but the request was turned 
down 
instead white house chief of staff kenneth n duberstein 
authorized the department to allocate 150 million in unspent funds 
for the cleanup effort 
in documents sent to congress last july the department estimated 
that the cleanup effort could cost up to 110 billion over the next 
40 years 
a more detailed classified study the 2010 report estimated that 
the costs will reach 81 billion over the next two decades 
according to administration and congressional sources familiar with 
the document 
that report envisaged a substantial increase in funding over 
198990 levels starting sometime in the 1990s 
of the total cleanup costs of 110 billion nearly half or 46 
billion would be spent at hanford which began operating as a top 
secret facility in 1944 producing fuel for the first us atomic 
weapons according to the report sent to congress

children swarmed onto a parade ground monday 
to say goodbye to the first of 3000 cuban soldiers scheduled to 
leave by april 1 under a peace agreement for southern africa 
they thrust flowers into the hands of officers and soldiers as 
defense minister pedro maria tonha told the men assembled at the 
training camp dont ever forget angola because you fought and 
died here 
the first 450 cubans are to depart tuesday in a symbolic 
airlift under terms of the agreement mediated by the united states 
and signed dec 22 by angola cuba and south africa the rest of the 
3000 troops are expected to return to cuba by ship 
angola and cuba have asked the united nations to pay the 
estimated 800 million cost of sending the estimated 50000 cubans 
home from angola 
their repatriation is part of a plan intended to bring peace to 
southern africa and independence to southwest africa also known as 
namibia after unsponsored elections 
not included in the agreement are rebels fighting angolas 
marxist government with us and south african support and the 
southwest africa peoples organization a guerrilla group opposing 
south african control of namibia 
tonha decorated 13 ranking cuban officers including gen raul 
menedez tomassevic among those attending the ceremony were gen 
abelardo colome ibarra vice minister of the cuban armed forces and 
gen pericles ferreira gomes of brazil head of the un observers 
who will monitor the withdrawal over 27 months 
cuban officials at the funda camp 22 miles northeast of luanda 
the capital said the ceremony brought together the largest number 
of cuban officers ever assembled outside the carribean island nation 
soldiers from cuba arrived in july 1975 to support the 
government that won control after independence from portugal in its 
battle with rebels of the national union for the total independence 
of angola 
the united states has said it will continue military assistance 
to unita until the government of president jose eduardo dos santos 
agrees to negotiate with the rebels 
brig gen rafael moracen limonta who first came to angola in 
1965 as an adviser to marxist guerrillas fighting the portuguese 
said the departure was possible because south africa agreed to 
withdraw from southern angola where its forces pursued swapo 
guerrillas and allow independence in namibia 
the problem with unita is among the angolans themselves he 
said standing with other officers on the parade ground we came 
here because of the south africans 
angola and south africa agreed to a ceasefire in southern angola 
on aug 8 and south african troops withdrew into namibia 
south africa captured namibia from germany in world war i and 
controlled it under a league of nations mandate the un general 
assembly ended the mandate in 1966 but south africa had refused to 
leave 
all but a token south african force is to withdraw from the 
territory by nov 1 when namibia is to hold its first free 
legislative elections 
some questions remain about how 70 military and 20 civilian un 
observers will monitor the departure of cuban troops from a country 
14 times the size of portugal 
gen ferreira gomes said he would rely on the good word of 
the cubans and angolans but another military observer said 
privately his mission is to count heads 
the observers are from algeria brazil congo india jordan 
norway spain and yugoslavia

who heads parliaments foreign affairs committee 
he said the united states has not supplied details about the 
american suspicions as requested west german and us officials 
were expected to meet this week to review the allegations 
stercken also said the issue should not have come to a head 
through the american media and that the united states and west 
germany should have had more communication about the us

companies italian and japanese firms were supplying libya with 
material and knowhow to build the plant

in a valedictory speech secretary of state 
george p shultz on monday night condemned leaks and lies in 
government and the old american inclination to withdraw from the 
world 
apart from the criticism shultz said he was leaving his post 
after more than six years convinced that ours is a winning hand 
shultz said the united states was approaching a new era in 
international affairs in a world that had undergone significant 
changes 
fear of nuclear war was greatly diminished 
a new ussoviet relationship promised to reduce tensions and 
to increase cooperation in solving world problems 
a new global economy based on information and openness was 
replacing old divisions based on national borders and ancient 
rivalries 
human rights the rule of law and the practice of democracy 
were taking root and spreading 
shultz who first came to washington more than 30 years ago said 
he would go home to california next week convinced that america is 
lighting the way for the hopes and aspirations of countless millions 
around the world 
his remarks were prepared for delivery at a reception given for 
him at the state department by the citizens network for foreign 
affairs a private group 
while most of shultzs speech was positive he said some things 
are worse including a steady erosion in the precepts of public 
service 
shultz criticized declinists or those who play to the idea 
that america no longer has anything to give the world 
without specifying any particular individual or group shultz 
said they touch on the old american inclination to withdraw from 
the world in order to regain economic or moral security 
shultz said their ideas should be rejected 
also he criticized a dangerous loss of trust within the 
government specifically shultz scored infighters in the executive 
branch who use leaks and lies to influence decisions 
our decisions should be fairly made and once they are they 
should be carried out like it or not shultz said 
you live up to your oath of office not just by carrying out 
decisions you agree with but by carrying out decisions you dont 
agree wtih or else resigning 
again shultz gave no examples 
during his stay at the state department he offered to resign 
three times over proposed liedetector tests a mission he was not 
aware of to the middle east by robert c mcfarlane then the white 
house national security adviser and his inability to secure a plane 
for an overseas assignment 
on the other hand shultz privately opposed the decision by 
president reagan to approve secret us arms sales to iran but did 
not threaten to quit

the justice department announced monday it will 
sue to block two proposed joint ventures between westinghouse 
electric corp and a swiss company 
the ventures between westinghouse and asea brown boveri inc of 
zurich would involve the manufacture and sale of electric power 
generation transmission and distribution products 
the proposed joint ventures pose significant threats to 
competition in equipment and services necessary for this countrys 
production of electric power said charles f rule assistant 
attorney general in charge of the antitrust division 
as a result the reduction of competition in these markets 
would likely mean higher electric rates for all users of electricity 
and higher prices for many products manufactured using 
electricity rule said 
if the anticompetitive aspects can be resolved through a 
restructuring of the joint ventures the antitrust division still 
would file a civil lawsuit but it would be accompanied by a consent 
decree incorporating the changes which settle the suit rule said 
westinghouse spokesman jim schmitt said that the negotiations 
are continuing that may enable the transactions to go forward 
under the joint ventures announced by westinghouse in april 1988 
westinghouse would hold 55 percent and abb 45 percent in each 
partnership schmitt said 
in both cases each partner will contribute the manufacturing 
plants and engineering and marketing organizations of its involved 
operations he said in addition westinghouse will receive 
about 500 million from abb for the two partnership interests 
a justice department statement said competitive concerns caused 
by one of the ventures focus on power transformers used by electric 
utilities to convert electricity to different voltages so that it 
can be transmitted efficiently over long distances the combined 
power transformer sales of westinghouse and abb would exceed 50 
percent of total us sales which were more than 400 million in 
1988 the department said 
the concern with the second venture focused on the manufacture 
and sale of steam turbine generators and the sale of major repair 
services on existing turbine generating equipment rule said 
westinghouse abb and general electric of fairfield conn are 
the three leading us suppliers of medium and large steam turbine 
generators 
westinghouse and abb are two of only four significant sellers of 
major turbine generator repair and related services to us 
utilities along with ge and utility power corp a subsidiary of 
siemens ag of west germany rule said us sales of steam turbine 
generators and the pertinent services are estimated at over 600 
million per year 
schmitt would not disclose the portion of each market held by 
westinghouse

japans new emperor said monday he will help 
safeguard the democratic constitution and leftist politicians urged 
vigilance against any government effort to use the monarchy for 
reactionary ends 
one communist and five socialist legislators boycotted the 
ceremony at which emperor akihito pledged himself to the 
constitution imposed by the united states after world war ii but 
two socialists did attend 
those who stayed away said the monarchys close links to the 
shinto religion violates the constitutional separation of state and 
religion they were invited in their capacities as chairmen of 
parliamentary committees 
outside the imperial palace nearly 315000 mourners signed 
registers of condolence monday for emperor hirohito who died of 
cancer saturday at age 87 his 62year reign was marked by the rise 
of militarism defeat in the war and japans emergence as a leading 
economic power 
one mourner outside 36yearold pianist yumiko ideta said of 
the new imperial era i and many of my generation think it will be 
a good chance for akihito to do the things his father wasnt able to 
do we know that the emperor has been manipulated politically since 
meiji times 18671912 and well have to address the problem during 
akihitos reign and afterward 
akihito 55 is expected to be closer to the people than his 
father who was considered a living god until he renounced the 
concept of imperial divinity after world war ii 
on monday in his first speech as emperor akihito said he would 
continue on hirohitos path making his desire to constantly be at 
one with the people my desire as well joining together with you to 
preserve the constitution of japan 
he reaffirmed the limits placed on his role by the constitution 
which makes him a symbol of the state and the unity of the 
people his duties are ceremonial consisting of signing bills 
into law and meeting foreign dignitaries 
by emphasizing the constitution drawn up in the us occupation 
of 194552 akihito was expected to win praise from liberals they 
have criticized recent attempts by rightist members of the ruling 
liberal democratic party to revise the document and declare the 
emperor head of the nation 
prime minister noboru takeshita pledged to work within the 
constitution of japan and with the emperor the symbol of unity of 
the people to make japan open to the world 
analysts said optimism about emperor akihitos new era helped 
boost the tokyo stock exchanges key indicator the nikkei stock 
average of 225 selected issues up 46885 points to a record high 
3067839 on monday 
the new emperor spoke somberly for four minutes in the formal 
ceremony attended by takeshita and 237 members of the imperial 
family government parliament and judiciary 
shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the awesome 
responsibilities i undertake i stand humbly before you akihito 
said at his side were empress michiko 54 and their 28yearold 
son crown prince naruhito 
eizo kobayashi a senior communist party official told reporters 
later no matter what the new emperor says we must realize the 
possible danger of his role our task now is to oppose reactionary 
political use of the emperor and to promote the peaceful clauses of 
the postwar constitution 
opposition political parties also say government sponsorship of 
some of the numerous rites honoring hirohito with their shinto 
practices violates the constitution 
hirohito will be buried feb 24 in an imperial mausoleum in 
hachioji a western suburb after a state funeral in the shinjuku 
gyoen imperial gardens and a public procession 
in one of about 60 funeral and transition rites emperor akihito 
paid final respects to his father monday and palace officials sealed 
hirohitos body in a coffin of japanese cypress inside a copper 
container news reports said 
officials said slightly more than 1 million mourners had visited 
the palace in central tokyo since saturday to sign the condolence 
books and about 350000 had signed 11 other registers around the 
country 
two old soldiers hanged themselves saturday and sunday leaving 
suicide notes saying they wanted to follow the emperor in death 
teinosuke watanabe an 82yearold retired company president 
said after signing the palace condolence register monday for my 
generation the emperor was an honorable man in his own way he has 
admitted responsibility for the war traveling around the country 
to meet the people as they rebuilt 
by living he has borne the heavy burden of war 
responsibility 
how much responsibility hirohito bore has been a matter of 
controversy but historians generally agree he was a figurehead with 
too little power to do anything but approve decisions of military 
leaders

the reagan administration on monday proposed to 
boost spending for aids research and prevention by 13 percent but to 
reduce the growth of the medicare and medicaid health programs by 
cutting payments to states hospitals and physicians 
overall the budget of the department of health and human 
services the largest federal department would increase 57 
percent to 4244 billion in fiscal 1990 hhs spending accounts for 
about 37 percent of the federal budget 
medicare and medicaid have been fueling the growth of the 
departments budget medicare has been growing faster than the 
number of beneficiaries and far more rapidly than inflation even 
inflation in medical prices between 1980 and 1989 medicare has 
grown about 12 percent annually while medicaid is growing at 13 
percent a year 
president reagan said his proposed cutbacks would not reduce 
benefits to the 56 million elderly disabled and lowincome people 
in the two programs but would force the states which administer 
medicaid and providers paid by medicare to become more efficient 
and reduce waste 
reagans critics however say the medicaid cutbacks which will 
reduce grants to states by 3 percent will curtail medical services 
for the poor 
unless states have or are willing to come up with more money 
which many arent their only options are to restrict eligibility 
reduce medical services or reduce fees paid to doctors said 
robert greenstein director of the center on budget and policy 
priorities a nonprofit group that researches policy issues 
affecting the lowincome 
in substantial part it will be passed along in benefit 
reductions he said 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the house health 
subcommittee said the medicaid cutbacks put the states in a 
financially untenable situation that will result in less coverage 
to lowincome families 
reagan said the fight against the spread of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome continues to be the nations top public health 
priority an estimated 1 million to 15 million people in the united 
states are infected with the deadly virus though not all have 
developed symptoms yet 
reagan proposed 160 million more for aids research which would 
bring spending in fiscal 1990 to 14 billion a 13 percent increase 
over current outlays 
hhs secretary otis bowen had pushed for a 39 percent increase 
over the 1989 budget authority of 13 billion but the proposed 
spending plan would increase spending authority by only 24 percent 
to 16 billion for fiscal 1990 budget authority totals can be 
spent over more than one year 
the department also estimated an additional 925 million would be 
spent on treatment and income support to aids victims through 
medicaid medicare disability insurance and other income and 
service programs 
more than 82000 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states since 1981 by the end of 1992 the administration said 
reported aids cases in this country are expected to reach 365000 
with 80000 new cases and 65000 aids deaths projected for that year 
alone 
the budget proposal also increases basic biomedical research by 
66 percent to 85 million included is 100 million for a project 
to map the human genome the biological blueprint that determines 
individual characteristics and that also can cause disease 
more than 94 percent of hhs spending is earmarked for entitlement 
programs like social security medicare and medicaid over which the 
agency has little budget control since eligibility for the programs 
is set by congress 
reagans budget protects social security benefits but proposes 
changes that would require approval by congress to reduce the rapid 
growth in medicare and medicaid spending 
hospitals have a lot of profit margin with which to absorb 
the reductions and states need to examine how they are running 
their medicaid programs not necessarily cut back benefits said 
elizabeth cusick director of the division of health benefits in the 
office of the hhs secretary 
we want to encourage them to find ways to control costs she 
said 
without any changes the medicare budget which pays for the 
health care of about 34 million elderly and disabled americans 
would grow by 14 percent in fiscal 1990 however reagan is 
proposing to trim that growth rate to 10 percent by cutting 35 
billion from fees paid to physicians and hospitals the medicare 
budget would total 949 billion 
about a third of the medicare cut 1 billion would come from 
cuts in payments to teaching hospitals which receive additional 
reimbursements to cover their costs of training interns and 
residents 
also capital payments to hospitals would be cut for a savings of 
620 million and reduced fees to physicians for certain procedures 
including radiology anesthesiology and surgery that are considered 
overpriced would save about 350 million 
a new part of medicare is the catastrophic health insurance 
program which is intended to be entirely selfsupporting it is 
financed by premiums paid by medicare recipients which are 
projected to total about 86 billion in fiscal 1990 the program is 
projected to spend 4 billion in that year 
growth in medicaid the program that rovides health care for 
about 26 million lowincome americans would be 9 percent without 
changes in the program next year the administration is proposing to 
slice that to 5 percent growth with cuts totalling about 14 
billion for a spending a total of 36 billion 
much of the reduction would come from reducing payments to the 
states which administer the program under federal guidelines by 
about 11 billion 
benefits under the social security program are protected and the 
administration projects a costofliving adjustment of 36 percent 
in january 1990 
currently a newly retired 65yearold can receive a maximum of 
899 per month in social security benefits a 36 percent increase 
would put the maximum at 931 next year

the environmental protection agency said monday 
it is considering charging the chemical industry a fee for the right 
to produce chlorofluorocarbons as an attempt to spur the phasing out 
of such production 
under international treaty production of chlorofluorocarbons or 
cfcs is to be curtailed to l986 levels next july and cut in half by 
l998 the chemical is widely blamed for depletion of the worlds 
atmospheric ozone 
in its fiscal l990 budget announced monday the epa said it 
plans to propose charging the chemical industry market value for 
the rights to produce cfcs and related ozonedepleting substances 
epa administrator lee m thomas told reporters the agency has yet 
to determine precisely what mechanism will be used to determine the 
fee which he said is expected to produce about 400 million in 
revenue 
under various proposals under consideration the government could 
charge a fee for a certain volume of cfcs produced or could auction 
off production permits officials suggested 
in either case the federal fee structure is expected to keep 
producers from reaping windfall profits as the available volume of 
cfcs is reduced in the coming years federal officials fear high 
profits would work against the industry rapidly developing 
substitute products 
producers of cfcs immediately criticized the plan although it is 
still in the preliminary stages of development 
the government proposal is a blatant illegal tax on an 
industry that is striving to restructure through an orderly 
transition to alternative products said a statement issued by the 
dupont company which is the worlds largest producer of cfcs 
the company said either a permit fee or an auction on permits 
will likely result in dislocations in the supply of these 
important chemicals 
the epa last summer also said in a preliminary regulatory 
proposal that some kind of permit and fee structure might be 
necessary to prevent cfc producers from taking in windfall profits 
and thereby slowing down the phasing out of cfc production 
because of the concern about ozone depletion the nations of the 
world have agreed that the production of chlorofluorocarbons are to 
be phased out 
cfcs are used for a variety of purposes including as a coolant in 
air conditioning units and refrigerators in halon gas fire 
extinguishers in the production of styrofome and in many countries 
as a propellant in spray cans 
dupont said that annually 28 billion in goods and services and 
135 billion worth of equipment depend on cfcs in some way

legislators pledged on monday they would grill 
the treasury over office expenses after reports said finance 
minister shimon peres planned to have taxpayers pay for his ironing 
the controversy came days after peres pushed through a 600 
million economic austerity plan that raised prices for basics such 
as milk and bread 
an outcry arose over a report in the haaretz newspaper that the 
finance ministry planned to increase its budget by at least 350000 
to fund special privileges for peres and his aides almost 90000 
was allocated to peres personal services such as ironing catering 
and photographs the paper wrote 
finance ministry spokesman avi gil said on monday that peres 
didnt see the budget proposal was not asked about it and didnt 
approve it 
he said when peres found out about the draft after the haaretz 
publication he canceled it immediately 
but yossi sarid a legislator for the opposition citizens rights 
movement said the ministry only backed away on monday because of 
the public clamor 
the latest proposal calls for one mobile car telephone instead of 
three and grants a senior aide a ford sierra instead of a volvo 
said sarid 
the other items such as ironing and so on will remain in the 
budget but the expenses for the photographer will be halved from 
26000 to 13000 sarid said adding that items like ironing 
were highly irregular 
they wont make or break the state economy but when everyones 
talking about tightening the belt and austerity its a matter of 
principle he said 
sarid said the new budget allocation would total 34000 less 
than onetenth of the original besides personal items the initial 
350000 figure was to cover services and overtime payments for 
peres aides haaretz wrote 
gil refused comment on sarids remarks 
guided by a finance ministry proposal the cabinet decided last 
thursday to slash the state budget by 600 million the cuts meant 
drastic price increases on subsidized foodstuffs such as milk bread 
and yogurt and additional charges for public high school tuition 
and doctors visits 
political figures from right and left assailed the finance 
ministry perquisites 
rafael eitan of the ultraright tzomet party said peres was 
setting a bad personal example and ran cohen of the leftwing 
citizens rights movement demanded that peres reduce his budget by 15 
percent rather than raise it 
the parliamentary finance committee did not discuss the 
controversy during its meeting monday but chairman ariel weinstein 
told the associated press i got the feeling it will become an 
important issue 
he said the committee would demand a detailed breakdown of the 
finance ministrys budget although the law does not require 
ministries to submit their budgets for approval 
a labor party official speaking on condition of anonymity 
blamed the misstep on peres aides and said it would weaken peres 
within the party whose younger generation has been challenging his 
leadership

officials said monday both engines of a 
new boeing 737 apparently failed causing the plane to crash beside 
britains main northsouth highway and kill 44 people 
transport minister paul channon said sabotage was not suspected 
in the crash sunday of the british midland airways jet the second 
air disaster in britain in less than three weeks prime minister 
margaret thatcher said however that no possible cause could be 
ruled out including sabotage 
the scandinavian airline sas part owner of british midland 
received a bomb threat against it and its subsidiaries eight days 
ago but spokesman john herbert said monday in stockholm no link 
with the crash was suspected 
one aviation expert called the double engine failure a 10 
millionto1 chance 
leicestershire police revised the death toll downward to 44 on 
monday night an earlier report of 46 fatalities resulted from 
confusion in counting bodies at several mortuaries said a police 
spokeswoman who by custom was not identified 
eightytwo passengers and crew members all of the survivors of 
the crash were injured including 43yearold pilot kevin hunt 
who was hailed as a hero for managing to miss crashing on the 
village of kegworth or the m1 highway 
the jet en route from london to belfast plowed into a grassy 
embankment on the highway sunday night as the pilot struggled to 
make an emergency landing at east midlands airport about 100 miles 
north of london he missed the runway by about half a mile 
so far the evidence although by no means conclusive is 
consistent with the right engine having stopped before impact and 
there are also signs of fire in the left engine channon told 
bbctv 
asked whether both engines malfunctioned he replied that 
certainly looks probable at the moment 
the boeing 737400 delivered to british midland just 12 weeks 
ago had flown less than 500 hours the airline said boeing said 
the plane had two cfm56 engines built in france by a consortium of 
the usbased general electric co and the french company snecma 
snecma spokesman olivier fagard said he did not know whether both 
engines failed 
it is extremely improbable that both engines would break down 
in such a short interval fagard said in paris we have very 
impressive reliability statistics there ws a fire in engine no 1 
which was controlled there was no fire in the other 
william tench retired head of britains air accidents 
investigation board said the odds against both engines failing on a 
boeing 737 were about 10 million to 1 he suggested there had been a 
technical mistake such as something incorrect being done to the 
engines during turnaround servicing between flights either 
inadvertently or deliberately 
freddie yetman spokesman for the british airline pilots 
association said a doubleengine failure was astonishing 
you just dont train for something like this you work on the 
assumption that there will always be an engine working he said 
mrs thatcher inspected the wreckage of the blue aircraft 
crumpled among roadside trees and visited survivors at derby royal 
infirmary 
asked whether sabotage was suspected she replied we rule out 
nothing we simply cant 
mrs thatcher said she almost couldnt believe it when she 
heard about the crash so soon after a bomb blew apart pan am flight 
103 over the scottish town of lockerbie on dec 21 killing all 259 
people on board and 11 on the ground 
the rev ian paisley the hardline northern ireland protestant 
leader who comforted relatives of the injured on a special flight 
from belfast also said sabotage should not be ruled out 
it is very suspicious looking because this flight is used by 
servicemen he said 
while soldiers are a frequent target of irish guerrillas in 
northern ireland civilian airliners have never been known to be 
attacked 
authorities said 25 soldiers stationed in northern ireland were 
on the flight four died along with at least two northern ireland 
police officers 
investigators searched the wreckage and recovered the flight 
recorders monday investigators from boeing and general electric 
flew here to help in the inquiry 
passengers had just been served a light dinner when the plane got 
into trouble shortly after leaving londons heathrow airport 
gareth jones 38 said some women passengers wept as the pilot 
told them prepare for a crash landing 
as the plane started descending on one engine jones said sparks 
began flying from its remaining engine 
gilmore stevenson 45 told mrs thatcher that it was very 
very noisy ill never forget that noise we had the sensation of 
cartwheeling and i ended up hanging upsidedown in my seatbelt i 
was strung up like a turkey 
stevenson said he agonized in the dark over whether to release 
his seatbelt and risk being injured when he fell from his seat by 
the time he decided to free himself he hardly had the strength to 
lift his arm to the buckle 
i eventually managed to release the belt and i fell down it 
was only a matter of feet i just lay there in a heap 
stevenson said his wife vivienne helped other passengers escape 
and he was rescued by firefighters

the us supreme court on monday allowed 
criminal defendants to exclude potential jurors because of their 
race clearing the way for an allwhite jury in a case involving a 
black mans murder by ku klux klan members 
the court over two dissenting votes rejected arguments by 
alabama prosecutors supported by law enforcement officials 
nationwide that defense lawyers unlawfully are seeking to bar 
blacks from a jury in the klan case in mobile 
justices byron r white and anthony m kennedy voted to hear 
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review 
mobile county district attorney chris galanos said defense 
lawyers should have to follow the same legal guidelines as 
prosecutors in not removing potential jurors simply because of the 
color of their skin he also said its absurd for defense 
lawyers to argue that black jurors cannot be fair to white 
defendants 
but neil hanley a defense attorney in the klan case said the 
constitution prohibits governmental discrimination against 
defendants and he was not surprised by the courts action 
i can strike whomever i please from the jury based on whats 
in the best interest of my client hanley said ive never 
argued that blacks cannot give whites a fair trial 
assistant alabama attorney general ed carnes said monday that 
attorney general don siegelman instructed him to prepare legislation 
that would make it a matter of state law that defense attorneys 
could not discriminate on the basis of race 
carnes said the supreme court by declining to review the case 
left open the possibility that such a state law may yet pass muster 
if the issue reaches the high court again 
the matter before the high court was whether a 1986 supreme court 
ruling against racial discrimination in jury selection applies to 
defendants as well as prosecutors 
the court in 1986 ruled that prosecutors may not disqualify 
potential jurors based on their race 
the ruling which overturned a black mans conviction by an 
allwhite jury in kentucky established that the constitutions 
equalprotection guarantees bar racially motivated jury selection by 
prosecutors but the decision left unanswered whether the same 
guarantees apply when defense lawyers seek to mold the racial 
makeup of the jury 
mondays action involved the case of the march 21 1981 killing 
of michael donald 19 who was abducted from a mobile street beaten 
to death and his body hanged from a tree 
prosecutors said he was the random victim of a klan hunting party 
retaliating for a jurys inability to reach a verdict in the trial 
of a black man accused of murdering a white police officer 
two klan members were convicted in the slaying henry francis 
hays was convicted of murder and sentenced to death james tiger 
knowles pleaded guilty to a federal charge of violating donalds 
civil rights and was sentenced to life in prison 
mobile county prosecutors then charged hays father bennie jack 
hays and benjamin franklin cox with aiding and abetting the murder 
the elder hays and cox are former kkk members 
an allwhite jury had been impaneled the defense attorneys had 
disqualified all 16 blacks among 65 prospective jurors but bennie 
hays collapsed in court last february prompting a mistrial for both 
defendants 
before the retrial prosecutors appealed to the supreme court to 
test whether blacks may be excluded in a similar fashion again 
mobile county circuit judge michael e zoghby ruled last may that 
under the law as it now exists defendants do not have to give a 
reason for the exercise of their peremptory challenges the 
alabama supreme court refused to disturb the judges decision

an australian duo monday ended the debate 
over which college has the most persuasive students winning 
debatings most prestigious tournament for the university of sydney 
union for the second time 
the sydney team triumphed over the university of toronto and 114 
other pairs of word wizards to capture the 9th annual world 
universities debating championship at princeton university 
two us teams from yale university and the university of 
pennsylvania were eliminated in the semifinal round monday morning 
using a forceful debating style mixed with wit the sydney team 
was the clear crowd favorite as debaters warren lee and andrew bell 
argued that modern society reveres those who acquire wealth 
university of toronto team members justin macgregor and david 
conklin acting as the government in the british parliamentary 
style argument had the task of proving that it profits a man 
nothing to gain the world and lose his soul 
it was a good debate a confident lee said after the 
australian team finished its work the masses were laughing and 
hooting and screaming you always like to see that 
conklin admitted the subject was a tough one any value today 
involving some notion of justice or injustice is difficult to get 
across 
in the debate conklin argued that figures such as jesus gandhi 
and the rev martin luther king jr shunned the material world for 
larger social gains 
christ in his death was far more important than he would have 
been had he compromised his values conklin said 
the australian team however argued that todays society does 
not punish those who acquire wealth 
lets look at the real world lee said people dont say 
lets all join the peace corps and be nice guys 
macgregor scored a few points by saying justice was served in 
the movie wall street michael douglas did go to jail in the end 
before he won his academy award 
but it wasnt enough to overcome the australians contention 
that the people who get the stuff are not punished they get the 
wealth the repsect and the happiness 
earlier in the day the australian team defeated the team from 
yale university in the semifinals by opposing the concept that 
the emperor has no clothes 
the university of toronto advanced to the championship round by 
defeating the university of pennsylvania with a successful argument 
that the sky is not falling 
the debating championship held at princeton university for the 
second time in the tournaments nineyear history drew a record 232 
participants from 18 nations 
the debaters have delivered some spirited arguments during the 
weeklong tournament 
for exampled cheryl strauss of cornell university last week 
suggested that vegetables be the focal point of a new religion 
i think we should all pray to vegetables she said then we 
could all look down and that would make us feel good 
mark voyce a debater from the university of maryland had an 
offbeat response sunday when given the topic how to make sports 
more violent 
voyce said archery should include human targets 
who wants to shoot an arrow into a bunch of hay he said

the judge in the irancontra case directed 
attorney general dick thornburgh on monday to certify that national 
security concerns would prevent a fair public trial of the key 
charges against former white house aide oliver l north 
us district judge gerhard gesell said he would not grant 
independent counsel lawrence walshs motion to dismiss conspiracy 
and theft charges until the attorney general made clear in an 
affidavit that the decision against allowing certain classified 
information to be released during any trial was made by high reagan 
administration officials 
i have a question in my mind as to whether or not this is a 
motion that can only be made by the attorney general gesell said 
at a hearing 
walsh who met with thornburgh last wednesday and told him he was 
going to seek dismissal of the two central charges said i am 
quite sure i could get an affidavit from the attorney general 
gesell said he hopes to receive it by thursday 
justice department spokesman loye miller declined to comment on 
whether the attorney general would provide an affidavit but a 
department source speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
assumed the attorney general probably will submit one 
meanwhile walsh disclosed he plans to call former us rep 
michael barnes dmd and beer magnate joseph coors to testify 
against north their names were on a revised list of prosecution 
witnesses which have been reduced in number from 87 to 40 because 
of the plans to dismiss the conspiracy and theft charges coors and 
barnes werent on the original list 
coors after meeting with north in june 1985 provided a 65000 
donation to supply the contras with a maule aircraft and two months 
later barnes inquired about norths activities on behalf of the 
contras barnes received a response denying that the national 
security council staff had provided fundraising or military support 
to the contras 
north prepared the response according to two counts in the 
indictment of the former national security council aide charging him 
with obstruction of congress and making false statements barnes at 
the time was chairman of the house subcommittee on western 
hemisphere affairs 
also among the new names on the prosecutions witness list is 
william langton president of southern air transport a former cia 
proprietary that was involved in both supplying the contras and in 
the administrations secret arms sales to iran 
walsh disclosed at the hearing that he acted to dismiss the two 
counts last thursday after receiving letters in december from 
thornburgh and cia director william webster discussing the problem 
of disclosing classified information in the north case 
the dec 22 attorney generals letter actually was written by 
assistant attorney general edward sg dennis jr head of the 
criminal division and noted that heads of intelligence agencies had 
identified material that posed a substantial threat to national 
security and could not be disclosed at trial 
the decision represented the unanimous view of the intelligence 
community dennis wrote a copy of the letter was released at the 
justice department after gesells hearing 
prosecutors asked gesell dec 22 to reconsider his guidelines for 
presenting classified information in prosecution exhibits the 
judges refusal last tuesday to take that step triggered walshs 
trip to thornburghs office at the justice department where the 
indpendent counsel told the attorney general he would seek dismissal 
of the conspiracy and theft counts 
at the hearing walsh said his motion to dismiss was prompted by 
the irresolution of the conflict with intelligence agencies over 
releasing documents 
gesell said that under the classified information procedures act 
the attorney general should represent the executive branch in 
detailing problems that disclosing classified information would 
present 
the decision of whether or not to release them seems to me to 
be a high government responsibility and not a prosecutorial 
responsibility said gesell 
gesell said the affidavit detailing the governments position 
would be presented to the court under seal 
north is still confronted with felony charges that could carry 
prison terms totaling as much as 60 years if he were to be convicted 
on all counts 
these include obstructing various congressional and presidential 
inquiries into the irancontra affair by preparing false statements 
and destroying documents 
the head of the prosecution team john keker estimated it would 
take six to eight weeks to present the governments case while 
north lawyer brendan sullivan estimated the defense part of the case 
would take two to three months 
its going to be a wonderful summer gesell said

of a new years party involving a couple who simulated a sexual act 
inside a flying helicopter hovering outside the hotels windows the 
manager said monday 
israeli newspapers said the couple was having sex in the 
choppers open doorway and the daily yediot carried a photograph 
monday showing a woman and a man who appeared engaged in a sexual 
act in a helicopter 
but doron gilboa of the club hotel in the city of tiberias said 
the couple was in fact dressed and only simulated a sexual act 
they were wearing transparent clothes and only hugged kissed 
and fondled each other he said you cannot make love in the 
cold we had then and whats more inside a helicopter 
gilboa told the associated press the entire hotel was rented for 
a threeday private new year party he said an arrangement was made 
with a man who offered a helicopter for a laser show

strangulation and rape of a pregnant pathologist in her city 
hospital office the suspect sometimes lived at the hospital and 
masqueraded as an employee police said 
steven smith 23 was found by police at a shelter monday after 
three other homeless men came forward with the doctors personal 
property and said smith had given it to them police commissioner 
benjamin ward said 
smith was charged with murder robbery and rape in the death of 
dr kathryn hinnant 33 ward said 
the city had offered a 30000 reward for information about the 
slaying which mayor edward i koch called the no 1 case to be 
solved 
ms hinnants body was found early sunday by her husband and a 
hospital administrator the pathologist was five months pregnant and 
the medical examiner determined that her death was due to 
strangulation 
ward said smith allegedly gave ms hinnants mink jacket to 
another man to sell ward said police said the doctor was robbed of 
a wristwatch 50 to 75 and the coat 
smith told investigators that he and another man named john had 
gone to the fourth floor of bellevue hospital and attacked ms 
hinnant ward said however the commissioner said smith put the 
onus of the attack on john including the rape 
we have not even confirmed that this person lived other than in 
the mind of steven smith ward said 
investigators also found bloodstained hospital garments in a 
garbage container near the wards island mens shelter where they 
found smith ward said

bed on the 22nd floor and would wander through the hospital without 
problems while wearing a stethoscope and hospital garb ward said 
chief of detectives robert colangelo went to the floor a 
maintenance and machinery area and confirmed that there was a 
lone dirty bed empty beer cans and a stethoscope the 
commissioner said

normal behavior when he is at the hospital is to steal ids and 
eat at the hospital cafeteria 
ms hinnant who had been working at the hospital on her day off 
to prepare a lecture she was to deliver monday was remembered 
fondly by colleagues 
hinnant came in on saturday because she was always looking for 
this extra mile and that extra piece of excellence she could give 
said dr john pearson director of pathology at the hospital 
about 50 detectives were assigned to the case as a debate over 
bellevue security raged 
security here isnt the tightest it seems like anyone can walk 
in said an intern dr jane skorina but she said the attack was 
an isolated incident and doesnt affect what may happen in the 
future 
a social worker supervisor who asked for anonymity said that 
when she once came in on a saturday she found it quite 
frightening i felt quite vulnerable there are no people around 
even the elevators are lonely 
dr jo ivey boufford president of the health and hospitals 
corp said security at the 1200bed hospital complex would be 
reviewed but an initial check found nothing out of the ordinary at 
the time of the murder

costa rica announced on monday the 
indefinite postponement of a central american summit scheduled for 
jan 1516 to discuss a regional peace plan 
there definitely will not be a meeting of presidents foreign 
minister rodrigo madrigal nieto told a news conference in san jose 
the capital he said three of the five presidents involved the 
presidents of honduras el salvador and costa rica had agreed to 
the suspension 
the other two countries are nicaragua and guatemala 
the new date will be negotiated adjusting the agendas of the 
presidents and of the foreign ministers madrigal nieto said 
he said the summit may take place in february foreign ministers 
of the five governments will meet in the nicaraguan capital of 
managua jan 1718 he said 
nicaragua said the summit should be held as scheduled rather than 
delayed as costa rican president oscar arias suggested 
but foreign minister ricardo acevedo of el salvador said 
president jose napoleon duarte believed it could be held on schedule 
only if presidents of all five countries agreed 
on friday arias suggested postponing the meeting to give 
presidentelect george bush time to formulate a central american 
policy bush takes office jan 20 
madrigal nieto denied that postponement could jeopardize the 
central american peace plan authored by arias and signed by the five 
presidents in guatemala city in august 1987 
the plan which won the 1987 nobel peace prize for arias calls 
for greater democracy an end to civil wars political amnesties and 
an end to the use of one country by rebels fighting in another 
the pln has been stalled since the presidents last met in january 
1988 in costa rica 
what we want is not to hold up esquipulas ii but to so 
organize it that it can give better results than achieved so far 
madrigal nieto said 
he was referring to the name commonly used for the peace plan 
arising from the guatemalan town where a key early peace meeting 
was held 
he said the original decision to hold a summit on jan 1516 was 
taken in a moment of euphoria as if central america didnt have 
conflicts or obstacles that could intervene in achieving better 
results 
madrigal nieto said committees set up to monitor compliance with 
the peace plan would have been unable to overcome differences among 
the governments before the original summit date 
in managua president daniel ortega of nicaragua telephoned arias 
on sunday to express his concern about the postponement 
ortegas press office said monday 
ortega said last week that postponing the meeting could mean 
the death of the central american peace plan 
a costa rican foreign ministry official called ortegas statement 
out of line 
ortega insisted late monday that the summit was not postponed he 
said on staterun nicaraguan radio that any move to delay the 
meeting will be through a definite decision made by us all the 
central american presidents 
but he added in case the meeting isnt held then it must be 
held as soon as possible 
ortega also said deputy foreign ministers from the five 
governments would meet on tuesday in managua the nicaraguan 
capital to work out a summit agenda 
guatemala also has said it opposed delaying the meeting 
honduras has not commented president jose azcona hoyo traveled 
to washington on monday and will meet tuesday with president reagan 
and bush 
acevedo said jan 2930 or feb 20 were being considered as 
alternate dates 
a technical preparatory meeting should be held as scheduled on 
tuesday and a foreign ministers meeting could be scheduled for jan 
1718 he said

the chairman of the national mediation board halted 
talks monday between troubled eastern airlines and its largest union 
chairman walter wallace returned to washington and couldnt be 
reached immediately for comment but an eastern executive said 
wallace gave as his reason the failure of efforts to keep secret the 
talks with the machinists union 
wallace arrived friday for the talks in key largo the sessions 
were aimed at ending a contract stalemate that has clouded the 
future of the airline a subsidiary of houstonbased texas air corp 
machinists district 100 president charles e bryan accused 
eastern of sabotaging the mediation by releasing statements on the 
talks to employees in what he called a violation of a news blackout 
on the sessions he also alleged eastern failed to bargain in good 
faith 
bryan called the airlines actions unethical without 
principle deceptive he said the company was determined to 
force a strike 
eastern spokesman robin matell said miami television stations 
discovered the location of the talks and began covering them friday 
matell said the daily employee bulletins which were obtained by 
reporters were not a violation of the news blackout 
bill gill assistant executive director of the mediation board 
said he did not know all the reasons behind wallaces decision and 
declined to comment harry bickford another federal mediator at the 
talks also declined to comment 
citing huge losses and high operating costs eastern is seeking 
major wage cuts from the union the 8500 mechanics baggage 
handlers and other ground service workers comprise more than 
onefourth of easterns payroll 
the end of talks is certainly a major disappointment with 
serious implications about easterns future said joseph b 
leonard easterns executive vice president and chief operating 
officer 
these talks have dragged on for more than 15 months draining 
easterns strength with each passing day we desperately need the 
government to provide a process to resolve this dispute within 30 
days he said 
eastern spokesman robin matell said miami television stations had 
discovered the location of the talks and began covering them friday 
matell said employee bulletins about the talks that were put out 
daily by eastern and were obtained by reporters werent a 
violation of the blackout on information about the talks 
charles e bryan president of district 100 of the machinists 
union declined comment until a news conference scheduled later 
monday 
eastern has been pressing for a federal declaration of an impasse 
in the negotiations which would begin a 30day coolingoff period 
after that the union could strike and the company could impose its 
own work conditions on the union members 
the union has claimed that eastern wants to provoke a strike so 
it can try to break it and bust the union 
wallace joined mediator harry bickford on friday in an effort to 
get the talks moving but sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said there was virtually no progress 
the two sides who last met in intense mediation in july have 
been about 200 million apart the machinists were seeking a 50 
million raise while eastern was seeking 150 million in 
concessions mostly from the nonmechanics represented by the union 
eastern reported 2337 million in losses for the first three 
quarters of 1988 texas air corp also owns nonunion continental 
airlines

scores of makeshift tents blew in the 
chilly wind monday alongside piles of garbage and donated clothing 
but few homeless central americans remained at the crude camp that 
moved a federal judge to put an immigration policy on hold 
facing eviction from their shantytown hundreds of aliens who had 
set up camp in brownsville left their tents for shelter in nearby 
churches or for other cities 
the camp had mushroomed in the wake of a dec 16 policy change by 
the immigration and naturalization service which required the 
aliens to stay in south texas while they applied for political 
asylum 
but the exodus began even before us district judge filemon vela 
issued a temporary restraining order monday against the ins 
allowing the asylumseekers once again to leave south texas 
many started looking for places to go sunday after the campsite 
property owner posted no trespassing signs and the cameron 
county sheriff ordered everyone off the property within 24 hours on 
monday the deadline was extended another day 
if i just go out there and put them on the street its going 
to place a bigger burden on everybody said sheriff alex perez 
but most of the aliens already had found other shelter from 
weather that turned cold and rainy many stayed in churches 
as the north wind picked up speed and drizzle continued monday 
afternoon only a few stragglers remained at the trashcovered lot 
by late monday only about 50 campers remained in their leanto 
shelters and many said they did not plan to stay the night 
area residents however continued to bring food and clothing 
these are my brothers and sisters in christ and this is what i 
have to do said mary mortimore 68 of plankinton sd who with 
her husband made one of many deliveries of clothing i cant 
believe the devastation here 
so much clothing was donated that piles of unused shirts pants 
coats and shoes were scattered over the campsite those who left 
could not carry it all with them 
other people brought hot food 
if we dont feed them who will asked fidela gomez 55 of 
brownsville who fed egg and potato tacos and coffee to a long line 
of central americans sunday night god doesnt make exceptions 
between people were all equal in his eyes 
im thankful to the people of brownsville said eliseo 
enriquez 30 a honduran who spent two weeks in the camp he and 
eight relatives said monday they were heading for houston where 
they have family members to help them 
life has been difficult in the shantytown 
some people lived under sheets of clear plastic held up by tree 
limbs while others stayed in real tents the most majestic 
structure on the site is a 15by15foot house of wood cardboard 
and tar paper built by 15 nicaraguans and equipped with separate 
rooms for men and women 
you want to buy it asked vidal sanchez 38 a nicaraguan who 
had stayed there but chose to leave he was heading for a nearby 
mennonite church iglesia menonita del cordero which opened its

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze will visit iran in the near future tehran radio 
reported monday 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said shevardnadze confirmed 
his visit in a meeting with his iranian counterpart ali akbar 
velayati in paris the site of this weeks international conference 
on chemical weapons 
at this time the ground has been laid for expanding relations 
between tehran and moscow the iranian radio quoted shevardnadze 
as saying 
ties between the two countries have improved following irans 
acceptance of a unmediated ceasefire in the 8year war with 
iraq which went into effect aug 20 
the change followed nearly a decade of strain after irans 1979 
revolution with iranian fundamentalist islamic leaders viewing the 
officially athiest soviet union with deep suspicion 
but the tehran daily etelaat said in an editorial monday that the 
soviet union seems to be turning away from absolute atheism and 
authorizing religious practice 
the editorial in what could be interpreted as a comparison 
between the soviet union and the united states known in iran as 
the great satan said 
godlessness undisguised is one thing and godlessness under the 
guise of religion is quite another a hypocritical believer is 
worse than a truly godless person

unduly concerned but some of the passengers only had to look out 
their window at a flaming engine to know something was very wrong 
a short time later the british midland airways boeing 737 hit 
the ground in what one passenger said was a shuddering crash 
like a massive motorcar accident 
the plane was less than 15 minutes into a londonbelfast flight 
sunday when dr john mccrea looked out of the window and saw 
flames and flashes coming out of the engine 
minutes later veteran pilot kevin hunt told passengers to 
prepare for an emergency landing at east midlands airport in central 
england the jet crashed short of the runway 
mccrea and his wife josephine were returning to their belfast 
home sunday night from a trip to london 
we had been on the plane for 10 or 12 minutes and they were 
serving light meals mccrea said monday from his bed in derby 
royal infirmary his right arm in a sling 
i felt a shudder and i looked over at the left wing he said 
and the cabin crew stopped the meal service 
the pilot announced that we were not to be unduly concerned 
but i began to wonder what was happening said mccrea 38 two 
girls started to scream and there were more more flames in the 
sky 
we went on flying for a further five minutes he said the 
plane seemed to drop we lost height 
soon he could see lights on the highway below 
we carried on two or three minutes and there were more flashes 
over the left side of the plane he said the cabin staff were 
moving up and down securing all the baggage in the lockers 
mccrea read the safety instructions and told his wife to brace 
herself i said it could be bumpy we carried on flying there 
were more flashes and more of what i thought was turbulence 
not long afterward the captain came on the public address and 
told us to prepare for an emergency landing it seemed like only 
five seconds later we were down 
passenger gareth jones said women wept after the pilots warning 
as the plane started its descent jones said he saw sparks fly 
from one engine as he had earlier in the flight the impact was 
like a shuddering crash it was like a massive motorcar 
accident crunch blackness 
jones a 38yearold government employee who suffered bad 
bruises said he held the hand of the distraught woman next to him 
during the rapid descent 
the lady next to me was obviously very distressed when the 
first engine went she started crying and held my hand i tried to 
joke about how these things could fly on one engine and glide 
down he said 
then the second engine went and she gripped my hand and i said 
there was no way we were not getting out of that plane together 
jones said i knew if i showed i had any fear she would have been 
worse 
when we hit the ground there was a massive crash like a 
multiple car accident and because we were right next to the 
emergency hatch i could see a tree outside and knew we had hit the 
ground and must get out jones later was quoted as saying by the 
times of london newspaper in its tuesday issue 
i pulled the emergency exit handle and pulled out the lady next 
to me i saw we were standing on the motorway and got to my feet 
but they immediately gave way and i fell down again he said 
he gave no further details in the interview about what happened 
to the woman after they left the plane 
nick stevenson who suffered a broken leg said that when the 
first engine failed the plane started losing altitude 
then the other engine started producing strange noises as 
we came in on the approach run it started spluttering and then just 
stopped and we knew we were going to hit the deck he said 
mccrea said that when the plane crashed people were moaning 
and someone said my legs hurt another voice said please help 
me 
he said the man sitting next to him helped pull his wife from the 
wreckage 
it seemed only a minute later and someone was crashing the 
windows in over the wing i think i was the third person off the 
plane 
firefighters doused the plane with foam my suit was soaked and 
it was slippery underfoot said mccrea 
mrs mccrea 38 who suffered hip and leg injuries said she 
prayed as the plane fell 
there wasnt time really to panic or worry about it she 
said the pilot told us to prepare for a crashlanding thats 
what we did 
asked if she feared she was going to die she replied i just 
said my prayers and got on with it there was nothing else to do 
at nearby leicester royal infirmary alistair mccrory 43 of 
downpatrick county down said that after his narrow escape he

a judge on monday blocked a new 
government immigration policy blamed for forcing hundreds of 
homeless central americans in south texas to live in primitive camps 
and condemned buildings 
us district judge filemon velas temporary restraining order 
restores a previous immigration and naturalization service policy 
that allows asylum seekers in south texas to travel to other us 
destinations after checking in with the ins 
hundreds of the asylumseekers have camped out in cameron county 
texas southernmost county since the ins adopted a policy dec 16 
that all but prevented them from leaving the area while their 
applications for political asylum were processed 
one would have to be blind not to recognize that we have a 
problem vela said in putting the ins policy on hold 
the temporary restraining order was sought in a lawsuit filed 
against the ins on friday by refugee advocates 
everybody is euphoric about the good news said vidal 
sanchez 38 of nicaragua who has lived for more than two weeks in 
a primitive camp near brownsville with more than 300 other central 
americans awaiting appointments with the ins 
sanchez said he planned to leave for miami by wednesday 
he and other campers many staying under tents fashioned from 
tree limbs and discarded sheets of plastic were told sunday they 
would have to vacate the land after the property owner posted no 
trespassing signs 
the campsites population continued to drop monday as the 
immigrants complied with a sheriffs order to leave or face 
trespassing charges the aliens have been offered shelter in several 
nearby churches 
by late monday only about 50 central americans were living in 
the camp and many said they did not plan to spend the night 
the shantytown is across the street from the catholic 
churchoperated casa oscar romero shelter for central americans 
which for months has been filled to its courtordered maximum 
occupancy of 200 
us rep solomon ortiz dtexas announced monday that he had 
obtained assurances of immediate federal assistance for cameron 
county in providing food and shelter for the influx of central 
americans 
ortiz said he and a team from the justice departments community 
relations service would tour the county and make recommendations for 
immediate action 
ortiz said the ideal situation would be to make use of existing 
space in federal buildings 
velas temporary restraining order will be in effect until 
thursday when the judge scheduled a hearing to decide whether to 
issue an indefinite preliminary injunction against the new ins 
procedure 
vern jervis an ins spokesman in washington said the agency will 
contest the restraining order 
the ins policy which applies to any district where aliens apply 
for asylum was defended monday by attorney david ayala 
your honor the immigration service is not to blame for the 
plight of the people who are out there ayala told the judge 
jervis said the new procedure was designed to curb abuses of the 
asylum process that created backlogs of thousands of cases in some 
cities more than 30000 asylumseekers passed through the ins 
harlingen district at the southern tip of texas last year 
most asylum applicants do not qualify for refugee status jervis 
said because they are here for economic not political reasons 
under the dec 16 policy ins officials were telling applicants 
they could not travel from the area or work while awaiting a 
decision on their asylum status a period of at least 30 days 
after velas order the victorious immigration attorneys went to 
tell the aliens of their changed status 
were going to advise people that they do not have to live here 
in the rio grande valley in the rain and the cold and vacant lots 
that they can now be with their family with their friends and they 
can pursue their asylum claims in those destination cities said 
mark schneider an attorney with proyecto libertad a cocounsel to 
the lawsuit 
its marvelous said maria isabel fernandez 28 of honduras 
who has camped for two weeks near casa romero what else could we 
ask for 
she and eight relatives said they planned to travel to houston 
where they have family 
sister juliana garcia director of casa romero said many people 
at the shelter started preparing to travel as soon as they heard 
about the court order 
i think it will alleviate the situation for a lot of people 
sister juliana said people are already making a big line to fix 
their papers and leave 
the lawsuit against ins commissioner alan nelson and us 
attorney general richard thornburgh was filed by brownsville 
immigration attorney linda reyna yanez robert rubin of the san 
francisco lawyers committee for urban affairs and the 
harlingenbased proyecto libertad immigrant legal advocacy office 
it accuses the ins of implementing a policy change without 
publishing it in the federal register for public comment and of 
depriving asylumseekers of their rights to representation and 
access to the asylum process as required by us law under the 
refugee act of 1980

from morganna the chesty mediawise kissing bandit who frequents 
major sports events to buss and tell

stars im not a jock but i do wear one 
sajak said he didnt get much sleep because he had a weird dream 
that time magazine had named earth as planet of the year 
i dreamed the earth was disqualified because it was the home of 
morton downey jr he said 
sajak introduced his bandleader tom scott and sidekick dan 
miller a former colleague he worked with in nashville 
sajaks desk was before an open window with a set backdrop of the 
los angeles skyline 
sajak asked miller if he knew what his job was and miller said 
yes its to move three feet over on the couch each time a new 
guest comes out 
the first guest chevy chase turned to miller and said ed 
good to see you a reference to carson sidekick ed mcmahon 
other scheduled guests were joan van ark michael gross and the 
judds 
earlier letterman called sajak an occasional guest on his new 
yorkbased show to offer congratulations and wish him good luck 
bob burton a spokesman for sajak said 
burton said sajak had also heard from carson but he did not know 
if the host of nbcs the tonight show had called personally 
regular substitute host jay leno was filling in for carson who has 
bested more than a score of competitors since becoming host of 
tonight in 1962 
thicke of the night a syndicated series starring alan thicke 
in 1983 was ballyhooed as a show that would take carson down a 
notch or two it lasted less than a year 
the late show starring joan rivers was a personal rivalry 
that inspired bitterness on both sides carson said he was offended 
that rivers who had been permanent substitute host of the tonight 
show had not told him in advance she was leaving to become host 
of the fox broadcasting show in 1986 she left the show after about 
six months because of poor ratings and the show expired several

rivalry against carson 
sajak a former tv weatherman best known as host of wheel of 
fortune said he does not see his new show taking on carson 
directly 
we have great respect for johnny but we dont plan our show

realistic expectations they dont think we have to knock somebody 
off to be a success actually johnnys been very gracious to me he 
once asked me to be a guest host

syndicated the arsenio hall show hall became a permanent host

charged in the slaying of georges besse president of the 
stateowned renault auto company 
besse was shot to death outside his paris apartment on nov 17 
1986 
nathalie menigon 31 and joelle aubron 28 of the group direct 
action are charged with murder jeanmarc rouillan 33 and georges 
cipriani 38 are charged with complicity

sevenjudge panel they refused to stand as the judges entered the 
courtroom where besses widow and her five children sat with new 
renault chief raymond levy 
they face maximum terms of life in prison if convicted 
on feb 11 1987 direct action claimed responsibility for the 
murder in letters sent to news organizations in paris the letters 
said the killing resulted from a world clash between the 
international proletariat and the imperialist bourgeoisie

attempted murder of two policemen in 1983

disinformation campaign to neutralize their political 
personalities the trial they said was not only about facts 
but what motivated the facts 
direct action first drew attention in 1979 by bombings such 
targets as interpol immigration and labor offices and corporate 
headquarters

emperor hirohitos regret over his role in 
world war ii made him feel unworthy as a father a former tutor of 
his son and successor emperor akihito said monday 
elizabeth gray vining said from her home in suburban kennett 
square pa the topic came up during one of two hourlong 
conversations she had about akihitos education with the emperor and 
empress nagako during the four years she taught english to the 
prince 
she said hirohito at the time saw his son only on weekends and 
not necessarily every weekend 
i spoke very frankly said mrs vining 86 an author of 25 
books i said i thought that the crown prince was very devoted to 
his father and that he wanted to see his father more often 
hirohito then said that he hadnt felt worthy because he hadnt 
been able to prevent the war she said 
hirohito 87 died of intestinal cancer friday without ever 
shedding much light on his role during world war ii historians 
generally agree he was a figurehead who was required to approve 
decisions of the military leaders until he decided the japanese had 
suffered enough and personally announced surrender in august 1945 
mrs vining said she did not know whether hirohito spent more 
time with his son after her conversation with him early in 1949 
mrs vining who had worked with the philadelphiabased quaker 
peace organization the american friends service committee became 
akihitos tutor in october 1946 when the crown prince was nearly 13 
and continued in that role until december 1950 
the american friends service committee nominated her for the job 
and several factors led to her selection she said 
the fact that i was a widow that i had known sorrow was 
important to the decision she said and the fact that i had 
traveled in europe and the fact that i was a quaker and quakers are 
known to stand for peace her husband had died in an automobile 
accident 
mrs vining has been back to japan four times since her years as 
akihitos tutor she saw akihito and his wife michiko most 
recently during the couples visit last year to the united states 
i think he wont be a copy of his father mrs vining said 
hell be his own man for one thing hes been in england hes 
met the royal family there 
from that experience he has an understanding of how a 
constitutional monarchy works she said

engines on the boeing 737 that crashed in england 
killing at least 43 people had parts that were not properly tested 
said a lawyer who sued the engines maker four months ago 
but a spokesman for general electric co which manufactures the 
engine in a consortium with the french company snecma said engines 
on the plane had checked out as normal 
attorney jim helmer of cincinnati in a telephone interview with 
the associated press identified the allegedly faulty parts as timer 
valves he said he didnt know if the parts could have caused sunday 
nights crash 
we have verified that the cfm56 engines did have timer valves 
on them that were produced in seattle and that the timer valves 
were not produced according to specifications helmer said 
a ge spokesman in cincinnati disputed whether there were any 
faulty parts that could have caused the crash 
weve gone back and looked at the records of both engines on 
the british midland plane and the engines under tests performed 
normally said dwight weber 
this included the aircraft flight acceptance tests at no time 
during these tests did any of these engines display any 
characteristics that would indicate malfunction of timer assembly 
he said 
also in a malfunction of a timer assembly the most extreme 
result would be an increase of temperature of the engine exhaust gas 
temperature of up to 20 degrees centigrade thats well within the 
operating limits of the engines in question weber said 
helmers suit was filed in september in us district court in 
cincinnati but was not unsealed until friday it alleges violations 
of the false claims act and was aimed primarily at military 
aircraft helmer said 
the suit alleged that general electrics airplane engine facility 
in seattle failed to properly test parts until sometime in 1987 when 
the testimg program was corrected 
helmer told the associated press the parts were also used in the 
type of engine installed in boeing 737s 
boeing commercial airplanes spokesman jack gamble declined to 
comment on the engine parts 
the 737400 model involved in the crash had been delivered to 
british midland airways 12 weeks ago it had 500 hours of service 
helmer is representing anthony divincenzo a former plant manger 
at general electrics aircraft division facility in seattle 
the false claims act allows citizens to sue defense contractors 
when contractors receive payments pursuant to falsified standards 
divencenzo maintains through helmers suit that general electric 
was required to do certain tests on these parts and that they did 
not do the tests or did not do them completely but still certified 
they had done the test 
helmer said the parts were timer valves he said he didnt know 
what function the parts served but that they were made only at 
general electrics seattle facility 
we just know they havent been tested properly helmer said

delegates from 16 arab countries at the 150nation conference 
argued meanwhile that a total chemical ban would be discriminatory

entering college freshmen are getting less aid 
from the federal government and are increasingly interested in 
making their educations pay off in cold cash according to a survey 
of more than 300000 students 
the annual survey nonetheless found that students entering 
college in 1988 were more likely than their 1987 counterparts to 
want to pursue graduate study despite the financial obstacles and 
although students are more interested in making money they seem 
less interested in business careers as a means of reaching that 
goal the survey said 
the findings released sunday by the american council on education 
and the higher education research institute at the university of 
california at los angeles are based on questionnaires filled out by 
308007 freshmen entering 585 twoand fouryear colleges and 
universities the results were adjusted to reflect the total 
population of 164 million firsttime fulltime entering students 
and have a margin of error of plus or minus two points

the recent discovery of a black widow binary a 
star that destroys its orbiting companion like the spider that eats 
its mate may provide a missing link in the evolution of the 
heavens astronomers said monday 
the object is a rapidly spinning binary pulsar a dead collapsed 
star that is orbited by a larger ordinary star 
astronomers have discovered that the pulsar is blasting away its 
companion in the last phase of an intricate give and take between 
the two distant orbs 
the companion is being destroyed said frederic a rasio of 
cornell university it is constantly losing matter eventually it 
could completely disappear 
astronomers say it appears that the pulsar uses its companion to 
build up tremendous spinning speed then turns on its mate burning

nation is another question which the constitution says congress 
would decide royalists tend to favor a descendant of pedro ii the 
last king who was deposed by the military in 1889 
their campaign already is afoot 
monarchy is the cheapest most modern and most democratic form 
of government rep cunha bueno author of the constitutional 
clause told about 150 people at the first meeting of the 
constitutional monarchic movement 
monarchy defends the people against their own government the 
most advanced nations in the world have it said bueno who is 38 
and a fiveterm congressman of the rightist social democratic party 
he named japan sweden denmark the netherlands norway britain 
and belgium 
applause filled the salon in one of rios old establishment 
hotels a room of chandeliers and crimson drapes with none of the 
glitz of tourism 
most of those attending were elderly there were men with canes 
dressed in the style of plantation days a few were young including 
a woman in a striped blouse who had a motorcycle helmet tucked under 
an arm 
brazil became independent as a monarchy the only latin american 
nation to do so it happened in 1822 when the man who became emperor 
pedro i rebelled against his father king joao vi of portugal 
after the abdication of pedro i his son pedro ii reigned for 
nearly 50 years until military officers overthrew him 100 years ago 
and proclaimed a republic 
in an interview the monarchist bueno said the socalled 
republic was actually a military coup shoved down the peoples 
throats now finally the people will be able to say what kind 
of government they want 
his constitutional provision calls for free time on radio and 
television stations most of which are privately owned to get the 
message across before the referendum 
the monarchic movement points out that relatively few presidents 
have served their full terms in brazil and repressive military 
dictatorships ruled in 19301945 and 19641985 
leaders of the movement credit the monarchy with preventing 
brazil from being broken up into small factionridden countries 
their view of the part of latin america colonized by spain 
on the other side are such as marcello alencar rios newly 
elected mayor of the socialistoriented democratic labor party 
he told an interviewer monarchism is a joke brazil has no 
tradition or political structure along those lines forget it 
comments like that do not faze bueno we know we are up against 
a lot of prejudice he said but once the people understand what 
monarchy is we will win 
caio domingues head of a large advertising agency working with 
the promonarchy campaign said brazil must rethink its form of 
government the one we have now evidently hasnt worked 
domingues cited current annual inflation of more than 1000 
percent and brazils 121 billion foreign debt largest in the third 
world he wore a golden royal crown pin in his lapel 
ovidio da cunha declared at the monarchy meeting brazil is 
rotten he observed that federal congressmen have raised their own 
pay to the equivalent of about 150000 a year while the minimum 
wage set by the government remains at less than 3 a day 
da cunha 76 is still active as a sociology professor at 
fluminense federal university in suburban rio he said a king would 
be like a referee in a soccer game or like a circuit breaker that 
shuts off the electricity before the house catches fire 
bueno said most royalists want a descendant of pedro ii as king 
of brazils 144 million people who inhabit an area larger than the 
48 contiguous united states 
theres a potential hitch in that however two heirs the 
emperors greatgrandson pedro gastao de orleans e braganca and luiz 
orleans e braganca greatgrandson of pedro iis daughter princess 
isabel claim to be the true pretender to the throne 
pedro gastao 75 said he would be willing to explain the 
advantages of monarchy on television he lives in the former 
imperial summer retreat of petropolis founded by and named for his 
royal ancestor in the mountains 40 miles north of rio 
domingues the advertising man said we are not going to get 
involved in names the situation is very complicated what were 
interested in is the principle of monarchy

in the same year that george bush and michael 
dukakis crisscrossed the united states searching for votes andrew 
mccarthy headed for the heartland 
i had never been to america before just new york and la 
said the actor who spent extensive time in the midwest while 
filming kansas and fresh horses 
neither film was a boxoffice hit for mccarthy who has appeared 
in st elmos fire pretty in pink and mannequin but he 
enjoyed the chance to work in new environments 
kansas which also starred matt dillon was filmed in 
lawrence and surrounding areas 
we had a ball mccarthy said in a recent interview i found 
the people there really neat we were big fish in a small pond 
in fresh horses filmed in cincinnati mccarthy plays a 
college student who breaks up with his fiancee after meeting a poor 
country girl molly ringwald 
it was cold he said of the location work theres the 
whole starkness up there it helped the mood of the movie 
nothing could have prepared mccarthy a theater major at new york 
university for the quickness of his entry into the movie business 
back in 1983 he was just another student at nyu when he decided to 
answer an open call in the newspaper for a part in class 
which starred jacqueline bisset 
i waited for hours with 500 other kids and they called me 
back mccarthy recalled it was so out of the blue one week i 
was in school and the next week im in bed with jacqueline bisset i 
thought im doing something right here i was going so fast i 
didnt have time to think about it 
bisset gave him a lot of professional help 
she was great she could have said who is this punk and 
taken advantage of me she was amazingly patient and considerate to 
me she and the director would say thats the camera andrew 
he recalled 
mccarthys first major success came in 1985 with st elmos 
fire which also featured rob lowe judd nelson emilio estevez 
ally sheedy and demi moore 
st elmos fire a smash hit despite scathing reviews was a 
mixed blessing for mccarthy he was unquestionably popular at the 
box office but his image suffered from being grouped with other 
young actors whose talents were questionable and who were known as 
arrogant and pretentious brat packers they were called 
i never really tried to take it that seriously mccarthy 
said i havent talked to any of them since i worked with them if 
people want labels it makes it easier to identify someone i dont 
really care it doesnt mean anything to me 
but he was concerned about being cast in parts designed to bring 
teenagers into the theaters 
its such a trap because they keep sending you the same movies 
and then you say ill do just one more and youre letting them 
control your life 
so in 1986 mccarthy was happy to have the chance to appear with 
linda hunt and linda bassett in the american playhouse production of 
waiting for the moon based on the lives of gertrude stein and 
alice b toklas 
i was doing mannequin when i got the script and i thought it 
was a wonderful little story i also wanted to work with linda hunt 
it was a nice little project he said 
despite his success mccarthy is not immune from getting cold 
feet last minute doubts about whether he is capable of playing a 
particular role he recalled having those feelings while making 
weekend at bernies a comedy to be released later in 1989 
i was torturing myself saying i cant do this im not 
funny my friend said youre such a jerk you were like this when 
you were about to do fresh horses you were like this with all of 
them 
but mccarthy isnt likely to give up this little ritual 
i think its good for you to ask what the hell am i doing 
here theyre paying me a lot of money and i dont know what im 
doing thats part of the fun in a sick little way 
and if his popularity does fade mccarthy can always count on the 
support of his friends in middle america 
i got a letter the other day from the locke family in 
minnesota he said they write me letters every month they have 
a birthday cake for me and im invited for thanksgiving

jerry jeff walker walked onto the small 
stage at gruene hall slung the exotic reptile skin strap of his 
martin guitar over his shoulder and signaled to the band he was 
ready to start 
to the resounding applause of 600 people at the rustic 
woodfloor honkytonk he picked and crooned one country tune after 
another talking to the crowd in between instrumental solos as if he 
were talking to old friends 
at the chorus of one tune the 46yearold walker reminded his 
audience he had matured just a bit he was once regarded as a hard 
drinking cussing rebel both on and off the stage who couldnt care 
less for the business end of his career 
were just here to play a little music not watch me throw up 
ive already done that before he said to earpiercing 
hoots and hollers in the 110yearold dance hall where burlap sacks 
hung from the rafters and newspaper ads adorned the walls 
the recent performance was another success it also was an 
inspiration for walker who recorded his first album in three years 
and his first live one in 10 years at the hall 
ive been playing here for years and weve had fun here 
walker said in an interview i usually record live anyway in the 
studio and i got some songs that i wanted some people to sing along 
on and i wanted to get the audience to join in 
were living in a very hightech era with mechanical drums and 
other things i thought it would be fun to make a live album with 
just regular ol musicians playing music 
during his two decades in the music business walker has played 
to thousands at concert halls and to a few fans and friends at dimly 
lighted bars in the middle of nowhere 
gruene pronounced green is about a third of the way to 
austin where walker lives with his wife and two children 
walker who recorded the live viva terlingua album in the 
onceunknown hill country hamlet of luckenbach believes gruenes 
smalltown flavor was just right for him and his fans for the new 
album 
its more of a treat for people to come here they can put on 
their levis come out in their pickup truck bring along some beer 
and come out and be heard he said 
the oneonta ny native wrote such songs as drifting way of 
life gypsy songman hill country rain and cadillac 
cowboy 
but he is best known for mr bojangles a song about a 
raggedy old man who danced a soft shoe for money walker wrote the 
tune during his wild days in 1968 but it remains popular and has 
been recorded by such artists as nina simone 
i still think its part of everything walker said i think 
people in show business have identified with that song and thats 
whats kept it around 
time and a family have changed walker some but the rebel is 
still within him he has shed his reputation as a boozer who played 
drunk at recordings and concerts he has an occasional beer or two 
but he spends most of his time writing songs jogging and playing 
golf 
gone too from walkers life are the entourages that followed 
him around the country hes a solo act now but in austin he knows 
he easily can get together a few musicians to play anytime he wants 
as was the case with the live album but the independent soul within 
him refuses to let others dictate how he should write play or 
market his music 
hes using his own money for the album and it will be released on 
his tried and true label susan walker 40 his wife of 14 years who 
also serves as his business manager and president of an official fan 
club is working out a distribution deal 
i think ive shown other song writers or singers that its ok 
to be a little bit out of what the mainstream is at the time 
walker said 
im just a happygoluckykind of a guy that just traveled with 
a guitar played music and never did mind sleeping in the rain he 
said adding that given another chance he would do it all the same 
im a character who lives in the song i can write about my 
life i can get to sing my memories every night and thats pretty 
fortunate im pretty happy with my life i played the music i 
wanted to play and the people that liked it liked it and those who 
didnt well theyre probably better off anyway 
though walkers attitude about fans has at times been perceived 
as flippant he and his wife insist he does care 
i think its great the fans stayed there and i think my wife 
susan getting involved in the business end of my thing has really 
helped my fans and me keep in touch with ourselves he said 
among those fans is chris wall a 38yearold wilsall mont 
singersongwriter who relocated to austin to open up shows for 
walker and to be managed by susan walker 
walker planned to record at least two of walls songs on the new 
album including trashy women and i feel like hanks williams 
tonight 
i liked jerry jeff because of the caliber of songs he was 
singing back in the mid70s wall said he was that rebel 
outlaw kind of guy and i think thats what i really liked about him 
hes not what i expected now hes pretty mellow and were 
pretty good friends i wonder what he would have been like back then 
and i wonder if i would have even been around with him back then 
wall who hopes walker can popularize his songs believes walker 
will be able to revitalize himself with the new album 
this is important to the fans and they all want to be part of 
history just like viva terlingua in luckenbach wall said 
not that he needs it or maybe not even want it but this will 
probably put jerry back where he belongs 
for wall and other struggling artists gruene has become a place 
for debuts after walkers recording the small community with a 
bedandbreakfast a couple of restaurants and several antique shops 
may be bustling like luckenbach did after walker willie nelson 
waylon jennings and others popularized it in music

iraq is rehabilitating its brief monarchy 
the reviled regime of henchmen that was begun by the british in 
1921 and ended with the murder of the third king in 1958 
the change of heart became evident after a ceasefire was 
declared aug 20 in the 8yearold war with iran it has been 
accompanied by the first moves toward political liberalization after 
decades of iron control 
books and articles have appeared reviewing and reassessing the 
monarchy created when the ottoman empire was carved up after world 
war i and iraq was created from the provinces of baghdad basra and 
mosul 
faisal i third son of sherif hussein of mecca who had lost his 
hashemite kingdom in syria was crowned aug 23 1921 the 
coronation was arranged by the british who had occupied what was 
then called mesopotamia since the war 
ghazi i and faisal ii the son and grandson of the first king 
succeeded him faisal ii was killed in the coup of 1958 
after 30 years of neglect the religious endowment ministry has 
allocated the equivalent of 3 million to refurbish the royal 
cemetery where the kings and some family members are buried 
king hussein of jordan a cousin of faisal ii and an important 
ally of president saddam hussein in the war with iran appears to 
have been the main influence for rehabilitation 
when the jordanian monarch visited baghdad recently president 
hussein accompanied him on a visit to the cemetery 
the ruling baath socialist party attached the regime of 
henchmen label long ago and no one dared defy its version of 
history now suddenly the party allows the same kings to be 
portrayed as great nationalists leaders in the quest for arab unity 
im 100 percent sure that they did not betray their country 
there were only differences of opinion abdullah bakr the last 
chief of the royal court wrote in a magazine article that would 
have been impossible before 
last month saddam hussein announced a program of political 
reform that includes allowing opposition political parties amnesty 
for political prisoners improvements in human rights and 
encouraging private enterprise 
western and arab diplomats question how far he will go toward 
reform but the flood of publications about the monarch emphasizes a 
notable decline in censorship 
the books and articles have spurred debate on whether the time 
has come for a reappraisal of iraqs entire turbulent history a 
tale of kings tribal warfare coups assassination kurdish 
rebellion and war encompassed by less than seven decades 
we werent afraid of them when they were alive so why should 
we fear them when theyre dead an iraqi official said in an 
interview speaking of the discredited kings 
fadhil hussein a university of indiana graduate who teaches in 
the baghdad university history department said it may be too soon 
to reassess the monarchy 
you cant prevent historical truth from being marked by 
political and social loyalties he told an interviewer history 
cannot be written when our recent past still has a great impact on 
our present 
nonetheless books on the subject have sold thousands of copies 
and new editions are being printed many have been serialized in 
newspapers 
historians and other academics have differed about the role of 
the monarchy in shaping modern iraq 
britain had sought to create a coherent political entity and the 
monarchy was a unifying element for a time but iraq soon was torn 
by tribal rebellion massacres and political intrigue 
iraqis generally have resented the monarchy as the creation of 
the british but many politicians now see the kings as realists who 
believed the nations integrity and development depended on british 
protection from external threat 
whether they tell the whole truth or not the publications have 
succeeded in bringing history to the attention of younger iraqis 
theres a huge gap in the new generations thinking about the 
monarchy said ahmed fawzi who has written a dozen books about 
his countrys short life 
he described his writings on the monarchy as a dignified 
revival of history for people who are not familiar with the period 
and have not received an objective account from official 
teachings in government schools 
the idea is to record the events of this period so other 
versions cannot be easily fabricated he said

always and ever there are things to worry about 
regarding the economys future and no forecaster seeking to remain 
employed would dare not mention them 
to them the issuance of warnings is professional protection 
allowing a forecast to be made but escaped from if wrong nothing is 
lost since most warnings are considered examples of erudition and 
responsibility 
you should know however that most of last years warnings 
inflation dollar collapse stock market debacle recession were 
changed in midstream only to be trotted out again as the new year 
began 
this is the 1989 list with comments by edward yardeni the 
prudentialbache securities economist who debunked last years 
forecasting myths and stands firm and independent from the general 
consensus this year 
the economy is overdue for a recession 
the expansion has lasted more than six years a long time by past 
measures suggesting that the odds cant be bucked much longer but 
hold on the economic world has changed and maybe the past isnt 
that accurate a criterion 
true there has been no general recession in that time period 
but there have been several rolling recessions different industries 
at different times have been very hard hit but the impact was 
offset by good times in others 
but what if these different industries slump at the same time it 
could happen but many us companies now operate globally and bad 
times in the united states could be offset by good business in 
europe 
capacity is too tight 
the percentage of production capacity rose above 84 percent in 
november marking the highest level in eight years federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan among many is concerned that such a level 
may generate inflation 
this could be a big mistake says yardeni why because in 
an environment of intense global competition we believe that tight 
capacity stimulates expansion rather than big price increases 
the jobless rate is too low so wage inflation will develop 
at 53 percent of the civilian labor force the rate is at a 
14year low there is indeed a shortage of new entrants into the 
labor force the thesis appear sound 
still says yardeni we believe that the employers recognize 
that offering big wage hikes will only drive up their labor costs 
rather than attract workers that demographically speaking dont 
exist 
in his opinion odds are that industries will opt to spend more 
on laborsaving productivity to substitute for scarce and expensive 
workers 
the federal deficit is too large 
sure it is large and that doesnt include perhaps 75 billion to 
rescue the thrift industry or maybe 150 billion to clean up 
radioactive pollution at the governments weapons plants 
but theres a brighter side too the deficit came down from an 
annualized peak of 2344 billion in the second quarter of 1986 to 
1248 billion in the third quarter of 1988 include state and local 
surpluses and the total government deficit dropped from 1743 
billion to 689 billion in this period 
the big problem says yardeni is in transfer payments 
designed to redistribute income more equitably which amounted to 
232 percent of gross national product in fiscal 1988 a very large 
fraction 
but in terms of expenses for goods and services the situation 
wasnt all that bad in the third quarter of last year purchases of 
goods and services were but 81 percent of gnp compared with more 
than 10 percent in the 1960s 
the trade deficit isnt narrowing fast enough 
really says yardeni the adjustment process is still working 
in our view and it will take another two years to produce a zero 
trade balance imports have clearly stopped growing exports are 
well above previousyear figures

public debate about whether they 
should work on sunday is making it hard for citizens of europes 
richest country to enjoy the sabbath quiet the bible extols and 
their constitution protects 
most west germans hew to the tradition of a day on which the 
family has coffee and cake at home and the children often are even 
discouraged from going next door to play with friends 
popular magazines and newspapers carry contributions from 
prominent people singing the virtues of sunday in church and at home 
the constitution provides special protection for sundays as days 
of rest from work and of spiritual uplift but union leaders say 
22 million in this nation of nearly 62 million people work at least 
one sunday a month 
hermann rappe head of the 630000member chemical workers union 
issued the latest call for more sunday work other union leaders 
united against him in what one called an avalanche of opposition 
rappe was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaper 
osnabruecker zeitung the unions must be ready to negotiate over 
sunday work for reasons of economics 
id prefer to have businesses use their money to create jobs in 
the federal republic west germany rather than in spain or greece 
if thats only possible with more work on weekends the unions cant 
simply say no 
business representatives praised him klaus murmann head of the 
national management council called rappes comments a beneficial 
shot of realism 
leaders of the printers public workers office workers the 
mighty 25millionmember steel workers union and some others 
didnt find his viewpoint beneficial in the least 
hermann rappes position was not and is not that of the 
printers union spokeswoman ulla krauseschaeuffler told the 
associated press he has set off an avalanche we are currently in 
negotiations to block sunday work 
rainer hillgaertner spokesman for the public workers said his 
union wants to keep sunday work to a minimum because the cultural 
value of having sunday off ranks above the principle of maximizing 
profits 
ernst breit head of the dgb labor federation which has 77 
million members also has expressed public opposition to work on 
sunday 
church leaders worried about a drop in attendance have been 
steadfast in disapproval 
we stand by our previous positions lutheran church spokesman 
peter kollmar told the ap citing the importance of the observance 
of the lords day and the cultural role of sunday 
the issue even united roman catholic and lutheran prelates in 
1984 long enough to issue a joint statement denouncing further 
expansion of sunday work 
the bible teaches us god blessed the seventh day and made it 
holy because on that day he ceased from all the work he had set 
himself to do the statement said in a citation from genesis 
remember to keep the sabbath day holy the christian leaders 
added quoting from exodus

the long palestinian uprising has brought 
bitterness to israeli humor and the comedians opener was not meant 
to put his audience at ease 
soldiers in uniform get in with a discount yonathan geffen 
said and after a pause soldiers with clubs get in free 
he referred to beatings by soldiers of protesters in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip where more than 300 palestinians have been 
killed and thousands wounded such a joke would have been 
unthinkable before the rebellion began dec 8 1987 
in night clubs theaters and galleries artists of various kinds 
grapple with questions about the violence of occupation and the 
brutalizing effect on israeli society of the armys handling of the 
uprising 
a satire by nightclub performer dudu topaz takes the form of an 
army radio report of an incident said to have begun when a young 
palestinian urinated on a soldiers leg 
the army arrests his entire family and destroys their house and 
an officer declares on the radio the youth was known as a 
potential terrorist 
a reporter finds the perpetrator but discovers he is not yet old 
enough to talk 
performing artists have collided with those who control staterun 
radio and television topaz was barred from a radio talk show for 
two weeks for comments critical of the army 
israel television rejected a skit by comedian tuvia tzafir that 
attacked public apathy by depicting an israeli family watching tv 
while a fire raged outside 
lyrics in coexistence with love a new album by vocalist 
astar shamir accuse the government of failing to explore options 
for peace while young soldiers do the dirty work of occupation 
as one of her songs a moment before the storm puts it my 
brother isnt a cruel soldier but hes cold in his soul he stands 
there with his hand on the trigger but he hates the war dont 
send my brother to the trigger 
ms shamir said in an interview when i sat opposite the 
television last january and they started showing me what was 
happening i couldnt sleep nights i know songs dont change things 
and cant move armies but they just came pouring out 
early last year army radio banned pop singer si hymans song 
shooting and crying about soldiers who used a bulldozer to bury 
four young palestinians alive in a west bank village the victims 
survived and the soldiers were given jail terms of up to a year 
have we forgotten our children were killed too hyman asks 
in the chorus alluding to the nazi extermination of 6 million jews 
in a jaffa nightclub tzafir performs a skit accusing prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of ignoring opportunities for peace 
it depicts shamir visiting an eye doctor and refusing to read a 
wall chart that says there are palestinians and in smaller 
letters there is a chance for peace 
my vision is too good shamir says i need something to 
block all this out 
palestinians have incorporated themes of the uprising into songs 
and plays words of a protest song reflect the tendency toward 
rhetoric with the molotov gasoline bomb with the stones i 
make my revolution with the stones we get rid of the enemy 
an art exhibit at the hakawati theatre in arab east jerusalem was 
a series of portraits of palestinians killed in the rebellion the 
new play waiting for the savior depicts buffoonlike israeli 
soldiers harassing palestinians going about their daily lives 
everything is political said jamal ghosheh director of the 
theatre we are talking about our lives our lives are political 
for israeli performers who do active and reserve army duty like 
everyone else it is more complicated 
at one point in his show topaz stopped and said i wonder if i 
have the right to do this im laughing at everyone but im 
laughing at myself as well because i too am a soldier 
the comedian whose father came here from the soviet union said 
in an interview this is not the country i wanted its not the 
kind of behavior i want if someone had told my father he was coming 
to live in a country that would rule another nation he never would 
have come

editors note the splendid medical technology that saves 
countless lives today is also capable of prolonging lives already 
lost it can be a cruel dilemma but for many terminally ill 
patients theres another way the hospice an institution of mercy

in a fit of depression when her third 
bout with cancer had sounded a death knell julia gebersky inquired 
through others whether her son robert had a gun and could shoot 
incontinent her body scarred by bedsores she had become a 
prisoner of her own helplessness if euthanasia were legal bob gery 
said he would have helped his mother kill herself 
but there was another way out for julie gebersky like nearly 
200000 patients a year she awaited her death in hospice a way 
station for the terminally ill that benignly treats them not for 
prolongation of life but to ease their dying and lessen their pain 
gerys mother died without much discomfort in the gentle hands of 
the connecticut hospice just as his father had died of cancer 
nearly 13 years ago under the same hospice care 
in that span the number of hospice care programs in the united 
states has grown from fewer than 100 to nearly 1700 according to a 
1988 survey by the national hospice organization in arlington va 
which provides technical services for its 900 members 
while care is much the same and about 90 percent of it is 
provided in the home the programs are operated by a variety of 
organizations for example 418 percent of the programs are 
independently run 266 percent are run by hospitals 224 percent 
by agencies that provide care in the home and 92 percent are run 
by a coalition of organizations such as nursing homes and hospitals 
working together 
hospice is not a place its a program of care says ira 
bates vice president of the national hospice organization we are 
the only health care provider that defines the unit of care as both 
the patient and the family 
hospice does this by sending in a team including volunteers and 
social workers to help the family with housework and personal 
problems to maintain the vigil while they take a break and to help 
with funeral arrangements once the patient dies after that hospice 
workers keep in touch with the family for at least a year to comfort 
them 
many hospice programs are based in office buildings and lease 
beds from hospitals and nursing homes if there is a crisis in the 
family then we can provide continuous home care in the home 
aroundtheclock bates says if thats not enough then we can 
move the patient to an inpatient setting 
the modern hospice system originated in england in 1967 when 
cicely saunders a british physician founded st christophers 
hospice 
what brought it about say hospice authorities was the leap in 
technical advances in medicine since the mid1950s and the 
increasingly common dilemma of terminally ill patients being kept 
alive sometimes against their wishes and the wishes of their 
families at high costs in suffering and financial sacrifice 
even some of those dealt the cruelest of hands in life aids 
victims who are not only dying but are homeless find refuge in some 
hospices like the connecticut hopsice the first and oldest in the 
united states and a leader in care for the terminally ill in the 
past two decades 
connecticut hospice began caring for the dying in their homes in 
march 1974 and opened a 44bed hospice for inpatients in july 1980 
in branford two years ago it bought an adjoining home and 
converted it into a cottage with five beds for the dying who have no 
home or no one to care for them 
bates says connecticut hospice is unique in its much higher 
proportion of inpatient care to home care it serves as a teaching 
hospice as well 
the average hospice says bates has three or four beds a paid 
staff of eight and 50 volunteers dealing with about 110 patients a 
year the discharge rate is around 10 percent those who decide to 
seek treatment or who go into remission 
while hospice patients are mostly elderly cancer victims as much 
as 90 percent the 80s have brought a new challenge a younger 
generation afflicted with aids either cast aside by society or in 
selfimposed exile to keep loved ones from seeing them at their 
worst 
the latest data available from the national hospice organization 
show hospices served about 2100 aids victims in 1986 among 154700 
patients in all while later figures are not available bates 
estimates the number of aids victims cared for will reach 6000 or 
7000 
among them are men like keith jackson 27 and eddie muniz 36 
who found accommodations in the connecticut hospice cottage last 
year their gaunt bodies implanted with catheters their shoulders 
propped up by hospice volunteers and friends so they could walk 
their lips barely movable slurring their speech almost as if theyd 
suffered a stroke and coughing coughing coughing 
i got a home but i dont want to be near the girls because ive 
been sick muniz an admitted drug dealer and user and the father 
of three daughters ages 8 10 and 12 told a visitor last november 
i know im gone i dont want to go he paused yet 
jackson a fashion model who is gay lived with his divorced 
mother until she died two years ago he said he would rather live in 
the cottage than move in with his father or siblings this is my 
home he said 
nurses the heart of hospice care and volunteers the soul give 
the men medication feed them do their laundry and take them out to 
dinner and to shop like many of the terminally ill they dread 
above all dying alone in confusion and fear the hospices quietly 
ease those apprehensions

for sundowners who fear the night and sleep by day families 
are often bedded down by their bedsides in inpatient hospices like 
the connecticut hospice which has its own building other hospices 
operate in a wing or ward of hospitals 
one of the big complaints is that dying is so sterile says 
pat jones executive vice president of the hospice association of 
america a washington lobby group that represents 1300 hospices 
people were isolated in a hospital room maybe the family couldnt 
come in i think its related to the need to be in control of ones 
life i dont think its an accident that hospice started coming 
into being around the same time as home birth its taking dying 
back into the family into the home 
indeed says national hospices bates most people want to die 
at home ninetyeight percent will say i want to be at home with 
my wife and family so we make that possible 
all of health care bates says is moving toward more choices 
the kind of choices made by julia gebersky and by mark marcucci a 
57yearold retired steelworker from bethel park pa 
like others with incurable cancer they decided they had had 
enough of hospitals and doctors and that there was little else 
caretakers could do but keep them comfortable 
mrs gebersky died as she wanted surrounded by people she loved 
her body free of the dreaded tubes she had been cared for at her 
apartment in neighboring hamden by a connecticut hospice nurse who 
looked in on her twice a week an outside nurse and a privately 
hired livein aide who took care of her aroundtheclock 
mrs gebersky fought a cancer in the parotid gland near the ear 
through surgery and radiation for seven years her condition 
worsened last fall and at her age 76 she decided against further 
treatment with chemotherapy 
her apartment had been decorated for a last thanksgiving dinner 
with her family and there was a christmas tree in case there would 
be time for that but two days before the holiday she slipped into a 
coma and was moved to the connecticut hospice at branford where she 
died on thanksgiving day 
one of her last wishes was to give the artificial christmas tree 
to the hospice and bob gery one of her sons did that 
gerys father benjamin 64 died at home of cancer on may 11 
1976 four years before the inpatient hospice was built 
after his father died gery who shortened his name served on 
the board of connecticut hospice for five years helping raise funds 
for the nonprofit organization 
you always know where the good service is for this type of 
care gery says the most important thing was that connecticut 
hospice would respect her wish to die with dignity thats basically 
where hospice distinguished itself from hospitals 
mark marcucci called it quits after a fouryear struggle with 
colon cancer he had been in and out of hospitals had undergone a 
colostomy catheterization intravenous morphine to palliate the 
pain had shrunk from 215 pounds to 140 pounds had begun to 
hallucinate 
when his wife of 26 years pat could no longer care for him at 
home he was admitted last summer to the forbes hospice in 
pittsburgh one of the divisions of the forbes health system that 
includes hospitals and a gerontology center 
he stayed at the hospice five days then came home to die with 
his wife and two sons at his side death came on aug 9 as we 
kept him comfortable propped up and just sat there with him pat 
says its not that they didnt treat him well at the hospice i 
just think he wanted to be with us 
generally hospice care is for those who have been diagnosed by a 
physician as having six months or less to live their average stay 
in the program is 45 days 
in surroundings familiar to them homecare patients are visited 
by a team of hospice workers including nurses homemakers social 
workers 
coincidentally says bates any strategy that keeps people out 
of hospitals saves loads of money he estimates savings of 20 
percent to 40 percent for taxpayers who foot the medicare bill for 
patients 65 and over and for health insurance companies many of 
which now provide hospice benefits 
beyond that says bates most hospices are committed to care 
regardless of the patients ability to pay since reimbursements 
rarely cover expenses most hospices rely on grants and donations to 
meet their budgets ninetyfive percent of them are nonprofit 
bates says 
ninety percent of our patients die at home says patricia 
oneil a liaison nurse at the merrimack valley hospice in andover 
mass i think thats really important because in order for that to 
happen you need a lot of support and intensive visits 
hospice patients range from the very young to the very old at 
merrimack valley hospice many are in the program only a few days 
because people are naturally reluctant to make the provision since 
it means a real acknowledgment that youre finished with looking 
for a cure says mrs oneil 
we can be very lowkey she says but there has to be some 
understanding at least from someone in the family that the 
prognosis is limited 
patients she says are not necessarily afraid of death itself 
but of the process of dying a hospice program can comfort them 
about that

mike and harry dutchburn shared a life as 
predictable as januarys blizzards and julys blackberries 
awake by 4 and asleep by 9 off to the barn at 4 2 and 5 
errands once a week st albans for parts newport for fertilizer 
john deusos store at the crossroads for potatoes hot dogs and 
bread 
in a weatherbeaten farmhouse on a lonely stretch of highway 10 
miles from canada the brothers passed their evenings in unmatched 
armchairs in a kitchen papered with sailing ships and maps of the 
world 
the wallpaper was hung by a sister years ago mike 77 and 
harry 79 likely would have chosen pictures of cows over maps of a 
world theyve had precious little to do with until it burst in on 
them one january night 
anyone in town can point out the dutchburn place with its 
blistered white paint and drawn shades surrounded by open fields 
house and barn sit near the road on a curve thats unexpectedly 
tricky mike and harry have lost track of the cars theyve pulled 
from the mud over the years a habit of helpfulness that was to cost 
them 
from their kitchen window they can see their hillside 
birthplace the only other home theyve ever known they still 
remember moving day june 15 1915 just as they do every journey 
away from home ever since their brothers funeral in massachusetts 
in 1944 mikes trip to their sisters in michigan in 1960 the 
65mile drive with their niece sandra lyon to burlington a year 
and a half ago harry hadnt been there for 40 years 
except for pies and cookies from grandmas bakery in richford 
the dutchburns list of indulgences is shorter than the list of 
their trips an aborted attempt at cigarsmoking in 1940 harry 
and two chugalugged bottles of gin in 1939 mike 
we dont owe anybody says mike we pay cash or we do 
without we go right along thats our way 
the dutchburns ways modesty hard work and thrift were 
common knowledge on the frugal little farms of franklin county so 
was their habit of carrying large sums of cash 
on the last day of january 1986 the ways of the world 
violence cruelty and greed were brought home to the dutchburns by 
two strangers who called them by name 
they pretended to be out of gas the dutchburns didnt have any 
but mike climbed out of his narrow iron bed in the middle of the 
night by the time hed walked the few steps to the kitchen the two 
men had kicked in the door 
you shouldnt be here mike told them he got hit in the face 
harry who had 7000 in his shirt pocket walked in right behind 
him and got hit in the head with the thick maple cane he used to 
prod cows 
mike put up a fight but it was over in less than five minutes 
afterward mike says the kitchen looked like youd cut a bunch of 
hens heads off and let em fly 
five minutes was all it took to teach two old men about fear the 
fear never left them not even after the robbers went to jail 
i dont sleep anymore i hear the cars all night you dont 
forget it says mike he only has to look at his brother to 
remember harrys right eye hangs like a crooked picture in his 
face it swells and weeps in the cold since the beating he no 
longer goes out to do chores 
the cane hanging on its peg is another reminder so are the dents 
it left in the old kelvinator in the kitchen they could have 
taken the money mike says theres no sense beating a person 
up 
he rubs the dents gently its the people in the world thats 
changed he says they dont care who they take from 
detective sgt bill northrup an 18year veteran of the vermont 
state police calls it as brutal as any homicide ive ever 
investigated 
except that it wasnt a homicide the dutchburns survived 
they just didnt recover 
mike dutchburn lay for 3 hours on the kitchen floor after the 
beating afraid to move harry was unconscious when mike saw a 
light go on next door at dawn he crawled out to his chevy pickup 
and drove half a mile to the neighbors 
when their niece got word at 530 that morning she drove 
straight to montgomery at the farmhouse where shed spent childhood 
vacations petting calves and eating ice cream sandy lyon found two 
state police troopers in a kitchen spattered with blood in her 
uncles hospital room she says i didnt recognize either one of 
them 
lyon a bank teller with three grown children has the manners of 
a sunday school teacher until she talks about the beating then 
she starts saying hell a lot

she remembers two strong handsome men who teased and spoiled her 
they were easygoing they took you for who you were mike 
pulled my pigtails harry was the perfect image of my dad who died 
when i was 17 
since the beating she says harry has been to the barn once 
mostly he sits there and broods theyre withdrawn now they have 
that constant fear any little noise on the porch and theyre 
petrified 
harry lets mike take him to the barber but outings are rare he 
has trouble climbing into the truck his back like his brothers 
is bent from years of work in the lowceilinged barn 
the money harry carried in and out of that barn the money ripped 
out of his pocket helped lead police to the attackers 
you spend 20 hours a day in a barn northrup says and your 
money will smell like a barn 
salesmen at champlain chevrolet in enosberg knew that smell it 
had lingered long after mike dutchburn drove off in his new pickup 
truck they finally tracked it to the cash in the safe 
northrup alerted all vermont banks and stores to be on the 
lookout for hundreddollar bills with a strong barn odor that 
led to some of the dutchburns money the money led to one of the 
men 
judge frank mahady can still picture the two stooped figures in 
faded green work clothes who shuffled into his burlington courtroom 
as if from another century to talk sorrowfully about locking doors 
and mistrusting strangers 
harry told of no longer being able to work the best part of my 
life is gone now he said 
mahady listened patiently as the dutchburns and their niece tried 
to explain why two years and eight months in jail the terms of a 
proposed plea agreement didnt feel much like justice 
there is a very fundamental right the right to be simply left 
alone the judge said finally it is so important and so basic 
it doesnt have to be set forth in any documents that basic 
fundamental right was taken away thats unpardonable 
mahady isnt known for rejecting plea bargains to the hard 
right he says wryly im known as the criminals judge 
he made an exception in the case of darrell clark 39 and 
unemployed with a record of larceny and assault in july 1987 
mahady gave clark five to 10 years in jail another judge gave louis 
gilbeau 33 a stainer at a furniture factory eight to 10 years 
with all but five suspended 
both men can expect to serve three years and nine months a 
rope around the neck wouldve been better says harry 
he and mike spent three days in the hospital after the beating 
then signed themselves out the doctors wanted to keep them longer 
the dutchburns had had enough doctoring 
they opened a checking account and had telephones installed in 
the house and barn then they shut themselves up behind new deadbolt 
locks 
the house still looks sealed vulnerable and exposed alongside 
the highway it could be abandoned but for the truck in the driveway 
and the two figures sitting still as statues in the kitchen 
they greet prolonged knocking with silence eventually they 
respond to introductions shouted through the locked door 
the gray sky is spitting snow but inside an ancient stove warms 
the kitchen harrys gold plaid chair is stationed by the side 
window mikes green vinyl recliner guards the door a holstein and 
her calf watch over them from a wall calendar courtesy of eastern 
milk producers 
a paper bag worn thin as tissue paper holds their memories one 
ghostly snapshot shows two hardy young farmers in matching coveralls 
and caps sharing a joke side by side they are broadshouldered and 
handsome heads tipped back mouths stretched wide eyes crinkled 
shut 
slowly stiffly mike hands the picture to harry out of their 
armchairs both men are curved like question marks fragile figures 
who move gingerly about the kitchen 
all along the valley in farmhouses much like the dutchburns 
doors and windows left unlocked for decades were bolted and sealed 
that winter and shotguns put away for next hunting season were 
retrieved 
franklin countys 37000 inhabitants had known crime but mostly 
of a different sort patches of marijuana tucked away in a field or 
burglaries of unoccupied vacation homes owned by outofstate 
skiers not the sort of facetoface crime that has people afraid to 
come to the door at night 
there was talk of forming a posse there was talk of lynching 
and tarring and feathering an oldfashioned killing party sandy 
recalls 
no hole is deep enough no rock big enough to hide scum like 
you neighbor james mcgroarty wrote in a letter in the franklin 
county courier i promise you well find you and i pray to god 
the police do before i or the other people in our town of montgomery 
do 
eventually things quieted down two men went to jail and life 
went back to normal except for mike and harry 
this month brings another reminder a lawsuit they filed against 
their assailants goes before a district court jury its the 
principle sandy says my uncles are never going to be better 
why should two innocent people have to live this way 
the prospect of once again facing their attackers weighs on the 
dutchburns they try to make light of it weve gotten used to 
going to court harry says grinning faintly 
there is no getting used to the locked doors or the fear 
not long ago yet another driver missed the curve by the 
dutchburns and spun off the road into the field he pounded on 
their door for a long time but mike and harry sat very still 
eventually he went away

editors note mongolia is one of the symbols of remoteness on 
earth yet this sparsely populated land the size of western europe 
is 100 percent literate and inching its way toward modernity now 
it is taking a leaf from the soviet union to speed the process

like its huge and dominant neighbor 
to the north this ancient nation of herdsmen and miners once ruled 
by genghis khan is restructuring its marxist society 
but what the soviets call perestroika the mongolians call 
shinechel or renewal and they are greeting the liberation of 
the statecontrolled economy and the infusion of democracy with an 
air of excitement 
the old ways brought shortages in a land of plenty and political 
timidity to a people of great warrior tradition 
shinechel is still too new to claim many accomplishments but 
there are great expectations 
before we said that capitalism and socialism cant exist 
together says puntagdasyn luvsandorj director of the institute 
of economics of the state planning committee now we say they must 
cooperate 
the main target of reform is the state monopoly on production 
imposed in the 1960s on both industry and more improbably in rural 
areas where people are scattered across a nation nearly the size of 
western europe wandering the grasslands as seminomadic herdsmen 
one consequence is that livestock numbers have stagnated at about 
23 million head since the early 1970s even though the human 
population has doubled to about 2 million 
half of the meat produced must be exported to the soviet union to 
pay for soviet goods and financial aid leaving city residents to 
stand in line sometimes for hours for scarce supplies of meat the 
staple of the mongolian diet 
more than half the population has left the harsh life on the 
grasslands for cities putting further strains on food supplies 
the food situation is getting worse said one foreign 
diplomat noting that grain and vegetable farms all run by the 
state are plagued by bad planning bad management and bad 
profits 
the government is now trying to spur meat production by 
increasing the private stocks herdsmen are allowed to keep those in 
the gobi desert region can now keep 100 head while those in other 
parts of the country can keep 75 farmers may now work small private 
plots 
industry has fared better because of heavy investment and 
technical assistance from the soviet union and other socialist 
nations helping mongolia develop its rich mineral resources 
in december mongolias parliament passed an industrial law 
giving factory directors greater authority over planning and 
investment but its three strikes and youre out the government 
will bail out moneylosing enterprises only two times before they 
are shut down 
before we didnt participate in selling our product so we 
were not interested in quality and meeting world competition said 
chimedeeren erdenechimeg general engineer at a carpet factory in 
ulan bator now according to the new law if we produce a good 
product and can find a market the living conditions of the managers 
and workers will improve 
free markets encouraged by the government are still small but 
growing owners of private cars have gone into the taxi service a 
few small restaurants have appeared and private clothesmakers are 
selling to retail cooperatives 
but the pace of economic change is likely to be slow said one 
foreign diplomat its such a vast country he said and there 
is little pressure from below for privatization because people are 
relatively prosperous and have known nothing but socialism since the 
marxist state was founded in 1921 only four years after the russian 
revolution making it the second oldest marxist society in the world 
faster change may come in the political sphere where the ruling 
communist party is debating an election law that for the first time 
will allow direct multicandidate elections 
the party is also trying to limit the role of party officials to 
policymaking and streamline the government marx and lenin said 
the roles of the party the government and mass organizations should 
be separate said kinayat zardihan a leading ideologist in the 
partys institute of social sciences but in our country this 
difference has disappeared 
as in the soviet union the official press is encouraged to 
condemn what are now regarded as errors of the past the press now 
speaks openly about repression and political purges in the 1930s 
yumjaagiyn tsedenbal ruler for 40 years until his ouster in 1984 
is knocked for forcing collectivization in the 1960s while his 
russian wife is criticized for wielding too much power 
statues in ulan bator of stalin and other native oppressors 
have recently been smeared with paint 
zardihan said the party is now rewriting the nations history to 
include the truth about events that have shaped the nation 
one government official noted that before now everything that 
happened before 1921 was regarded as bad including the 12th and 
13th century advance of genghis khans horsemen that created a 
mongol empire stretching from the danube to the coast of china 
president and party leader jambyn batmonh a 62yearold former 
rector of the state university is also hoping to ease his remote 
and landlocked nation away from its near total dependence on the 
soviet union and other soviet bloc nations 
relations with china with which mongolia shares a 2900mile 
border show signs of improvement as moscow and beijing patch up old 
differences mongolia which sided with the soviet union when its 
two giant neighbors split in 1960 sent home one division of soviet 
troops in 1987 and has now pledged to remove a considerable 
number of the remaining 50000 soviet troops guarding mongolia 
from a potential chinese attack 
in early 1987 mongolia and the united states established 
diplomatic relations and are now negotiating cultural and consular 
agreements 
currently 97 percent of mongolias total annual trade of about 
16 billion is with socialist countries 80 percent with the soviet 
union those figures will be hard to change in the near future 
mongolia receives about a billion dollars in aid and twothirds of 
its capital investment funds from the soviet union every year which 
locks it into shipping its ores cashmere and meat to the socialist 
bloc 
officially at least mongolians are full of praise for the 
soviet union which helped build its cities and industry 
under sovietstyle socialism mongolia has become a nation of 
almost 100 percent literacy where 25 percent receive higher 
educations medical and other welfare facilities are inexpensive and 
worker incomes average nearly 200 dollars a month one of the higher 
figures in asia

at the young peoples cultural center 
on a sunday night mongolian girls with glitter on their cheeks and 
boys wearing narrow ties swivel to the disco beat of american 
singers stevie wonder and whitney houston 
upstairs a 12piece band belts out mongolian hits from the 1930s 
as a more middleaged crowd some dressed in the traditional 
robelike del and high black riding boots swirl around the room 
despite the isolation in the winter the capital of ulan bator 
is accessible only by plane from moscow or a 30hour train ride from 
beijing signs of western influence are seeping into this stolidly 
socialist nation of 2 million 
foreign visitors must pay hotel and transportation bills with 
us dollars and are frequently stopped on the street by 
moneychangers offering twice the official dollar rate for the 
mongolian currency the tugrik 
at the dollar store in ulan bator mongolians with american 
or other western money listen to a tape from a san francisco radio 
station program while buying british whiskeys american toiletries 
and japanese radios 
english still rare in a country where studying russian is 
mandatory is now taught on primetime national television with a 
series arranged through the british embassy 
the foreign influence however is predominantly russian 
thousands of soviets engineers technical advisers traders and 
soldiers live and work in ulan bator the visage of lenin peers 
from statues and billboards around the city and a war memorial 
jutting into the skyline from the top of a hill is dedicated to 
soviet not mongolian soldiers 
central ulan bator which means red hero is a collection 
of sovietfinanced columned government buildings and utilitarian 
apartment complexes most painted in pleasant pastel shades of pink 
and yellow mongolia must import most of its consumer goods and 80 
percent of its trade is with the soviet union 
mongolia adopted the russian cyrillic script in 1946 and all 
schoolchildren must study russian from the fourth grade on study of 
the mongolian script suppressed for decades was revived about four 
years ago but classes only begin in the seventh grade 
signs in the native script are rare in contrast to chinese inner 
mongolia where shops and offices frequently carry signs in 
mongolian for the mongolian minority of 3 million 
about 6000 mongolian university and research students the 
nations best and brightest study in the soviet union 
the dependence on soviet political and cultural reinforcement 
goes back to 1921 when soviet forces helped mongolia drive out the 
chinese who had occupied the country for more than 200 years and set 
up the worlds second communist state 
sovietstyle socialism was in part mongolias salvation creating 
a wellcaredfor and welleducated nation the cost to mongolian 
heritage however was high 
at the turn of the century the mongolian population was only 
500000 and in danger of being wiped out literacy was about 1 
percent forty percent of the male population lived in the nations 
750 buddhist lamaseries one reason for the declining population 
a stalinist purge of the 1930s resulted in the closure of all 
monasteries and the murder of many monks today the gandan monastery 
in ulan bator with 160 monks is the only functioning buddhist 
temple in the country 
in the 1940s the mongolian script was suppressed and in the 
1950s there was a campaign to ban wearing of the native costume 
plans to celebrate the 800th birthday of the great mongol warrior 
genghis khan in 1962 were scaled down as a result of soviet 
displeasure 
mongolian culture persists in both the del the usual form of 
dress in the countryside and the ger or yurt the round 
canvascolored tent which is still home to about half ulan bators 
500000 people 
in the countryside seminomadic herding remains the main way of 
life despite collectivization of their herds of sheep horses cows 
and camels 
we need more settled animal husbandry to supply cities with 
meat and milk says o shagdarsuren rector of the mongolian state 
university 
but shagdarsuren who grew up in a herdsmans family said 
mongolia should keep its nomadic ways in settled husbandry people 
live for the animals in nomadic husbandry the animals are always 
working for man 
mongolia is also working to ensure that its human population 
which occupies only a tiny part of this western europesized nation 
of steppes deserts forestland and mountains will continue to grow 
a mother giving birth to her fourth child receives a 15day 
vacation at a state rest house and is eligible for retirement at 50 
further births means greater salary and pension benefits and a 
woman with eight children is awarded a first class medal of famous

chultem tumurbaatap is a socialist 
nomad a herdsman who wanders for the state across the endless 
steppes of mongolia 
tumurbaatap 26 rides herd on 400 horses assigned to him by the 
karakorum state farm near the ruins of the ancient capital from 
where the sons of genghis khan once conquered an empire stretching 
from eastern europe to the pacific 
like his ancestors he sets off every spring with his animals for 
a halfyear of seeking the green pastures of mountain hideaways 
returning for a more settled life during the long and harsh 
mongolian winters 
but in socialist mongolia the young horseman receives a salary 
for his labors and other benefits such as paid vacations the state 
farm to which he belongs of medium size has 1000 members and 
100000 head of sheep horses cows and camels 
tumurbaatap hosting visitors in the round canvascovered tent 
or yurt that is still common in both rural and urban mongolia 
shyly brushed off suggestions that socialism might not be suited for 
the wild and isolated life of a nomadic herdsman 
he said he is paid 150 a month and his wife receives a similar 
amount for helping with the milking of the horses he receives 
bonuses for keeping the herd healthy and holding down losses from 
wolves and winter winds 
with the money he has bought a generatoroperated 
blackandwhite television a radio a saddle with silver buckles a 
new 1600 yurt and a motorcycle he said that in about 10 years he 
might have enough to buy a car 
farm workers drive to his winter campsite about 9 miles outside 
the dirtroad town once a week with portable hotwater showers 
movies stores and performing troupes also make the rounds of the 
grasslands and the farm provides a vehicle to help transport his 
yurt when he is on the move 
his three infants when they are ready for school will receive 
free boarding at the farms school dormitory 
turmubaatap who trains horses for racing said he did wish the 
state would let him keep more private animals now he is allowed to 
own only 10 head and a few of the foals born every year 
socialist amenities have not softened the herdsman i like the 
snows in winter he answers laconically when asked about life on 
the steppes when the temperatures dip to minus22 degrees farenheit 
like other herdsmen he wears a fur hat highpointed boots and 
the del the traditional long silk robe tied at the waist with 
an orange sash and with sheepskin lining in the winter his 
24yearold wife bavuu sanjaasuren wears a similar outfit but 
sports nail polish and a fashionable whitestriped knit hat 
horses dont like western clothes he said when asked why he 
prefers the native costume 
during the winter the family eats mainly horsemeat boiled on a 
dungheated iron stove in the middle of the yurt the family 
including the children keep warm by drinking airak a mildly 
alcoholic drink made from fermented mares milk 
tumurbaatap was stationed in the capital of ulan bator during a 
threeyear stint in the army but says hes not attracted to city 
life i want to live in the countryside he said i like 
horses

iowa farmer and hunter norbert bremer 
traveled 10000 miles and spent 10000 to get a shot at a ram on 
the frozen windlashed wasteland of the gobi desert 
i had a wonderful time says bremer showing off the mighty 
curved horns of a gobi ram his trophy from one of the worlds more 
exotic safaris 
he is one of some 350 hunters out of 600 who apply whom the 
mongolians allowed in last year they control the number to preserve 
the wildlife 
bremer 52 also tracked down a tallhorned siberian ibex as part 
of the tour and for an extra 750 shot a blacktailed gazelle 
he was the last hunter of 1988 to take the gobi tour he said 
temperatures in the mongolian desert plunged to zero and the wind 
knifed through the treeless scrub at 30 mph 
bremer who farms 880 acres of corn and soybeans in ocheyedan 
iowa says he read of the gobi hunt in hunting magazines for about 
6500 the mongolian tourist agency zhuulchin provided incountry 
transportation guides and attendants and a license to shoot one 
gobi sheep and one ibex 
bremer had to get here on his own via beijing 
he also paid a fee of 200 dollars for every inch of the rams 
horn in excess of 43 inches 
his kill had horns of 51 inches which bremer said may make the 
record books 
but the experience was more than the hunt his party passed 
nomadic herdsmen some armed with rifles and riding camels and 
horses as they tended their herds and flocks in the parched bush 
the hunters lived in a yurt the round tentlike home of 
mongolian herdsmen and were served by an interpreter a driver a 
cook a camp manager and a young woman who tended the stoves and 
skinned the animals 
the tourist agency also offers safaris to the woodlands of 
central and northeast mongolia where elk moose deer and brown 
bear abound 
g batsukh deputy general director of zhuulchin said several 
years ago the government sold licenses to hunt the rare and 
beautiful snow leopard found in the altai range claiming the 
leopard population had increased and was preying on cattle yaks and 
people but he said only one or two of the white and black leopards 
were killed and shooting licenses are no longer issued

editors note its a catandmouse game in the skies 
speciallyequipped planes of the us customs service in search of 
suspected drug smugglers they sometimes fly long hours to no avail 
patrolling the gulf of mexico and the usmexican border from texas 
to california but when the quarry is sighted there is often the 
thrill of an airborne chase which one radar operator compares to 
an act of war 
</TEXT>

flying wingtiptowingtip with 
suspected smugglers or buzzing a boat to get a better look the air 
crews of the us customs service are on the front line in the war 
on drugs 
equipped with hightech radar that can spot a plane 200 miles 
away they roam the skies at 20000 feet or skim the waters of the 
gulf of mexico 
they know the thrill of an airborne chase 
it seems like what were doing is an act of war says radar 
detection specialist steve macdonald as he scans the skies on his 
radar screen 
using five fourengine p3 orions the size of airliners and two 
smaller twinengine e2c hawkeyes the customs service runs its 
surveillance detection operations here at the corpus christi naval 
air station on the gulf of mexico 
these crews have a tough job they are responsible for patrolling 
the vast gulf and the usmexican border from texas to california 
their equipment often fails they get little help from countries 
south of the border 
the system of tethered radar balloons that will someday relieve 
much of their border coverage is behind schedule only four of a 
planned 17 are operating 
but they are excited about their new 20 million p3 outfitted by 
its builder lockheed with an airborne early warning aew radar 
dome on top similar to that of an air force airborne warning and 
control plan awacs 
on this plane radar operators sit at two computer keyboards 
where they can track planes 200 miles away assign color codes to 
friendly and suspect aircraft and direct customs planes on a chase 
a second dome plane is due in april and customs hopes for a total of 
four 
stanley adams a customs pilot and surveillance branch 
supervisor likened current detection coverage to hiding a pea in a 
shell game you keep moving the coverage around hoping to hit 
the right place on the right night 
this is not firstclass flying this is flying with erratic 
temperature controls that can leave you sweating or can keep a soda 
ice cold without a refrigerator 
this is flying on a roller coaster because during a chase the 
pilots have little time to find windows through rough weather 
this is flying in the threeseat radar compartment of an e2c 
which is so narrow that a quarter turn of a chair is all the room 
you have it is so noisy on the plane built for aircraft carriers 
that special earplugs are required 
compared to the hawkeye the p3 is a luxury with a refrigerator 
and a microwave oven 
on a recent winters night the p3 is patrolling over the gulf of 
mexico when a call from a customs intelligence agent in houston 
sends the crew on a 200mile chase 
the pilots gun the four propjet engines and the airspeed 
indicator jumps from 240 knots to 360 knots 
as the plane bumps through the clouds two radar operators search 
for their target on their screens 
did they say his lights were off one crew member asks 
another on the radio 
no selfrespecting smuggler would keep his lights on one of 
the pilots responds 
the thrill of the chase as happens too often evaporates when 
the p3 arrives in the target area the suspect cannot be found 
perhaps because he had already landed at a remote airstrip 
sometimes though the customs fliers strike pay dirt 
a couple of weeks ago we chased a plane that landed on cat 
island in the bahamas says radar operator buck benham the drug 
plane had dumped its load at the airport we saw cars headed for the 
airport to pick up the drugs we sent in a helicopter they rounded 
up the plane and pilot we kept circling 150 feet off the ground 
trying to identify the vehicles and the smugglers were running 
every which way

editors note a psychologist at the university of california 
spent 10 years studying 60 families split by divorce and found some 
unexpected patterns now judith wallerstein is publishing her 
findings in a book to be published next month it seeks to answer 
the question who wins who loses and why 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
every year more than 2 million americans in some degree of 
desperation seek a second chance in life through divorce 
but a new look at this phenomenon finds that things are not 
necessarily better the second time around and the chances of success 
are more elusive than was thought 
and society often forgets to think much about the 1 million or so 
children a year who are involved in divorce most of whom sense a 
loss of protection and fear of the future 
furthermore the study shows the aftershocks of divorce echo 
through the personal lives of all concerned at least a decade later 
judith wallerstein a psychologist at the university of 
california and founder of the center for the family in transition 
has studied in depth 60 families for more than 10 years 
her findings are to be published next month in a book second 
chances men women and children a decade after divorce written 
in collaboration with science writer sandra blakeslee the subsub 
title is even more provocative who wins who loses and why 
among the findings that wallerstein discovered as new 
scientific and unexpected was that in most instances one person 
was much better off 
one person is very important in life she says but the 
other member was on balance either in the same place or not doing 
too well youre looking at a much greater divergence after divorce 
and thats entirely new 
who gets the major benefit of the second chance boils down to 
who wanted the divorce whether male or female 
wallerstein says she is not against divorce divorce is much 
more than the coup de grace of a stressful marriage she writes 
it is a new beginning that offers people second chances it is no 
more and no less than an opportunity to rebuild lives and theres 
the rub 
the book tells of the pitfalls the expectations the denial and 
the quiet dramas through the voices of those involved and 
wallerstein has obviously won the trust and the understanding of 
these people with whom she has been involved these many years 
in the book there are three major families we built on she 
says i think those people started off equal we ask why did 
you get married almost all of them tell us they married for love 
they thought they were equal they werent shotgun marriages because 
someone got pregnant although some of them were by and large they 
knew each other 
in some of the marriages that we see there never was a 
marriage however one defines marriages in terms of love intimacy 
friendship there was unhappiness loneliness or violence whatever 
from the start 
but in a whole group of these marriages there was at some 
point a real marriage and then it didnt endure for a whole lot of 
different reasons 
in fact wallerstein says were almost at the point in america 
where we are beginning to know more about divorce than we know about 
marriage 
she is tempted next to write about what it is that makes 
marriages break up 
in investigating the aftermath of divorce she found that each 
participant has a different view even the children although they 
are almost unanimous in thinking that the divorce was a good thing 
for their parents 
not so for the children youre in a mine field of moral 
issues because the children feel they are worse off wallerstein 
says im not sure they were but they feel they were and thats 
an important distinction i think in many ways they were better 
off 
nor is it a passing thing again this was a finding i didnt 
expect i was startled when i first looked at it it crescendoes as 
they move into young adulthood as they are looking at an important 
love affair an important commitment thats when they really worry 
am i going to be locked into what happened to my mom and dad 
the children envy their friends who have two parents wallerstein 
says they have an idealized sense of a twoparent family they feel 
those other children are better protected but they worry on behalf 
of themselves and their future children about the possibility of 
betrayal 
there is a lot of premarital living together yet these children 
of divorce are basically conservative not believing in open 
marriage against what they see as cheating in search of a 
longterm commitment 
now this is what they want wallerstein says what they do 
is often at odds with what they want 
young women tend to get involved with a lot of young men 
apparently unafraid of getting hurt wallerstein says its a 
complex picture were looking at 
ironically when they are most in need of outside support the 
process is crippled one parent or another may simply abdicate just 
when coparenting is most important that in fact is one of the 
prime remedies that wallerstein would like to see set in place by 
the divorce process 
a lot of the children she studied frequently the children of 
uppermiddle class professionals never get to college because child 
support ends at 18 
its not fair she says in these families very few fathers 
helped their children after age 18 they didnt all plead poverty 
it was a sense that they had done all that they were legally 
obligated to do i was surpised i was very distressed it wasnt 
that they werent seeing their children but often there was a sort 
of blunting that had occurred 
wallerstein would like to call this phenomenon to the attention 
of society divorce is in many cases necessary and the best thing 
for everyone concerned but the sequelae need to be addressed 
we saw as much anger between the parents 10 years later as 
there was at the outset it was not a cheerful finding the 
coparenting was disrupted the relationships between fathers and 
children were disrupted although a major finding was that at 
adolescence there was a rising need for the father 
the divorce can become a remedy a very important remedy for 
one parent but whats not recognized is how hard it can be for the 
children and that is something that can be changed

editors note membership in college fraternities has almost 
doubled in the past 10 years and unlike in their golden years of 
the 1950s there is little supervision or strict rules but that may 
be changing a series of scandals involving hazing in the past 
couple of years has tarnished the image of the brotherhoods and 
stirred an outcry for reforms

the 14 newly pinned college fraternity 
pledges roused by the members speeches and their own desire to 
belong were led downstairs into the darkened lambda chi alpha 
basement and lined up in front of the bar 
on went the lights revealing the final stage of the pinning 
night there sat 200 kamikazes a potent vodka concoction 
they drank 
james callahan of north bergen drank until he dropped dead 
the 18yearolds alcohol death last winter at rutgers university 
was one of a string of scandals at fraternity houses around the 
country that have brought more pressure for reforms of the 
greekletter brotherhoods 
with their futures at stake fraternities are responding 
bars in many fraternity houses are being closed and advisers are 
returning and the national interfraternity conference is 
considering a total ban on pledging 
its not easy to change the culture but until we do i think 
there are going to be very bad days ahead for fraternities says 
john creedon a rutgers assistant provost since callahans death 
creedon has led the push for fraternity reforms at rutgers 
fraternities are under fire as never before says eileen 
stevens a national antihazing activist mrs stevens has traveled 
the country since her son died 10 years ago after drinking too much 
during a hazing at alfred university in upstate new york 
their very future is in jeopardy mrs stevens says i 
think weve come to a point where the people who supervise them 
realize the problems are enormous and theyre just not sure what to 
do about it 
the problems boil down to two harddying traditions drinking 
and hazing 
critics call fraternities an anachronism 
fraternities have been engaged like the brontosaurus in a 
futile struggle against a changed climate earl smith dean at 
colby college wrote last year in the chronicle of higher education 
fraternities have been banned at colby since 1984 when 
administrators decided they no longer fit in at the college in 
waterville maine 
fraternity leaders say the scandals are relatively few that 
elitism charges are unfounded and that the positives such as 
friendship leadership development and community service far 
outweigh any negatives 
but over the past two years defenders of the fraternity system 
have winced at a series of incidents in addition to the rutgers 
death 
our members of the university of alabama chapter of sigma alpha 
epsilon the largest national fraternity were arrested on charges 
of selling cocaine they were accused of making some of the drug 
deals out of the stately chapter house 
at the university of lowell in massachusetts six fraternity 
members were charged under the states tough antihazing law over a 
stunt that sent a pledge to the hospital with a body temperature of 
109 the members had bundled the victim in a sleeping bag and turned 
on heaters nearby 
a former university of delaware student claimed in a lawsuit 
that someone dumped caustic oven cleaner over his head during a 
fraternity hell night 
but nothing stirred an outcry like callahans death at rutgers 
it inspired nearly a dozen bills in the new jersey legislature and 
is cited by fraternity critics nationally 
that probably had more impact on us than any other hazing 
incident says jonathan brant director of the national 
interfraternity conference 
the reprisals against lambda chi alpha were swift and harsh the 
rutgers chapter was disbanded and the house doors slammed shut 
the 29 other fraternities were ordered to pull out their basement 
bars which had become standard equipment at rutgers fraternities 
and make other reforms 
it could have been worse

in recent years more than a dozen colleges have banned 
greekletter organizations besides colby fraternities are passe at 
amherst college and the university of lowell both in massachusetts 
and franklin and marshall college in lancaster pa 
at the pennsylvania college the trustees felt the fraternities 
had been reduced in many ways to underage drinking clubs says 
college spokeswoman patti lawson 
the mounting pressure against fraternities threatens what has 
been a steadily rising membership 
undergraduate fraternity membership has climbed to 400000 
according to the interfraternity conference thats more than double 
the 1970 figures and a 170000 increase since 1980 
unlike the greek systems golden age of the 1950s this heyday 
has come in a relatively unsupervised environment campus 
administrators note gone are the housemothers strict rules and 
other formalities that once characterized fraternity life 
but some college administrations are starting to reintroduce the 
supervision its met with resistance from many fraternity chapters 
but some are starting to respond 
resident advisers have moved into chapter houses on the 
university of southern californias fraternity row fraternities 
have gone completely dry at indiana university home to one of the 
strongest greek systems in the country 
the fraternities national magazines abound with denunciations of 
alcohol abuse sexism and racism 
a recent edition of alpha tau omegas publication chronicles that 
fraternitys efforts to halt a national liquor promotion geared to 
male college students 
the governing body of zeta beta tau voted in september to end 
pledging an idea being studied by the national greek council 
callahans death came a few days after more than 40 princeton 
students were treated for alcohol poisoning following a drinking 
binge at two private social clubs 
fifteen lambda chi alpha members were charged with aggravated 
hazing in callahans death they have yet to come to trial but a 
conviction would carry a maximum penalty of 18 months in jail and a 
7500 fine 
ive had calls from all across the country says james 
meisel a hackensack lawyer who is representing callahans mother 
among the people ive talked to university people crusader 
groups theres a consensus that as a general matter drinking is 
way out of hand on college campuses 
joseph discenza a lawyer for lambda chis board of trustees 
acknowledges there was peer pressure for the pledges to drink 
but discenza contends that nobody was forced 
he says callahans own reckless behavior was to blame for his 
death which an autopsy attributed to 23 ounces of alcohol and a 
434 percent blood alcohol content more than four times the legal 
limit 
this one isolated incident says nothing says discenza an 
alumnus of the rutgers lambda chi alpha chapter it says if 
someone really wants to drink a lot they can it could have happened 
just as easily in my basement 
michael steinbruck a delta phi member is leading a fight 
against the rutgers administrations latest proposal for reform a 
requirement that each chapter have an adult livein adviser 
steinbruck 23 has a scrapbook full of press clippings about his 
chapters work raising money for new brunswick homeless shelters and 
other causes he believes the university has ignored the good works 
of fraternities and acted in a reactionary fashion to callahans 
death 
people are so fed up with constantly being on the defensive 
about hazing theyre willing to try lots of different plans if they 
feel they have a reasonable chance of succeeding says patrick 
brown president of the national fraternity council 
the goal brown says is to reinforce the founding purposes of 
friendship and scholarship and eliminate the basic 
irresponsibility whether it is alcohol abuse hazing poor 
scholarship 
fraternity can be a magnificent educational movement if its 
appropriately directed im convinced were taking it in the 
direction it has to go if were to survive

david sanborn probably the worlds only 
professional alto saxophone player hosting a tv variety show says 
that even the sponsors seem surprised at the favorable ratings 
since october sanborn has been cohost of sunday night a 
weekly latenight musical variety show on nbc affiliates his 
cohost is jools holland keyboardist in the english pop band 
squeeze who once hosted an english tv musical variety show the 
tube 
the ratings have been pretty good sanborn says i think it 
surprised everybody the sponsors included its not exactly a 
wonderful time slot 1230 sunday nights 
sanborn 43 had his first band and cut the first of his dozen 
recordings in 1975 he played with the chicagostyle paul 
butterfield blues band for four years starting in 1967 he also 
toured with stevie wonder gil evans the rolling stones david 
bowie james taylor linda ronstadt rickie lee jones the brecker 
brothers and others 
hes been a semiregular with the band on late night with david 
letterman 
the idea for the variety show he says was presented to me as 
a situation where guest musicians would sit in with a house band and 
it would be a pretty eclectic mix of musicians that appealed to me 
i thought it would be worthwhile doing to show people who 
ordinarily wouldnt get to be on commercial tv like eddie palmieri 
david fathead newman betty wright al green marianne faithfull 
nrbq sonny rollins slim gaillard if we can do something of high 
quality on tv and people like it weve accomplished something 
working on sunday night plus compiling a weekly radio jazz 
show has left sanborn with no time to tour 
ive been fairly successful he says ive been able to make 
a living and im very grateful for it i didnt become a musician to 
make a lot of money 
on sunday night sanborn plays the saxophone every week 
he says on an ideal show we get somebody contemporary and an 
artist who has been around a longer time ivan neville is a young 
singer and ruth brown has been around since the 1950s that would be 
a model show 
wed like to get robert cray with albert king eric clapton 
with etta james bonnie raitt with koko taylor a great idea would 
be tammy wynette and elvis costello thats a tough one 
the biggest problem with sunday night so far sanborn says 
has been finding musicians whose touring schedules permit them to 
appear 
another problem is the lack of time for talk its 
infuriating sanford says you have 30 seconds to do an indepth 
interview with a musician theres no way you can avoid sounding 
superficial 
sanborns the jazz show is syndicated for the third season 
to about 150 radio stations by westwood one radio network 
eating brown rice and millet during an interview in his small 
manhattan apartment sanborn who is divorced says i try to live 
pretty healthy given the schedule that i have 
in an ordinary week we rehearse monday and tuesday for tv 
tape wednesday rehearse thursday and friday tape another show 
saturday and do the radio show on sunday i dont know if i have the 
stamina to keep the radio show going 
he tours with a band in the summertime in 1988 i was in 
europe japan hong kong and had a few dates on the west coast he 
says this summer ill tour in the states ill play a lot of 
indooroutdoor pavilions and 2000 to 5000seat theaters most of 
my audience is concentrated in the big cities 
on his most recent album closeup on reprise sanborn does 
some jazzstyle improvising but i think the rhythmic orientation 
which is to me what defines the idiom is more rhythm n blues than 
jazz he says 
his biggest selling album was a change of heart out in 1987 
after i do something i kind of dump the information about it i 
remember that because it did so well my last four or five albums 
have sold around half a million that one sold about 650000 
sanborn also practices every day as he has been doing since he 
started playing saxophone at age 11 in st louis david newman and 
hank crawford were my idols back then he says they were in ray 
charles band i had their records and heard them live 
i had david newman on sunday night it was a real thrill

when nancy dussault first saw into the woods 
the stephen sondheimjames lapine musical that opened on broadway 
more than a year ago she thought gee i could do that 
she could and eventually did 
in december the buoyant musical comedy performer joined the cast 
of the fairy tale musical as the witch a role originally played by 
bernadette peters 
for dussault the show is something of a homecoming a roundabout 
return to the broadway theater after several long side trips mostly 
to television where she cohosted good morning america and 
appeared in the series too close for comfort 
not that she was completely away from performing on the stage in 
fact when dussault got the call for into the woods she was in 
michigan starring in a production of follies another sondheim 
musical the actress didnt hesitate to come to new york for her 
first broadway show in 10 years 
you dont get that many chances on broadway anymore she 
says today its real hard theres no place for kids to work 
when they tell me im going into the musical theater my heart 
stops 
dussault had no such problems when she began her own career which 
started in the mid1950s with a high school production of 
brigadoon the little girl with the big voice later attended 
northwestern university as a music major and worked at a tent 
theater in highland park ill where one summer she did 12 shows 
we were so young she recalls what did we care how hard we 
worked but we had real training 
every day meant four hours of singing drills then stage 
exercises improvisations learning how to work so close to an 
audience and then lectures on grooming makeup and weight 
maintenance 
i got a great education in the etiquette of theater dussault 
says it was so valuable 
that education came in handy when she made her way to new york 
and first made her name in small revues created by julius monk at 
the famous upstairs at the downstairs 
i loved doing revues two shows a night at 100 a week she 
says when i look at saturday night live im sorry i was just a 
little too old when it started you want someone who does all the 
accents and the insanities and sings even upside down whatever you 
want i can do it 
her big broadway break came in 1960 when she played the ingenue 
in do re mi a musical that starred phil silvers she won a 
theater world award and was nominated for a tony 
after that she never stopped working in the theater at least 
while broadway kept doing big musicals but big shows became fewer 
and fewer 
i really thought i would always be able to make my living in 
the theater dussault says and i did for a long long time 
eventually she realized that to be hired for the theater you had 
to have a name and making a name meant california and television 
i had to go do that and it made me desperately unhappy 
dussault says i just wanted to sing and dance i grew up with 
those kinds of movies and i didnt understand the impact of 
television as it turned out i like doing television a lot 
especially the quickness of it 
she plunged into tv gueststarring on scores of television 
shows today audiences remember her best as the original cohost on 
good morning america and as ted knights wife on too close for 
comfort for much of the 1980s that job provided steady 
employment lasting six years 
people criticized our show as a silly little sitcom she 
recalls but i said no we worked real hard and we tried to 
make it good 
in between there were short tours or limited engagements each 
year in shows like im getting my act together and taking it on 
the road or the michigan engagement of follies but you cant 
play the ingenue forever and those roles were for older women 
im very aware of how long ive been in the business and what 
my age is she says im not a child anymore i know the roles 
are changing for me and i try not to be frightened by it 
thats why she jumped at the chance to play the witch in into 
the woods besides peters such diverse actresses and singers as 
phylicia rashad of the cosby show and cleo laine have tackled it 
i kind of like coming into a show thats already running rather 
than go through all the rigamarole of getting a new musical on 
dussault says 
besides the role gave her a chance to work with sondheim who 
wrote the music and lyrics for into the woods 
he is our guiding light she says i dont quite know how 
to articulate it i guess i think hes a genius he has such passion 
for his job and he works at it so hard 
and he fortunately has gotten into a position when people will 
always pay attention to what he is doing and rightly so hes 
unique 
sondheim went over the music with dussault explaining the 
rhythms and the orchestrations particularly how they work to convey 
emotions 
what happens when her into the woods contract is up in six 
months 
ive been threatening for years to do a onewoman show 
dussault says my biggest problem is trying to decide what that 
would be whether it should be a conglomeration of songs or have a 
theme either way its a lovely way to continue working in the 
theater

this island of 12000 people has been 
british since 1783 but a carved wooden shamrock perches on the 
colonial governors roof and an immigration officer will stamp the 
irish symbol in your passport 
montserrat a pearshaped haven of densely forested mountains 
palm trees multicolored flowers and grayblack volcanic beaches 
between antigua and guadeloupe is a hint of ireland in the 
caribbean 
tourist brochures call it the emerald isle st patricks day is 
a legal holiday and a version of irish stew is a local delicacy 
although the population is 98 percent black and the climate 
semitropical you can flip through the telephone book and imagine 
yourself in killarney row after row of ryans rileys and ogarros 
both the head of government and his main rival are named osborne 
chief minister john and opposition leader bertrand a distant cousin 
driving around montserrat a hilly 11 miles long and seven wide 
you pass st patricks cork hill sweeneys estate carrs bay 
bransby point and galways soufriere a volcanic crater of bubbling 
sulfur 
in the north you find the most irish montserratians of all the 
socalled black irish who make up 10 percent of the population and 
are as likely as not to speak with a hint of brogue and have a tinge 
of red in the hair 
most other montserratians are descendants of slaves who took 
their masters names after emancipation in 1832 when irish people 
greatly outnumbered english on the island 
anthropologist john messenger of ohio state university said the 
black irish descend directly from legal marriages in the 17th 
century between african slaves and irish plantation owners and 
irish customs were passed down through the centuries 
they are very closeknit and inbred he said and three 
family names predominate gibbons sweeney and allen 
among them messenger found montserrats last known irish fiddler 
a few years ago he held the fiddle in the crook of his arm and 
his daughter did an irish stepdance the anthropologist said 
messenger and his wife betty a fellow anthropologist at ohio 
state have been digging at montserrats irish roots since 1965 
they were making their 20th or so visit over the christmasnew year 
school break and talked about their work 
christopher columbus sighted the island in 1493 and named it for 
the serrated mountains and abbey of montserrat in spain the english 
settled montserrat in the early 1600s and gained undisputed control 
in 1783 after a series of wars with the french 
john messenger said there is historical evidence the irish 
arrived in two separate groups in the same year 1632 and settled 
on different parts of the island one contingent came from nearby 
st kitts and the other from jamestown in virginia colony both to 
escape protestant persecution he said 
before long the irish outnumbered the english on montserrat 
they established many of the sugar lime and tobacco plantations 
worked by imported slaves a census record in 1678 gave the 
population as 52 scots 761 english 992 slaves and 1869 irish 
irish people settled throughout the caribbean but became 
concentrated here 
messenger said there was little awareness of the the islands 
irish past until he and his wife wrote several articles for the 
irish times of dublin in 1967 and lectured in ireland 
since then two films on the black irish have been shown in 
europe and the irish and irishamericans have become interested 
we got the ball rolling the anthropologist said 
he said the montserrat tourist industry has promoted the irish 
connection in hopes of attracting irishamericans an estimated 
1500 to 2000 of whom visited last year 
most islanders dont seem all that interested however howard 
fergus a faculty member at the university of the west indies and 
montserrats leading historian suggested irishness is not something 
they would to boast about 
i dont think there is any attachment to the irish he said 
people celebrate st patricks day here but apart from the church 
connection a number of us celebrate it because on that day there was 
a slave rebellion on march 17 1768 
about his own name being irish fergus said yes but it 
doesnt mean anything to me it merely is a slave name the 
irish are white people

perhaps the best thing that ever happened to 20000 
americans with the bleeding disease hemophilia was the discovery of 
treatment with a protein called factor viii it was also probably 
the worst 
fiveminute infusions of this natural substance overcome their 
bodies inability to form blood clots so they can lead nearly normal 
lives but the price has been disastrously high the treatments also 
have given more than half of them aids infections 
the treatment has been made safe again but another crisis looms 
factor viii is in severe sometimes lifethreateningly short supply 
in the new york region weve used 30 to 40 percent less 
clotting factor in 1988 said dr richard lipton of long island 
jewish medical center i dont know if i can say anyone has died 
because of this but we have had some pretty hairy situations trying 
to find factor viii for people who are bleeding 
doctors say that because of the shortage most nonemergency 
surgery has been postponed for hemophiliacs bleeding often is 
treated with less than the recommended doses sometimes with poor 
results users have smaller reserves for emergencies most have 
stopped taking preventive doses and now use clotting factor only for 
actual bleeding 
they also have had to rely more on cryoprecipitate an older 
less convenient therapy that requires a trip to the hospital to 
receive blood plasma that is rich in factor viii this treatment 
carries the same very slight risk of aids as an ordinary blood 
transfusion 
the shortage has produced a tremendous amount of frustration 
and in some people despair in some anger and in some resignation 
said donald s goldman a lawyer from west orange nj who has 
hemophilia 
hemophiliacs represent just 1 percent of the 80000 aids cases 
reported in the united states since 1982 however a larger 
proportion of them are infected than are the other two major risk 
groups homosexual men and drug addicts 
about 60 percent of us hemophiliacs are infected and for those 
with the most severe form of the disease its perhaps 80 percent to 
90 percent said alan brownstein executive director of the national 
hemophilia foundation 
while most of the hemophiliacs who carry the aids virus are still 
healthy doctors fear that many of them will eventually get aids 
hemophilia is caused by a genetic defect passed from mothers to 
sons at conception victims dont produce enough factor viii one 
link in the chemical chain reaction that prompts the body to stop 
bleeding without treatment cuts may bleed for days but the most 
common problem is bleeding internally bleeding into the joints 
causes crippling deformities 
once the only treatment for hemophilia was blood transfusions 
then blood plasma was substituted in the 1960s cryoprecipitate 
became the standard finally in the 1970s factor viii became 
available instead of 30 to 50 trips a year to a hospital for 
infusions people with severe cases could quickly treat themselves 
at work or at home 
we are talking about people who aside from the horrible aids 
tragedy have been liberated by clotting factor said brownstein 
a person with hemophilia can do any job now if they have a 
spontaneous bleeding episode they can mix their preparations and 
infuse themselves on the spot they can do it as conveniently in a 
747 as in their own living room 
factor viii is derived from human blood it takes about 30 liters 
to produce enough clotting factor for one treatment in commercial 
production blood plasma from many people is mixed together a 
single dose may contain elements of blood from 20000 people or more 
no one knew it at the time but during late 1970s and early 
1980s aids virus in the donated blood passed through the 
purification process into the factor viii in 1982 the us centers 
for disease control reported the first three suspected cases of aids 
among hemophiliacs 
in 1984 manufacturers began heating the clotting factor in an 
effort to kill hiv the aids virus and a year later a test became 
available to screen donated blood for the virus since then factor 
viii makers have adopted other cleansing techniques including 
detergents and antibodies 
since 1985 only 18 new aids infections have been documented 
said brownstein who believes the latest strategies have made 
clotting factor hivfree but they have also made it expensive and 
scarce the new processes yield only about half as much factor viii 
per liter as the earlier techniques 
robert w reilly president of the american blood resources 
association an industry group said the price has risen six to 
sevenfold since 1985 enough clotting factor for one person now 
typically costs about 50000 a year brownstein said 
the price and supply were also affected by low demand for 
albumin until recently factor viii was simply a byproduct of the 
business of producing albumin which was used to restore blood 
volume after surgery and burns however albumin is being replaced 
by newer treatments 
factor vii was already in short supply at the start of 1988 but 
the situation became much worse because of problems at the american 
red cross which produces about 20 percent of the countrys clotting 
factor 
last april the red cross discovered it had allowed factor viii 
to be made from blood that should have been discarded because of 
potential aids contamination dr s gerald sandler vice president 
for blood services said that most of this was from people whose 
blood twice tested positive for hiv during initial screening but was 
shown by later confirmatory tests to be safe 
these donations were thrown out but the donors were later 
allowed to give blood again this time their blood passed the 
initial screening test however because of their earlier positive 
results acceptance of the blood was a violation of food and drug 
administration rules 
since then the red cross has released little factor viii 
although it recently resumed production meanwhile about 7 percent 
of the nations usual annual production is on hold officials of the 
red cross and fda believe it is safe but because of errors in the 
way it was produced fda officials say they would be breaking their 
rules if they allowed its release 
paul parkman director of the fdas center for biologics 
evaluation and research said the fda might allow the questionable 
factor to be released as an experimental drug users would have to 
sign consent statements acknowledging that they understood the 
protein did not meet federal standards 
brownstein said that last year 675 million units of factor viii 
were available in the united states and 591 million were used in 
1988 about 450 million units were available and virtually all of 
it was used 
reilly said the major commercial makers expect to improve 
production during 1989 and with the red cross back in business the 
shortage should begin to ease during the second half of 1989

a simple box of cardboard foil and glass is 
being promoted as a means to free third world women from the 
timeconsuming search for firewood and get them out of the unhealthy 
smoke of wood cookfires 
the solar cookers designed by two arizona women are being 
introduced in the third world by pillsbury co we feel the 
potential of solar cookers is so great that it could truly alleviate 
some of the global problems said william h sperber a senior 
research microbiologist at the food conglomerate 
the united nations estimates 15 billion people are affected by 
firewood shortages said robert metcalf a microbiologist at 
california state universitysacramento who attended graduate school 
with sperber at the university of wisconsin 20 years ago and is 
working with pillsbury 
theyve got a lot of sunshine but they dont know how to use 
it metcalf said its fun in the united states it can be very 
useful but its critical in developing countries 
the cooker is an insulated box within a box topped with a glass 
pane and a reflector that directs sunlight it can be made out of 
cardboard or wood and aluminum foil food is cooked in dark 
covered metal glass or ceramic pots 
the temperature peaks at 250275 degrees meaning food takes 
longer to cook than in electric ovens but metcalf says users save 
time by no longer having to collect firewood and by not having to 
stir the food because of the low heat 
metcalf who has been promoting the solar cooker since 1979 was 
joined by pillsbury in 1986 he and sperber have demonstrated it in 
africa and south and central america pillsbury is spending more 
than 100000 on the program 
simplicity may be an obstacle to widespread adoption supporters 
say 
it doesnt look as high tech as other things that have been 
tried said chris flavin vice president of research at worldwatch 
institute a private nonprofit research group that focuses on 
global resource issues 
theres an actual bias in development agencies against anything 
thats small and decentralized said flavin they like to 
support big projects because theyre easy to manage 
flawed cookers produced before the arizona women designed theirs 
also have discouraged widespread use they tipped easily 
temporarily blinded users had reflectors that fell off and were 
able to cook only one pot of food at a time 
barbara kerr of taylor ariz a nurse and sherry cole of tempe 
a former freelance writer and neighbor of kerrs created the 
design in the mid1970s since then cole said theyve sold about 
3000 kits and cookers ranging from 40 to 275 and several thousand 
plans from 1 to 375 
sperber and pillsbury became involved in 1986 while working in 
bolivia with the freedom from hunger foundation a private 
nonprofit group on the problems of lack of firewood high infant 
mortality and diarrhea metcalf and scientists from pillsburys 
technology center have worked to simplify the design so it can be 
better mass produced and more easily assembled in the field 
by trial and error metcalf and his family have developed recipes 
that work with the cooker vegetables which contain moisture dont 
need to be cooked in water they discovered after one soggy 
mess chicken can be cooked in three hours but cant be overcooked 
because the low temperature wont turn moisture in the food to 
steam dry out the food and burn it the normal amount of water is 
added to dried grains such as rice and to beans 
theyre cooking their corn and beans today in guatemala in 
these types of cookers and really taking control of their lives 
he said this is what i want to see happen in hundreds of 
thousands of places around the world

if togetherness is getting you down you 
have an ally in a british psychiatrist who says solitude is more 
than just ok 
it is a fault of my profession that people have been made to 
feel guilty if they enjoy time alone said anthony storr former 
oxford university lecturer in psychiatry and author of solitude a 
return to the self 
the whole emphasis in social work and psychotherapy is all to 
do with interpersonal relations storr said in a recent interview 
im not saying people can do without personal relationships 
im saying its not pathological to spend hours alone in some 
activity 
a great many people on phonein programs in america seemed to 
find it rather a relief said storr whose book published by 
macmillan inc was no 6 for 1987 on the washington post 
nonfiction bestseller list 
on jan blacks journal a radio callin show on kcbs in san 
francisco many callers thought of themselves as weird because 
we are such a social society but they had a desire or need to 
spend time by themselves it gave them a certain sense of relief 
that someone with his credentials said its ok said producer 
charlotte lantz 
i remember one caller in particular a woman who gave a big 
kind of sigh of relief after all the pressure to be with people 
said cordelia maloney producer of extension 720 a callin show 
on wgn radio in chicago 
particularly in the us canada and western europe there is a 
cultural bias that people who want to be alone have something wrong 
with them that its a sign of danger especially in a kid but 
people do in fact need time to be alone said psychology 
professor peter suedfeld dean of the graduate faculties at the 
university of british columbia in canada 
in the 1970s suedfeld studied prisoners in solitary confinement 
and found that generally what they object to is not being alone 
but to harassment of guards cold food things like that some 
even popped a guard in the nose to get put into solitary when 
the pressures of everyday conditions in the prison got to be too 
much for them he said 
we have a social setup said storr that makes people feel 
guilty if they want to go off and read a book families say why do 
you want to do that some people never have anything by themselves 
in their lives 
we need times when we dont have too much input 
and not just input from people he said weve got to a kind of 
stage where people feel that if they havent auditory stimulation 
somethings wrong 
if they didnt have the radio on they might have some more 
interesting thoughts i always walk out of shops if there is music 
going on 
peoples fear of being without sounds comes from fear of 
thoughts storr said they dont want to face what they really 
feel they want to put out of their minds anything thats 
upsetting 
dr arnold modell a clinical professor of psychiatry at harvard 
university said people need to maintain an area of themselves 
that does not communicate with other people that hasnt been known 
as a basic human need even among psychoanalysts but most artists 
know this to be true people need to be within their own world yet 
maintaining contact with other people 
asked why many readers seem to react with such relief toward 
solitude dr arnold richards a new york psychoanalytic society 
spokesman said people often confuse life with psychoanalytic 
exploration of relationships 
psychoanalytic theory does not tell people how to live their 
lives said richards a practicing psychoanalyst in new york city 
its been a fashion for many years to think that happiness 
depends on personal relationships said storr im not a zealous 
person who is trying to convice everybody not to have a 
relationship i just want to give a little push on the pendulum the 
other way

perhaps the best thing that ever happened to 20000 
americans with the bleeding disease hemophilia was the discovery of 
treatment with a protein called factor viii it was also probably 
the worst 
fiveminute infusions of this natural substance overcome their 
bodies inability to form blood clots so they can lead nearly normal 
lives but the treatments also have given more than half of them 
aids infections 
the treatment has been made safe again but another crisis looms 
factor viii is in severe sometimes lifethreateningly short supply 
doctors say that because of the shortage most nonemergency 
surgery has been postponed for hemophiliacs bleeding often is 
treated with less than the recommended doses sometimes with poor 
results users have smaller reserves for emergencies and most have 
stopped taking preventive doses 
they also have had to rely more on cryoprecipitate an older 
less convenient therapy that requires a trip to the hospital to 
receive blood plasma that is rich in factor viii this treatment 
carries the same very slight risk of aids as an ordinary blood 
transfusion 
hemophiliacs represent just 1 percent of the 80000 aids cases 
reported in the united states since 1982 however a larger 
proportion of them are infected than are the other two major risk 
groups homosexual men and drug addicts 
about 60 percent of us hemophiliacs are infected and for those 
with the most severe form of the disease its perhaps 80 percent to 
90 percent said alan brownstein executive director of the national 
hemophilia foundation 
factor viii is derived from human blood a single dose may 
contain elements of blood from 20000 people or more during late 
1970s and early 1980s aids virus passed through the purification 
process into factor viii 
since then factor viii makers have adopted cleansing techniques 
and brownstein believes clotting factor is now hivfree but it also 
has become expensive and scarce the new processes yield only about 
half as much per liter as the earlier techniques factor viii for 
one person typically costs about 50000 a year brownstein said 
factor vii was already in short supply at the start of 1988 but 
the situation became much worse because of problems at the american 
red cross which produces about 20 percent of the countrys clotting 
factor 
since then the red cross has released little factor viii 
although it recently resumed production meanwhile about 7 percent 
of the nations usual annual production is on hold officials of the 
red cross and us food and drug administration believe it safe but 
because of errors in production the fda says it would be breaking 
agency rules if its release was allowed

a simple box of cardboard foil and glass is

timeconsuming search for firewood and get them out of the unhealthy 
smoke of wood cookfires 
the solar cookers designed by two arizona women are being 
introduced in the third world by pillsbury co we feel the 
potential of solar cookers is so great that it could truly alleviate

scientists are trying to find ways to 
catch cosmic dust that could provide clues about the origins of life 
and the solar system 
complicating the problem is that the dust particles zip through 
space at 22370 mph and you must catch them with minimum damage 
sort of like catching a ball with a pillow says joel williams of 
los alamos national laboratory 
the particles often are smaller than onethousandth of an inch 
across 
williams and colleagues at los alamos are evaluating dust 
catchers for the national aeronautics and space administration 
which wants one on its proposed space station the device would look 
like a footthick wall measuring 10by10 feet and would be in 
place up to a year because dust hits are rare said scientist 
debra wrobleski 
many particles striking the collector would come from comets 
and asteroids and studying their chemical composition and structure 
could provide clues about the origin and evolution of the solar 
system los alamos said by catching particles from outside the 
solar system scientists can learn if they contain substances that 
help form amino acids the building blocks of life 
the scientists have found a number of potentially useful 
materials among the foams and stacks of superthin metal foils they 
evaluated with an electron micropscope and other methods the 
materials include polystyrene foams and gold aluminum and beryllium 
foils

survey says 
the 278page atlas of satellite images of antarctica is the first 
chapter in satellite image atlas of glaciers of the world an 
11chapter volume being prepared by the agency the complete atlas 
will provide a global snapsnot of glaciers as they were photographed 
in the 1970s by the landsat satellite 
comparing atlas images with other maps and aerial photographs 
can help scientists determine how the area covered by glaciers 
fluctuates due to natural or humancaused warming or cooling said 
geologist richard s williams jr 
the enormous area of ice concentrated in the glaciers of 
antarctica about 53 million square miles including 91 percent of 
the total volume of glacier ice on earth influences the 
temperature wind and weather patterns over the entire earth said 
williams a coeditor of the atlas project 
changes in the volume and dynamics of the ice sheet therefore 
may cause global climate changes he said in turn changes in 
the temperature of the planet can affect the volume and dynamics of 
the antarctic ice sheet

a computerized suction pump and monitor 
can help surgeons remove the right amount of fat and prevent 
dangerously excessive blood loss in patients undergoing cosmetic 
liposuction surgery 
liposuction is the most common us plastic surgery procedure 
done for aesthetic purposes says the illinoisbased american 
society of plastic and reconstructive surgeons which published a 
study about the pumpmonitor in the journal of plastic and 
reconstructive surgery 
during liposuction the surgeon inserts a small blunttipped 
metal tube into a pocket of fat commonly in the hips thighs or 
abdomen a suction pump connected to the tube sucks the fat into a 
bottle 
but even a small amount of blood turns the bottles contents dark 
red so blood loss is difficult to determine said dr harvey lash 
a plastic surgeon at the palo alto medical foundation and nearby 
stanford university 
the exact determination of blood loss is important to 
prevent shock or anemia lash said guess or estimate may not 
allow the precise replacement of blood and fluids needed for the 
safety of the patient 
precise measurement of fat removal also helps surgeons suck the 
same amount of fat from both sides of the body to give a balanced 
appearance 
the new pump has a color monitor that instantaneously shows the 
amount of blood and fat removed lash and his colleagues were among 
the first to test the device which was developed by his son 
physicianengineer bob lash and is now being marketed nationally 
the device monitors fat and blood loss using two electrodes in 
the bottle fat cells dont transmit electricity but blood 
transmits it well the device determines the ratio of removed blood 
and fat by measuring the amount of electricity that moves from one 
electrode to another

sniff hack honk 
if it seems to you that you have the same exact cold as everybody 
you know maybe the throats not too bad but the sneezing is 
relentless or the cough is terrible but the sniffles havent shown 
up youre probably right 
there are a couple of hundred viruses that can cause the 
common cold according to dr larry anderson a virus specialist 
with the national centers for disease control there will be a 
range of maybe more than one agent circulating at a given time 
but you also may have one predominant virus 
and a certain virus he said will have certain types of 
symptoms 
thus its not surprising when everyone in the office is 
spreading what comes to be known as the same cold 
theyre likely to have the same virus anderson said 
during the winter a particular influenza strain often comes to 
dominate the flu season from coast to coast a particular cold 
virus however doesnt usually spread that far anderson noted 
by and large other viruses dont spread in a national pattern 
like flu does 
the cold going around may vary from community to community or 
even from time to time within the community he said there can 
be one or several types of rhinoviruses causing the colds 
there are a number of government agencies doing research on the 
common cold one of the most loathed diseases around albeit not 
the most serious 
the cdc and the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases study colds the food and drug administration evaluates 
cold treatments even the national center for health statistics 
keeps some facts and figures on the diseaserelated impact of colds 
but with all that theres no cure in sight partly because a 
cure would have to be able to wipe out some 200 specific viruses 
theres so many of them its not like you can develop one 
vaccine that will take care of the common cold anderson said 
if you develop one other viruses are going to evade it

some of the worst albeit memorable advertisements of last year 
adweek magazine said in a survey released today 
in announcing its 7th annual badvertising awards the weekly

voters some incompetent advertising 
it cited the campaign of democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis in particular for its socalled handlers

handlers trying to disguise their candidates alleged shortcomings 
adweek also said some ads run by probush organizations were 
so distateful that the bush campaign was obliged to disown them 
the magazine said the results of its survey were based on 
comments from its editorial staffers and readers 
every year we all see hundreds of ads that are forgettably bad 
a few ads though manage to be memorably bad the trade magazine 
said in its jan 16 issue

members and nonmembers of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries will meet jan 26 in london to 
discuss ways of cooperating to stabilize the world oil market 
opecs secretary general said monday 
indonesias subroto also said that opec had no confirmation of 
published reports that the united arab emirates was exceeding its 
production quota agreed upon at an opec meeting last november 
the january meeting will include representatives of the 13member 
cartel but not necessarily the countries oil ministers subroto 
indicated to reporters after meeting with egypt oil minister 
abdelhady kandil 
the indonesian minister who arrived in cairo sunday night is 
touring nonopec oilproducing countries and already has visited 
colombia and mexico he is to depart wednesday for oman 
subroto said his purpose is to determine what opec and nonopec 
nations can do together 
subroto and kandil said that nonopec oilproducing countries 
will hold a meeting of their own in london jan 25 at omans 
request then experts from opec and nonopec countries would meet 
the following day to prepare the ground for a ministerial meeting 
later he said 
we discussed cooperation and what we shall do together to bring 
stability in the oil market subroto said of his talks with 
kandil certainly one aspect of that cooperation is how to 
influence supply and opec has done its part already by the november 
agreement to reduce production and i think it is now time that 
nonopec producers will also contribute 
kandil however ruled out any further reduction of egypts 
production he said that since october 1984 egypt had reduced its 
daily output in support of opec policies 
egypt is not a member of opec but its oil policy is generally 
guided by the cartels actions 
subroto said that opecs eightminister monitoring committee has 
closely followed each members output looking for possible 
violations of quotas asked about published reports that the united 
arab emirates was exceeding its quota subroto said there was no 
evidence to support such a claim 
subroto said that world oil prices were developing very much 
positively thanks to observance of last novembers opec quotas and 
cooperation between opec and nonopec producers 
opec agreed late last year to reduce its oil output to 185 
million barrels a day from more than 22 million barrels starting 
jan 1 since the agreement world oil prices have risen steadily 
from around the 1213abarrel range to the 1617 range 
the new quota is to remain in effect for six months

if you are still reeling from having to deal 
with a thoroughly rewritten federal income tax last year take 
heart this year there are only a few changes and most of them are 
beneficial 
theres another bit of good news because april 15 falls on a 
saturday you have two extra days to file your 1988 return 
most of the changes enacted by congress in 1986 were in effect 
when returns were filed last year deductions for sales taxes and 
for twoearner couples were repealed the preference for capital 
gains was wiped out individual retirement accounts were limited 
and new restrictions were placed on deductions for consumer interest 
and medical and miscellaneous expenses 
those changes paid for lower tax rates and for higher exemptions 
and standard deductions 
for 1988 returns exemptions and standard deductions are higher 
still and most people will find their rates have dropped again the 
most significant change that could bring higher taxes for some 
people is a further tightening of the deduction for consumer 
interest 
the major changes 
personal exemption you may exempt from taxation 1950 for 
yourself your spouse and each dependent up from 1900 last year 
a student or other person who can be claimed as an exemption by 
another such as a parent may not take an exemption on his or her 
own return 
standard deductions a couple that does not itemize deductions 
may reduce income subject to taxation by 5000 for a single 
person the deduction is 3000 for a head of household 4400 
for a married person filing a separate return 2500 in each case 
a person over 65 or blind gets a higher deduction for example a 
married couple over 65 with one spouse blind and filing jointly is 
allowed 6800 a person who can be claimed as a dependent is 
allowed as little as 500 depending on type and size of income 
tax rates last year there were five rate brackets from 11 
percent to 38 percent now there are four 15 percent 28 percent 
33 percent and 28 percent again for most taxpayers it makes no 
difference how many rates there are since they still determine how 
much they owe by looking at a tax table the net result is that 
under the new law most people will pay a smaller part of their 
taxable income to the government although more of their income may 
be taxable 
mortgage interest a homeowner now may deduct interest on up to 
1 million of debt used to acquire one or two homes plus up to 
100000 of homeequity loans there are no restrictions on how the 
equity loan can be spent 
consumer interest only 40 percent of interest paid on loans for 
education automobiles credit cards and other personal debt is 
deductible on 1988 returns down from 65 percent the previous year 
investment interest deductible interest paid to make investments 
is limited to net investment income plus 4000 any excess may be 
carried over into future years and deducted against investment 
income 
earnedincome credit this benefit for lowerincome working 
families with dependent children has been increased to a maximum of 
874 up from 849 families with earned income as high as 18756 
may qualify up from 15432 in 1987 
mutual funds publicly offered mutual funds will not report 
certain operating expenses as income to shareholders for 1988 and 
1989 thus shareholders will not have to report such amounts as 
income or write them off as miscellaneous deductions this is the 
same treatment allowed for 1987

the new federal tax law has raised the taxfree 
level to the point that a married couple under 65 may have total 
income of up to 8899 and not have to file a return 
just two years ago a couple had to file if income was 5830 or 
more as did a single person whose income was at least 3560 now 
a single person under 65 need not file until income hits 4950 
whether you have to file depends on your income and your filing 
status you must file if your income is more than the total of the 
personal exemptions for yourself and any spouse plus your basic 
standard deduction 
in most cases the filing thresholds are higher if one or both 
spouses is over the age of 65 but they do not increase 
automatically because of blindness as the standard deduction does 
most married couples will find it advantageous to file a joint 
return even though both spouses earn income but there are 
exceptions and the only way to be certain you are making the right 
choice is to figure your taxes twice once on a joint return and 
once on separate returns 
here are guidelines for the various filing statuses 
married filing jointly you must have been married on dec 31 
1988 although there is no requirement that you and your spouse be 
living together you may not be legally separated each spouse is 
liable for the full amount of tax even though one earned no income 
the filing thresholds 8900 if both spouses are under 65 9500 
if one is 65 or older and 10100 if both are 65 or older 
married filing separately the definition of married is the 
same as with a joint return but if you file separately the filing 
threshold is 1950 regardless of age you report only your income 
and none of your spouses and claim only your deductions if one 
spouse itemizes deductions so must the other 
some people may save money by filing separately for example if 
one spouse has a large amount of medical or unreimbursed employee 
expenses more of those deductions could be claimed by filing 
separately 
that is because only medical expenses exceeding 75 percent of 
adjusted gross income and only miscellaneous expenses exceeding 2 
percent of agi may be deducted if for example you have 5000 of 
unreimbursed medical expenses it would be easier to exceed 7 
percent of your income than to exceed 7 percent of the combined 
income of both spouses 
head of household if you qualify for these tax rates which are 
about midway between those for singles and couples filing jointly 
you will have to file a return if income is 6350 or more assuming 
you are under 65 or at least 7100 if 65 or older 
in general you qualify if 
you were unmarried at yearend or your spouse did not live in 
your home during the last six months of the year and 
you paid over half the cost of maintaining your home as the 
principal residence of your unmarried child or grandchild or of a 
married child or grandchild whom you can claim as a dependent or of 
any other relative whom you can claim 
surviving spouse if your spouse died last year and you did not 
remarry filing thresholds are the same as for a married couple 
filing jointly you may claim a 1950 personal exemption for your 
spouse and file a joint return for 1988 as a rule you may use 
joint tax rates but not claim an exemption for the spouse for 
two additional years following the year of death of a spouse if you 
furnish over half the cost of keeping a home for your dependent 
child 
single you must file if income is 4950 or more if under 65 
or 5700 if 65 or older you are considered single if you were 
legally separated or unmarried on dec 31 1988 
the rules are different if you can be claimed as a dependent by 
someone else if all your income was earned wages tips 
scholarships your filing threshold is 3000 if you had any 
earned income such as interest and dividends and you are under 65 
your threshold is 500 the figure rises to 1100 if you are 
married and 65 or older and to 1250 if you are single and 65 or 
older

think back to 1986 when congress passed and 
president reagan signed a sweeping overhaul of the income tax 
remember all the crowing about how there would be only two simple 
tax rates forget it 
look at the 1988 tax rate schedules in your package of tax forms 
and youll see there actually are four marginal rates 15 percent 
28 percent 33 percent and 28 percent again 
where simplicity is concerned as long as there is more than one 
rate it makes little difference whether there are two or 20 
that is because the great majority of taxpayers have no contact 
with tax rates when they fill out their returns unless you have 
taxable income which is what is left after subtracting personal 
exemptions and deductions from your income of 50000 or more you 
simply look at the tax tables find your income read across the 
page to your filing status and see what you owe 
about four of every five taxpayers will pay only the lowest rate 
15 percent on money earned last year these people have taxable 
incomes of up to 17850 if single and up to 29750 if married and 
filing joint returns 
when president reagan proposed acrosstheboard tax cuts in 1981 
his goal was to give people incentive to work more and save more in 
ways that would improve the economy he proposed to do this by 
cutting marginal tax rates as low as possible congress and the 
president had the same thought in mind when they approved the 1986 
overhaul 
a marginal rate is what you would pay on any additional dollars 
you earned for example if you are married and have taxable income 
of 27000 your top marginal rate is 15 percent you are said to be 
in the 15 percent bracket earn another 1 or 1000 and it still is 
15 percent 
but earn 3000 more and your top rate jumps to 28 percent you 
would pay 15 percent on the first 29750 and 28 percent on the 
excess that is on 250 you have jumped into the 28 percent 
bracket 
when reagan took office the top marginal rate was 70 percent 
now it is 33 percent although backers of the overhaul like to 
claim it is 28 percent 
heres how that works 
remember that for a single person for example the first 17850 
of income subject to taxation is taxed at 15 percent any additional 
income between 17850 and 43150 is taxed at 28 percent anything 
between 43150 and 89560 is taxed at 33 percent and then comes 
the complication the 89560 upper limit is increased by 10920 
for each personal exemption claimed thus a single person with a 
dependent child pays 33 percent on taxable income between 43150 
and 111400 
and finally any additional dollars above the top limit are taxed 
at 28 percent 
why jump from a 28 percent rate to 33 percent and back to 28 
percent again the answer is that congressional tax writers wanted 
to have what appeared to be a top rate of 28 percent but did not 
like the idea of having a person with 20000 of taxable income pay 
the same top rate as one with 2 million 
the solution was to deny wealthier americans any benefit of the 
bottom rate of 15 percent and any benefit from the personal 
exemption the net result was to impose a flat tax rate of about 28 
percent it can be more depending on the number of exemptions on 
every taxable dollar earned by these people 
as a sideeffect the welltodo taxpayers who fall into this 
category are facing a 33 percent marginal tax rate on some of the 
extra dollars they earn above the 28 percent bracket for a single 
person with no dependents this surcharge applies on up to 57330 
of income that is on everything between 43150 and 100480 for 
a couple with two children the higher rate applies to 121030 
everything between 71900 and 192930 
the more children in the family the more income that is taxed at 
the 33 percent rate

for the second time in two years congress has 
changed the rules for deducting interest on a home mortgage most 
taxpayers will find the new version more advantageous but they also 
will be able to deduct less consumer interest 
in general you may deduct interest on up to 1 million borrowed 
to buy build or improve your principal home and second home and on 
an additional 100000 for a homeequity loan whose proceeds may be 
used for any purpose but some conditions and definitions make the 
rules considerably more complex 
under the 1986 tax overhaul only 40 percent of interest paid in 
1988 on credit cards auto loans education loans and similar 
consumer borrowing may be deducted that is down from 65 percent 
allowed in 1987 
there are similar restraints on investment interest with an 
added attraction if your 1988 investment income was too low to 
allow you to deduct all your investment interest you may be able to 
carry it over and write it off in a future year 
but back to mortgage interest 
if your outstanding mortgages were taken out before oct 14 
1987 all the interest on one or two homes is deductible and the 1 
million limitation does not apply qualifying loans include money 
borrowed to buy or improve a home as well as homeequity loans 
which usually are incurred after a person has lived in a home for a 
while 
if you borrowed to buy build improve or refinance a home after 
oct 13 1987 the law draws a distinction between acquisition debt 
and homeequity debt 
acquisition debt this is money borrowed to buy build or 
substantially improve a first or second home interest on up to 1 
million may be deducted but that total is reduced by the amount of 
any outstanding mortgage that was taken out before oct 14 1987 
you must be able to prove that a loan was actually used for such 
purpose the internal revenue service will accept as proof evidence 
of acquisition costs incurred within 90 days before or after a loan 
was closed 
homeequity debt interest on up to 100000 of debt is fully 
deductible even though the proceeds of the loan are used for 
nonhousing purposes the loan must be secured by a mortgage on your 
home there is one catch you may not deduct interest on money 
borrowed to make investments such as municipal bonds whose 
interest is taxexempt 
the maximum deductible equity loan is the value of your home 
minus any outstanding acquisition debt or 100000 whichever is 
smaller 
for purposes of a tax deduction your principal home may be a 
cooperative unit condominium houseboat or trailer the second home 
is a vacation home or other place that you may or may not rent out 
part of the time if it is rented out you must use it at least 14 
days a year or 10 percent of the number of days it is rented 
if your mortgage interest payments for 1988 totaled 600 or more 
the company or person holding the mortgage is required to send you a 
form 1098 by jan 31 showing how much interest you paid the lender 
also sends a copy to the irs 
mortgage points may be deducted if they are normally charged in 
your area as a cost of getting a loan and if they are viewed as 
interest not as service charges they may be fully deductible in 
the year paid only on loans to buy or improve your principal home 
otherwise they must be written off gradually over the life of the 
loan 
however the tax court recently upheld the irs position that 
points paid to refinance a mortgage are not deductible 
to be deductible points should be paid by separate check and not 
simply withheld from the proceeds of the loan 
if your income and deductions are high enough you may be subject 
to the alternative minimum tax a flat 21 percent levy which could 
dilute the value of your mortgage deduction 
form 6251 and its instructions let you know if you are subject to 
the minimum tax publication 545 spells out the rules for interest 
deductions publication 936 gives the specifics on the mortgage 
interest deduction

tax overhaul is making taxpayers or at least 
firsttime return filers of many younger americans 
the 1986 law while lowering rates and raising exemptions bars a 
child from taking any exemption if he or she can be claimed as a 
dependent by a parent or someone else in many cases it reduces the 
standard deduction for dependents and it requires any dependent 
with interest dividends or other unearned income totaling as little 
as 501 to file a return 
each personal exemption means a 1950 reduction in 1988 income 
subject to taxation for most taxpayers that is a saving of 29250 
in taxes for those in the 28 percent tax bracket it is a saving of 
up to 546 
five tests must be met for you to claim a person as your 
dependent 
the dependent must be a resident or citizen of the united 
states or a resident of canada or mexico 
he or she must not have filed a joint return with a spouse 
the dependent must be your child grandchild parent 
grandparent brother sister nephew niece uncle aunt son or 
daughterinlaw parentinlaw brother or sisterinlaw or any 
person who is a member of your household and lived with you 
throughout the year 
the dependents gross income for 1988 must have been less than 
1950 this does not apply to your dependent child who either was 
under 19 at the end of the year or was a fulltime student 
you must have furnished more than half the dependents support 
during the year there are exceptions if you are divorced support 
includes foot lodging clothing education medical care 
transportation toys pocket money etc 
if all those conditions are met you may take an exemption for a 
dependent but that dependent cannot take an exemption on his or her 
personal tax return even if you dont actually claim it 
so how are your familys taxes affected if your 17yearold 
daughter had a parttime job and a small savings account last year 
she earned 2500 in the job and 200 interest 
you the parent are allowed to claim her as a dependent for 
that reason and because her gross income exceeds 500 she must 
file a return as well her standard deduction is her total earned 
income or 3000 the usual standard deduction for a single person 
whichever is smaller since her earned income wages tips fees 
and the like was 2500 that also is her standard deduction 
she should file the simplest form 1040ez only 200 of her 
income would be taxable and her tax liability from the tax table on 
page 37 in the instructions would be 32 
in the unlikely event that your daughter had itemized deductions 
exceeding 2500 it would be to her advantage to itemize rather 
than take the standard deduction she then would have to file form 
1040 and schedule a rather than 1040ez 
if she had no unearned income such as interest and dividends 
she would not have to file a return unless her earned income 
exceeded 3000 but she should file to get a refund of any income 
tax that was withheld from her earnings 
in any case the standard deduction for a person who can be 
claimed as a dependent of another may not exceed 500 of the 
dependents earned income whichever is greater 
the real complications occur when your child is under 14 and has 
unearned income of more than 1000 in that case some of the 
childs income will be taxed at your presumably higher maximum tax 
rate you should read the instructions for form 8615 which may have 
to be attached to your childs return 
this new provision is aimed at deterring the avoidance of tax by 
a parents shifting of incomeproducing property to a child 
remember that you must list on your tax return the social 
security number of any child age 5 or older whom you claim as a 
dependent

once you determine that you must file a federal 
tax return the question is which form to use the answer depends on 
your income and marital status and whether you itemize deductions 
use the simplest form the onepage form 1040ez if you are 
single you have no other dependents you dont itemize and your 
taxable income gross income minus any personal exemption is less 
than 50000 your income must have come solely from wages tips or 
taxable scholarships except for up to 400 interest 
the twopage 1040a is for any filing status married single 
head of household allows any number of exemptions but no itemized 
deductions and is restricted to those whose taxable income is under 
50000 but within that income limit you may have in addition to 
wages tips and scholarships any amount of interest dividends and 
unemployment compensation 
a 1040a filer must attach schedule 1 if an individual retirement 
account deduction or childcare credit is claimed or if dividends 
or taxable interest exceed 400 
the long form 1040 is required for filers who dont qualify for a 
shorter one that includes for example anyone who received taxable 
social security benefits or made estimated tax payments in 1988

something new has been added to your federal 
tax package but you probably should not take it too seriously 
as part of a government effort to reduce paperwork the internal 
revenue service now is required to estimate how much time it will 
take to fill out your return so on page 3 of your instruction 
booklet you will find a table estimating the average time required 
for recordkeeping learning about tax law or the form preparing 
the form and for copying assembling and sending the form to the irs 
the filer of a long form 1040 could be a fourmember family 
struggling to stay above the poverty line with 25000 income and 
no itemized deductions or the filer could be a millionaire whose 
stock transactions require a 100page document just to list 
nevertheless the irs estimates average all the 1040 filers 
together and recordkeeping will require 3 hours and 7 minutes 
learning about the law or the form 2 hours and 28 minutes 
preparing the form another 3 hours and 7 minutes and the rest of 
the work 35 minutes 
throw in a schedule a for itemized deductions and the average 
1040 filer is looking at 13 hours and 51 minutes

an individual retirement account can be a 
valuable asset for your later years and if you qualify reduce your 
current taxes as well 
even though your income may be too high to qualify you for a 
taxdeductible ira it still may be to your advantage to have a 
nondeductible ira interest that your ira earns will not be taxed 
until you make a withdrawal from the account presumably after you 
pass the age of 59 
there still is time to open an ira for 1988 you have until 
midnight april 17 the deadline for filing your tax return 
if you are single and not covered by a company pension plan your 
ira contribution is fully deductible no matter how high your 
income if you are covered by a company plan you qualify for a full 
deduction so long as your adjusted gross income is 25000 or less 
you get a partial deduction if income is between 25000 and 
35000 and no deduction once income hits 35000 
similarly if neither spouse is under a company pension plan a 
couple may make a fully deductible contribution no matter how high 
their income but if one or both spouses is in a company plan a 
full contribution is deductible only if income on a joint return is 
40000 or less a reduced deduction is allowed as income rises 
above 40000 no deduction is permitted above the 50000 income 
level 
in any case if the income limitations restrict you to a 10 or 
20 deduction for example you may deduct at least 200 that means 
that if you qualify for a deduction at all you may claim 200 
assuming you actually contributed that much to your ira 
whether your ira contribution is fully or partially deductible or 
not deductible at all the maximum deposit is 100 percent of your 
earned income up to 2000 if one spouse has a paying job and the 
other does not each may have an ira but total contributions may not 
exceed 2250 a year that can be divided in any number of ways so 
long as neither account gets more than 2000 
to claim a deduction for an ira contribution you must file 
either form 1040a plus schedule 1 or the long form 1040 calculate 
your deduction by using one of the two worksheets in the 
instructions 
use form 8606 to report any nondeductible ira contributions if 
you and your spouse each make such contributions you must file 
separate 8606s even though you file a joint tax return the same 
form is used to report 1988 withdrawals from your ira 
it is important to retain a copy of your form 8606 because you 
may need it in the future to prove that your ira contributions 
already have been taxed 
publication 590 free from the irs explains what you need to 
know about ira contributions and withdrawals

you may have to pay income tax on up to half 
the social security benefits you received in 1988 
part of your benefits is taxable if your total income including 
half the benefits and all your taxexempt interest exceeds 32000 
if you are married and filing a joint return in the case of a 
single person the threshold is 25000 
if any of your social security is taxable you will have to file 
the long form 1040 
assuming you and your spouse file a joint return you received 
7000 in social security benefits your nonsocial security income 
totaled 37000 and you list income adjustments of 2000 here is 
how to determine what is taxable 
add half your social security 3500 to your other income 
including taxexempt interest 37000 40500 
subtract any adjustments that you list on lines 24 through 29 
on form 1040 such as reimbursed employee business expenses and 
alimony paid 2000 that leaves 38500 
subtract the threshold for a couple filing jointly 32000 
that leaves 6500 if you get zero or less here none of your 
social security is taxable 
take half of that 6500 3250 
compare that 3250 with the 3500 representing half your 
social security benefits you pay tax on the smaller 3250 that 
figure is reported as taxable social security on line 21b of 1040 
if you are married lived with your spouse at any time last year 
and are filing a separate return the threshold figure is zero a 
single person head of household or married person who did not live 
with a spouse at any time in 1988 has a 25000 threshold 
the government should send you by jan 31 a form ssa1099 
showing social security benefits you were paid last year the 
important figure is in box 5 
use the same rules and computations if you received railroad 
retirement benefits in that case you should receive form rrb1099 
in the mail 
special rules apply if you repaid any social security benefits 
last year publication 915 free from the irs explains this and

up to 10 million families are expected to 
reduce their 1988 tax bills by as much as 1440 by claiming the 
credit for dependentcare expenses 
the credit generally is available to a taxpayer who in order to 
find or keep a job pays another person to care for a child under 15 
or other dependent that dependent could be a disabled spouse any 
disabled person who could be claimed by the taxpayer as a dependent 
or a disabled person who had 1950 or more in income and thus 
could not be claimed by another 
the hired person may not be your spouse your child under the age 
of 19 or any person you may claim as a dependent in the case of a 
couple both spouses must work full time or part time to claim the 
credit unless one is a fulltime student or is disabled 
the credit applies to amounts paid for household services and 
care of the dependent while the taxpayer works or looks for work 
these can include services of a cook babysitter or housekeeper in 
the home as well as costs of outside care for a child under 15 but 
not costs of overnight camp outside care for a disabled dependent 
of any age also is covered if that person regularly spends at least 
eight hours a day in your home 
special rules apply to children of divorced or separated parents 
there are these limitations on the credit 
the total of claimed dependentcare expenses may not exceed 
your earned income wages fees tips and the like or in the case 
of a couple the earnings of the lowerpaid spouse 
the maximum claimed expenses are 2400 for one dependent and 
4800 for two or more 
the credit is for 30 percent of eligible expenses if your 
adjusted gross income is 10000 or less it drops one percentage 
point for each 2000 of income the credit is 20 percent for income 
above 28000 
taxpayers who file the long form 1040 must also fill out form 
2441 to claim the credit filers of 1040a must attach schedule 1 
claiming the childcare credit can bring these complications 
if you pay 50 or more in a calendar quarter to someone who 
cares for your dependent you generally must pay social security tax 
of 751 percent on those wages withhold another 751 percent from 
the workers wages and forward the full 1502 percent each quarter 
by filing form 942 
paying wages of 1000 or more in a quarter may also subject 
you to paying unemployment taxes get form 940 for details 
you may have to calculate whether you are subject to the 
alternative minimum tax this is a flat 21 percent tax that you pay 
only if it exceeds your regular income tax it is aimed at 
preventing welltodo people from totally avoiding taxes through use 
of large deductions 
check the back of form 2441 to see whether you should be 
concerned about the minimum tax

its easy to avoid the most common error found 
on federal tax returns just be sure to claim the right standard 
deduction 
every year the experts sample returns on which errors have been 
found and every year the results are the same thousands of 
taxpayers who dont itemize deductions write down the wrong standard 
deduction 
the problem was made worse by the 1986 tax overhaul which 
limited the standard deduction for taxpayers mostly students who 
can be claimed as a dependent by someone else the new law also 
complicated the standard deduction for those who are blind or at 
least 65 
if you file the long form 1040 get your standard deduction from 
page 17 of the instructions see pages 28 and 29 if you file 1040a 
or 1040ez 
thousands of other taxpayers make errors in arithmetic and 
although such mistakes usually are caught by an irs computer they 
likely will delay any refund 
another common error can be most costly large numbers of 
lowerincome working families that are eligible for the 
earnedincome credit fail to claim it others make the wrong 
calculations to determine whether you are eligible check the 
worksheet on page 20 of the 1040 instructions or page 35 of the 
1040a instructions 
some other things to remember

be sure you copy the right figure when you read across the tax 
tables to find your tax liability 
even the rule for rounding off to whole dollars has been 
complicated the irs says for example that you may round off 139 
to 1 and 250 to 3 but if you have to add two or more figures 
to arrive at the amount to enter on a line round off only the total 
not the individual figures 
if you had two or more employers and earned more than 45000 
last year you may have had too much social security tax withheld 
from your paychecks the excess may be subtracted from income taxes 
owed 
tax on your series e or ee us savings bonds is due no later 
than when they are redeemed however you may choose to report the 
interest each year when it accrues and pay tax annually 
the law says you have not filed a return unless it is signed 
you could face a 500 penalty for filing a return that does not 
include basic information necessary to determine your tax liability 
and even if you feel the need to protest dont cross out or alter 
the under penalties of perjury declaration just above the 
signature line that would void the return 
keep all records pertaining to your taxes for at least three 
years records on the sale purchase or improvement of property 
including your home should be kept permanently as should paperwork 
on your individual retirement account 
you must file schedule b for form 1040 or schedule 1 for 
1040a if you received taxable interest or dividends exceeding 400 
the irs needs to know how much taxexempt interest you received 
last year it should be listed on line 8b dont include interest 
earned on your individual retirement account 
by feb 15 you should receive from your employer a w2 form 
showing your 1988 income if you dont ask for it lack of a w2 
does not excuse you from filing and paying any due tax by the april 
17 deadline 
if you cannot complete your return by the deadline file a form 
4868 instead which gives you an automatic extension to aug 15 
however you must estimate how much tax you owe and send a check for 
that amount with form 4868 
the sequence numbers listed under 1988 in the upper right 
corner of your tax forms tell you in what order the supplemental 
forms and schedules should be attached to your 1040 
you may have heard that if you use the preprinted stickon 
label on your return you are making it easier for the irs to select 
your return for an audit nonsense say experts outside the irs the 
label simply makes it easier for your return to be processed through 
a computer 
if you are selfemployed you may deduct on line 6 of form 1040 
25 percent of what you paid for health insurance for yourself and 
your family the deduction may not exceed your net selfemployment 
income and you dont get it if you are covered by an employers 
health insurance 
investors in enterprises that generate losses may be subject to 
a whole new set of tax rules in general a loss from a passive 
activity something in which you do not materially participate may 
not be used to avoid taxes on nonpassive income such as wages 
check irs publication 925 
if you deduct alimony payments your return must show the 
social security number of the recipient the recipients return must 
show your number 
dont forget to put a stamp on your envelope it isnt a filed 
return until it is received by the irs and the postal service 
probably will not send it without a stamp

recent tax laws have cut deeply into deductions 
traditionally claimed by millions of taxpayers many writeoffs have 
been lost entirely because of higher thresholds on deductions for 
medical and miscellaneous expenses 
but there still are enough deductions left to make it worthwhile 
for onethird of taxpayers to itemize 
one of the most expensive changes for individuals in the 1986 tax 
overhaul was repeal of the deduction for state and local sales 
taxes but state and local income and property taxes are still 
deductible 
only unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7 percent of 
adjusted gross income may be deducted certain uninsured 
nonbusiness casualty losses such as from fires may be deducted 
subject to a 10 percent threshold 
there is a 2 percent limit on miscellaneous deductions that 
applies to such things as unreimbursed employee expenses including 
union dues tools work clothes but not if suitable for street 
wear protective safety shoes and glasses investment expenses 
such as advice subscriptions and rental of safe deposit boxes in 
which investmentrelated papers are stored and taxpreparation fees 
1988 is the last year to deduct subject to the 2 percent rule a 
portion of the basic monthly home telephone service charge as an 
expense of producing income 
very few miscellaneous expenses may be deducted without regard to 
the 2 percent threshold these include certain workrelated expenses 
of handicapped people and gambling losses up to the amount of 
gambling winnings 
some other deductions 
if you use your own car for the benefit of a taxexempt 
charity including driving to and from the organization you may 
deduct 12 cents a mile or the cost of gas and oil plus in either 
case parking fees and tolls 
on the other hand driving your child to the hospital gets you 
a medicalexpense deduction of only 9 cents a mile or gas and oil 
plus parking and tolls these transportation expenses are lumped in 
with other reimbursed medical expenses and subject to the 7 percent 
threshold 
over the years the definition of medical expenses has been 
expanded in addition to such traditional costs as physicians and 
dentists fees and prescription drugs the term can include a hair 
transplant drugabuse treatment a closedcaption television device 
for the deaf a facelift or even musical lessons prescribed to 
correct an overbite 
use form 1040 line 28 to report penalties paid for early 
withdrawal of savings you wont be taxed on that amount 
if you itemize you may be able to write off certain expenses 
incurred in connection with a jobrelated move if the new job is at 
least 35 miles farther from your old home than was the old job for 
example if your old job was three miles from home you new job must 
be at least 38 miles from the old home if you had no previous job 
the new job must be 35 miles or more from your old home publication 
521 free from the irs gives details 
use form 8283 to report gifts other than money to charity when 
the value exceeds 500 no breakdown is required on your return if 
such gifts are 500 or less but you would be wise to keep records 
in general you are allowed a deduction for contributions of money 
or ordinaryincome property as opposed to property that could 
produce a capital gain up to 30 percent of your adjusted gross 
income 
nonbusiness losses due to fire theft storm and similar 
events may be deductible misplacing or breaking a valuable item is 
not a deductible loss after absorbing the first 100 of each loss 
you may deduct only the total amount of all losses in a year that 
exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income see form 4684 
here are some expenses that are not deductible scientology fees 
funeral expenses health club dues the value of your services 
donated to charity fines termite or moth damage overthecounter 
drugs even if prescribed diaper service gifts to foreign 
charities child support and costs of commuting from home to work

theres a new twist in the tax law for sports 
fans who give to the ol alma mater 
even if your gift to a college or university entitles you to buy 
season tickets you still may take a charitable deduction for 80 
percent of your donation 
this new law enacted last year overturns a 1983 ruling by the 
internal revenue service 
the irs noted that in many cases games are sold out long in 
advance and the only way to be assured of getting a ticket is to 
make a donation to the college or its athletic programs therefore 
the irs insisted the privilege of buying a ticket had value and a 
charitable deduction is prohibited when the donor receives something 
of value in return 
lawmakers would have none of that so under a 1988 law you may 
deduct 80 percent of such contributions if as part of the 
arrangemnt you receive the right to purchase tickets if you 
receive no such right the contribution is 100 percent deductible 
if you receive tickets as part of the deal none of the contribution 
may be deducted 
the new law applies retroactively to contributions given after 
dec 31 1983

capital gains are an aspect of tax law that 
most people encounter only in connection with the sale of their 
home but in many cases taxation on profits from a home sale is 
deferred or avoided entirely 
in general the law treats such gains in much the same way that 
it treats profits from the sale of stock land coins or other 
property that means any profit is taxable income and under the new 
law there is no automatic exclusion of a portion of capital gains 
however there are two outs when the capital gain is from the 
sale of your principal home 
first if certain conditions are met any tax on the gain is 
deferred so long as you buy a replacement home that costs at least 
as much as your old home sold for the replacement must be bought 
within 24 months before or 24 months after the old one is sold 
if your new one costs less than the adjusted selling price of 
your old home you pay tax on the profit from the sale or on the 
portion of the sales price that exceeds the cost of the new home 
whichever is less you reduce the tax bite by adjusting the sales 
price of the old home to reflect points fixup expenses real 
estate commissions and legal fees you paid 
deferral of gain on your home sale is not optional you must do 
it anytime you buy a principal home whose price equals or exceeds 
the adjusted sales price of your old one 
second if you or your spouse are 55 or older you may avoid 
tax on the first 125000 of profits this option is available only 
once in a lifetime to qualify the property must have been your 
principal home for at least three of the last five years before the 
sale 
the miscellaneous tax bill that congress passed last october made 
two minor changes affecting these provisions 
one ensures that a couple will not be denied the benefits of the 
deferral because one spouse dies after the old home is sold but 
before the new one is bought 
the second stipulates that a person 55 or older who becomes 
mentally or physically incapable of selfcare during the fiveyear 
period preceding the home sale will be deemed to have met the 
residency requirement if up to four of the five years are spent in a 
nursing home 
if you sold a principal home in 1988 you should check 
publication 523 which is free from the irs whether you purchased a 
replacement home or claimed the special benefit for those 55 or 
older you probably will have to file a form 2119 
any gain that is taxable must be reported on 1040 schedule d 
did you sell your home in 1988 and wont receive some of the 
proceeds until 1989 or later you may have to report such 
installment sales on form 6252

more than half of americas taxpayers 60 percent of the 107 
million will be hiring professional tax preparers this year 
according to an article in lears magazine 
the number compares to 40 or 45 percent who sought professional 
help on their taxes last year says lears a yearold magazine 
aimed at women over 40 
the article written by lisa collier cool author of three 
business books and a regular magazine contributor on financial 
affairs offers these alternatives for those seeking tax preparation 
help 
for those with relatively simple tax returns there is free 
taxpreparation assistance available from the internal revenue 
service 
of course even when irs employees provide correct information 
they arent likely to volunteer strategies to reduce a tax bill 
writes ms cool but if an agent who helps with a return makes 
mistakes the taxpayer isnt charged interest fees or penalties 
least expensive tax help is available from uncertified public 
accountants and franchised storefront services 
they are also the least accurate according to the irs says 
lears 
certified public accountants and enrolled agents tax 
preparers certified by the irs can represent taxpayers at audits 
and in tax court 
because of their high level of professional training says 
lears cpas and enrolled agents who generally charge from 50 to 
100 an hour can and will do more than merely fill in the blanks on 
a 1040 form many will offer ideas on tax planning tips on 
keeping records and advice on deductions to be aware of throughout 
the year 
tax attorneys generally deal with highincome earners whose 
financial affairs are more complicated than most their fees range 
from 80 to 350 an hour

billion bill 
theoretically the federal home loan bank board which regulates 
the sampl industry expects enough income over the next 30 years 45 
billion to 50 billion to cover the cost 
but analysts and many members of congress say regulators have run

the government said today that it was looking at a 
possible bid for the electronics giant general electric co plc that 
an international consortium is expected to launch within days 
the takeover which analysts say could be worth between 115 
billion and 142 billion would be the largest in britain 
the consortium is expected to include plessey plc another 
electronics company which is the target of a 3 billion hostile 
takeover bid from gec and siemens ag of west germany another 
electronics company 
although no bid for gec has been formally launched the office of 
fair trading has legal powers to look at a bid in contemplation 
we really are looking at the situation to see who the 
participants are involved before we can take real active steps 
said a spokesman for the office who asked not to be identified 
there hasnt actually been a statement of intention 
the office of fair trading usually reviews a bid and then makes a 
recommendation to the trade secretary on whether he should refer it 
to the monopolies commission for a full investigation 
the bid speculation prompted heavy trading in gec on londons 
stock exchange by midday monday 
a gec spokesman who wasnt identified in accordance with british 
practice called the developments vague and inconclusive but said 
that a takeover would be fought 
this appears to be a selfinterested attempt by the board of 
plessey and its advisers to form a consortium to break up gec and 
therefore save plessey he said 
the possible bid for gec began to be taken seriously after the 
investment firm lazard brothers and co said over the weekend that 
it had helped form a company called metsun ltd to devise a proposal 
which may or may not lead to an offer for gec 
metsun is headed by sir john cuckney chairman of helicopter 
maker westland plc which was at the center of a 1986 takeover 
controversy that prompted the resignation of two british cabinet 
ministers 
metsun was talking to possible partners both in britain and 
abroad lazard brothers said without identifying them 
french electronics company thomsoncsf said it was considering 
joining the consortium 
meanwhile barclays bank plc confirmed it was putting together a 
62 billion syndicated loan to help finance such a bid 
gec managing director lord weinstock said in a television 
interview that his company dropped barclays bank as one of its banks 
because the bank had behaved in a way that was not quite right 
in addition lord prior gecs chairman resigned saturday from 
the board of barclays bank 
potential foreign interest in such an important british 
manufaturing company is a sensitive political issue particularly 
following the controversy surrounding westland 
american helicopter maker sikorsky aircraft acquisition of a 
stake in westland britains only helicopter builder over rival 
european bidders created the government controversy in 1986 
michael heseltine who resigned as defense secretary in 
opposition to the american bid for westland was spearheading 
demands monday for trade secretary lord young to refer the gec 
matter to the monopolies and mergers commission without delay 
the opposition labor party has said it will raise the issue in 
the house of commons as a matter of the utmost urgency when 
members of parliament return from the christmas recess on tuesday

president reagan today sent congress a 115 
trillion farewell budget that attacked his biggest economic failure 
the federal deficit by offering up again some of his cherished 
ideas about reducing the size of government 
the presidents ninth and final spending plan out of balance 
like all of his others is largely an academic exercise certain to 
be overhauled to reflect the priorities of a democraticcontrolled 
congress and an incoming president george bush after his 
inauguration jan 20 
bush aides said that the presidentelect agreed with the general 
thrust of the reagan document especially the absence of any new 
taxes but still intended to submit his own recommendations after 
taking office 
if reagans ideas were adopted in their entirety the deficit 
would fall to 925 billion in the 1990 fiscal year the lowest 
since 1981 when he took office 
this budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is 
possible without raising taxes reagan said in his budget message 
it can be done in a reasonable responsible way with discipline 
and fairness new taxes are not required 
in his proposals for the fiscal year that starts oct 1 1989 
reagan advocated terminating a total of 82 government programs 
slashing spending on farm programs by 97 billion and trimming the 
growth in medicare and medicaid the giant health programs by about 
5 billion the pentagons budget on the other hand was awarded a 
big spending increase 
the budget would provide increased spending for two of the 
governments most pressing new problems bailing out hundreds of 
insolvent savings and loan institutions and cleaning up contaminated 
nuclear weapons plants aids research and space exploration would 
also receive increases 
while reagan was presenting his budget only 11 days before 
leaving office many of its broad outlines were expected to be 
adopted by bush who has said he will unveil his own proposals to a 
special joint session of congress soon after taking office 
in two key respects the two budgets will be alike both men 
pledged to cut the deficit which is projected to climb this year to 
1615 billion without resorting to new taxes and without touching 
social security 
but bush is expected to seek a smaller increase in defense 
spending while allocating more money in such areas as child care 
cleaning up the environment and housing the homeless 
skeptical democrats believe bush will find it impossible to 
fulfill all his campaign promises for higher spending while relying 
on a flexible freeze on other government programs to eliminate 
the budget deficit without resorting to new taxes 
president reagans final budget is really irrelevant at this 
point rep william gray dpa former chairman of the house 
budget committee said today on cbs this morning it is a 
farewell gesture that every president is required to do it only 
becomes relevant if george bush today tomorrow or this week says 
thats my budget i dont expect him to do that senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine called reagans proposal amiable 
fiction 
reagan will leave office with a budget that proposes collecting 
1059 trillion in revenues and spending 1152 trillion leaving a 
budget deficit of 925 billion 
the deficit if realized would be the lowest since a 737 
billion imbalance between spending and revenues in 1981 the year 
reagan took office with a pledge to balance the budget by 1984 
reagan saw that promise swamped by a tide of red ink which has 
almost tripled the national debt 
in his budget message reagan blamed the huge deficits on the 
severe 198182 recession which reduced government revenues and on 
the refusal of congress to go along with his spending cuts but he 
predicted that the deficit could be totally eliminated by 1993 if 
congress adopts his spending cuts similar predictions of future 
budget deficits in past reagan budgets have proved to be wildly 
optimistic however 
we have an opportunity this year to put the worst of the 
deficit problem behind us and enable the next administration to 
begin its term of office with a clean slate reagan said 
reagans 925 billion deficit target for 1990 would be well 
within the grammrudman requirement which sets a 100 billion 
deficit goal for 1990 this law establishes declining deficit 
targets leading to a balanced budget in 1993 holding out the threat 
of acrosstheboard spending cuts if the targets are not met 
many private economists believe reagans 1990 deficit estimate is 
based on overly optimistic assessments about how the economy will 
perform including expectations that growth will continue at a rapid 
clip while inflation and interest rates both decline 
among the 82 individual programs recommended for termination by 
reagan are the interstate commerce commission the legal services 
corporation the economic development administration the 
appalachian regional commission direct loans by the small business 
administration amtrak railroad passenger subsidies mass transit 
grants and subsidies to airlines serving small airports 
reagan has tried and failed over the years to get congress to go 
along with these proposals 
the presidents final budget protects his defense buildup one of 
the hallmarks of his presidency by proposing a 54 percent increase 
to 3152 billion in spending authority 2 percent higher than the 
expected rate of inflation as part of the increase the budget 
seeks a 44 percent increase in spending authority for development of 
the spacedbased star wars nuclear defense shield 
spending authority reflects not only the checks that will be 
written in a given year but also authorization for outlays on 
weapons systems that are begun in one year but paid for in future 
years defense outlays for 1990 are projected at 303 billion 
compared to estimated outlays of 2983 billion in 1989 
the president also proposes making a downpayment of 900 million 
to start cleaning up and modernizing the governments aging nuclear 
weapons facilities a project that the energy department estimates 
could cost as much as 128 billion over the next two decades 
likewise the budget projects spending 16 billion this year and 
9 billion next year to bail out hundreds of insolvent savings and 
loan institutions from 1988 through 1994 reagans budget estimates 
spending to mop up the sampl mess will exceed 80 billion but leaves 
the problem of finding the necessary funds to the incoming bush 
administration 
in the area of cuts reagans budget proposed trimming the huge 
medicare program which provides health care to social security 
recipients by 32 billion below the projected increase for 1990 
primarily by reducing the fees received by doctors and hospitals 
medicaid which pays the health bills of poor people would be 
cut by 17 billion over its projected increase for 1990 with the 
savings coming from reductions in federal payments to the states 
which run the medicaid program

the supreme court today refused to let the 
government permit japanese salmon fishermen off the alaska coast 
from using huge nets in which porpoise and other marine mammals get 
trapped 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that blocked such fishing 
at issue is an interpretation of a federal law the marine mammal 
protection act of 1972 which spells out how marine mammals may be 
taken hunted captured or killed in us waters 
the law generally bans all such takings of marine mammals but 
contains an exception allowing the secretary of commerce to 
authorize specified takings incidental to commercial fishing 
the secretary however may not allow incidental takings of any 
marine mammal species in danger of significant depletion or 
extinction 
the united states requires fishing permits within a 200mile 
protected zone 
in 1986 the federation of japan salmon fisheries cooperative 
associations sought to extend a permit under which it would be 
entitled to snare up to 5500 dalls porpoise a year in salmon 
gillnets cast in the waters of the north pacific ocean and the 
bering sea 
other sea mammals such as northern fur seals and sea lions also 
become snarled in the nets some of which are nine miles long 
commerce secretary c william verity issued a general permit for 
the japanese fishermen to operate after finding that the dalls 
porpoise population would not be threatened 
he could not make such a determination however for the northern 
fur seal or northern sea lion populations 
environmental and native alaskan groups challenged the legality 
of granting a permit to the japanese fishermen 
a federal trial judge blocked the fishing operations during the 
salmon season last june and july the judge said the government 
could not assure that some marine mammals surely to be caught in the 
nets are not in danger of depletion or extinction 
the us circuit court of appeals here upheld the injunction by a 
21 vote and the supreme court rejected the reagan adminstrations 
emergency challenge of that ruling last june 9 
in the appeal acted on today justice department lawyers argued 
that the practical effect of the appeals courts feb 16 ruling 
would be to shut down large segments of commercial fishing by both 
domestic and foreign entities in us waters 
but lawyers for the environmental and native alaskan groups urged 
the justices to reject the appeal 
lawyers for the center for environmental education contended that 
marine mammal protection act amendments enacted last november 
indicate that congress agreed with the appeals courts 
interpretation of the law 
congress intentionally drafted the amendments so as to 
exclude the japanese driftnet fleet and reauthorized the 
prohibitions in the act in their existing form they argued 
the case is verity vs center for environmental education 88428

grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly 
lower today on the chicago board of trade in response to the 
cancellation of some us export business and to weekend showers in 
the south american soybean belt 
the agriculture department said late friday that private 
exporters had reported cancellations of sales of 240000 metric tons 
of us soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations analysts said 
the most likely buyer was the soviet union which occasionally is 
forced to cancel grain purchases due to limited port space 
unexpectedly heavy weekend showers in one of brazils most 
important soybean growing regions also contributed to the early 
selling of soybean futures analysts said 
but the weekend was drier in argentina a large producer of 
soybeans wheat and corn which helped limit losses on the us 
futures markets said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago 
argentina is a much bigger exporter of wheat and corn than 
brazil he said 
cautious trading is expected this week ahead of fridays usda 
crop report 
in early trading wheat was unchanged to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 446 a bushel corn was cent 
to 1 cent lower with march at 288 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 
2 cents lower with march at 241 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents

the supreme court today barred texas officials 
from requiring cabooses or alternative safety equipment on most 
trains traveling through the state 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that federal law 
preempts such state regulation 
the texas railroad commission in 1986 adopted a rule requiring 
cabooses capable of communicating with the locomotive on all trains 
carrying various hazardous materials and on trains more than 2000 
feet long that lack mechanical devices for monitoring the train and 
track 
the regulation was designed to allow someone in the caboose to 
make sure brakes axles and wheels are not overheating and to check 
for any problems behind the train 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals threw out the rule last 
july the appeals court noting the safety aspects of cabooses 
generally have been supplanted by technological advances said the 
federal railroad safety act of 1970 preempts the states regulation 
cabooses once were essential to train operation in the days when 
brakes were located there the appeals court said 
but now it said automatic brakes are controlled from the 
locomotive advances in wheel bearings decrease the risk of 
overheating and monitoring devices simulate rearcar observation 
major railroads through collective bargaining with their unions 
in 1982 eliminated cabooses from about onefourth of all trains 
the 5th circuit court said congress in passing the federal 
railroad safety act determined that cabooses do not involve safety 
the issue is one for collective bargaining the appeals court said 
under these circumstances we are compelled to conclude that 
the act has impliedly preempted state regulation of cabooses 
the appeals court said requiring cabooses in some states would 
burden interstate commerce by forcing the railroads to attach 
cabooses at all times or stop at state borders where they are 
required to attach them the appeals court said 
texas regulation permits railroads to avoid the need for cabooses 
by installing load and overheating detectors and other devices along 
the track 
but the appeals court said the requirement for those devices is 
preempted by federal law as well 
the texas railroad commission said the 5th circuit court ruling 
permits collective bargaining to override governmental regulation 
of a safety issue 
the case is railroad commission of texas vs missouri pacific

for the second week in a row the number of 
working oil and natural gas rigs took a plunge this week by 36 to 
total 872 industry watcher baker hughes inc reported 
last week the count plunged by 32 to total 908 following a 
twoweek increase of 25 rigs a year ago the number of rigs totaled 
1102 baker hughes said monday 
the decline follows normal seasonal patterns according to baker 
hughes economist ike kerridge 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity 
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of 
last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level last year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states wyoming saw the steepest 
decline with 10 fewer rigs followed by new mexico nine louisiana 
five kansas and pennsylvania four each michigan and texas three 
each and north dakota one 
oklahoma had the biggest gain with six additional rigs followed

federally mediated talks between eastern airlines 
and its largest union apparently broke off today the company said 
i confirm that at this point negotiations halted eastern 
spokesman robin matell said right now we are assessing what is 
happening 
i dont want to give any positions at this point matell 
added we would reserve our comment 
machinists district 100 president charles e bryan wasnt 
immediately available for comment today nor were national mediation 
board chairman walter wallace and mediator harry bickford who was 
joined by wallace for talks beginning last friday at the sheraton 
hotel in key largo fla 
the easternmachinists negotiations went into federal mediation 
nearly one year ago after direct negotiations stalemated wallace 
joined bickford in an effort to get the talks moving but sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity said there had been virtually no 
progress during the lengthy weekend sessions 
eastern has been pressing for federal declaration of an impasse 
which would begin a 30day coolingoff period after the 30 days 
the union could strike and the company could impose its own work 
conditions 
eastern says only the pressure of a deadline which the mediators 
have refused to set will get the negotiations moving the union has 
claimed eastern wants to provoke a strike so it can try to break it 
and bust the union 
eastern put out a bulletin to its employees sunday reporting that 
the machinists lead negotiator had walked out william scheri the 
national machinists union airline chief negotiator had 
participated for the first time in the eastern mediation last 
weekend but left key largo on sunday 
mr scheris sudden departure after the wallace announcement of 
no deadline for these talks reinforces our previously stated 
belief that the iam will not take the talks seriously until the nmb 
starts the 30day cooling off period the company bulletin said 
however the mediators said they had been informed earlier that 
scheri planned to participate only through the weekend before 
returning to washington headquarters of the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers 
the two sides who last met in intense mediation in july have 
been some 200 million apart the machinists representing 8500 
mechanics baggage handlers and other ground service workers or 
more than onefourth of easterns employees were seeking a 50 
million raise 
eastern was seeking 150 million in concessions mostly from the 
nonmechanics 
eastern which reported 2337 million in losses for the first 
three quarters of 1988 has lobbied vigorously for declaration of an 
impasse

the chief spokesman for the motion picture 
industry has called for an alliance with the vcr industry once 
considered a dreaded rival in the battle against film pirating 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america told attendees at the consumer electronics show that the 
videocassette recorder industry was viewed as a virus by his 
industry as movie attendance waned in the 1970s 
a strange thing has happened since 1971 when the electronics 
industry and the movies declared war on each other valenti said 
the trend is that the more a person watches a movie on a vcr 
the more that person seems to be drawn to wanting to see a movie in 
a theater valenti said sunday 
there is a rise in movie attendance by those 40 years and 
older he said there is a yearning to be entertained 
that yearning is worldwide valenti said 
there is now a celebration going on for both the electronics 
and movie industries valenti said 
a rapport and attitude of cooperative collaboration has 
developed between your industry and mine valenti told the 
electronics executives 
valenti called for the electronics industry to join in the battle 
against film piracy and illegal copying 
systems must be made copyproof valenti said i ask for 
your commitment to that in the future 
film piracy and illegal copying is a hot topic annually at the 
consumer electronics show which showcases a wide array of 
electronic gadgetry from vcrs to television telephones home office 
equipment camcorders and other audiovideo equipment 
valenti said the future is promising for both the electronics and 
motion picture industries 
the electronics industry has the technical skills to make the 
machines that can carry the creative stories produced on film by the 
motion picture industry valenti said

share prices posted their biggest gain in a year and 
the nikkei stock average set a record on monday the first day of 
trading since emperor hirohitos death of cancer on saturday 
analysts said small investors who had held back from the market 
out of anxiety during hirohitos long illness flooded the tokyo 
stock exchange with buy orders 
the opening of a new era is having a positive psychologicaleconomy 
said christopher chew strategist for james 
capel pacific ltd markets have been discounting for the emperors 
death since midoc 
impact on the tober when it became clear he wasnt going to 
recover he said 
most businesses returned to normal on monday after having closed 
for mourning over the weekend department stores had turned off 
their blazing neon signs and draped window displays with white 
sheets 
the tokyo stock exchange canceled its regular saturday halfdays 
trading and asked members to exercise restraint in their business 
activities this week reflecting a view that it would be unseemly 
for trading to be active 
but trading on monday was extremely active with 11 billion 
shares changing hands analysts said the trading was by individual 
investors major securities firms limited their trading out of 
consideration for the nationa economist at the mitsubishi research institute 
a private 
think tank 
from now on the impact of hirohitos death will be 
positive yano said 
shortly after hirohito became bedridden on sept 19 hotels 
caterers florists and suppliers of food and formal wear reported 
falling sales due to cancellations of weddings and parties 
one executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
cancellation of just one order for a gala autumn festival cost his 
firm more than 70000 
richard jerram an economist at the kleinwort benson brokerage in 
tokyo estimated that the slackness caused by hirohitos long 
illness could have reduced japans growth for the period by 
onequarter of a percentage point 
hirohitos death did not provoke anything like last septembers 
cancellations despite an official sixday period of mourning and a 
yearlong mourning period for the imperial family 
saturday was not a propitious day according to the buddhist 
calendar often used in japan to select wedding dates and on sunday 
such functions went ahead as planned 
there has been absolutely no impact on reservations for our 
facilities for weddings and other events said a managerial 
employee at the imperial hotel who refused to give her name 
it was fortuitous that his death fell on a saturday so that 
there was a minimum of economic disruption jerram said now 
its business as usual 
mondays big gains on the stock exchange contrasted sharply with 
the plunge of 35242 points in the nikkei average to 2754858 on 
sept 20 the day after hirohito became seriously ill 
since then the index has climbed past 30000 points despite 
rumors about hirohitos illness that occasionally shook the market 
economists predict unusually high demand for printing products as 
japan shifts from the old showa calendar of hirohitos reign to the 
heisei calendar of the new emperor 
prices of printing paper and pulp and ink shares did not shoot 
up any increases would have occurred long ago as it became apparent 
that hirohito was going to die

british electronics giant general electric co plc 
on monday accused rival plessey co of mounting a spoiling 
tactic by joining an international consortium that is expected to 
make a hostile bid for gec 
gec had joined siemens ag of west germany in launching a hostile 
3 billion offer for plessey in november now gec finds itself the 
target of a possible counterbid by a consortium that probably will 
include plessey 
gec said it would fight the possible counterbid and pursue its 
efforts with siemens to take over plessey 
britains gec and usbased general electric co are not related 
the governments office of fair trading said it was studying the 
possible bid for gec which is expected to be launched by a new 
international consortium within days 
that takeover could be worth between 115 billion and 142 
billion britains largest ever 
a counterbid is known on wall street as the pac man takeover 
defense because of its similarity to the eatorbeeaten video game 
the possibility of gec being taken over sparked political 
controversy at the prospect of a large defenseoriented company 
falling under foreign control 
three years ago two cabinet ministers resigned in a controversy 
over foreign bids for britains only helicopter maker westland plc 
gec said a weekend statement from the investment firm lazard 
brothers amp co about a possible takeover bid for gec was vague and 
inconclusive 
a gec spokesman told press association the domestic news agency 
this appears to be a selfinterested attempt by the board of 
plessey and its advisers to form a consortium to break up gec and 
therefore save plessey in the short term regardless of the cost to 
british industry in terms of lost opportunities and lost jobs 
the spokesman said it was a spoiling tactic by plessey that 
would be fought 
gec managing director lord weinstock said in a sunday television 
interview that gec would pursue its bid for plessey 
a gec spokesman declined to comment to the associated press 
plessey also had no comment a spokesman told the ap 
gec shares jumped 19 pence 34 cents to finish at 221 pence 
391 in heavy trading on londons stock exchange monday plessey 
shares were down 2 pence 4 cents at 226 pence 4 at the close 
the possible bid for gec began to look serious after lazard 
brothers said it had helped form a company called metsun ltd to 
devise a proposal which may or may not lead to an offer for gec 
metsun is headed by sir john cuckney westlands chairman 
metsun was talking to possible international partners lazard 
brothers said without identifying them british news reports said 
possible participants might include thomsoncsf of france american 
telephone amp telegraph co and general electric of the united states 
meanwhile barclays bank plc confirmed it was putting together a 
62 billion syndicated loan to help finance such a bid 
the office of fair trading said it was looking at the possible 
bid noting that it has legal powers to review a bid in 
contemplation 
a spokesman who requested anonymity said the office was examining 
which participants were involved adding there hasnt actually 
been a statement of intention 
the office of fair trading usually reviews a bid and then makes a 
recommendation to the trade secretary on whether to refer it to the 
monopolies commission for full investigation 
rhe acquisition of a stake in westland by united technologies 
corps sikorsky division over rival european bidders plunged the 
government into controversy in 1986 
michael heseltine who resigned as defense secretary in 
opposition to the american bid for westland spearheaded demands 
from politicians and unions for trade secretary lord young to refer 
the gec matter to the monopolies and mergers commission without 
delay 
after the office of fair trading made its statement heseltine 
said i believe the government is to be congratulated on the speed 
with which it has acted to give a proper appraisal of the strategic 
and industrial implications of a breakup of gec 
the opposition labor party says it will raise the issue in the 
house of commons as a matter of the utmost urgency when 
lawmakers return from the christmas recess on tuesday 
gec which employs more than 100000 people had pretax profit 
of 12 billion on sales of 98 billion in its most recent year

in a major victory for dow chemical co the 
supreme court on monday upheld a lower court ruling dismissing 
hundreds of personal injury lawsuits tied to the chemical giants 
antinausea drug bendectin 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by more than 800 
families who filed a federal lawsuit against merrell dow 
pharmaceuticals the cincinnatibased dow unit that manufactures the 
drug 
meanwhile monday the justices agreed to decide whether congress 
may outlaw all sexually explicit telephone dialup message services 
known as dialaporn the high court will rule on the validity of a 
1988 law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages 
available through these services 
a federal judge in california ruled last summer that the law 
could be applied to ban all obscene messages but he struck down the 
laws ban on messages deemed merely indecent 
the court also made several decisions effecting state and local 
governments including one that bars cities and towns from receiving 
180 million in federal revenuesharing funds withheld by the reagan 
administration in the case involving the dow chemical subsidiary 
the justices refused to revive lawsuits seeking millions of dollars 
in damages on behalf of children with birth defects allegedly caused 
by their mothers use of bendectin during pregnancy 
merrell dow had agreed in a 1984 settlement to create a 120 
million fund to compensate these children although it did not admit 
the drug had caused the defects 
the settlement later was rejected by a federal appeals court 
which reinstated the suits against merrell dow a federal jury 
decided after a 22day trial in 1985 that bendectin did not cause 
birth defects when taken in prescribed doses 
that ruling was appealed and last august it was upheld by the 
6th us circuit court of appeals 
merrell dow spokesman william donaldson said his company was 
pleased with the us supreme courts denial of a hearing since 
this case is the major case involving bendectin the company 
maintains the drug is safe 
in other businessrelated action monday the supreme court 
left intact a ruling that 180 million in federal 
revenuesharing funds properly was withheld from local governments 
under budget cuts imposed by the socalled grammrudman act 
agreed to decide whether federal courts should referee some 
disputes over electric power rates between public utilities and 
local or state regulatory agencies 
refused to bar cityowned water systems from charging some 
nonresident customers higher rates than other nonresidents even if 
there is no costrelated reason 
agreed to decide whether states generally are immune from being 
sued for money damages by bankruptcy trustees 
refused to let the government permit japanese salmon fishermen 
off the alaska coast to use huge nets in which porpoise and other 
marine mammals get trapped 
agreed to decide whether the justice department must supply a 
weekly tax magazine with copies of all federal trial court opinions 
and orders in tax cases 
decided to use a dispute over royalties from aerosol valves to 
answer a question involving the authority of federal appeals courts

soybean futures prices closed sharply lower monday 
on the chicago board of trade on forecasts for rain in argentina 
the worlds fourthlargest soybean producer where early growing 
conditions have been dry 
wheat and corn futures finished mostly higher although both of 
those markets also were pressured late in the trading session by the 
argentine rain forecasts 
the rain predictions followed a weekend of unexpectedly heavy 
showers in brazil the worlds secondlargest soybean producer after 
the united states 
this morning the forecasters were saying argentina would be 
relatively dry but later on they started saying there would be more 
rain in the next 24 hours in argentina than was previously 
expected said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago 
further selling of soybean futures was prompted by the 
agriculture departments announcement late friday that private 
exporters had reported cancellations of sales of 240000 metric tons 
of us soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations 
everybody assumes it was the soviet union that canceled it 
lespinasse said 
at the close of trading wheat was unchanged to 1 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in march at 448 a bushel corn was 
1 cents lower to cent higher with march at 289 a bushel oats 
were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with march at 239 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 12 cents lower with january at 806 a 
bushel

the supreme court on monday said it will use a 
dispute over royalties from aerosol valves to answer a question 
involving the authority of federal appeals courts 
the court agreed to hear an appeal by an illinois corporation 
that sued four venezuelans and a us citizen living in venezuela 
the company newmangreen inc has been making aerosol valves 
for more than 30 years it arranged in the early 1970s to market the 
valves in venezuela and set up a licensing agreement with five 
shareholders of the venture in the south american country 
newmangreen filed a suit in federal court in illinois in 1982 
accusing the five of violating the royalty agreement 
the five include william l bettison a us citizen who lives in 
venezuela 
a federal judge awarded newmangreen 200000 in unpaid royalties 
but said the venezuelan shareholders did not owe royalties for a 
period after the us company canceled its license with the 
venezuelan shareholders 
newmangreen asked a threejudge panel of the 7th us circuit 
court of appeals for increased royalties 
the panel then noticed that the federal courts appeared to lack 
authority over the dispute because of the presence of bettison as a 
defendant 
federal courts have jurisdiction in such disputes when the 
opposing sides are from different states or from different nations 
bettisons lack of residency in the united states while still a 
us citizen jeopardized federal court jurisdiction the panel said 
but the panel said the problem was solved by eliminating bettison 
as a defendant it then ruled that newmangreen is entitled to 
additional royalties from the other four 
that decision was overturned last august by the full 7th circuit 
court in an 83 ruling 
the full appeals court said the threejudge panel lacked the 
authority to dismiss bettison from the case and sent the dispute 
back to the federal judge who presided originally over the suit 
the appeals court said the judge must decide the next step which 
could be to dismiss bettison as a defendant 
we can find no source for a power in a court of appeals to 
preserve jurisdiction by dismissing a party retroactively to 
the date the suit was filed the full 7th circuit court said 
newmangreen appealed to the supreme court to reinstate the 
ruling by the threejudge panel 
the case is newmangreen vs alfonzolarrain 88774

the reagan administration on monday dumped the 
savings and loan crisis into the lap of presidentelect bush 
acknowledging for the first time it does not have enough money to 
bail out the troubled industry 
the administration in its proposed budget for fiscal year 1990 
outlined plans to spend 64 billion from the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp from 1989 through 1994 of that 16 billion 
would be spent in fiscal 1989 which began last oct 1 9 billion 
in 1990 and 39 billion from 1991 through 1994 
but the budget document acknowledged these proposals will not 
resolve the entire problem it said treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady is working on a plan including identifying additional 
funding sources for fslic to be presented to bush within 60 days 
the budget shows spending of 64 billion over six years but 
projects collections by the fslic of only 334 billion that does 
not necessarily mean however the 306 billion difference will 
have to be made up with tax dollars immediately 
the insurance fund which guarantees deposit accounts up to 
100000 can continue as it has over the past year to spend in 
the form of promissory notes to bailedout institutions 
the notes count as immediate spending for budget purposes but 
until they come due sometimes 10 years later the agency spends only 
enough cash to cover the interest 
another kind of commitment from sampl regulators promises to make 
good on some of the future losses of rescued institutions do not 
show up on the budget at all until the cash is actually spent 
in calendar year 1988 sampl regulators spent or promised to 
spend more than 38 billion to rescue a postdepression record 217 
insolvent savings and loans however that still leaves a large 
problem about 350 insolvent institutions and another 150 with 
capital levels close to insolvency 
the reagan budget document maintains that of the 25 billion in 
projected spending for 1989 and 1990 10 billion in 1989 and 5 
billion in 1990 will be for new case resolutions and the rest to 
pay for old rescue deals 
however reagan budget director joseph r wright jr 
acknowledged most of the 10 billion for new deals in 1989 was 
alreadly spent in the first three months of the fiscal year 
our point is this should allow the fslic to handle the most 
troubled institutions its not like this is the final 
solution wright said any additional money should be linked to 
reforms of the regulatory system he said 
if you just pour money into it and leave the industry operating 
the way it is now you can find yourself pouring it in again in 
eight to 10 years he warned 
an official of the general accounting office the auditing wing 
of congress said regulators appear to have already committed 
themselves to spending all of their projected revenue for the next 
decade 
based on what ive seen i think theyve spent it all or maybe 
even more than they can count on receiving over the next 10 years 
said craig simmons a ga analyst 
according to the federal home loan bank board the fslics parent 
agency the insurance fund will collect about 22 billion a year in 
assessments from member sampls 
under legislation passed by congress in 1987 it has authority to 
sell bonds to raise another 55 billion this year and next plus 
over the next five years it expects to realize 9 billion from the 
sale of property previously owned by insolvent sampls 
the gao is analyzing the fslics finances to determine whether it 
faces a cash crunch in the future by the end of 1990 the bank 
board will have issued 106 billion in bonds and to date it has 
issued about 25 billion in promissory notes the interest on those 
obligations will run at least 3 billion a year 
bert ely a financial analyst in alexandria va said i think 
theyre facing a cash crunch this year 
the treasury department according to administration sources who 
declined to be identified is studying a number of options f money into 
the insurance fund 
one plan would raise the money through additional borrowing 
taxpayers would pay the interest but the money would be borrowed 
offbudget and would not add to the federal budget deficit an 
independent board incor 
pumping moreluding the treasury secretary would oversee 
regulators spending of the new money 
the reagan budget document while withholding details of the 
treasury plan outlined its principles 
insured depositors will be protected 
private resources including additional money from the sampl 
industry should be fully explored before any public assistance is 
considered 
reform of the existing regulatory structure should be linked to 
any additional money 
there must be full accountability to the president and the 
congress for any use of additional money 
reforms should aim at maintaining market forces and 
discipline the document did not explain precisely what was meant 
by that phra 
reagan called too for eliminating subsidies that help run 
subways and bus services and terminating a program that keeps air 
service for many small communities 
doctors would have to accept smaller fees for treating the 
elderly under medicare and the poor under medicaid radiologists 
anesthesiologists and surgeons especially would get less 
the nations six million boat owners weekend sailors and 
commercial fishermen alike would have to buy a 25 coast guard 
decal to help defray the costs of rescues in emergencies 
homebuyers would see a nearly fourfold increase in the 1 percent 
fee for va loan guarantees it would rise to 38 percent under 
reagans proposals 
he proposed eliminating the 1990 costofliving increase in 
pensions received by federal retirees and reworking the formula 
under which cola increases are granted so that the retired workers 
would have to absorb the first 1 percent increase in the annual cost 
of living 
workers who lose their jobs to foreign competition now get weekly 
benefits while they look for other work reagan proposed eliminating 
a program which he said works to benefit one group of 
underemployed workers or uncompetitive firms

more us companies changed their names in 1988 
than at any time in the past 19 years and more than half the 
changes resulted from corporate mergers and takeovers a 
corporateidentity firm said monday 
the number of companies changing names last year was 1864 or 6 
percent more than the 1753 that changed names in 1987 the previous 
record year said anspach grossman portugal inc which has 
conducted an annual survey of corporate name changes for 19 years 
the number of new names resulting from mergers and acquisitions 
last year was 961 or 52 percent of the total according to the new 
york and san franciscobased company 
among them were standard oil co whose name was changed to bp 
america after its acquisition by british petroleum co plc and 
firestone tire and rubber co whose name was shortened to firestone 
corp after the companys sale to japans bridgestone corp 
an additional 430 name changes or 23 percent of the total 
resulted from corporate downsizing such as spinoffs and 
divestitures among them were allegis corp the parent company of 
united airlines which changed its name back to ual corp after 
shedding its hotel and carrental operations 
those companies changing their names for reasons other than 
mergers or downsizings numbered 473 or 25 percent of the total 
among theme were james b beam distillers which changed its name to 
jim beam brands inc and deluxe check printers to deluxe corp 
sometimes a company combines wellknown names to take advantage 
of the equity they have built up among customers said joel 
portugal a principal in anspach grossman portugal 
for example dr pepper and sevenup merged as dr 
peppersevenup memorex acquired telex and became memorextelex 
and fleet financial and norstar bancorp merged into fleetnorstar 
financial 
anspach grossman portugal said it compiles its list through 
announcements of corporate name changes in newspapers magazines 
trade publications and other sources portugal said there is no one 
organization or government agency that keeps track of such changes 
and so his firms list is an approximation of the actual number of 
name changes

more than 38 percent from the same period last year when investment 
sales boosted earnings the aviation electronics and insurance 
conglomerate said monday

speculators bailed out of the coffee futures market monday in a 
frantic technically inspired selloff on new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange although fundamental factors continued to point 
toward higher prices 
on other markets frozen porkbelly futures plunged soybean 
futures fell sharply precious metals were mixed energy futures 
rose and stockindex futures advanced 
most coffee futures contracts settled 6 cents a pound lower the 
permitted daily limit for price movement the limitless contracts 
for delivery in march and may settled 943 cents and 875 cents 
lower respectively with march finishing at 14829 a pound 
what we saw today was a wholesale bailout of speculative 
longs or players who previously had bet that prices would rise 
said kim badenhop a coffeemarket analyst with merrill lynch 
capital markets inc 
analysts said that after reaching a 27month high of 1669 a 
pound last tuesday profittaking had brought the coffee market down 
by fridays close to levels that triggered mondays selloff 
the surge in coffee prices during december was rooted in 
tightsupply strongdemand fundamentals including a drought in the 
coffeegrowing regions of brazil and the arrival of winter in the 
northern hemisphere the annual peak period for coffee consumption 
analysts said those factors remained in place 
the longterm fundamentals suggest we would move to the upside 
but it gets kind of scary when you get selloffs like this 
badenhop said 
frozen pork bellies for both february and march delivery plunged 
the 2centsapound limit on the chicago mercantile exchange 
illustrating the markets potential for strong downward moves on 
only moderately bearish news 
the rise in supplies of frozen pork bellies last year to 
nearrecord levels has caused a good deal of consternation among 
analysts but has had little impact on prices 
but fridays quarterly hogsandpigs report from the agriculture 
department although by no means an overwhelmingly bearish report 
apparently was enought to trigger mondays selloff 
the report showed a 2 percent increase over the previous year in 
the number of pigs that producers expected to be born from december 
through february 
the baby pigs born in december january and february are 
slaughtered in june july and august said tom morgan president 
of sterling research corp in arlington heights ill if the 
decemberfebruary farrowings really do go up 2 percent that means 
the summer slaughter will go up 2 percent and thats bearish for the 
bellies 
hog and cattle futures finished mixed 
live cattle settled 30 cent lower to 20 cent higher with 
february at 7355 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent to 62 
cent higher with january at 8497 cents a pound live hogs were 75

february at 4245 cents a pound 
soybean futures fell as much as 12 cents a bushel on the chicago 
board of trade on forecasts for rain in argentina the worlds 
fourthlargest soybean producer where early growing conditions have 
been dry 
wheat and corn futures finished mostly higher although those 
markets also were pressured late in the trading session by the 
argentine rain forecasts oats ended sharply lower 
further selling of soybean futures was prompted by the 
agriculture departments announcement late friday that private 
exporters had reported cancellations of sales of 240000 metric tons 
of us soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations which traders 
and analysts said probably meant the soviet union 
wheat settled unchanged to 1 cents higher with march at 448 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to cent higher with march at 
289 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with march at 
237 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 12 cents lower with 
january at 806 a bushel 
gold and silver futures retreated modestly on new yorks 
commodity exchange in response to the early strength of the dollar 
but platinum futures rebounded on the new york mercantile exchange 
after the dollar weakened late in the day 
gold settled 140 to 210 lower with february at 40670 a troy

research and move several bigticket weapons into production while 
sustaining current levels of military forces

increase after inflation for national defense in fiscal 1990 
the defense budget envisions that 303 billion of the 3152 
billion will be paid out during the fiscal year the balance 
represents money that would be authorized for various programs but 
not spent until later 
of the totals 3056 billion in budget authority and 2938 
billion in outlays is earmarked for the defense department the

percent to 4244 billion in fiscal 1990 hhs spending accounts for

medicare and medicaid have been fueling the growth of the 
departments budget 
president reagan said his proposed cutbacks would not reduce 
benefits to the 56 million elderly disabled and lowincome people 
in the two programs but would force the states which administer 
medicaid and providers paid by medicare to become more efficient 
and reduce waste

the massive securities fraud trial over 
washington public power supply systems 225 billion bond default 
officially ended monday with formal dismissal of the jury 
the trial had been expected to last at least a year but 
outofcourt settlements with all the defendants made the 
proceedings unnecessary 
the 11 women and seven men on the panel had sat in court for 32 
days since sept 7 and heard 27 days of testimony from a single 
witness a wppss employee who was the liaison with 88 public utility 
districts 
those districts had contracted with wppss to build the power 
plants which were abandoned unfinished in 1982 in 1983 wppss 
defaulted on the bonds sold to finance the project 
a class of more than 24000 bond investors and chemical bank of 
new york a trustee for bondholders sued more than 100 agencies 
consultants and individuals they charged that the defendants 
conspired to lie to prospective bond buyers 
many jurors said they followed us district judge william d 
brownings instructions against forming an opinion on the case until 
they heard all the evidence 
however tucson meat cutter filiberto islas 53 said he was 
kind of leaning toward the defendants saying he heard nothing 
that would indicate conspiracy or fraud 
don valdez 36 a tucson elementary school teacher said he 
couldnt really form an opinion based on the sole witnesss 
testimony 
juror jane gerdes said she would have liked to deliberate a 
verdict but felt the settlements saved the court money and gave 
bondholders some compensation 
i was thinking that if they settled it would be financially 
better for everybody she said 
browning told the jurors he felt the case would not have 
settled had we not sat you down and started this trial so your 
service here was very valuable he also praised them for 
attentiveness to the complexities 
by the time the jury heard opening arguments 20 defendants 
remained in the trial 
with outofcourt settlements the number had dwindled to one 
defendant and the class plaintiff when the trial recessed dec 5 for 
a month 
blyth eastman painewebber inc the wppss former finanical 
consultant ended need for continuing the trial by agreeing to 
settle out of court for 25 million 
browning still must hold hearings on the fairness of 16 
settlements and how the money should be distributed those are 
scheduled to be in the spring in seattle although a date has not 
yet been set 
a new trial would be ordered for the parties in any settlement 
browning might reject 
with the three other settlements worth 107 million browning had 
approved in june the settlements total 700 million plus whatever 
the plaintiffs can recover from 50 million in disputed insurance 
claims 
wppss will not pay any money as part of its settlement with the 
plaintiffs the state of washington pledged 10 million and the 
federal bonneville power administration the power broker for the 
pacific northwest agreed to pay 35 million into the settlement pot

about 100 general motors corp buick division 
workers will be laid off as the automaker cuts production of its 
reatta luxury twoseat car a company spokesman said monday 
larry gustin said production levels at the reatta craft center in 
lansing would be cut feb 13 from 56 to 42 cars daily 
some of the layoffs would come as early as jan 20 when the plant 
is shut down for installation of a new paint process and some new 
tooling for a reatta convertible gustin said 
there are about 780 employees currently at the plant which 
produces only the reatta 
overly optimistic sales forecasts prompted the cutback gustin 
said 
the manufacturing operation had been set up in a more 
optimistic mode than our forecasts gustin said in part because 
of yettobe seen convertible sales 
originally the reatta convertible was to be introduced late last 
fall but gustin said company officials decided more development 
time was needed and put off introduction of the soft top until fall 
1989 
analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international 
inc of new york said gm had ambitious production schedules during 
the last three months of 1988 the monthly sales rates of reatta 
rose during the second half of last year compared with the first 
half to 480 cars a month from 272 
most of that increase came in the last quarter 
between reattas introduction jan 15 1988 and the end of last 
year buick dealers sold 4514 of the cars 
we have forecast 7000 to 8000 in sales for the 89 model 
year gustin said 
its still a momentumbuilding car looking for a new market 
niche he said i think the manufacturing side felt that we 
would do better than that 
the frontwheeldrive reatta which retails for 26700 has as 
its only options a 16way adjustable drivers seat and a power 
sunroof standard equipment includes a keyless entry system 
antilock brakes airconditioning and leather seats

national semiconductor corp has 
agreed to sell half its mainframe computer business to memorex telex 
nv for 250 million in cash and 4 million shares of memorex telex 
stock the companies said monday 
national advanced systems of santa clara which will become a 
joint venture of the two companies is the largest distributor of 
ibmcompatible mainframe computers and datastorage devices made by 
japans hitachi ltd 
memorex telex based in amsterdam is the worlds largest 
supplier of ibmcompatible equipment such as terminals datastorage 
devices and communications equipment 
the dutch company is privately held so the value of the 4 
million shares that national semiconductor would receive in the deal 
is difficult to estimate 
national semiconductors main business other than mainframes is 
computer chips the company said the sale of half of national 
advanced systems would give it cash for future investment needs and 
help the competitiveness of the mainframe unit 
under the deal memorex telex would get an option to buy the rest 
of national advanced systems at a later date 
even though this is being called a joint venture i really 
dont see that theres much doubt of the acquisition of nas by 
telex somewhere down the road said bob djurdjevic president of 
annex research inc a computer market intelligence firm based in 
phoenix 
memorex telex has annual revenues in excess of 2 billion it is 
made up of the memorex business formerly owned by burroughs corp 
and telex inc of tulsa okla tulsa remains the us headquarters 
of memorex telex 
djurdjevic said that since memorex telex already has a large debt 
burden it made sense for the company to pay partly with stock and 
to stretch the expected purchase of nas over a period of time 
national advanced systems which has annual revenues of 900 
million will operate as a separate entity with headquarters in 
santa clara 
this relationship should prove beneficial to both companies and 
to our combined customer base said giorgio ronchi president and 
chief executive officer of memorex telex through cooperative 
programs we will substantially enhance the worldwide pcm market 
memorex telex operates in 27 countries worldwide with 
distributor links in another 50 markets it has some 2200 employees 
worldwide including 1200 in the united states

president reagan on monday sent congress his 
final budget a 115 trillion plan to continue his legacy of 
military growth squeezed social programs and asyet unrealized 
optimism that the federal deficit will disappear without a major tax 
increase 
presidentelect bush praised the effort but reiterated his 
intention to alter its design within weeks he is expected to seek 
less military spending to make room for his priorities a cleaner 
environment better education and child care then congress will 
rewrite it again 
like all his others reagans ninth budget is out of balance but 
this deficit at 925 billion would be the smallest since the year 
he took office when fiscal 199 ends on sept 30 1990 the 
accumulated national debt will exceed 3 trillion three times what 
it was eight years ago when reagan took office promising a balanced 
budget in three years 
reagan blamed congress for his deficit reduction failures and 
tried again to persuade it to eliminate many domestic programs this 
time he proposed to save 49 billion by killing 82 of them many 
previously preserved by congress like subsidies for mass transit 
rural development and export business 
farm subsidies and child nutrition programs would be cut by 97 
billion limits would be placed on the growth in medicare which 
provides health insurance for social security recipients and 
medicaid which covers poor people saving 49 billion 
but social security itself is unscathed 
military spending would increase 5 billion to 303 billion and 
the nation would begin to build a permanent manned space station 
about 6 billion would be raised by selling government assets 
and another 1 billion would come from increasing fees for various 
government services several corporate taxes would be cut by a 
total of more than 2 billion 
the resulting 925 billion deficit would meet the 100 billion 
target of the grammrudman deficitreduction law and represents a 
sharp reduction from the 1615 billion the white house anticipates 
in the current fiscal year which ends sept 30 
this budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is 
possible without raising taxes reagan said in his budget message 
it can be done in a reasonable responsible way with discipline 
and fairness new taxes are not required 
bush concurred 
the budget submitted by president reagan today is an excellent 
budget which demonstrates clearly that the deficitreduction 
targets can be met and indeed exceeded without raising taxes 
said bush in a statement 
naturally i support its intent he continued however i 
will continue to review it for possible amendments after i assume 
the office of the presidency 
the democraticcontrolled congress plans to relegate reagans 
proposals to the status of reference books until bush decides which 
of it he will embrace and which he will change 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine labeled reagans 
plan largely irrelevant and house speaker jim wright called on 
bush to announce his own plans soon 
rep leon panetta dcalif new chairman of the house budget 
committee saw no surprises in the document which he called the 
last will and testament of the reagan administration 
the real question is whether the priorities of the outgoing 
administration will be renewed or rejected by the new 
administration panetta said 
it provides a formula for a meaner harsher america rather than 
a kinder gentler one as bush promised said senate budget 
chairman jim sasser dtenn it would be a serious mistake for 
george bush to dress up ronald reagans budget in slightly different 
clothes and expect it to be the basis for constructive budget 
debate he said 
panetta and sasser have been openly skeptical that bush can 
comply with the grammrudman law while keeping his campaign promises 
and still avoiding a tax increase 
house republican leader bob michel rill predicted congress 
would accept the reagan budgets underlying assumption that the 
economy will remain strong with moderate inflation and interest 
rates reagan has been frequently criticized as too optimistic 
overall the budget proposes collecting 1059 trillion in 
revenues and spending 1152 trillion leaving a deficit of 925 
billion 
one ingredient of reagans budget which automatically takes 
effect unless vetoed by congress is a 50 percent pay raise for the 
cabinet members of congress judges and the federal governments 
top managers 
elsewhere in the budget but only if congress approves is a 
proposed 2 percent pay increase for rankandfile federal workers 
36 percent for the military federal pensioners would get zero 
their costofliving increase for next year canceled although 
inflation this year is running about 44 percent 
the presidents budget reflects the persistent demands on the 
treasury to bail out insolvent savings and loan institutions 
costing taxpayers 16 billion this year and 9 billion next year 
some 80 billion might be needed over the next few years but reagan 
leaves it to bush to find the resources 
the continuing banking crisis and last summers drought were 
among the chief reasonsthe administrations deficit estimate for the 
current year was raised to 1615 billion up from 145 billion 
estimated last august according to joseph r wright jr the 
presidents budget director 
the budget also proposes 3 billion to clean up and modernize the 
governments aging nuclear weapons plants the energy department 
estimates the project could cost as much as 128 billion over the 
next two decades 
for the military reagan sought to extend his influence halfway 
into bushs first term by submitting a twoyear spending plan 
including sharp increases in spending on antisatellite and 
antimissile weapons 
reagan asked for 3152 billion in military spending authority 
for fiscal 1990 of which 303 billion would actually be spent 
before the end of the fiscal year the spending authority includes 
funding for longterm projects and weapons buying in future years 
for fiscal 1991 the president requested 3308 billion in budget 
authority and 3144 billion in actual outlays 
on the domestic side the president proposed spending increases 
in select areas including aviation safety toxic waste cleanups and 
the search for a cure for aids the 14 billion increase in the 
space program includes money to begin building the space station and 
launch 9 shuttle flights and the budget also includes 250 million 
to start work on a superconducting supercollider physics laboratory 
the reagan budget includes no general tax increase although 1 
billion in new fees would be imposed for a variety government 
services including a 1 percent increase in the charge for veterans 
home loan guarantees 
commercial and recreational boaters would have to pay a 25 
annual fee for using waterways patrolled by the coast guard a 
scheduled cut in aviation taxes would be canceled 
all state and local government workers would be required to pay 
the medicare tax raising about 2 billion 
meanwhile corporate taxes would be cut under several proposals 
including a 17 billion tax break for corporations operating abroad 
reagan told a business group monday that because of the current 
economic expansion the revenue is literally rolling in the 
370 billion in additional taxes expected because of the bigger 
economy by 1994 means plenty of money to do the business of 
government 
raising taxes would be the surest way of killing the economic 
goose that lays the golden egg the president said 
in his eight years in office congress passed and reagan signed 
13 separate tax increases that will cost taxpayers 150 billion 
during the next budget year reaganera tax reductions will save 
taxpayers 377 billion next year according to the budget documents

prime computer incs president told securities 
analysts monday the computer makers operating income could rise as 
much as 50 percent in 1989 but only if it wards off a hostile 970 
million takeover bid by mai basic four inc

wasnt a falloffthechair impact said barry willman who 
follows prime for sanford bernstein amp co 
said willman 40 million to 100 million to my mind isnt that 
much in terms of the corporation which reported sales of 116 
billion in the first three quarters of 1988 
prime stock closed at 1925 up 12 on relatively heavy trading 
of 580000 shares 
mai basic spokesman peter rosenthal said the firm would not 
comment on craigs remarks 
a massachusetts judge temporarily enjoined mai basic on dec 29 
from pursuing its 20pershare cash tender offer saying lebow had 
failed to make full disclosure of his financing arrangements with 
drexel burnham lambert inc but mai basic said it would go back to 
court this month to submit further information and try to clear the 
bid which totals 970 million 
craig said the main purpose of the meeting with analysts was to 
give a good news flash on our expected fourth quarter earnings 
because there had been divergent estimates in the absence of 
information 
the 43yearold executive who was named in october to succeed 
joe m henson as primes president said fourthquarter revenue is 
expected to increase by 7 percent to 10 percent from 3914 million 
in the prior quarter net income is expected to rise more than 40 
percent over the third quarters 117 million he said 
craig said prime has completed its acquisition of general 
electrics calma subsidiary giving the company approximately 800 
new customers and 60 million to 70 million in revenue in 1989 
prime announced dec 28 it would eliminate 1200 jobs in 1989 
bringing its worldwide work force down to about 11600 the company 
also cut 700 employees last year after buying computervision inc 
for 435 million 
craig said the 1988 restructuring succeeded in rolling back costs 
by about 50 million and that prime expects to cut costs by a 
similar amount again this year 
he told the analysts he expects a 6 percent to 8 percent increase 
in revenue this year and a 10 percent to 12 percent rise in 1990 
primarily because of strong growth in sales of computeraided design 
and manufacturing systems 
the combination of sharp cost cutting and revenue growth he 
said could produce a 40 percent to 50 percent increase in operating 
income in 1989 and a 20 percent to 30 percent increase in 1990
