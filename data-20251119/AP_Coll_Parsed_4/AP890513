iraq is spending 6 billion to rebuild this 
city at almost headspinning speed turning a town left virtually 
demolished by the war with iran into iraqs most beautiful and 
elegant city 
workers have built bridges replaced buildings fixed roads 
added new water and electricity systems and have even begun 
replacing palm trees decapitated by artillery fire 
officials plan to erect almost 100 statues of war heroes with 
their fingers pointing forbiddingly in the direction of neighboring 
iran 
what we are doing cannot be compared with the sacrifices of 
thousands of brave men who lost their lives in defending basra 
said engineer nawaf abdullah as he supervised a street repaving in 
downtown basra 
president saddam hussein in february imposed a threemonth 
deadline for completing reconstruction of this strategic city 
overlooking the shatt alarab waterway iraqs main outlet to the 
persian gulf 
the deadline was to end may 12 but gov anwar saeed hadithi 
told the associated press on friday that the renovation has been 
extended to june 12 to cover more of the city and encompass new 
projects 
at least 90 percent of the buildings in basra were destroyed or 
damaged in fierce iranian artillery barrages during the 8yearold 
war with iran iranian troops reached within six miles of the city 
last spring before being driven back and iraqis consider the city 
a symbol of their defense 
after the august ceasefire the iraqi government announced it 
would rebuild basra and so far said it has committed 6 billion to 
the project 
hadithi said six small rivers in basra had been cleared of 
debris their banks resurfaced and 40 bridges constructed 
a new electricity grid and new pipe network for drinking water 
have been installed iraqi authorities have said they will build a 
new drinking water processing plant in basra that will tap water 
from the euphrates river near nasrriya 75 miles north 
residents consider the current water from the shatt alarab too 
brackish 
hadithi said the government offered unlimited money to finance 
the development plans so basra can be iraqs most beautiful and 
elegant city 
but the city still bears scars from the shelling including 
shrapnel holes in buildings 
hadithi said the city iraqs secondlargest after baghdad is 
back to its prewar population of 15 million an estimated half the 
population fled during the shelling 
the government has encouraged people to return by offering plots 
of land cash gifts and loans or grants of up to 32000 to build 
new homes 
the government also is offering similar incentives to get people 
with no basra roots to move into the city 
among the projects is the construction of 96 statues of senior 
iraqi officers killed while defending the city 
the statues will be erected on the corniche of the shatt alarab 
with their arms pointing east toward iran warning against the 
dangers which have always come from iran the governor said 
the government did not use independent contractors for the 
reconstruction drive relying its own men and machinery to do the 
work 
at least 100000 workers and 40000 machines from different 
parts of the country were dispatched to take part in the project 
called the national drive for the reconstruction of the city of 
cities 
basra has as much strategic as symbolic importance to iraq iran 
insists a 1975 treaty that places the countries southern border in 
the middle of the shaat alarab to still be valid 
iraq says the treaty is invalid and that the border is on irans 
eastern bank

the new director of the minerals management 
service says the agency is developing a plan for doing a much 
better job of protecting indian oil rights 
barry williamson who took over april 3 as head of the agency 
charged with protecting oil royalties to indians told a senate 
investigating committee friday that he is working on a package of 
changes from current policy 
the special unit of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs spent the past week taking testimony from witnesses who 
criticized the minerals service the bureau of indian affairs and 
the bureau of land management for not fulfilling the federal 
responsibility to protect indian oil rights 
the purpose of these hearings is to expose what has happened 
in the past but more importantly chart a new course said sen 
john mccain rariz 
when lawyers showed williamson evidence the minerals service had 
not acted in accordance with the federal oil and gas royalty 
management act he promised improvements 
we can do better than we have done in the past was his 
refrain throughout questioning 
earlier friday a homeless cherokeearapahoe woman said she was 
receiving only sporadic royalty payments on three wells in which 
she has an interest 
mary limpy who lives in an abandoned house in oklahoma city 
okla said the 30 to 60 payments she gets periodically keep her 
on the oil royalty rolls and make her ineligible for public 
assistance 
disabled by childhood polio mrs limpy cannot work and said the 
state took away her two youngest children two years ago 
she hasnt been able to get any of the federal agencies 
responsible for indian oil to tell her what has happened to her 
payments she told the panel 
mrs limpy said her wells originally were leased by the tenneco 
oil co which sold the leases to koch oil she said that at one 
point she heard the wells had been capped but the farmer who 
works the land where the wells are located said trucks kept going 
on and off the oil field 
other witnesses told the committee that koch which is based in 
wichita kan had been taking more oil than it had paid for from 
indian wells a charge the company has denied 
mrs limpy is a participant in a federal classaction suit 
charging the government has violated its trust responsibilities to 
indians with oil well interests said attorney steve moore 
moore said the suits plaintiffs include 7000 allottees with 
interest in 944 oil leases in western oklahoma 
that suit has been held under advisement by judge ralph thompson 
of the western district of oklahoma for two and onehalf years 
said moore 
a statement issued by bob dennis court clerk for the western 
district of oklahoma said counsel for both sides have reported to 
the court that settlement offers have been ongoing while they 
watched an almost identical case pending in new mexico 
the statement said the new mexico case was settled by an entry 
of consent decree in march and that both parties in mrs limpys 
case filed a status report last month that specific settlement 
offers were forthcoming and that the parties would report on 
their progress in july 
the court said they waited on the new mexico case to avoid a 
potential conflict in rulings to avoid delays in possible appeals 
and to enhance the prospects of an agreed settlement in the 
case

the attorney for former cia agent joseph 
fernandez says a classified documents law would force him to give 
prosecutors a soup to nuts disclosure of the defenses case 
before the irancontra figure goes to trial 
defense lawyer thomas wilson told a court hearing friday that 
the classified information procedures act was unconstitutional and 
would seriously harm fernandezs case 
fernandez was the cia station chief in costa rica when former 
national security council aide oliver north was helping supply 
weapons to the nicaraguan contras during a congressional ban on 
such assistance 
a federal grand jury under supervision of irancontra 
independent counsel lawrence walsh charged that fernandez lied 
about his role in the contra arms network 
the classified information procedures act would force the 
defense to notify prosecutors in advance of the classified 
documents fernandez plans to use wilson told us district judge 
claude hilton that 100 percent of the domain of evidence is 
classified and that fernandez would have to reveal his defense 
in a way that would be wholly unreciprocated by the government 
irancontra prosecutor geoffrey stewart told the judge that much 
of the information in the case no longer involves classified 
matters and that the defense overstates what is required 
hilton took the case under advisement 
fernandez who used the code name of tomas castillo in central 
america was charged with four criminal counts he is accused of 
obstructing inquiries by the cia general counsel and the 
presidentially appointed tower commission that investigated the 
irancontra arms and money affair and false swearing in connection 
with those inquiries 
the indictment said fernandez falsely told the cia that an 
airstrip in costa rica used to supply the contras was built by 
the costa rican government to train pilots for a possible 
nicaraguan invasion of costa rica 
fernandez allegedly lied to the tower commission by denying that 
he knew the nowconvicted north was involved in helping arm the 
contras 
each of four charges in the indictment carries a maximum 
fiveyear sentence and a 250000 fine upon conviction 
hilton noted that a hearing was scheduled may 26 on documents 
that prosecutors might have to reveal to the defense the judge 
said that if he rules the government must give the defense 
substantial information about the prosecution case there would be 
no harm to fernandez 
norths trial on irancontra charges was conducted under the 
classified procedures law after surviving a similar challenge from 
the defense

after three years of court battles a federal 
appeals court ruled friday to permit the boston police department 
to conduct random drug testing of police officers 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals ruled in favor of a police 
department regulation issued in 1986 that requires random drug 
testing of all police department employees 
i am deeply concerned for the health and safety of our police 
officers said boston police commissioner francis m roache in a 
statement prepared after the decision they are human and engaged 
in perhaps the most stressful profession in our society therefore 
i believe that this drug testing policy is beneficial to the public 
as well as to the police officers in this city and in the country 
the 1600member boston police patrolmens association which 
claims the law is unconstitutional vowed friday to take the case 
to the us supreme court 
under agreement reached by both parties in the case the 
regulation will not be imposed until the appeals process has been 
fully exhausted 
these rules conjure up memories of george orwell said frank 
mcgee chief counsel for the boston patrolmens association 
there are very major implications here the broader question is 
how far can the government go in searching the bodies of its 
employees are blood tests and mandatory psychiatric tests next 
the twopage decision by the appeals court cited two us 
supreme court ruling in march that upheld the governments right to 
require drug and alcohol tests for us customs service workers 
involved in drug interdiction and for railroad workers involved in 
accidents 
the supreme court ruled that public safety outweighs 
constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches 
the decision reached in boston was one of three suits filed by 
police unions around the country against proposed drug detection 
programs cases involving drug testing in the detroit and 
chattanooga tenn police departments are still under review 
the appeals court decision stemmed from a suit brought in 
federal court in october 1986 by robert e guiney president of the 
boston patrolmens association earlier that year roache had 
proposed mandatory random testing as part of efforts to ensure a 
drugfree force 
in may 1988 us district judge robert e keeton upheld urine 
tests of police officers as a result of suspicion of drug abuse but 
ruled that a provision of the regulation imposing random tests 
without suspicion was unconstitutional and was an unreasonable 
search and seizure of an officers body fluids 
drug testing of police officers has been a controversial issue 
in police departments across the country most police departments 
have attempted to test only those officers under suspicion or 
involved with drug interdiction 
in march the nassau county police department in new york began 
random drug testing of certain narcotics squads in new york city 
random testing for drugs was started last october among the 
estimated 1000 officers assigned to the organized crime control 
bureau 
in 1986 the maryland state police began a random mandatory 
testing program for its members the program was suspended after 
eight months when the state attorney general advised it may be an 
unconstitutional invasion of privacy 
miami police officers have asked that an annual mandatory drug 
screening exam be written into their contracts 
approximately 5 million americans are subject to drug testing 
each year usually as a condition of employment

us business leaders saying theyre 
tired of warning about the ill effects of massive federal deficits 
expect a sharp slowdown in economic growth to result in 
disappointing revenues for the treasury and exacerbate the nations 
deficit woes 
the business council made up of 65 chief executives from the 
nations top corporations predicted friday that the governments 
red ink next year will total 135 billion well above the 100 
billion maximum that is allowed under the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
every year ive been here i have to say the same thing 
edmund t pratt chairman of pfizer inc told business leaders at 
this mountain resort we in the business community are still very 
concerned about the deficits 
congress after protracted negotiations with the bush 
administration has drafted a fiscal 1990 budget that it says would 
hold the deficit to just under the grammrudman limit 
the business leaders were unconvinced of that projection yet 
somewhat encouraged that congress and the bush administration at 
least were talking to one another 
david t kearns chairman of xerox corp said the latest 12 
trillion spending plan wont do much to reduce the deficit but 
the fact that theyre not fighting that theyve come to step one 
is positive in my mind 
step two will have to be for them to deal with it in real 
terms and it must be dealt with or were going to have some 
discontinuities that could be severe he said 
roger smith chairman of general motors corp and of the 
business council said the budget and trade deficits are being 
closely watched because they have a direct bearing on our 
industry and how people feel about the economy 
its going to be a good year from what we can see 
providing nothing untoward happens in washington smith said 
pratt said corporate officials are disappointed that a more 
serious bite of the apple wasnt taken in the new budget 
on the other hand we do have a feeling of encouragement that 
at least congress and the executive branch act like theyre 
more serious about trying to grab hold of the problem he said 
sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking republican on the 
senate budget committee told the council in a private session 
friday that the 1990 budget would come in right around the 
grammrudman target and was worth an awful lot because it set 
the stage for further negotiations 
i remain convinced that there is a very significant process 
that has been set in motion that might address the deficit that 
otherwise would go totally unattended and create grid lock and 
chaos domenici said after the session 
rudolph penner senior fellow at the urban institute and former 
head of the congressional budget office told the business leaders 
the budget was disappointing because it again uses accounting 
gimmicks to reduce the red ink 
every year we do a little bit every year we claim we did more 
than we do he said 
the business council is forecasting that economic growth as 
measured by the gross national product will slow from last years 
healthy 39 percent pace to 14 percent by the end of the year 
the council projected gnp growth of 29 percent for all of 1989 
and 17 percent next year 
richard breeden a top aide to president bush told the council 
that the recent slowing in economic activity was a pause and a 
base for further expansion 
the administration is pinning its deficitreduction plans on an 
optimistic expectation for gnp growth of 32 percent this year

the american business community has 
been able to operate successfully in panama despite political 
violence governmentfanned hostility toward the united states and 
us sanctions against the government 
the community plans to stay open for business but its greatest 
threats come from longrange political instability and a continued 
economic downturn said a spokesman for the american chamber of 
commerce and industries of panama 
companies gradually are relocating and will keep doing so as 
long as gen manuel antonio noriega remains in power and us 
sanctions remain in place he said 
the spokesman who also is a partner in a panamanian business 
asked not to be named for fear of reprisal 
i dont see any shortrun solution he said friday 
members of the chamber dont feel our friend noriega is showing 
any willingness to move and we have to make plans on that sort of 
scenario 
companies that have plants here such as borden probably will 
continue as long as they can pay their payroll and so forth 
others like kodak which have regional offices here may decide to 
locate them elsewhere he said 
in the united states kodak spokesman paul allen said operations 
have not been affected by the unrest 
he said kodaks fewer than 100 employees in panama include a 
handful of americans and they have not been advised to leave or 
take unusual precautions 
on thursday the us state department advised american 
businessmen to make plans to get dependents out of panama 
however one executive of a us importing firm said he did not 
plan to move his wife and children because we dont want to live 
in an army base 
like most americans contacted he said he had encountered no 
hostility from panamanians or had any problems 
the antiamericanism just isnt out there the chamber of 
commerce official said an antius offensive by the government 
found little support among panamanians he said 
panama has been a regional center for a lot of companies in 
the last two years this configuration is down at least 50 percent 
it will drop further if this thing continues much longer the 
spokesman said 
a foreign business specialist who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said in panama the key to americans doing business 
these days is lets make a deal 
when economic sanctions aimed at getting rid of noriega were 
announced in 1988 there was widespread fear that panama would 
close businesses that did not pay required taxes to the government 
that did not happen the businesses which hire thousands of 
panamanians and buy millions of dollars worth of goods from 
panamanian companies each year stayed open 
there certainly is some bartering of services to the 
government in lieu of taxes paid the specialist said but added 
that panama also recognizes the economic impact that closing the 
businesses would mean in a nation with a 20 percent unemployment 
rate 
many executives of many multinational corporations including 
several leaders have been replaced the past two years by 
panamanians he said 
the chairman of ibm here is a panamanian so is the chairman 
of colgatepalmolive he said the banks in panama are pretty 
well locally managed now too 
the economic sanctions he said are more damaging to us 
business than to panamas government 
the sanctions prevent american companies and us government 
entities from paying taxes to the government 
by chamber of commerce calculations all the taxes we should 
pay and dont would keep the panamanian government afloat for only 
two days he said 
he added that many multinational businesses have been losing 
money in panama because of its economy and some company officials 
soon may decide to close operations there 
panama is a small country and it would not be a major loss to 
some of the biggest companies he said 
the tragedy is that once panama loses those companies it is 
hard for it to get them back

donald gregg president bushs 
ambassadordesignate to south korea faces further questioning by a 
senate panel about his knowledge in 1985 and 1986 of oliver norths 
secret network to arm the nicaraguan rebels 
on friday sen alan cranston accused gregg bushs national 
security adviser when he was vice president of sponsoring a 
freelance covert operation out of the vice presidents office 
cranston dcalif said gregg was making sweeping denials 
of his knowledge about the nicaraguan contra network apparently 
in order to cover up the truth and to limit embarrassment to your 
boss thenpresidential candidate george bush 
even though congress at the time had banned us military aid to 
the contras gregg said it didnt occur to him that there was 
anything ipso facto illegal he said former cia operative felix 
rodriguez had been focusing on alleged corruption by some of the 
arms dealers involved in the network and didnt think that kind of 
matter was sufficiently vice presidential to tell bush 
gregg underwent a threehour hearing before a senate foreign 
relations subcommittee chaired by cranston who said later through 
an office spokesman that there will be further questioning on the 
irancontra affair 
theres going to be another hearing said the spokesman 
murray flander the questions have not all been asked or 
answered 
gregg says he didnt find out until august 1986 from rodriguez 
that north might be involved with facilitating the supply of lethal 
aid to the contras 
with support from gregg rodriguez was sent to el salvador to 
help the air force there counter guerrilla insurgents gregg said 
he didnt know until the august 1986 meeting that rodriguez was 
involved in helping the contras 
greggs training at the cia and friendship with rodriguez 
apparently led you to believe you could serve the national 
interest by sponsoring a freelance covert operation out of the 
vice presidents office cranston said 
the senator said a cover story about rodriguez sole mission in 
central america being to help the salvadoran air force was 
seemingly concocted 
i think it is a rather fullblown example of a conspiracy 
theory gregg said of cranstons comments thats not what i 
was doing it is not what felix was doing to my knowledge my job 
was to keep the vice president informed i did not have operational 
responsibility for anything to do that would have been the 
quickest way for me to lose my job 
the ambassadordesignate for the first time offered what he 
called a speculative explanation of the fact that two april 
1986 documents from his office said bush was to be briefed on 
resupply of the contras in a meeting with rodriguez 
i believe the agenda item was a garbled reference to resupply 
of copters in el salvador instead of resupply of the contras 
gregg testified he declined to specify whether he thought his 
aide col sam watson or a secretary had gotten the wording 
garbled 
gregg recalled that at the time rodriguez was concerned that 
helicopters being used by the salvadoran military needed spare 
parts he said he came to the conclusion that the reference had 
gotten garbled after seeing galleys of a book rodriguez recently 
completed

the bush administration is preparing to lobby 
hard for a tough resolution denouncing panamanian leader manuel 
antonio noriega when organization of american states foreign 
ministers meet next week to discuss the panama crisis 
but panamanian authorities are expected to blame the upheaval in 
their country on what they regard as systematic us intervention 
in panamas internal affairs 
the oas permanent council on friday approved a venezuelan 
proposal for the oas foreign ministers to meet next wednesday to 
discuss the serious crisis in panama 
while many delegates expressed concern about the interruption of 
the election process and the violence directed against some 
panamanian opposition leaders others argued against interfering in 
panamas internal affairs 
panamas representative carlos russell used the occasion to 
blast us actions saying we will not bow to the colossus of 
the north 
he cited reports alleging that the bush administration donated 
10 million to the opposition candidates campaign he also said 
the us government had funded a clandestine antigovernment radio 
operation that preparations were being made to scuttle the panama 
canal treaties and that us military forces in panama are engaged 
in hostile military maneuvers 
but the us delegate william pryce said that in the interest 
of the people of panama the oas must raise its collective voice 
against the dictator noriega and demand that he respect the will 
of the courageous people of panama 
on thursday the state department began referring to the 
opposition candidate guillermo endara as the presidentelect of 
panama based on exit polls showing he had a sizeable lead over the 
pronoriega candidate carlos duque 
us officials who asked not to be identified said there 
seemed to be little likelihood that the oas foreign ministers would 
designate endara as the winner there also was some doubt that the 
oas would approve a resolution condemning noriega the officials 
said 
the united states was expected to fight hard for a toughly 
worded resolution but strong resistance was anticipated from a 
number of countries especially mexico and nicaragua both of which 
attach high priority to the principle of noninterference 
even venezuela which initiated the call for a foreign ministers 
meeting was restrained in outlining its reasons 
ambassador edilberto moreno made no direct reference to noriega 
saying only that the popular will of hemispheric nations must 
be respected and that a meeting of foreign ministers at this time 
is appropriate given the grave crisis in panama 
the strongest antinoriega statement during the meeting was 
delivered by jamaican ambassador keith johnson who denounced 
this blatant rape of democracy in panama

seventeen rustic shacks on the outer dunes of 
cape cod could still be ripped down even though the huts which 
provided soulsearching solitude to eugene oneill jack kerouac 
and scores of other creative minds have won national historic 
designation 
the national park service on friday placed the primitive huts on 
the national register of historic places over the objections of 
regional officials at the cape cod national seashore 
the dune shacks are an important part of the pattern of 
artistic and cultural life on the outer cape and merit the 
protection and recognition of the national register said 
massachusetts secretary of state michael connolly chairman of the 
massachusetts historical commission that pushed for the designation 
but herbert cables regional director of the park service in 
boston said earlier this year that a historic designation 
affords no guarantee of protection 
the national park service could raze these shacks theres 
still potential for that to happen said edie sheanhammond a 
regional park service spokeswoman in boston 
but she said regional officials vowed in december that all the 
huts would be preserved until plans for the area are completed she 
said preservation of the dune shacks in those plans is under full 
consideration 
for the next few years we dont see anything happening at 
all sheanhammond said 
gail cohen a dune hut activist remained skeptical 
all i know is for 30 years theyve been doing everything they 
could to destroy these shacks she said 
cohen called the historic designation a small victory but it 
really doesnt mean a lot its still up to the national seashore 
officials to decide what to do with them 
she said three of the shacks have been razed since 1984 and two 
of the remaining 17 had been slated for destruction 
the one and tworoom gray shingled beach huts lie between truro 
and provincetown near the tip of cape cod 
built in the 1920s and 1930s by the coast guard as shelters the 
weatherbeaten shacks offer none of the conveniences of modern 
life such as electricity and plumbing but they provide peaceful 
hideaways in a strikingly unspoiled setting reachable only by 
fourwheel drive vehicles or walking 
yes residence on the dunes is uniquely sheltering and 
certainly stimulating to creative work kerouac wrote in a 1963 
letter its true that i was working on on the road there 
summer of 1950 
preservationists say the shacks have been used by oneill 
kerouac poet ee cummings author norman mailer and scores of 
lesserknown painters poets playwrights and novelists earning 
them a place in american history and worthy of protection 
the shacks came under park service control in 1961 when the 
government purchased 27000 acres of outer cape land for the cape 
cod national seashore a private group has been managing the rustic 
huts renting them for 150 a week 
park service officials in boston previously had maintained that 
the dune shacks did not have the architectural or historic value to 
warrant preservation the service had indicated the shacks would be 
demolished after leases with the current owners expire over the 
next 16 years

the national space council is urging president 
bush to commit to funding the landsat earthsensing satellites 
which were almost shut down in march through fiscal 1991 
the council under the leadership of vice president dan quayle 
made the recommendation friday 
this signifies a real commitment of the bushquayle 
administration to be aggressive in space said an administration 
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the landsat program launched in 1978 has long been plagued by 
funding uncertainty because the reagan administration had hoped to 
commercialize it that proved not to be feasible the source said 
for the first time the administration has stepped forward and 
said it landsat could not be fully commercialized well into the 
21st century the source said the demand for the data has not 
grown as rapidly as early forecasts had projected 
indeed the federal government is landsats biggest client 
although 13 countries have bought landsat stations he said 
the landsat satellites were due to be turned off march 31 when 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration was to run out 
of money to operate them 
but quayle announced on march 6 that he had gained a commitment 
for funds to keep the program going until the space council which 
studies national space programs completed a review 
two satellites currently are in operation landsat 4 and landsat 
5 they provide photos for mineral exploration checking soil 
conditions and vegetation urban and rural planning monitoring 
volcanoes and tracing ocean currents but both have been running 
well beyond their expected lifetimes and are no longer fully 
functional 
an improved satellite landsat 6 is scheduled to be launched in 
1991 
the space council recommended money be made available to 
continue operations of landsat 4 and landsat 5 through fiscal 1990 
that combined with the 200 million already committed to launching 
landsat 6 in 1991 will give you data continuity until 1996 
the source said 
however the source of funding after fiscal 1991 remained a 
question the space council directed the office of management and 
budget and council staff to focus on ways to keep the data flowing 
the councils decision calls for user departments and agencies 
such as the interior agriculture commerce and defense departments 
and the national aeronautics and space administration to provide 
the 5 million needed to continue the program through the remainder 
of fiscal 1989 
the space council hopes to obtain 19 million needed for the 
1990 fiscal year through a supplemental request for the commerce 
departments budget the source said 
weve already paid almost 200 million for landsat 6 the 
official said this signals commitment in the long run and the 
united states continued leadership in space and space technology 
the official said quayle demonstrated during the meeting the 
satellites ability to highlight environmental concerns 
the vice president had in the room images from april 7 from 
the valdez oil spill in alaska and you could clearly see where the 
oil spill was the administration official said you could 
clearly see that landsat can have real use to environmental 
matters

the federal railroad administration was 
unfairly blamed for contributing to a fiery train collision in iowa 
last summer that killed two people an fra official said today 
the complaint was voiced by s mark lindsey chief counsel for 
the agency in a letter to the national transportation safety board 
the ntsb said last tuesday that failures by the iowa interstate 
railroad and the fra to enforce train operating rules were part of 
what caused the july 30 headon crash between two freight trains 
two crewmen on a westbound train were killed when it collided 
with an eastbound train at altoona more than 2000 people were 
evacuated from their homes as two tank cars containing 20000 
gallons of denatured alcohol burned for more than two days 
the ntsb blamed iowa interstate which operated both trains and 
said the eastbound train had been operated by a fatigued crew 
the panel also blamed the fra for failing to act against iowa 
interstate 
lindsey in a letter to the ntsb said the criticism of the fra 
is not only unfounded it demonstrates a basic lack of 
understanding of the difference between a railroads own rules and 
federal regulations and it evidences a remarkable ignorance of 
fras rail safety program and rules 
the crash was caused by one train leaving too early in violation 
of an internal railroad order lindsey said 
to state the elementary violation of a train order 
constitutes a violation of railroad rules not federal regulations 
responsibility for enforcing compliance with the railroads own 
rules is the railroads not fras he wrote 
fra is not the guarantor of rail safety he said instead 
its mission is to develop appropriate safety standards for the 
industry to monitor railroad compliance and to conduct an 
enforcement effort that will have a deterrent effect overall 
fra cannot prevent every instance of noncompliance nor can 
it control the propensity for human beings to make bad decisions or 
to behave negligently he said

here is the prepared text of 
president bushs speech friday to graduating seniors at texas aampm 
university 
my sincerest congratulations go to every graduate and to your 
parents 
in this ceremony we celebrate nothing less than the 
commencement of the rest and the best of your life 
when you look back to your days at texas aampm you will have a 
lot to be proud of a university that is first in baseball and 
first in service to our nation 
many are the heroes whose names are called at muster many are 
those you remember in silver taps 
we are reminded that no generation can escape history 
parents we share a fervent desire for our children and their 
children to know a better world a safer world 
students your parents and grandparents have lived through a 
world war and helped america to rebuild the world 
they witnessed the drama of postwar nations divided by soviet 
subversion and force but sustained by an allied response most 
vividly seen in the berlin airlift 
wise men truman and eisenhower vandenberg and rayburn 
marshall acheson and kennan crafted the strategy of containment 
they believed that the soviet union denied the easy course of 
expansion would turn inward and address the contradictions of its 
inefficient repressive and inhumane system 
and they were right 
the soviet union is now publicly facing this hard reality 
containment worked 
containment worked because our democratic principles 
institutions and values are sound and always have been 
it worked because our alliances were and are strong and because 
the superiority of free societies and free markets over stagnant 
socialism is undeniable 
we are approaching the conclusion of an historic postwar 
struggle between two visions one of tyranny and conflict and one 
of democracy and freedom 
the review of ussoviet relations that my administration has 
just completed outlines a new path toward resolving this struggle

<TEXT>
our goal is bold more ambitious than any of my predecessors 
might have thought possible 
our review indicates that 40 years of perseverance have brought 
us a precious opportunity 
now it is time to move beyond containment to a new policy for 
the 1990s one that recognizes the full scope of change taking 
place around the world and in the soviet union itself 
in sum the united states now has as its goal much more than 
simply containing soviet expansionism we seek the integration of 
the soviet union into the community of nations 
as the soviet union moves toward greater openness and 
democratization as they meet the challenge of responsible 
international behavior we will match their steps with steps of 
our own 
ultimately our objective is to welcome the soviet union back 
into the world order 
the soviet union says it seeks to make peace with the world and 
criticizes its own postwar policies 
these are words we can only applaud 
but a new relationship cannot be simply declared by moscow or 
bestowed by others 
it must be earned 
it must be earned because promises are never enough 
the soviet union has promised a more cooperative relationship 
before only to reverse course and return to militarism 
soviet foreign policy has been almost seasonal warmth before 
cold thaw before freeze 
we seek a friendship that knows no season of suspicion no chill 
of distrust 
we hope perestroika is pointing the soviet union to a break with 
the cycles of the past a definitive break 
who would have thought we would see the deliberations of the 
central committee on the front page of pravda or dissident andrei 
sakharov seated near the councils of power 
who would have imagined a soviet leader who canvasses the 
sidewalks of moscow and washington dc 
these are hopeful indeed remarkable signs 
let no one doubt our sincere desire to see perestroika continue 
and succeed 
but the national security of america and our allies is not 
predicated on hope 
it must be based on deeds 
we look for enduring ingrained economic and political change

while we hope to move beyond containment we are only at the 
beginning of our new path 
many dangers and uncertainties are ahead 
we must not forget that the soviet union has acquired awesome 
military capabilities 
that was a fact of life for my predecessors 
that has always been a fact of life for our allies 
and that is a fact of life for me 
as we seek peace we must also remain strong 
the purpose of our military might is not to pressure a weak 
soviet economy or to seek military superiority 
it is to deter war 
it is to defend ourselves and our allies and to do something 
more to convince the soviet union that there can be no reward in 
pursuing expansionism to convince the soviet union that reward 
lies in the pursuit of peace 
western policies must encourage the evolution of the soviet 
union toward an open society 
this task will test our strength 
it will tax our patience 
and it will require a sweeping vision let me share with you my 
vision 
i see a western hemisphere of democratic prosperous nations no 
longer threatened by a cuba or a nicaragua armed by moscow 
i see a soviet union that pulls away from ties to terrorist 
nations like libya that threaten the legitimate security of 
their neighbors 
i see a soviet union which respects chinas integrity and 
returns the northern territories of japan a prelude to the day 
when all the great nations of asia will live in harmony 
but the fulfillment of this vision requires the soviet union to 
take positive steps including 
first reduce soviet forces although some small steps have 
already been taken the warsaw pact still possesses more than 
30000 tanks more than twice as much artillery and hundreds of 
thousands more troops in europe than nato they should cut their 
forces to less threatening levels in proportion to their 
legitimate security needs 
second adhere to the soviet obligation promised in the final 
days of world war ii to support selfdetermination for all the 
nations of eastern and central europe this requires specific 
abandonment of the brezhnev doctrine one day it should be possible 
to drive from moscow to munich without seeing a single guard tower 
or a strand of barbed wire in short tear down the iron curtain

third work with the west in positive practical not merely 
rhetorical steps toward diplomatic solutions to regional disputes 
around the world i welcome the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan 
and the angola agreement but there is much more to be done around 
the world were ready lets roll up our sleeves and get to work 
fourth achieve a lasting political pluralism and respect for 
human rights dramatic events have already occurred in moscow we 
are impressed by limited but freely contested elections we are 
impressed by a greater toleration of dissent we are impressed by a 
new frankness about the stalin era mr gorbachev dont stop now 
fifth join with us in addressing pressing global problems 
including the international drug menace and dangers to the 
environment we can build a better world for our children 
as the soviet union moves toward arms reduction and reform it 
will find willing partners in the west 
we seek verifiable stabilizing arms control and arms reduction 
agreements with the soviet union and its allies 
however arms control is not an end in itself but a means of 
contributing to the security of america and the peace of the world 
i directed secretary baker to propose to the soviets that we 
resume negotiations on strategic forces in june 
and as you know the soviets have agreed 
our basic approach is clear 
in the strategic arms reduction talks we wish to reduce the 
risk of nuclear war 
in the companion defense and space talks our objective will be 
to preserve our options to deploy advanced defenses when they are 
ready 
in nuclear testing we will continue to seek the necessary 
verification improvements in existing treaties to permit them to be 
brought into force 
we will continue to seek a verifiable global ban on chemical 
weapons 
we support nato efforts to reduce the soviet offensive threat in 
the negotiations on conventional forces in europe 
and as ive said fundamental to all of these objectives is 
simple openness

make no mistake a new breeze is blowing across the steppes and 
cities of the soviet union 
why not then let this spirit of openness grow let more 
barriers come down 
open emigration open debate open airwaves let openness come 
to mean the publication and sale of banned books and newspapers in 
the soviet union 
let the 19000 soviet jews who emigrated last year be followed 
by any number who wish to emigrate this year 
let openness come to mean nothing less than the free exchange of 
people books and ideas between east and west 
and let it come to mean one thing more 
thirtyfour years ago president eisenhower met in geneva with 
soviet leaders who after the death of stalin promised a new 
approach toward the west 
he proposed a plan called open skies which would allow 
unarmed aircraft from the united states and the soviet union to fly 
over the territory of the other country 
this would open up military activities to regular scrutiny and 
as president eisenhower put it convince the world that we are 
lessening danger and relaxing tension 
president eisenhowers suggestion tested soviet readiness to 
open their society 
the kremlin failed that test 
let us again explore that proposal but on a broader more 
intrusive and radical basis one which i hope would include allies 
on both sides 
we suggest that those countries that wish to examine this 
proposal meet soon to work out the necessary operational details 
separately from other arms control negotiations 
such surveillance flights complementing satellites would 
provide regular scrutiny for both sides 
such unprecedented territorial access would show the world the 
meaning of the concept of openness 
the very soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would 
reveal their commitment to change

where there is cooperation there can be a broader economic 
relationship 
but economic relations have been stifled by soviet internal 
policies 
they have been injured by moscows practice of using the cloak 
of commerce to steal technology from the west 
ending discriminatory treatment of us firms would be a helpful 
step 
trade and financial transactions should take place on a normal 
commercial basis 
and should the soviet union codify its emigration laws in accord 
with international standards and implement its new laws faithfully 
i am prepared to work with congress for a temporary waiver of the 
jacksonvanik amendment opening the way to extending most favored 
nation trade status to the soviet unon 
the policy i have just described has everything to do with you 
today you graduate 
you will start careers and families 
and you will become the leaders of america in the next century 
what kind of world will you know 
perhaps the world order of the future will truly be a family of 
nations 
it is a sad truth that nothing forces us to recognize our common 
humanity more swiftly than a natural disaster 
i am thinking of soviet armenia just a few months ago a 
tragedy without blame warlike devastation without war 
my son took our 12yearold grandson to yerevan 
at the end of a day of comforting the injured and consoling the 
bereaved father and son sat down together amid the ruins and wept 
how can our two countries magnify this simple expression of 
caring 
how can we each convey the goodwill of our people 
fortythree years ago a young lieutenant by the name of albert 
kotzebue class of 1945 at texas aampm was the first american 
soldier to shake hands with the soviets at the banks of the elbe 
river 
once again we are ready to extend our hand 
once again we are ready for a hand in return 
once again it is a time for peace

the space agency is juggling the 
launch schedule for five space shuttle flights including 
postponement until 1990 of the hubble space telescope mission long 
awaited by scientists 
the schedule changes announced friday became necessary when 
nasa decided last month that the shuttle columbia could not be 
readied in time for a july launch because of modifications that 
must be made 
because of columbias lag officials said they could not support 
two missions in the julyaugust time period and still preserve an 
october launch period for the highpriority galileo flight to 
jupiter 
the national aeronautics and space administration said in april 
that it was moving the columbia flight a classified defense 
department mission to august and was shifting a discovery 
military mission set for august until sometime after the galileo 
launch on atlantis which is set for oct 12 
nasa announced this new sequence friday for postgalileo 
missions 
discovery on the military mission that had been scheduled in 
august 
columbia to dispatch a communications satellite and retrieve a 
science satellite orbiting since 1984 officials want to recover 
the 107ton satellite before it can reenter the atmosphere and 
burn up late this year or in early 1990 
atlantis on a defense department mission 
discovery with the hubble space telescope which is to study 
the universe far beyond the sun and its planets under a previous 
schedule the telescope had been scheduled for launch in december 
the earliest now is february 
columbia with the astro1 payload a package of ultraviolet and 
xray telescopes to observe deep space 
nasa said it would announce dates for these flights within a few 
weeks it appears there will be three or four more launches this 
year with the others slated for 1990 two missions have flown so 
far in 1989

a runaway freight train jumped its 
tracks at 90 mph on a downhill grade and plowed into a row of 
houses friday killing at least three people two of them children 
the train was all over the place it looked like a toy in a 
sandbox it was just everywhere in peoples yards pieces of the 
axles were in peoples yards said witness al dorame 
late friday evening a 24yearold man was found alive in the 
wreckage of a home more than 14 hours after the accident said 
police sgt david clark he was found shortly before 9 pm 
tentatively identified as chris shaw he had been asleep when the 
69car train derailed and plowed through his home 
earlier friday at least two people were reported missing and 
firefighters and police combed the wreckage of the residential 
neighborhood two specially trained dogs from the volunteer 
california rescue dog association were used to search the rubble of 
the homes and the train 
southern pacific said it would not begin moving the wrecked cars 
until word was received that all homes had been searched 
hospitals reported treating at least eight people for varying 
injuries including the trains engineer frank w holland 34 a 
14year southern pacific employee who was pulled from the wreckage 
by witnesses 
holland was listed in serious condition with broken ribs 
bruises and cuts said jo coffey a nursing supervisor at st 
bernardines hospital 
the southern pacific freight apparently lost its brakes toward 
the top of treacherous 4190foot cajon pass and came raging down 
the grade at more than 90 mph before the derailment said southern 
pacific spokesman doug stephanson 
it flew off an embankment and into a neighborhood of modest 
twoand threebedroom homes on the northwest outskirts of san 
bernardino smashing houses and throwing out its load of sandlike 
potash 
stephanson said one of the five crewmembers radioed to a 
dispatcher in los angeles that the train was out of control 
they said the speed was 90 mph a few miles up the track from 
the crash site he said they absolutely were out of control 
it was a runaway train 
he said the train apparently lost its brakes near the top of the 
pass in the mountains about 60 miles east of los angeles 
the train had four engines in front and two helper engines 
in back and had between 55 and 69 cars in all the rear engines 
had applied full brakes stephanson said 
police sgt dan hernandez said the train hit 11 homes six were 
destroyed one had major damage and four had minor damage inflicted 
by the train flying dirt and rocks from the roadbed and the 
potash a mineral used in making fertilizer and soap property 
damage was estimated at 600000 
the engine came off the track and went through a house said 
dane maloney who saw the crash on his way to work 
it was terrible there were train cars on top of houses train 
cars on top of cars it sounded like a couple of bombs going off 
it was going down from cajon real fast didnt have no brakes 
i looked over part of the train was in the air it just fell back 
on the ground and all the sand started flying up in the air and 
stuff said kelly michaels a little boy who saw the wreck 
the pass is the major road and rail conduit from the los angeles 
basin to las vegas interstate 15 passes through it 
the dead were identified as conductor everett s crown 36 a 
member of the bakersfieldbased train crew and a southern pacific 
worker since 1972 and stepbrothers jason thompson 9 and tyson 
white 7 whose home was smashed by the train 
another crew member brakeman alan r reiss 44 who has been 
with southern pacific since 1971 was still listed as missing said 
train master terry givens in bakersfield 
southern pacific spokesman jim loveland said the railroad will 
help people left homeless by the crash we feel terrible about 
this he said 
red cross spokeswoman kim schwartz said a shelter had been set 
up at the inland job corps center and 10 people had registered by 
late afternoon 
about 200 people were kept from their homes for a time for fear 
that leaking diesel fuel could ignite garcia said he said most of 
the injuries were minor 
jim kolstad acting chairman of the national transportation 
safety board was flying in from washington dc to direct the 
investigation said gary mucho the regional director he said 
there was no indication of the cause 
the train was carrying potash from the highdesert town of 
mojave to long beach said southern pacific spokesman jerry pera 
the tracks were expected to remain closed at least a day 
forcing detour of 15 freights and two passenger trains a day pera 
said the trains including amtraks los angelestonew orleans 
service would use a route through saugus he said 
elsewhere a derailment near meridian miss spilled thousands 
of gallons of antifreeze and diesel fuel into the chunky river and 
residents were told friday to keep away from the river 
no injuries were reported in the thursday night derailment of a 
midsouth railroad train but more than 200 people were evacuated

cards honoring mom usually are stuck on 
the refrigerator door about a week but for a single mother of six 
this mothers day will bring something more enduring a college 
diploma 
anne marie liebhaber whose children range in age from 3 to 17 
will receive a bachelors degree in general studies with an 
emphasis on psychology and sociology after completing her 
undergraduate coursework at gonzaga university with a 40 grade 
point average 
federal grants and a tuition discount helped finance her 
undergraduate studies but for her next course of study ms 
liebhaber was awarded a full merit scholarship shell attend the 
gonzaga law school come fall 
she is one of a handful of law students selected as recipients 
of thomas more scholarships based on outstanding promise for 
intellectual achievement and community service 
id like to go into public service dealing with family and 
domestic law as an advocate for women and children ms liebhaber 
said 
after an abusive marriage that ended in divorce she 
stayed home and devoted my time and effort to raising my 
children because we were all wounded from the trauma of the 
divorce 
for the first time i had to experience taking care of myself 
and it was quite difficult ms liebhaber said 
she said shes never had a job outside the home and makes ends 
meet with child support and food stamps her exhusband whos in 
the military has paid regular child support ms liebhaber said 
and all her children except her youngest are covered under the 
militarys health care plan 
the birth of her youngest child ben provided the impetus for 
her to enroll at gonzaga two months later and her struggle to get 
child support influenced her decision to go on to law school she 
said 
my youngest was my gift he brought love and life back into 
this family ms liebhaber said 
she said her other children were surprised but they were very 
accepting and ben is very loved 
raised in chicago ms liebhaber attended the university of 
illinois for two years before she was married and the credits she 
earned were accepted at gonzaga 
the private jesuitrun universitys general studies program is 
designed to allow more flexibility in scheduling and curriculum 
content for adult students 
i enrolled in gonzaga two years ago directly as a result of 
their nontraditional program which would allow me to raise my 
children and achieve a quality education she said 
shes a hero said her academic adviser jerry cook dean of 
the college of professional studies shes come from a difficult 
personal situation achieved a perfect academic record and shes 
headed for law school 
it shows what a mature woman can do when she puts her mind to 
it 
ms liebhaber said her situation receiving regular child 
support and health care for her children was atypical of many 
single mothers who return to college 
she didnt have to hold down a job while attending classes and 
her daughter now 14 took care of her infant son and her other 
four sons did their own laundry and helped with housework 
i dont think my case is that extraordinary what im doing 
is what millions of women do without any kind of fanfare or 
acknowledgment she said fortunately for me ive been given a 
good intellect so that i can succeed in school 
although ms liebhaber was apprehensive about having her 
accomplishments publicized she hopes her story inspires other 
women 
its been a remarkable experience she said but i have a 
lot yet to do with my life im only 38

that as these feelings and pictures continued to occur and repeat 
that i had to prepare a way develop a plan make arrangements and 
i have done so

education secretary lauro cavazos urged 
students to join his campaign for education reform by appearing in 
person at a small indian high school and by satellite at remote 
schools across the west 
i came here to learn you can help teach me he told the 30 
students and dozen teachers and administrators at pyramid lake high 
school on friday 
we have serious problems in the united states in terms of 
education if we work together perhaps we can correct some of the 
mistakes we have made in the past 
cavazos joined four students to view and participate in a 
sociology class beamed by satellite to the remote paiute indian 
reservation school through the star schools program which 
offers advanced courses to classrooms in rural or isolated areas 
nixon is 48 miles northeast of reno along the shores of pyramid 
lake 
the satellite classes originate in san antonio texas and are 
sent out over the tiin united star network students can ask their 
tv teacher questions by telephone besides sociology the network 
offers such courses as advanced math science and foreign languages 
as the class featured guest the education secretary fielded 
questions from students in texas and oregon 
sociology teacher pat riley opened the door to one of cavazos 
favorite topics when she asked how his upbringing led him to the 
cabinet 
i started to school in a tworoom schoolhouse on a ranch in 
texas he said my father always told me education is the 
most valuable thing you can have and nobody can take it away from 
you 
cavazos said one of his goals is to convince parents that 
learning begins at home long before their youngsters are in 
school education begins with the parents he told mrs riley 
the secretary told the students he is concerned that 27 million 
people in the united states remain illiterate and that 28 percent 
of the nations students drop out 
although budget deficits occupy much of the time on capitol 
hill until you solve the education deficit you wont overcome 
the other deficits he said 
we made a commitment that wed go to the moon we went to the 
moon he told the students our national commitment to 
education must start right here in this room 
it was cavazos first experience with the star schools 
program since becoming education secretary sept 30 his department 
financed the four regional partnerships in the program with a 19 
million grant in october 
i welcome the opportunity to meet and share some thoughts with 
you he told the students your questions show an interest in 
education and a commitment to education 
monika new moon a junior at the nixon school said the 
satellite program allowed her to take courses her small school 
couldnt provide 
theyre pretty limited in the classes they have to offer its 
just the basics she said 
cavazos met privately with school officials tribal chairman joe 
ely and eugene paslov state superintendent of public instruction

the chinesesoviet alliance lasted only a decade 
but moscows influence lingers 30 years later in chinas stalinist 
political system huge public halls and propaganda posters with 
rosycheeked socialist workers 
a generation of writers in the 1950s filled their books with 
sovietstyle heros who fought for production not love architects 
copied soviet models to produce drearily grand buildings with high 
ceilings huge chandeliers and stuffy halls 
western artistic influences now far exceed the soviet 
influences and new buildings are modeled on western highrises but 
the soviet political stamp remains inbred in the structure of 
chinas government and communist party 
you call a ministry in china and can never find the right 
person when you do find him he cant make a decision just 
like in the soviet union complained a former chinese diplomat to 
moscow who spoke on condition of anonymity 
its more than just shared inefficiency china copied the 
structure of josef stalins government and communist party 
wholesale said zhu ruizhen a soviet scholar at the chinese 
academy of social sciences 
as in the soviet union authority was tightly centralized with 
orders flowing down from a handful of men at the top 
the party became a bureaucracy within a bureaucracy stationing 
officials in every government office with final say over decisions 
a weak legislature and oversized cabinet posed little threat to the 
partys power 
very little of this system has changed in china since its split 
nearly three decades ago from moscow soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev who visits beijing next week in a bid to smooth the 
breach has done far more than chinese leader deng xiaoping to 
shake off the stalinist political model 
chinas cabinet still is unwieldy with 41 ministers and 
although the legislature has become more active in drafting 
legislation in recent years it cannot formulate policy 
deng has taken major steps away from stalins economic model 
allowing market forces to set some prices but large sectors of the 
economy remain centrally planned with raw materials allocated by 
the center china still announces fiveyear economic plans like 
the soviets 
generally speaking we should cast off most of this said 
xing shugang also a soviet expert at the academy of social 
sciences the soviet system he said lacked a democratic 
foundation and in applying lenins principle of democratic 
centralism too much emphasis was put on the centralism 
democratic centralism should mean that the minority submits to 
the majority xing said if three of you take a position and i 
disagree i should submit to you but you should not gag me 
in the arts xing recalled soviet influence was powerful during 
the 1950s alliance years 
many soviet novels were translated into chinese but few 
western novels he said the soviet novels were filled with 
ironman heros who threw themselves into production for the 
motherland 
the soviets never wrote about love only about revolution 
said xing a generation of chinese authors copied the example 
as a result over the decades since the revolution china 
produced some good works of literature but none that are 
outstanding xing said 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost has dramatically relaxed the 
controls on soviet writers and led to a flurry of new literary 
activity but xing said this shouldnt be copied blindly from the 
soviets 
the soviet model is not good enough for china to study he 
said china should do better than the soviet union it should 
study some things from the west

antiarab anger has exploded in southern 
israel over the slaying of an israeli army sergeant and the 
disappearance of a second soldier both blamed on palestinians 
in ashkelon just north of the occupied gaza strip hundreds of 
israelis took to the streets last week screaming death to the 
arabs and stoning arabowned cars 
in nearby ashdod residents beat an israeli shopkeeper who 
employs arabs and fractured the skull of a palestinian motorist 
with a rock as he was waiting at a traffic light 
the arabs should be locked inside the gaza strip so they can 
destroy each other the time has come to punish them severely 
said ruth a 23yearold ashkelon secretary and neighbor of the 
missing soldier ilan saadon she would not give her last name 
outbreaks of antiarab emotion often follow palestinian attacks 
on israelis but the anger in recent days has escalated beyond the 
norm apparently compounded by rising frustration over israels 
inability to stop the 17month palestinian uprising 
hardline politicians sensing the grumbling across the country 
have stepped up their rhetoric and called for tougher measures to 
quell the rebellion against israeli rule 
speaking after the fatal stabbing of two elderly israelis in 
jerusalem on may 3 prime minister yitzhak shamir called on the 
israeli public to deal with terrorists 
if the murderers succeed they should not be allowed to escape 
in one piece said shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc 
his aides later denied he was urging vigilante justice 
transport minister moshe katsav of likud demanded the government 
seal off the occupied west bank and gaza strip for three months 
starting in july to crush the uprising 
the proposal expected to be discussed soon by the cabinet 
would bar palestinians from entering israel and journalists from 
covering the occupied lands 
their the palestinians free movement in sovereign israel has 
become dangerous katsav said 
during a threemonth closure he said efforts would be made to 
replace the 110000 palestinians from the occupied lands who now 
work in israel most in menial jobs such as construction 
agriculture and santitation 
palestinian employment is already down 
according to the central bureau of statistics palestinians put 
in about 25 percent fewer working hours each week than before the 
uprising in 1987 
the drop is attributed both to armyimposed curfews in the 
occupied areas and to palestinian general strikes called to protest 
israeli occupation 
in ashdod a mediterranean city of 80000 and hometown of slain 
soldier avi sassportaz officials are focusing their anger on arab 
employment trying to phase out most of the 1250 arab workers 
high school students for example were mobilized to clean 
streets during the independence day holiday when the gaza strip was 
under curfew 
mayor zvi zilker of likud wants to raise manual labor wages by 
25 percent to make the jobs more attractive to israelis and has 
suggested offering army veterans a oneyear university scholarship 
in exchange for one year of manual labor the city council will 
vote on the ideas sunday 
the proposals were sparked by the may 7 discovery of sassportaz 
body in a grave 15 miles south of ashdod authorities said 
sassportaz was shot to death by palestinians who gave a ride to the 
hitchhiking soldier feb 16 
the discovery unleashed several days of antiarab rioting in the 
city and city officials decided to escort arab workers to the gaza 
strip to prevent them from being attacked 
during a visit to ashkelon on friday antiarab sentiments still 
ran high in saadons shimson neighborhood a rundown housing 
project populated mostly by immigrants from morocco and the soviet 
union 
the arabs are walking around freely and nobody is stopping 
them they should not be allowed to enter israel said pinchas 
elka 18 a neighbor and former classmate of saadon who was last 
seen may 3 hitchhiking in southern israel 
ruth said that since saadons disappearance she has wanted to 
avoid all contacts with arabs at work we have arabs who clean 
i cant look them in the eye i hate them they pretend they are 
innocent but they hate us too she said 
ashkelon mayor eli dayan of the leftleaning labor party 
downplayed the antiarab outbursts saying they were incited by a 
few extremists 
however he said in an interview that if attacks on israelis 
continue authorities might no longer be able to contain the anger 
in the city of 60000

a federal appeals court ruling that the boston 
police department can conduct random drug testing of all officers 
raises memories of george orwell a lawyer for the patrolmens 
union said 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals on friday upheld a 
department regulation issued in april 1986 requiring random drug 
testing of all department employees 
i am deeply concerned for the health and safety of our police 
officers boston police commissioner francis m roache said after 
the decision they are human and engaged in perhaps the most 
stressful profession in our society therefore i believe that this 
drug testing policy is beneficial to the public as well as to the 
police officers in this city and in the country 
robert e guiney the president of the boston patrolmens 
association who sued the department in october 1986 to stop the 
testing plan criticized the ruling 
its an invasion of the body and an illegal seizure of body 
fluids without cause guiney said weve always taken the 
position that theres no room in police work for anyone taking 
drugs but we feel that police officers have the rights of every 
other citizen 
bostons 1600member patrolmens union immediately vowed to 
appeal the decision to the us supreme court both parties have 
agreed testing wont be imposed until all appeals are exhausted 
the twopage decision cited two us supreme court rulings in 
march that upheld the governments right to require drug and 
alcohol tests for us customs workers involved in drug 
interdiction and for railroad workers involved in accidents 
those verdicts said public safety outweighs constitutional 
guarantees against unreasonable searches 
in response to guineys suit us district judge robert e 
keeton upheld in may 1988 the departments right to test officers 
suspected of drug abuse but keeton ruled that imposing random 
tests without suspicion was unconstitutional and an unreasonable 
search 
these rules conjure up memories of george orwell said frank 
mcgee chief counsel for the boston patrolmens association he 
said no other major police departments in the country have random 
testing of all employees 
there are very major implications here mcgee said the 
broader question is how far can the government go in searching the 
bodies of its employees are blood tests and mandatory psychiatric 
tests next 
lawsuits filed by police unions also are pending against 
proposed drug testing in the detroit and chattanooga tenn police 
departments 
in march the nassau county police department in new york began 
random drug testing of certain narcotics squads in new york city 
random testing for drugs was started last october among the 
estimated 1000 officers assigned to the organized crime control 
bureau 
the maryland state police began a random mandatory testing 
program for all its members in 1986 but suspended the program after 
eight months when the state attorney general advised it may be 
unconstitutional

a radcliffe undergraduate has charged 
that a harvard law student forced her to participate in 
pornographic videos and raped her but a lawyer for the accused 
said the woman was a consenting partner 
the secondyear law student who is president of the 25member 
society for black professional entrepreneurs also is accused of 
using that group for sex forcing some members to undress in front 
of cameras 
thomas samoluk spokesman for the middlesex county district 
attorneys office said friday that investigators had been in touch 
with the alleged victim and were looking into the matter 
jill richburg 24 also a student at harvard law school and 
member of the entrepreneurs society said she was angered by the 
depiction of the group as a sex ring richburg said she knew of 
no one who was coerced into videotaped sexual activities 
harvard spokesman peter costa said internal hearings by the 
harvard law school administrative board began friday 
the board takes testimony collects evidence and can recommend 
disciplinary measures costa said but he wouldnt specify what 
action might be taken against the student 
the male students lawyer martin gideonse of cambridge 
described the incident as the unfortunate outcome of a broken 
relationship he said his client was devastated by publicity 
over the alleged incident 
he said his client and the woman were involved from april 1988 
until last fall and described the tapes as the result of private 
consensual activity 
the notion that theres a ring of some sort is garbage said 
gideonse its not a lurid widespread kind of thing people do 
things in the privacy of their own home and at some point somebody 
changes their mind 
gideonse said that in addition to his client and the female 
student there was only one other participant in the tapes a male 
harvard divinity school student who recently appeared on the phil 
donahue talk show as part of a panel of professional virgins 
there was no rape and there was no extortion gideonse said 
harvard officials began investigating after the radcliffe 
student filed a report last december with campus police accusing 
the law student of rape when she demanded that he erase videotapes 
showing her and others involved in sexual acts gideonse said 
the woman said she went to the law students apartment dec 11 
to persuade him to erase the videotapes she claimed he reacted by 
raping her and demanded money or sexual favors in return for 
destroying the tapes officials said

park rangers and volunteers searched the 
summit of mount rainier for a missing climber whose partner was 
found dead just below the 14410foot summit 
four search parties totaling 21 people were spending the night 
on the mountain after having been flown in by helicopter said cy 
hentges a mount rainier national park ranger 
hentges identified the dead man as richard mooney 33 of south 
lake tahoe calif who was one four people climbing the mountain 
together 
peter derdowski 26 of tahoe nev was missing he said 
if derdowski cannot be found today hentges said i would say 
it looks pretty grim 
their companions larry duin 26 and steve newell 27 both of 
south lake tahoe descended from the peak and notified authorities 
thursday 
mooneys body was found by duin and newell as they headed upward 
about 400 feet below liberty cap one of three summits around the 
crater of the dormant volcano hentges said the body was flown off 
the mountain friday he said 
the two survivors searched the summit area and the eastern side 
of the peak for the missing man before descending to the ipsut 
creek campground to report the death 
mooney had taken off his parka and tied it to his skis and 
probably died of hypothermia the parka was still tied to the skis 
when he was found 
derdowski apparently climbed toward the summit thinking the 
other two climbers were ahead 
he left his pack behind with the body hentges said 
we dont know what he took out of it the ranger added he 
didnt have a lot with him besides the clothes on his back 
the four climbers all of whom had skis for the descent down 
snowcovered glaciers started their climb sunday hentges said 
it the search looks less fruitful as we continue but you 
never know he said he derdowski was a strong climber

exxon and the coast guard planned more 
than a dozen flights over the site of the nations worst oil spill 
to chart routes for fishing boats and ensure a clean start to the 
halibut season 
the company and government officials also planned to test 
oilthinning chemicals on crudecaked beaches some 
environmentalists criticized the move but officials said it was 
necessary because seven weeks of washing and scrubbing by thousands 
of cleanup workers had proven ineffective 
authorities also reported that a soviet skimmer ship that exxon 
dropped from the cleanup effort earlier this week had been rehired 
for standby duty near the entrance of prince william sound 
vice adm clyde robbins the coast guards senior officer in the 
spill zone ordered eight flights saturday and eight more on sunday 
over fishing grounds in and around the sound the fishing industry 
had sought the flights as a means of allaying consumers concerns 
of oiltainted halibut 
the halibut season begins monday and the areas annual harvest 
has been estimated at 85 million 
since the exxon valdez ran aground on march 24 and spilled 
almost 11 million gallons of crude the herring season has been 
cancelled in the sound 
robbins also ordered testsprays of chemical dispersants on the 
beaches of ingot island in the sound on monday the chemicals are 
designed to thin the hardened oil 
it creates more of a hazard than its worth said cindy 
lowry a spokeswoman for the environmental group greenpeace 
right now it seems a pretty risky thing to try there are so 
many important pupping areas for harbor seals this is not the 
right time to do it 
earlier testing of dispersants proved inconclusive shortly after 
the spill 
in releasing the soviet ship vaidogubsky earlier this week 
exxon had blamed hardened oil for jamming the skimmers pumps and 
rendering it ineffective 
nevertheless alyeska pipeline service co hired the 11400ton 
vessel under a 15000aday contract through the end of may 
executives for the company that operates the transalaska pipeline 
said 
alyeska hired the craft for standby backup at the entrance 
to prince william sound said spokesman tom brennan he said the 
vessel would provide extra protection in case of another spill 
meanwhile gov steve cowper signed legislation to create a 
state commission to investigate the exxon valdez spill and to 
impose tougher spill fines the law would increase fines for spills 
caused by gross negligence to as much as 50 a gallon or a maximum 
of 500 million from 10 a gallon or 100 million 
cowper also signed a bill that imposes stricter liability laws 
on companies responsible for oil and hazardous material spills 
the spill bills were the first to become law since the exxon 
valdez ran aground 
the national transportation safety board has hearings scheduled 
next week in anchorage to investigate the cause of the accident 
the fired skipper of the tanker joseph hazelwood 42 of 
huntington ny faces trial june 20 in valdez on charges that 
include operating the vessel while intoxicated 
an executive at exxon shipping co said hazelwood may have felt 
pressure from alyeska and exxon to sail late at night on march 23 
despite the presence of icebergs in prince william sound according 
to a report in the boston globe if joe hadnt pulled out of 
valdez at 10 after he finished loading at 8 alyeska would have 
been on the phone to the west coast office said the manager 
whom the newspaper didnt identify in a few minutes the ships 
satellite phone would have rung telling joe to get his ship out of 
there hed have to come up with a real good reason to stay 
the globe said exxon spokesmen refused to comment on the report

about 250 protesters with economic and ethnic 
demands rampaged through streets of a city near the iranian border 
setting fire to shops and pelting police with stones a newspaper 
reported 
the may 9 riot in nebitdag a western city in the republic of 
turkmenia followed a rampage in the republics capital ashkabad on 
may 1 in which more than 100 young people were arrested 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said in a report friday that 
about 50 people had been arrested in nebitdag and that two 
policemen had been injured by the crowd 
the crowd overwhelmed the citys small police force which had 
to call in reinforcements said ns radzhabov head of the local 
interior ministry office 
all of two weeks ago you could boldly say about turkmenia that 
it was one of the quietest regions of our country the newspaper 
said the soviet union has been hit by unrest in many of its 15 
republics homelands for some of its more than 100 ethnic groups 
but radzhabov told the paper that a crowd of mostly turkmen aged 
1640 gathered in the center of nebitdag and rebuffed police who 
tried to talk to them 
we tried to quiet the people but they started throwing 
stones he said the crowd split into two each of which moved 
down streets of the city demolishing and setting fire to 
cooperative cafes and stalls 
the paper said that like the crowd in ashkabad they expressed 
anger at cooperatives the small private businesses that president 
mikhail s gorbachev has fostered to fill gaps in goods and 
services provided by the state economy 
but the crowd in the nebitdag also turned some of its wrath on 
armenians the paper said 
armenians are involved in a bitter dispute with azerbaijanis 
over control of the nagornokarabakh region armenians are 
traditionally christian azerbaijan and turkmenia both bordering 
iran are on opposite sides of the caspian sea and are 
traditionally moslem 
many soviets are suspicious that cooperatives are interested 
only in quick profits and are havens for organized crime pravda 
the communist party daily said may 3 that the ashkabad crowd was 
angered by high prices of cooperatives and the low quality of 
goods and services 
radzhabov said their main complaint was about cooperatives and 
that the crowd shouted slogans directed at people of armenian 
nationality 
the paper said that unhappiness with traders at turkmenias 
markets might be the fault of local merchants who buy up goods from 
tadzhiks uzbeks armenians and others as soon as they arrive in 
turkmenia

the government is testing us oil tankers at 
border entry points for solvents pcbs waste oil and other 
impurities used by traffickers to dilute shipments and boost 
profits officials and news reports said 
environment minister lucien bouchard announced friday that as 
part of a plan to stem the alleged tide of contaminated fuel 
shipped from the united states only 50 of the 175 border crossings 
will be open to oil tankers 
bouchard said the change will allow closer inspection of 
imported fuels to ensure they are not tainted with pcbs or other 
chemicals that can produce cancercausing furans and dioxins when 
burned 
the minister said inspection teams have begun taking samples 
from tanker trucks at major uscanada border crossings and that 
no contaminants have been found in 12 samples analyzed so far 
an environment canada official said consumers would not have to 
stop driving their cars or turn off their furnaces because of fears 
of tainted fuel bill milliken said if the toxic wastes and 
solvents were mixed with fuel the levels would not be high enough 
to have a health impact 
pcbs or polychlorinated biphenyls were used mainly as a 
coolant in electrical transformers but have been banned in north 
america because of health concerns 
the political opposition however continued to insist the border 
action by the conservative government would do little good 
jim conrad executive vicepresident of the petroleum marketers 
association estimated the testing and closing of border crossings 
to the shipments will cost canadian consumers up to 500 million a 
year 
the globe and mail newspaper reported monday that the solvents 
were mixed secretly into fuels the past four years sold to 
customers in western new york and taken across the border for sale 
in the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec 
the report in the globe and mail quoted unidentifed law 
enforcement sources and participants in what it said was lucrative 
trafficking 
it said the shipments of altered gasoline diesel and industrial 
heating fuel originated in new york state 
the globe and mail reported friday at least 26 million gallons 
of toxic solvents were shipped to texas from sarnia ontario and 
blended into gasoline over a twoyear period some of the tainted 
gasoline came back to sarnia and was sold in ontario and quebec 
bouchard also announced that the royal canadian mounted police 
will lead a task force investigating the report that millions of 
gallons of imported fuel were contaminated by the toxic wastes 
us governors from the great lakes state visiting canada on 
thursday and friday were asked repeatedly at their public 
appearances about the report 
michigan gov james blanchard said the news was to be taken 
seriously but its something thats basically news to us 
the governors said state environmental officials would discuss 
the issue at a summer meeting

businessmen opposed to a bill banning 
unsolicited facsimile advertising thought it natural to lobby the 
governor by fax but they may have sent the wrong message by 
jamming his machine for hours 
you could not have done a better job of bringing home the 
problem adressed in the bill that you oppose charles monagan an 
aide to gov william oneill wrote thursday in a letter to the 
national fax users committee 
the committee opposes a bill awaiting oneills signature that 
would prohibit them from marketing their products by facsimile 
machine without first obtaining the permission of the recipient 
violators would face a 200 fine 
in a campaign apparently organized by the committee dozens of 
connecticut businesses sent oneills office a form letter by fax 
arguing against the fax ban beginning thursday the letter argued 
it would cost the average company 6000 a year to obtain 
permission before sending facsimile messages 
the stream of messages was so constant 40 came in before 10 
am that the governors office turned off the fax machine 
thursday when they turned it back on friday the messages still 
were pouring in 
oneills press secretary jon l sandberg said the governor 
still hasnt decided whether he will sign the bill 
but aides said the persistent lobbying campaign proved how 
annoying unwanted messages can be the inconvenience was compounded 
because the governors office was unable to use its facsimile 
machine to receive information about spring flooding around the 
state 
in his letter monagan urged the californiabased fax users 
committee to come up with a different and more effective way of 
getting your message across 
the committee doesnt have a listed telephone number so monagan 
did the logical thing he transmitted the letter to the committees 
fax line 
a facsimile message sent by the associated press to the national 
fax users committee to a telephone number listed on the committees 
documents went unanswered friday

the communist khmer rouge will try to 
launch a blitzkrieg against phnom penh after vietnamese troops 
withdraw from cambodia resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk 
said today 
sihanouk 67 told reporters he was sure civil war would 
erupt in cambodia after the pullout that vietnam has pledged to 
complete by sept 30 the khmer rouge would seek a quick victory 
before countries start recognizing the vietnameseinstalled 
government as the nations legitimate rulers he said 
the prince said the khmer rouge with an estimated 40000 
guerrillas and enough weapons for 120000 fighters would go to 
battle unless they are included in a provisional government 
he said the provisional government should include the 
vietnameseinstalled government and the guerrilla coalition 
comprising the khmer rouge sihanouks forces and the 
anticommunist forces of former premier son sann 
he said hun sen premier of the phnom penh government was 
absolutely wrong to believe that an alliance between hun sen 
and sihanouk would bring peace to cambodia 
we have to acknowledge the khmer rouge are certainly very 
bad people very cruel they are even criminals but they are 
there he said 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 ousted the radical 
khmer rouge that had ruled the country since the spring of 1975 and 
set up another communist government 
the khmer rouge came to power by defeating the usbacked 
cambodian government during its brief rule up to 2 million 
cambodians were killed in purges or died of starvation 
the khmer rouge on friday dismissed calls for an immediate truce 
as a trick it said the vietnamese also used during the war with the 
americans to prepare for a military offensive a text of the 
broadcast was seen today in bangkok 
thailand recently proposed a ceasefire before vietnams 
pullout and the vietnameseinstalled government and the 
noncommunist guerrilla groups have agreed 
the khmer rouge rejected the proposal on monday in fridays 
broadcast it said that before a truce there first must be 
a vietnamese pullout under international supervision 
supervision of the withdrawal in strategic areas of cambodia 
supervision of the ceasefire 
supervision of the disarming of all sides and 
reduction of all forces to a level to be agreed upon by all 
sides 
otherwise this ceasefire will be a deception and a lie and 
would be most dangerous it said

100 people killed by the new peoples army in a purge of suspected 
military spies in their ranks following a series of arrests of

it took eight years and four murder trials 
but a jury finally agreed with what an antiques dealer had said all 
along he killed a 21yearold man in selfdefense not in a 
jealous rage 
after eight years of mental physical and financial torture 
it feels good that justice finally has been served james 
williams said after his acquittal friday 
the 58yearold savannah dealer had been convicted twice in the 
may 2 1981 slaying of danny lewis hansford but those verdicts 
were overturned on appeal a third trial ended in a hung jury 
the fourth trial was moved to augusta at the defenses request 
and defense attorney frank seiler credited the change for the 
verdict 
i knew we had to get it out of chatham county thats the 
key he said 
im not surprised im delighted williams concurred 
theres a difference this jury up here was fair and square 
and so was the judge these people knew how to read between the 
lines 
prosecutors alleged williams was having a homosexual affair with 
hansford and shot him in a jealous frenzy then arranged the scene 
to make it appear to be selfdefense hansford was shot three times 
in the study of williams home 
williams admitted the shooting but said he shot only after 
hansford fired at him first during an argument 
district attorney spencer lawton jr said he accepted the 
verdict it is not my practice to secondguess jurors he said 
williams was prominent in savannah society as an art expert 
restorer of old homes and historic preservationist he had hired 
hansford to work around his home a restored 1860s mansion 
on thursday a former girlfriend of hansford testified that he 
drank too much used drugs didnt want to work and was hostile 
toward williams 
debbie blivens told prosecutors hansford had a room in williams 
house and lived there williams had testified that hansford was a 
house guest but did not live with him 
in closing arguments friday seiler contended the prosecutions 
case was based on a ridiculous theory 
murder she wrote hasnt come up with the bizarre things 
theyve dreamed of he said referring to the cbs television

plo chief yasser arafat left the capital 
today after accusing washington of using blackmail and threats 
against the world health organization to prevent the plo from 
joining the un body

prospects for middle east peace told a news conference late friday 
that us threats resulted in the plos membership bid being

mugabe is chairman of the nonaligned movement a grouping of 
third world nations that is an alternative to the east and west 
power blocs the plo considered by zimbabwe to be an independent 
state is a member of the movement

in harare arafat also accused the united states and israel of 
blocking efforts toward middle east peace saying all the 
initiatives were being made by the plo

riot police with truncheons and 
shields held back thousands of protesters denouncing the death of a 
student who dissidents claim was killed by police 
students and kwangju residents pushed and shoved riot police 
guarding a square in front the provincial government building as 
speakers denounced the government of president roh taewoo 
troopers rushed out with truncheons and shields hitting and 
kicking the protesters to stop them from reaching the government 
building 
but police did not prevent about 10000 people from holding a 
rally in the square in front of the building in this provincial 
capital 170 miles south of seoul there were no immediate reports 
of injuries and arrests 
protesters cheered and applauded as their leaders called for a 
nationwide movement to topple roh and expel us troops from south 
korea speakers accused roh of attempting to impose authoritarian 
rule and the crowd responded with chants of down with roh 
taewoo 
earlier demonstrators shoved riot troopers blocking the way as 
about 15000 people tried to march to the city center to denounce 
the death of radical student lee chulkyu whose body was found 
wednesday 
in seoul the government said today it has protested to the us 
government for irresponsible remarks over lees death which it 
said were made publicly friday by a us state department official 
in washington 
assistant foreign minister lee jungbin said a us official 
termed lees death a deplorable event and atrocious act and 
said we hope the murderers will be exposed and severly punished 
the foreign ministry said it told the us embassy in seoul that 
the remarks lack a sense of responsibility and could affect the 
investigation the us embassy did not return telephone calls 
inquiring about the comments 
the crowd cheered as dissident leaders claimed police 
interrogators tortured lee to death 
this barbarous act was committed by the suppressive security 
forces to suppress the national democratic movement claimed 
dissident leader chang kipyo

incident are demanding a full and independent investigation into 
his death and punishment of police officers allegedly involved 
police have denied any official involvement in lees death 
doctors said an initial autopsy failed to determine the cause of 
death 
lee was being hunted by police for pronorth korean articles and 
other political activities he had spent almost two years in jail 
for antigovernment activities 
lees death could provoke widespread protests in kwangju 
especially since it came one week before the anniversary of a 1980 
antigovernment uprising in the city in which at least 192 people 
died 
south korea has been rocked by violent antigovernment protests 
and strikes in recent months but radical groups have little public 
support because of their violent tactics and extreme views roh has 
ordered a series of crackdowns to stop the dissident movement

about 1000 chinese students began a hunger 
strike in tiananmen square today to press for democratic reforms 
and student leaders said the government agreed to discuss their 
demands 
student leader wang dan of beijing university said students 
still may be in the square on monday when soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev arrives for the first sinosoviet summit in three decades 
as for whether we will disrupt mr gorbachevs visit to china

good experience in political reform however he said he didnt

im sure he wont come to tiananmen square to get involved in 
chinese politics 
student leaders also said that on friday night in a major 
concession the government agreed to hold talks with an independent 
student group on the student demands for sweeping democratic 
reforms and an end to official corruption 
but they made certain conditions said wang chaohua a 
graduate student at the chinese academy of social sciences 
they said the number of student delegates could not exceed 
20 and reporters would be allowed to issue only partial reports 
on the talks the students are demanding that the talks be 
broadcast in full 
miss wang said the students were not satisfied with the offer 
the offer nevetheless is a major concession because the government 
previously had insisted that all talks be held through 
governmentsponsored student unions

protest which marked the eighth time students have marched to 
tiananmen since they began a campaign for political change on april

the state law that requires pregnant 
teenagers to have the consent of a parent or a judge before 
getting an abortion has been called constitutionally infirm by 
a florida appeals court 
the 5th district court of appeal in daytona beach agreed with 
lake circuit judge jerry lockett who ruled may 4 that the 
abortionconsent law was unconstitutionally vague 
the appeals court also said in its ruling friday that the state 
law failed to protect the privacy of minors guaranteed under roe 
vs wade the us supreme court decision which made abortion legal 
rulings by district courts of appeal are binding statewide 
unless as often happens in controversial cases another state 
appeals court decides to take a similar case and reaches a 
different decision said volusia circuit judge c mcferrin smith 
then for the decision to apply statewide it would have to be 
appealed to the florida supreme court 
the court in a 21 ruling sent the case back to lockett with 
the order that he dismiss the petition filed by a 15yearold 
pregnant teenager who had sought his permission for an abortion 
the decision to terminate the pregnancy is up to the girl 
and her physician without state regulation the court ruled 
the state law was so vague the ruling said that there was a 
clear danger that trial judges would render a decision on the basis 
of their own moral religious or political beliefs regarding 
abortion 
judge warren cobb who issued a twoparagraph dissent said the 
court should send the issue to the florida supreme court as 
requested by attorney general bob butterworth 
the law approved by the legislature last year requires single 
girls under age 18 to get permission from a parent guardian or 
judge before obtaining an abortion 
it says judges can grant approval if they decide the girl is 
sufficiently mature to make the decision if consent is being 
unreasonably withheld by a parent or guardian or if the girl fears 
emotional or physical abuse if she tells her parents

countries today voted to readmit egypt 10 years after cairos 
membership was suspended for signing a peace treaty with israel 
the kuwaiti oil minister said 
sheik ali khalifa sabah of kuwait declined to say whether the 
vote was unanimous but sources said libya cast a negative ballot 
the vote a step by egypt back into the arab fold came at a 
meeting of 10 oapec nations egypt is the 11th member of the 
kuwaitbased organization 
before the meeting arab sources called cairos reinstatement a 
foregone conclusion 
libyas oil minister fawzi shakshouki indicated tripoli 
opposed egypts return to oapec but would abide by majority 
decision 
we will not pull out shakshouki said 
he said however libya would continue to oppose egypts return 
to arab organizations as long as the causes of its suspension do 
not vanish 
egypt lost its place in all arab institutions after its 
membership in the arab league was suspended in 1979 for signing the 
camp david accords with israel egypt has still not been reinstated 
by the arab league but that move is expected at a may 2324 arab 
summit in casablanca morocco

organizations but the syrians have in recent months moderated 
their stand against egypt 
opening the meeting oapec chairman mana saeed otaiba the 
united arab emirates oil minister called for restoring egypt to 
oapec 
the arab family will remain incomplete as long as egypt 
remains outside he declared egypt is a mother sister and 
daughter of the arab nation we hope this meeting will handle 
the question 
oapec sources said the organizations charter stipulates that 
twothirds of the members and twothirds of the founders must vote 
for membership to be restored 
oapec was founded in 1968 by saudi arabia kuwait and libya as 
a forum for coordinating arab oil policies the other members are 
iraq the united arab emirates qatar algeria tunisia bahrain

a lawyer handling a paternity suit 
against coleman young says hes ready to start negotiating support 
payments after releasing blood tests indicating the detroit mayor 
fathered a 6yearold boy 
paternity is practically proved with that one iota of 
possibility that hes not the father and i think that in a court 
of law this would be acceptable evidence to prove that he is 
dearborn lawyer noel keane said friday 
results from edward w sparrow hospital in lansing show a 
999999 percent likelihood that young 70 fathered joel loving 
the boy lives with his mother annivory calvert in fontana calif 
a second set of tests analyzed at the memorial blood center of 
minneapolis inc at the request of youngs attorneys showed a 
99999 percent likelihood the mayor is the father 
calvert 34 a former detroit assistant director of public 
works took a job as public works director in fontana shortly 
before filing her suit in january she was out of the office on 
business friday and unavailable for comment her secretary said 
young was vacationing friday and could not be reached 
until all institutions have reported and particularly until 
the dna fingerprinting is reported the attorneys for mayor young 
will have no further comment youngs attorney lawrence 
charfoos said in a written statement 
keane said further action is unlikely pending results of similar 
blood tests by cellmark diagnostics of germantown md those tests 
also were requested by youngs attorneys he said 
tests to determine paternity included dna analysis and at least 
14 other comparisons of the blood samples 
calvert seeks unspecified child support keane said she also 
wants young to exercise visitation rights he said 
keane said he expects young who has been married and divorced 
twice to acknowledge paternity when all the results are in 
clearing the way to negotiate childsupport payments 
calvert said she had a relationship with young from 198087 
keane has released snapshots of young holding calverts baby the 
attorney said the child is aware that young has been alleged to be 
his father 
he was asked here in my office who his dad was and he said 
coleman young keane said but he kind of said it very 
sheepishly because it was maybe something that he was told not to 
go around saying 
young is expected to seek his fifth term as mayor of the 
nations sixthlargest city later this year and some supporters 
have alleged the suit was filed for political reasons

the roman catholic church highly 
influential in panama has condemned strongman leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega and called on his soldiers to quit terrorizing 
residents 
police maintained roadblocks in sections of the capital early 
today and groups of us servicemen attended discotheques despite 
strong us advice to remain on military bases 
the church in an unusually stern statement friday assailed 
last sundays elections as fraudridden and appealed to the noriega 
supporters who beat the opposition candidates with pipes sticks 
and rubber whips to act with moral restraint 
latin american leaders also intensified efforts to negotiate an 
end to the crisis as hundreds of us troops soldiers in by 
president bush to protect americans in panama or working at the 
panama canal arrived at us bases nearly 1900 us soldiers are 
expected to arrive over the next week 
japan also urged the government to respect the general will of 
the people the request came in a letter from japans ambassador 
to panama jumpei kato about election irregulaties 
meanwhile noriega and acting president manuel solis palma 
remain out of sight neither has been seen in public or made a 
statement in a week 
the government blaming the united states in part for 
interferring in internal affairs nullified an election in which 
international observers said opposition candidate guillermo endara 
was beating noriegas handpicked candidate carlos duque 3to1 
no new elections have been scheduled 
venezuela a leader in the regional democratic effort and a 
vocal opponent of noriega recalled its ambassador friday 
following similar moves by the united states and mexico 
the washington post reported in todays editions that venezuelan 
president carlos andres perez during an interview offered noriega 
asylum in venezuela the paper provided no further details on the 
offer 
the united states has sought to oust noriega from power since he 
was indicted on drugtrafficking charges last year in miami and 
tampa fla noriega head of the 15000member defense forces 
denies the charges 
noriega has successfully weathered political and economic 
turmoil since febrary 1988 when he engineered the ouster of 
president eric arturo delvalle delvalle tried to fire noriega 
after the general was indicted 
the united states continues to recognize delvalle despite the 
installation of solis palma and has hit panama with economic 
sanctions that created cash shortages caused capital flight and 
contributed to a decline of its international banking business 
on friday panama postponed classes for its 600000 school 
children and 60000 university students citing actions by the 
deranged administration of president bush 
government television appealed for calm while a 
governmentcontrolled newspaper named bush bum of the day 
in washington the organization of american states accepted 
venezuelas proposal to discuss the panamanian crisis on wednesday 
approval came after a stormy twohour meeting 
but panamas representative carlos russell blasted us 
actions saying we will not bow to the colossus of the north 
in a sharp break from the government the church in this 
predominately catholic nation of 22 million assailed the electoral 
process and civil unrest 
what moral justification can there be for terrorizing the 
population with gangs feeding on hate and a false nationalism 
the statement said 
the statement and the american decision to add reinforcements to 
the 10000member us force were inspired at least in part by a 
wednesday attack by thugs on endara and his two vice presidential 
running mates endara remained hospitalized friday but was 
described to be in good spirits 
c141 and c5a jets the largest in the american arsenal landed 
at howard air force base about every half hour with marine and army 
troops vehicles and other equipment 
a marine sergeant said were glad to be here arriving 
troops were not permitted to be interviewed 
about 3000 dependents of american military and embassy 
personnel and civilian military employees have moved onto military 
bases as have an estimated 160 panamanians seeking refuge 
the southern command canceled all unofficial offbase activities 
and urged military personnel to stay out of public areas 
there has been no official panamanian reaction to the increase 
in troops which is permitted under the 1977 torrijoscarter treaty 
that will give the panama canal to panama at the end of the century

earlier killings

association and resisting arrest also arraigned on murder and 
other charges were alvaro de leon valdez and omar francisco orea 
dressed in a prison uniform and standing behind bars in a 
chamber off the courtroom ms aldrete denied she was involved in 
constanzos death 
she shook her head no when an official of the 58th federal

interrogation said she urged alvaro de leon valdez to obey when 
constanzo 26 ordered himself and martin quintana killed to avoid 
capture

they stop shooting that they the police were going to kill all 
of us she told the court 
i never gave orders to kill adolfo she said 
at the end of the proceedings ms aldretes lawyer horacio 
moyar quintanilla told the court there was no evidence to support

shooting himself on sept 17 was described by constanzo as his 
godson 
ventura was interpol chief in mexico since early 1985 interpol 
is a parisbased organization that coordinates police actions 
against international criminals 
ms aldrete has specified that she practiced christian 
santeria which she said did not include human sacrifices 
however she described rituals involving sacrificial killings of 
animals the way i found out about the deaths and everything that 
happened at the ranch was when the bodies were shown on 
television she said she said it was then that constanzo told 
her how they were killed 
she said four victims including texas college student mark 
kilroy were human sacrifices the others she said were killed 
over drugs money or other disputes 
she said she wanted to flee after group members fled to mexico 
city when the bodies were found but said constanzo told her you 
wont leave here any way but dead since you are a loose cannon 
she said she was constanzos girlfriend for about a month in 
september 1987

is sufficient evidence to presume guilt or drop the charges the 
three are not eligible for bond if he orders them held he then 
has a year in which to sentence them or find them innocent

panamas wouldbe presidentelect 
guillermo endara spent his 53rd birthday in a hospital bed 
recovering from an attack by thugs at a postelection political 
rally 
it was an unlikely spot for endara a portly affable lawyer and 
former law professor who headed the opposition ticket in sundays 
presidential elections supporters on friday gave him an impromptu 
birthday party there 
the government declared itself ahead when it stopped the vote 
and nullified the election wednesday blaming among other things 
american interference 
exit polls showed endara and his two vice presidential 
candidates with an edge of about 31 
on wednesday men wearing tshirts of noriegas dignity 
battalions battered endara and his two presidential candidates in 
a bloody street scene captured by foreign cameras sending endara 
to the hospital 
they were not battalions and they have no dignity endara 
said earlier in a hospital interview as supporters held up his 
bloodied guayabera a shortsleeved smocktype shirt favored by 
many latins 
endara a veteran member of the panamanista party ran very much 
in the shadow of panamas grand old man of the opposition arnulfo 
arias madrid who died last summer in selfimposed exile in miami 
endara was arias spokesman in panama until arias died and used 
to speak almost dreamily of the day when arias would return as 
a sign of providence to lead the country 
endara lost control of the party in december to hildebrando 
nicosia who ran as a thirdparty candidate and finished third 
the opposition liberal authentic party adopted endara and the 
coalition democratic opposition alliance ran him for president 
endara served twice in the national assembly and was arias 
minister of planning and economic policy in 1968 when arias was 
thrown out of office for the third time after only serving 11 days 
as president 
endara went into hiding was jailed for a time and eventually 
fled to exile when arias reorganized his party as the authentic 
panamanist party in 1983 after a long ban on political activity in 
panama endara helped 
endara who studied at the university of panama in argentina 
and in new york lacked arias charisma and spent most of his time 
behind the scenes of the oppositions seemingly endless attempts to 
replace the de facto military power that has ruled panama for 21 
years 
in a preelection interview he put faith in the hope that the 
democratic process in panama would prevail electoral fraud or not 
he said if he won noriega would be given a chance to leave 
gracefully and be fired if he refused 
noriega has hired and fired presidents pretty much at will since 
he took over the military in 1983 his last victim was eric 
delvalle who tried to fire noriega after the general was indicted 
on drug charges last year in the united states 
even so endara said he trusted the democratic process 
remember delvalle was in very different circumstances he 
said he was a puppet of the military by the fraud of 1984 
thats the price you pay for not being a democratically elected 
person you are subject to the decisions of the military 
he and his wife marcella have one daughter also named 
marcella

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze warned today that the kremlin might have to consider 
developing a new nuclear missile if nato upgrades its shortrange 
rockets 
after a meeting with foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
which shevardnadze described as reflective of a new stage in our 
relations the soviet diplomat berated us resistance to talks 
on shortrange nuclear weapons 
what is to be feared by talking shevardnadze said at a news 
conference no one can be forced in negotiations to do what he 
does not want to do 
he described nato plans to replace its current arsenal of lance 
missiles with new rockets of longer range as development of a new 
weapons system and said the kremlin would not want to have to 
take a similar step 
this would have to be considered but it would not be by our 
own choice shevardnadze said 
he likened the new missiles nato plans to develop to the soviet 
ss23s that are being removed and dismantled under the superpowers 
december 1987 treaty on the elimination of mediumrange missiles 
nato plans to replace the lance rockets which have a range of 
less than 75 miles with missiles capable of reaching as far as 300 
miles or the upper limit of the shortrange category 
the soviets contend the nato plan known as modernization 
violates the spirit of the inf agreement and would spoil the 
atmosphere at other arms control talks 
that view is shared to a large degree by west germany which has 
called for ussoviet negotiations to remove the shortrange 
rockets most of natos arsenal is deployed in west germany 
genscher is the driving force behind west germanys recent 
insistence that the negotiations be opened soon in conflict with 
natos position that such talks aimed at elimination of shortrange 
forces be made contingent on a balance of eastwest conventional 
arms 
president bush again rejected the soviet call for shortrange 
negotiations after secretary of state james a baker iii visited 
moscow on wednesday 
the question of how to proceed on the shortrange missiles has 
resulted in a situation where the soviet and west german positions 
are closer than those among the nato allies 
west german chancellor helmut kohl joining other alliance 
leaders said after his talks with shevardnadze on friday that 
scrapping the weapons was out of the question as long as the warsaw 
pact had superior numbers of conventional forces and tactical 
nuclear weapons 
but kohl held firm on west germanys position that negotiations 
should be held promptly to reduce the shortrange forces 
shevardnadze and genscher also discussed plans for the june 
1215 visit to west germany of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev although those details were not immediately disclosed 
bonns insistence on shortrange arms negotiations has split the 
alliance before a crucial nato summit scheduled at the end of may 
shevardnadze arrived in bonn one day after gorbachev announced a 
new arms reduction initiative during a meeting with baker 
gorbachev reiterated his call for negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear weapons and also announced a proposal to withdraw 500 
soviet battlefield nuclear weapons from europe unilaterally 
baker rejected the call for talks on shortrange nuclear 
arsenals and said the other part of the initiative was a public 
relations move

werent looking for trouble but were ready if it came

aboard cargo jets friday at this base in fairfield 35 miles 
northeast of san francisco had been angered by what he knew of 
recent events in the troubled latin american nation 
i watched the beating of that man a panamanian opposition 
candidate on television said greg reith a 24yearold private 
in the light infantry divisions field artillery unit it just 
didnt seem right to me id like to get my hand in there and see 
if i couldnt do something about it 
reiths personal message to panamanian military leader manuel 
noriega would be 
look out because theres some light fighters coming to town 
he better keep his eyes open 
president george bush ordered nearly 1000 fort ord troops and 
about 1000 from other bases mobilized to help protect us 
citizens in panama the 7th infantry division is designed to travel 
light so that it can be deployed swiftly anywhere in the world 
in louisiana the first of more than 700 soldiers being sent to 
panama from the 5th infantry division at fort polk left today some 
went by plane and the others headed by truck convoy to beaumont 
texas where they were to board a cargo ship along with their 
vehicles the louisiana contingent includes 20 women in noncombat 
jobs such as mechanics or electronics repair 
the fort ord troops in combat gear and their faces splotched 
with green camouflage paint departed aboard c5 and c141 cargo 
jets that screamed skyward throughout the day 
many of the divisions soldiers refused to comment saying they 
had been instructed not to talk with the media 
among the handful who talked with reporters most said they were 
prepared to go that this would be a good test of their training 
and that they were just doing their job 
im not scared im just curious whats going to happen we 
knew this was coming we just didnt know when said a 
21yearold soldier from southern california who declined to give 
his name 
pfc daniel grabowski 20 of cleveland assigned to the field 
artillery units operations center leaned against a jeep as he 
awaited his turn to load aboard a cargo jet 
grabowski in the army just a year said this is his first

cpl roger little of milwaukee echoed other soldiers comments 
that they knew little of the panamanian situation 
all i can do is what im told to do the president says ive 
got to go theres got to be a good reason he said 
little 23 who is attached to the air defense artillery section 
that operates the highly potent stinger missile acknowledged pride 
in the weapon adding i hope we wont have to use it 
one soldier who refused to be interviewed was nevertheless in 
good spirits mugging for television cameras he smiled waved and 
said hi mom then turned to his companions beaming and added 
ive always wanted to do that

there is no fanfare just a 
biographical introduction he is a retired marine lieutenant 
colonel wounded twice in vietnam won silver star and bronze star 
married four children planned the grenada rescue applause 
involved in apprehending the achille lauro hijackers applause 
helped plan the raid on libya applause 
ladies and gentlemen oliver north 
as one the audience rises a woman waves an american flag a 
man with a flag in his lapel lifts his son so he can see better a 
few women wipe their eyes 
north steps on the stage it has been just seven days since a 
jury convicted him of three felonies and he is about to make his 
third 25000 speech in two days 
i never considered myself to be a hero he says i stand 
before you this evening as a frail and flawed human being like the 
rest of you 
the words this evening before a nearcapacity audience of 3000 
in the front row theater in this cleveland suburb sound 
spontaneous they arent he said them at a morning appearance at 
the same theater and in kansas city the day before 
this is oliver north on the lecture circuit making profitable 
use of his time while he awaits sentencing june 23 to enter the 
hall he had to pass demonstrators who chant ollie bush reagan 
partners in crime and jail ollie jail to the chief as well 
as those who praise him as an american hero a la ronald reagan and 
george bush 
north speaks to mostly friendly audiences in kansas city at a 
feed industry association meeting his talk on commitment trust 
and family was part of a convention package this evenings 
audience paid 1875 a ticket this mornings 1775 
he speaks about the dangers to the young posed by drugs about 
meddling by congress about his faith in god and his absolute 
belief that everything will turn out all right for him back at 
that sad swamp along the potomac the harshest words are reserved 
for the news media especially cbs and dan rather 
we have been told by the media those great thinkers that 
mickey gorbachevs a good guy he says at one point the 
american people are fairer and wiser than perhaps cbs and the 
washington post would have us believe he says at another 
north is polished and impassioned not much different from the 
way he testified before congress two years ago and at his trial 
which ended may 4 with guilty verdicts on three charges and 
acquittals on nine 
he has notes but only glances at them and rambles from thomas 
jefferson to manuel noriega to his belief in family and god the 
speech is sprinkled with wit some spontaneous some manufactured 
in kansas city when the introducer turned to the wrong side of 
the stage to welcome him norths first words were i didnt mean 
to sneak up behind you but i have a reputation to uphold 
his podium here was in a theaterintheround and the stage made 
one complete circuit every 13 minutes i noticed im going to the 
left said north it maybe the only time in my life im turning 
left 
he said he would prefer being introduced simply as the husband 
of one and the father of four i got that backward a couple of 
weeks ago he said and the audiences in missouri laughed and so 
did the ohioans but he said i was in san francisco and 
nobody noticed 
when a young questioner said the only news out of the white 
house since george bush moved in concerned the presidential 
puppies north replied i didnt have anything to do with the 
puppies nor did i have anything to do with millie being pregnant 
rex runyon a vice president at the american feed industries 
association said north was booked last year for 25000 he called 
north the hottest property on the publicspeaking circuit today 
indeed he said after word got out about the north engagement 
some people paid the 500 nonmember convention fee just to hear 
north 
north himself says i am reluctantly a man of great 
visibility and i do not stand before you today and ask you to 
endorse what i did or failed to do 
north says he has has been investigated more than any mafia 
figure and refers to himself as one who has been blamed for 
everything from the greenhouse effect to the horrible rain showers 
we had last week in washington 
he makes no bones about his conservative views 
the government has a responsibility to promote the general 
welfare not to provide welfare to the general public 
we have now an imperial congress trying to usurp the 
presidency 
i remain deeply skeptical about gorbachev today in the 
soviet union you can criticize former dictators but you cant 
criticize the present one i am an unrepentant anticommunist i 
hope im not one of the last 
we have a congress totally opposed to giving the nicaraguan 
freedom fighters anything but bandaids and doughnuts if we are 
going to have a constitutional amendment that limits the term of 
the president of the united states we ought to have an amendment 
that limits the terms of congress 
that last line gets applause every time north builds up to it 
by deploring electoral gridlock because 98 percent of 
congressmen seeking another term win it more people are returned 
on a regular basis than are returned to the politburo in the soviet 
union he says 
he sees drugs and voter apathy as americas greatest dangers 
and he urges greater support for police officers who are 
outgunned outpaid and outraced 
norths evening appearance here lasted more than two hours more 
than half of the time spent answering questions 
what constitutes leadership the political leaders of this 
nation ought to be people who dont simply wet their fingers in 
their mouth and test the wind 
it is obvious that many in the audience think that north should 
be one of those leaders 
mr north i salute you said one man you had a set of 
something we all know about you had the guts to stand up to 
congress your answers were better than the questions those stupid 
congressmen asked please give us a chance to put an x behind your 
name 
north fields that one if i was so damn smart i wouldnt be in 
so much trouble 
later he returns to the theme someone who incurred the wrath 
of daniel ortega moammar gadhafi abu nidal and dan rather must 
have done something right 
he tells the audience his family has endured because of its 
belief in god 
i honestly believe the good lord has a plan for all of us 
its all going to end well 
north speaks of the enormous legal expenses that have piled up 
his bills during the trial have been estimated at 380000 a month 
but he does not say whether his speaking fees go to lower that 
debt 
a woman asked where she can contribute money north replied that 
the north defense trust established by his former us naval 
academy classmates is the only one that has my endorsement and 
not a penny goes to me personally 
he answers questions until the master of ceremonies calls a 
halt north says goodbye with the marine motto semper fidelis 
always faithful 
again there is a standing ovation norths two bodyguards rush 
down and lead him out of the theater and north heads for his 
chartered jet and back to the sad swamp

a politburo commission blamed most of the 25000 
deaths in armenias earthquake on shoddy construction and turned 
its findings over to prosecutors to file criminal charges tass 
said saturday 
the catastrophic consequences of the earthquake in armenia are 
explained above all by the low quality of the building and assembly 
work by the inadmissible violation of design norms and the 
strength of underground tremors the official news agency 
reported 
there would have been no such huge number of human casualties 
if the established standards and regulations at all stages of 
construction from design to assembly were observed it said 
the report ended an investigation that began immediately after 
the dec 7 1988 earthquake which measured 69 on the richter 
scale and destroyed leninakan spitak kirovakan and other cities 
of northern armenia the politburo commission was headed by premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov 
the commission turned its findings and materials over to the 
procurator generals office to file criminal charges and bring 
those responsible to account tass said 
many of the structures that fell in the earthquake were newly 
constructed multistory apartment buildings which are common 
throughout the soviet union they collapsed in heaps of rubble 
trapping their inhabitants about 500000 people were left homeless 
many older buildings with fewer stories remained standing 
the soviet union is faced with an acute housing shortage and has 
turned to construction of identical prefabricated blocks throughout 
the country 
ryzhkov traveled to armenia immediately after the earthquake as 
early as middecember he said that poor housing construction was a 
likely cause of the high number of deaths the commission report 
confirmed that suspicion 
it said the poor construction was aggravated by a lowering of 
seismic standards in the quakeprone region in 1978 
tass gave no indication how widespread the criminal 
investigation would be nor how many people would be prosecuted 
officials have said it will cost billions of dollars to rebuild 
the armenian cities but they have pledged to do it within two 
years and under strict standards designed to prevent a repeat of 
the disaster 
the commission reported that 400 million of construction work 
was done in the quake area through april 
but it reported complacency and lack of coordination in supply 
and construction workers are only able to unload 1600 of the 
2000 rail cars that arrive daily in armenia with building 
supplies it said

as house speaker jim wright wages a 
painstaking legal battle against ethics accusations there is a 
growing feeling among his colleagues that the larger war for public 
opinion is slipping away 
while wrights eightlawyer defense team filed a series of 
motions contesting the formal case against wright last week the 
speaker was battered by a series of reports and events including 
the resignation of a top aide over the aides criminal past that 
kept him publicly on the defensive 
the motions have the look of a formal highrisk 
allcardsonthetable strategy said one wright supporter rep 
pat williams dmont but he noted a significant change in 
perceptions of wrights standing among colleagues theres a new 
gloomy dark feeling among the speakers supporters 
one participant in a recent strategy meeting in wrights office 
likened the atmosphere to what it must have been like inside the 
nixon white house during watergate according to two sources who 
were there 
many and not just the speakers supporters are bitter about 
what they see as the unfairness of a process that holds wright to a 
new and tougher behavior standard than the one that prevailed when 
many of the alleged rules violations occurred but few deny the 
reality of the political damage already done 
the daily revelations are not helpful said rep jim 
slattery dkan theres a twofront war being waged here one is 
the technical legal war and the other is the public relations war 
it would be a good idea to win both its absolutely essential that 
you have a clear victory in one or the other 
two other midwestern democrats from different states who a few 
weeks ago believed wright might be able to survive as speaker now 
have changed their minds he should step down this hurts 
everybody said one who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
he can survive the ethics question but i dont think he can 
survive the political question 
those who have come to such a conclusion are not willing to be 
quoted by name fearing reprisals or being seen as disloyal 
one reason for the changing mood is that lawmakers have grown 
weary of the publics perception of congress as preoccupied with 
its own internal problems serious public policy problems such as 
the federal budget deficit are not getting the attention they 
deserve they contend 
wrights potential problems have grown faster than his legal 
team which he bolstered last week with the addition of houston 
trial lawyer stephen susman senior adviser clark clifford and 
several associates 
on thursday john mack one of the speakers most able and 
trusted senior aides resigned amid new reports about his 
conviction 16 years ago for a brutal attack on a woman 
mack said in a statement he did not want to become an additional 
burden to wright but the resignation raised the profile of an 
matter with greater emotional content than many of the ethics 
charges surrounding the speaker it tended to personalize the 
speakers problems said rep dan glickman dkan 
since the ethics committee formally charged wright on april 17 
with 69 instances of violating house rules new problems have 
surfaced each week 
former employees of the pacific institute a seattle wash 
firm that markets motivational programs have questioned whether 
wrights wife betty did any work to earn the 36000 salary she was 
paid from 1984 until the ethics probe opened last june wrights 
office issued a statement last week from company chairman louis e 
tice asserting that mrs wrights performance of her assigned 
duties was excellent 
the committee continues to look into a lucrative texas gas 
drilling venture that yielded a quick 170000 profit for wright 
last year and plans this week to question fort worth lawyer tom 
law the administrator of wrights blind trust 
news stories have raised questions about whether wright 
received preferential treatment in his unsuccessful 100000 
investment in a texas nursing home venture receiving dividends and 
interest payments unavailable to other investors wright also is 
reported to have taken unreimbursed plane rides on the companys 
aircraft but the speaker said he can recall no such rides 
the justice department has expressed renewed interest in 
wrights dealings and said this week it will review the evidence 
for possible criminal violations once the house ethics case runs 
its course 
one member of wrights team rep robert torricelli dnj 
defended the speakers emphasis on his legal defense that has 
always been the speakers strongest position the principle 
struggle now is to prevail legally the politics will follow 
the lawyers soon will make oral arguments on their crucial 
motion to dismiss the most serious charges probably the week of 
may 22 
in making his assessment torricelli conceded a point that only 
underlines wrights troubles that house rules are out of date with 
current public expectations time has passed circumstances have 
changed and ethical standards have appropriately risen he said 
implicit in that statement is that wrights dealings selling 
his books in bulk to interest groups and accepting financial 
benefits from a fort worth friend while meeting the letter of the 
rules are out of step with washingtons new tougher ethical 
climate 
theres such a tremendous shifting sand of ethical standards 
right now that nobodys really clear on what is ethical and what is 
not stanley brand a washington lawyer specializing in ethics 
said in a recent speech to lobbyists ethical mores in washington 
change almost daily you have to keep ahead of the curve

seventeen women all black and most of them crack 
addicts and prostitutes have died mysteriously in the same area 
since 1986 there have been no signs of violence no signs of 
illness nothing to suggest who or what may have killed them 
was it a serial killer who knows how to hide signs of violence 
a deadly new form of drug abuse investigators dont know 
last week after a new wave of publicity dade county medical 
examiner joseph davis officially declared the cases homicides but 
davis acknowledges that the cause of death remains unknown and 
investigators say they are as frustrated as before 
if in fact there is a killer or killers out there or if 
its caused by crack cocaine we just dont know yet says john 
farrell chief of the headquarters division of detectives for 
metrodade police we consider them open cases and were 
investigating them as if they were homicides 
fbi behavioral scientists and experts from the national centers 
for disease control in atlanta have been called in by local 
authorities to study the sparse data their reports are not 
complete 
farrell notes that there is not even a proven link among the 
deaths which began in september 1986 however there is a pattern 
the bodies of all but one of the women were found in a narrow 
predominantly black section of miami and an adjoining 
unincorporated area of dade county they were lying in overgrown 
vacant lots abandoned houses or back alleys the victims skirts 
were up or pants down indicating recent sexual activity all but 
two had traces of cocaine in their blood most were known as 
willing to trade sex for crack money 
none however showed any signs of trauma or violence and the 
cause of death is listed as unknown the latest known victim peggy 
gooden 27 was discovered april 2 
the geographic distribution of these cases lends support to a 
presumption of probable homicide based on the absence of other 
proven alternatives at this time davis said 
there are several theories on what is killing the women but 
there are problems with each 
if a serial killer is at work he has gone to great lengths to 
hide his method of killing the women the working assumption is 
that the killer would somehow strangle or smother them a 
difficult cause of death to establish 
and police say it strains credulity that the women would quietly 
suffocate without screaming fighting or resisting enough to show 
signs of trauma 
the serial killer theory has a different problem there are no 
reports from other street people of suspects and no close escapes 
matching the circumstances of the deaths 
dr lee hearn chief toxicologist for the medical examiners 
office says the bodies were even checked for cyanide but no 
traces were found people who are poisoned generally show signs of 
illness before their deaths and none of the women did 
that leaves the possibility of a previously unknown kind of 
chemical reaction in which small amounts of cocaine perhaps 
coupled with genetic factors a rundown physical condition or 
sexual stimulation resulted in sudden death 
but that theory too has holes hearn notes why isnt the same 
phenomenon occurring outside this narrow area in new york los 
angeles or even neighboring fort lauderdale and why is it 
affecting only black women there are plenty of white crack addicts 
as well 
two of the women had no cocaine at all in their bloodstreams 
hearn notes although it is always possible that their cases are 
unrelated to the rest 
one possible explanation for the narrow geographical 
distribution of the deaths could be a single dealer distributing 
crack that is cut with a deadly chemical but officers sent out 
into the area to buy samples have found nothing unusual hearn says 
tests didnt disclose any such toxic agent 
we just dont know whats killing them farrell says and 
the people in the street are just as confused as we are some think 
its a killer and some think its the crack but well keep on 
investigating and well find an answer

when soviet and chinese leaders last met in 
beijing nikita khrushchev hurried out of town with a dour look on 
his face and summitry between the communist giants was put on hold 
for three decades 
a new kremlin chief is coming to town monday and better results 
are expected 
chinese analysts believe president mikhail s gorbachev will 
find common ground with deng xiaoping the 84yearold leader who 
has transformed china with marketoriented policies that 
resurrected the crippled economy 
the two are reformers said xing shugang an expert on 
soviet matters at the chinese academy of social sciences they 
ought to have a common language 
gorbachev also will meet communist party chairman zhao ziyang 
who is closely identified with the economic refoms and premier li 
peng who studied engineering in the soviet union 
a western diplomat said privately that gorbachevs meeting with 
zhao might go particularly well because both are men of vision 
under pressure for pursuing risky reforms 
amicable meetings would go far to erase unpleasant memories of 
the frosty summit of september 1959 between khrushchev and mao 
tsetung whose relationship was marked by vast ideological 
differences and mutual distrust 
by the end of that september meeting the chinesesoviet rift 
was out in the open khrushchev wasnt wearing a smile as he 
left for moscow recalled zhu ruizhen a russianlanguage 
interpreter for mao 
personal friction aggravated the difficulties between the two 
leaders 
khrushchev and mao never got along said a foreign ministry 
official who spent several years in the chinese embassy in moscow 
mao was introverted and khrushchev was very flashy that 
contributed to the problem 
other chinese scholars said mao who avidly studied history and 
wrote lengthy political essays and esoteric poetry regarded 
khrushchev as uncultured 
gorbachev has shown an ability to impress and was able to 
establish good working rapport with prime minister margaret 
thatcher of britain and former president ronald reagan 
we think gorbachev will be more adept at handling our 
leaders than khrushchev said the ministry official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity he has many advisers who were present 
during the last summit they know the problems and they understand 
chinas need for certain things 
our leaders want a certain measure of respect deng xiaoping 
is an old revolutionary and we believe gorbachev will treat him as 
such 
xing the sovietologist said good personal chemistry is 
important because gorbachev and deng play the most important 
policymaking roles in the two countries

teenage girls who are pregnant or have 
children are not getting the support they need to complete their 
educations and are likely to experience discrimination at their 
schools a new survey indicates 
few schools have clear policies about how to treat pregnant 
and parenting students authors margaret nash and margaret dunkle 
of the equality center write in a report called the need for a 
warming trend 
most schools fail the title ix test the authors add 
referring to the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in 
schools that receive federal aid 
the findings are based on a survey completed by administrators 
teachers or counselors at a dozen diverse schools in eight states 
they reflect the results of two earlier studies and according to 
experts in the field the general school climate for students who 
have or expect children 
pregnancy is far and away the leading cause of female dropouts 
at least 40000 girls quit school each year because they are 
pregnant according to the center for population options 
the report by the equality center a washingtonbased nonprofit 
research group said these girls are often overlooked in 
discussions of atrisk students and dropout prevention programs 
making the school environment more hospitable for these female 
students and for teenage fathers can make a significant dent 
in dropout statistics as well as provide these young parents with 
the education they and their families need the authors wrote 
the survey responses revealed title ix violations at nine of the 
12 schools with several having multiple violations 
among the violations were not allowing absences from school for 
prenatal or postnatal care or problems associated with pregnancy 
requiring pregnant students but not students with other medical 
conditions to have a doctors certification to stay in school and 
not permitting enough leave to recover from pregnancy and birth 
all schools said pregnant and parenting students could be club 
members be on the ballot for class favorites and participate 
in graduation ceremonies but at one of the schools they are not 
always allowed to run for student government be club or class 
officers or run for prom or homecoming queen or court 
other schools did not allow the students to be eligible for 
scholarships financial aid and prizes on the same basis as other 
students and did not allow them to participate in sports or 
athletics programs although there was no medical reason to exclude 
them 
the schools did comply with some important requirements the 
survey found none of the schools use pregnancy or parenting as a 
reason to expel or suspend students the authors said further 
none required that these students enroll in a special program or 
school or have home instruction rather than stay in regular 
classes 
but the climate remains chilly the authors said most dropout 
prevention efforts do not focus on pregnancy and parenting most 
schools do not keep attendance dropout or enrollment statistics on 
pregnant or parenting teens and many pregnant girls simply 
disappear before graduation 
all but one school in the survey reported that lack of adequate 
child care makes it very hard for teen mothers to stay in school 
one school had an onsite toddler center but none of the schools 
had onsite infant care the hardest kind of care to find and the 
most critical in terms of getting a mother back into the classroom 
before she drifts away permanently 
the survey also found that twothirds of the schools have 
someone available to tell pregnant girls about health services and 
half of them have someone who can tell the girls about social 
services such as welfare food stamps nutrition programs and child 
care but only a minority routinely refer girls to community 
agencies and some schools did not view coordination as their 
responsibility 
the neglect appears to stem from a feeling that they brought 
this on themselves and the fact that girls who become pregnant 
and parents usually are not the best students experts say 
they tend to be marginal students said karen pittman 
director of adolescent pregnancy prevention at the childrens 
defense fund they are the kids who are not noticed a lot are 
left to just quietly slide 
she and others said the results of the equality center survey 
though based on a small sample are representative of what is 
happening at schools across the country 
you can generalize from that sample said ann m wilson a 
social work professor at rutgers university and a board member of 
the national organization on adolescent pregnancy and parenting 
for example she said there are only three schoolbased day care 
sites in new jerseys 611 school districts 
wilson pittman and rebecca stone of the center for population 
options stressed that schools vary widely in what they offer to 
pregnant and parenting students but pittman said of the survey 
what theyre reporting is generally true and probably true 
roughly in the proportions that its being reported 
schools in the survey were benito juarez high school in chicago 
thibodaux high school in thibodaux la natchitoches parish in 
natchitoches la bladensburg high school in bladensburg md 
gaithersburg junior high school in gaithersburg md southern 
middle school in lusby md north caroline high school in ridgely 
md minuteman vocational technical high school in lexington

the environmental protection agency announced 
saturday steps to ban using the growth regulating chemical alar on 
apples and other foods but said final action is not likely for at 
least 18 months 
alar is used by some apple growers and became the center of 
controversy recently when a private study cited it as being 
particularly harmful to children who eat large amounts of apple 
products 
the uproar prompted some school districts to stop serving apples 
and in some cases has has caused parents to stop using them 
despite assurances from the epa and the growers themselves 
the epa until recently estimated that only about 4 percent of 
the apples continue to be exposed to alar but the agency said 
saturday that recent findings have caused them to increase that 
estimate the epa now estimates that as many as 15 percent of last 
years crop may have been sprayed with alar 
the epa had said in february that it would begin regulatory 
action aimed at alar and has urged that the chemical technically 
called daminozide be voluntarily taken off the market because it 
has been found to cause cancer in test animals 
alars manufacturer uniroyal chemical co has disputed the 
health claims and continued to sell the chemical which keeps 
apples on trees longer and provides longer shelf life 
earlier this week a trade group that represents processors of 
apple products urged the epa to announce a formal regulatory action 
to ban the product in hopes of dissuading growers from using it 
many food processors claim that checks are made for alar and 
apples containing the chemical are not used in products such as 
apple sauce and juice consumers have not been convinced however 
and the recent concerns about the chemical have caused a drop in 
apple product sales of as much as 20 percent according to the 
processed apples institute 
jack moore acting deputy administrator said the epa has 
proposed ordering alar off the market because it over a lifetime 
it poses unreasonable risks to the public 
moore reiterated as he did in february when announcing the 
agencys intention to ban the chemical that the health risk is not 
great enough to warrant an emergency ban which could go into 
effect immediately 
i want to emphasize that based on our current estimates the 
shortterm risks of eating food treated with daminozide are not 
significant and do not pose an imminent or major publichealth 
threat said moore in a statement 
the agriculture department and the food and drug administration 
also have pronounced apples safe for consumption even though some 
may contain alar 
the epa began a review of alar in 1984 and two years later 
proposed taking it off the market after it was found to have caused 
cancer in test animals those findings were challenged however 
and the agency directed additional studies 
the studies have yet to be completed but moore said preliminary 
evidence is clear enough to warrant rulemaking procedures that 
eventually will direct alar not be used a final ban is not 
expected for nearly 18 months and could take twice that long if the 
action is challenged epa officials said

the soviet union today began a 
partial withdrawal of soldiers and tanks stationed in 
czechoslovakia it was the first pullout of permanent soviet forces 
since a 1968 invasion to crush communistled reform 
a 6mile column of soviet army vehicles headed home from the 
north moravian city of olomouc according to staterun media a 
brief ceremony sponsored by local communist party officials marked 
the departure the reports did not say how many soldiers and tanks 
were in the procession 
the partial withdrawal of soviet soldiers was announced in 
december by mikhail s gorbachev as part of an overall plan to cut 
the red army by half a million men by 1991 
gorbachevs promised withdrawal of 50000 soviet troops and 
5000 tanks from east germany hungary and czechoslovakia by 1991 
began last month with the much publicized departure of 31 t64 
tanks from a base in southern hungary soviet troops and tanks have 
also begun to leave east germany 
until alexander dubcek launched the shortlived prague 
spring reforms in 1968 the kremlin had no troops or tanks 
permanently stationed in czechoslovakia 
soviet and other warsaw pact troops and tanks first entered the 
country for lengthy maneuvers in mid1968 in a sign of increasing 
nervousness among czechoslovakias communist allies over dubceks 
reforms 
the warsaw pact forces withdrew to just over the czechoslovak 
border in july 1968 but returned aug 20 the invasion crushed 
reforms and led to the expulsion of dubcek and nearly 500000 
others from the communist party 
according to western estimates the soviets have about 80000 
soldiers in czechoslovakia czechoslovak chief of staff gen 
miroslav vacek said in february the soviets will withdraw 5300 
soldiers 708 tanks and 20 planes by the end of 1990 four 
battalions numbering some 1500 men will be withdrawn this year

authorities searching through tons 
of debris found a 24yearold man alive more than 14 hours after a 
runaway freight train jumped its tracks at 90 mph and slammed into 
a row of houses killing four 
chris shaw was halfasleep in his home friday when the 
outofcontrol train catapulted off a curve locomotives and 
freight cars loaded with unprocessed potash were sent crashing into 
11 houses including his 
he was found shortly before 9 pm and spoke to rescuers who fed 
him oxygen through a tube and encouraged him throughout the 1hour 
rescue operation 
i would never have believed that this individual could have 
survived where he was said a rescue coordinator whose name was 
not immediately available he had major train parts against his 
body 
the body of the fourth victim of the crash the brakeman was 
found early today 
shaw apparently was able to survive after metal debris formed a 
cave creating an air pocket with enough oxygen to sustain him 
said gene brooks a rescue supervisor 
im glad my son is out of the house said his mother 
maryann shaw i was so confused i told him that his mama was 
outside and i was out here for him 
he suffered a broken right leg said joy flint a nursing 
supervisor at san bernardino county hospital shaw was in serious 
condition early today 
christopher is awake and alert and in good spirits mrs 
flint added 
the southern pacific freight apparently lost its brakes near the 
top of the 4190foot cajon pass and careened down the flank of the 
san bernardino mountains said southern pacific spokesman jim 
loveland 
during their desperate plunge the fiveman crew radioed that 
they were out of control then the train twothirds of a mile 
long plowed into a modest neighborhood of singlestory homes about 
740 am in san bernardino about 60 miles east of los angeles 
killed were conductor everett s crown 36 brakeman allan

with her watched as the body of a little boy a school chum of 
daniels was carried away he saw them taking the body out under 
a blanket and he started crying ms fricks said 
dogs used to search for victims of the 1985 mexico city 
earthquake were flown in from northern california to help find 
reiss whose body was discovered about 230 am today 
scores of rescuers worked to free shaw his house was shattered 
and he was buried under debris and tons of the sandlike potash 
ms shaw said her son had been drowsy and was lying in bed in a 
front bedroom i knocked on the door and told him to remember to 
shut everything off because he has a habit of leaving the iron 
on she said 
after the crash she stared at a 25foot tower of wreckage 
covering the house only the mailbox was still standing 
hospitals in the area reported treating at least eight people 
for varying injuries including engineer frank w holland 34 who 
was in serious and stable condition late friday suffering from 
fractured ribs bruises and cuts said jo coffey a nursing 
supervisor at st bernardines hospital 
the other crew members who suffered minor injuries were engineer 
larry hill 42 and brakeman robert waterbury 57 
one of the trains five crew members radioed to a dispatcher in 
los angeles that the train was out of control loveland said the 
mayday call was received by the dispatcher shortly before 730 am 
the 69car freight had four engines in front and two helper 
engines in back the rear engines had applied full brakes 
the national transportation safety board will coordinate 
investigation of the crash 
police sgt dan hernandez said six houses were destroyed one 
had major damage and four had minor damage property damage was 
estimated at 600000 
red cross spokeswoman kim schwartz said a shelter had been set 
up at the inland job corps center and 237 people had been fed and 
housed at area hotels friday night 
the train was all over the place it looked like a toy in a 
sandbox said eyewitness al dorame it was just everywhere in 
peoples yards pieces of the axles were in peoples yards sand 
covered a whole house some of the people thought it was an 
earthquake 
crews pumped 11000 gallons of diesel fuel from overturned 
engines to prevent an explosion

reformers in the nations secondlargest city 
have begun a grassroots campaign to oust leningrads communist 
party chief from the ruling politburo a move that would have been 
unthinkable a few years ago 
the reformers defeated 12 local party leaders during march 
elections for the new soviet legislature and now are seeking to 
remove those leaders from their regular communist party posts the 
reformers say 
the prime target is yuri f solovyov leningrad party chief and 
a member of the politburo 
pyotr filippov a leader of the recall movement said his group 
is working through small communist party groups to demand 
solovyovs replacement 
whats important is that change is coming from below said 
filippov 
solovyev is the highest ranking of the approximately three dozen 
party officials nationwide who lost in the march 26 elections to 
the congress of peoples deputies 
the defeats in the nations first multicandidate elections were 
an embarrassing blow to the communist party 
filippov said he believed there is support now among leningrad 
party members to hold a special conference on the removal of 
solovyov as party chief and the ouster of other oldline leaders 
onethird of the party members must agree before such a conference 
can be held 
filippov said solovyovs ouster as leningrad party chief likely 
would persuade the politburo to remove him from that elite body 
membership on the politburo is determined by the 20 members and 
by the larger central committee of toplevel communists 
solovyovs loss in the congress of peoples deputies was 
particularly humiliating because he failed to to win 50 percent of 
the vote even though he had no opponent 
after his defeat solovyov complained bitterly at the communist 
party central committee plenary meeting in moscow that the party 
had lost its unity 
that earned him sharp criticism from soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev who supports greater openness in soviet affairs 
elections for the seat solovyov sought and for 197 other 
unfilled seats in congress of peoples deputies seats are to be 
held sunday the seats still open are those in which no candidate 
received more than 50 percent of the vote during the march 
balloting 
many of the reformers are running for leningrads four remaining 
seats in the new legislature 
already several communist party organizations in leningrad have 
passed resolutions demanding the special conference to replace the 
leningrad leadership said marina salye a party member and 
candidate in sundays election 
she said reformers will intensify the fight for a special party 
conference as soon as the current election is completed 
moscow said its an internal affair in leningrad filippov 
said he said he considers that a green light for the sort of 
grassroots political action mentioned by gorbachev 
but speculation persists that moscow plans to preempt the local 
uprising by appointing an outsider to solovyovs post said a 
western diplomat who declined to be named 
most of the representatives to the congress of peoples deputies 
were elected from districts based on geography another 750 seats 
were reserved for representatives from the communist party trade 
unions and social and professional groups 
the new congress is to open on may 25

the zonies and zdonks are sure bets but 
the aoudads were nothing but trouble says a man who wants to make 
a business out of exotic livestock 
believe me away from here its a good business i just hope 
to make it a good business here said farmer glawson gantt 
gantt makes his living selling ordinary horses cattle and 
donkeys on his north louisiana farm but he expects to expand his 
line within the next year 
the 57yearold entrepreneur who already had buffaloes llamas 
buzzards peacocks and pheasants on his farm bought two zebra 
stallions at an exotic animal auction and plans to breed them to 
his donkeys and shetland ponies the resulting animals will be 
zdonks and zonies gantt said 
dont just everybody want a zebra gantt said recently 
theyre mean as satan and if you take out after them there isnt 
a fence that can hold them but you mix them with a donkey or 
shetland pony and what you get is as sweet as can be 
the halfshetland pony hybrid will sell for 1500 the 
donkeyzebra cross will go for up to 3500 gantt said 
although you wont find these animals in the dictionary the 
crossbreeding of zebras to donkeys and horses has been done for 
years said david anderson curator at the audubon zoo in new 
orleans zoos consider the resulting animals nothing but 
curiosities he said 
gantt already has had success with his bobbydoes the half 
sheep half goat can sell for up to 600 he had less luck when he 
was given some aoudads a type of african sheep with long curved 
horns 
theyre kind of goatlooking things and can jump 16foot 
fences he said we couldnt keep ours penned up as far as i 
know theyre still running wild out in the woods 
i keep waiting to hear about some hunter shooting a creature 
that nobody can identify but i guess they cant catch up with them

bush quoted the slain civil rights leader dr martin luther 
king saying that intelligence is not enough intelligence plus 
character that is the goal of true education 
he also noted his own 41year history of support for the united 
negro college fund and said he hoped to help college students get 
into government work through his new recruitment program for 
parttime and summer positions 
later today bush was speaking at the mississippi state 
university commencement the last in a trio of graduation addresses 
over two days 
on friday bush chose texas aampm university to make a major 
foreign policy speech in which he called for a new era of relations 
with the the soviet union he challenged gorbachev to meet goals 
that will establish a friendship that knows no season of 
suspicion no chill of distrust 
signaling a willingness to shift from previous us approaches 
bush announced that he wants to move beyond the traditional 
containment policy toward moscow to welcome the soviet union 
back to the world order 
our goal is bold more ambitious than any of my predecessors 
could have thought possible the president said 
but he warned that the soviets would have to meet certain 
expectations making good on its promises of openness and 
democratization for the relationship to take off 
bush made the comments in a commencement address at texas aampm 
university in college station texas 
bush spent the night in his adopted hometown of houston where 
he went for a jog and dined out with friends 
his speech friday staked out a forwardlooking approach geared 
to making the most of what national security adviser brent 
scowcroft called this unusual phase of history when the soviets 
are also taking a new approach 
the united states now has as its goal much more than simply 
containing soviet expansionism we seek the integration of the 
soviet union into the community of nations bush said 
he offered the promise of improved economic and trade relations 
if the soviets meet the challenge of responsible international 
behavior by such steps as withdrawing troops around the world 
removing the iron curtain between east and west europe improving 
human rights and cooperating in solving regional disputes 
ultimately our objective is to welcome the soviet union back 
into the world order bush said 
scowcroft told reporters bush was not looking to make catchy 
headlines with his foreign policy 
none of our proposals are going to be that traumatic 
scowcroft said you dont turn a great nation like the us 
around quickly were talking about modifications of direction 
scowcroft had a dim view of an arms reduction proposal gorbachev 
made this week in moscow following meetings with secretary of state 
james a baker iii scowcroft said gorbachevs announcement that 
the soviets would unilaterally cut 500 shortrange nuclear weapons 
in eastern europe was designed principally to create problems 
within the nato alliance 
baker called gorbachevs offer a public relations ploy 
in his speech friday bush proposed two specific policy changes 
an open skies policy under which each country would be 
permitted to overfly the others territory and monitor military 
activities and easing of the 17yearold law the jacksonvanik 
measure that ties trade with the soviet union to emigration policy 
bush said he would support a temporary waiver of the rule 
and offer the soviets favored trade status if the soviets codify 
new laws ensuring free emigration 
ending discriminatory treatment of us firms would be a 
helpful step trade and financial transactions should take place on 
a normal commercial basis the president said 
bush said the hopeful indeed remarkable signs of soviet 
openness should be viewed with an eye toward deeds to back up the 
rhetoric and enduring ingrained economic and political change 
within the soviet union 
make no mistake a new breeze is blowing across the steppes 
and cities of the soviet union why not then let this spirit of 
openness grow let more barriers come down

kansas republicans are holding their 
collective breath hoping they will hear good news when sen nancy 
kassebaum reveals later this month whether she will seek a third 
term in 1990 
state democrats are equally anxious because of the chance an 
open seat would give them to elect a us senator for the first 
time in 50 years 
if kassebaum shuns another sixyear term it would have the 
biggest impact of any single event on kansas politics in many 
years not only would it portend a freeforall for her senate 
seat but it likely would put three us house seats up for grabs 
as those incumbents bid to succeed her 
indications are kassebaum will make her decision known this week 
contacted in washington last week she wouldnt say whether she 
had made a decision but said she would make a public announcement 
kassebaum said previously she will decide this month since she 
is scheduled to travel to yugoslavia the week of may 2226 her 
announcement could come within the next four or five days 
republicans have been urging kassebaum to run again imploring 
her both publicly and privately 
they see the woman who won reelection in 1984 with 76 percent 
of the vote as a shooin if she wont run two gop members of 
congress jan meyers and pat roberts are considered likely 
contenders for the partys nomination that would mean a costly and 
possibly divisive primary 
with democratic congressman dan glickman certain to try to 
succeed kassebaum if she doesnt run democrats see it as their 
best chance to elect a senator since former us rep bill roy 
narrowly missed ousting republican sen bob dole in 1974 
there hasnt been a democratic senator from kansas since 1939 
kassebaum 56 is the daughter of former kansas governor alf 
landon who lost the 1936 presidential election to franklin 
roosevelt her 1978 election made her the first female 
representative from kansas and the first woman elected to the 
senate without having been preceded by her husband at present 
shes one of only two women in the senate maryland democrat 
barbara mikulski is the other 
there are good arguments supporting both sides in the 
speculation over whether kassebaum wants to stay in the senate or 
call it quits after 12 years 
kassebaum is known to have told friends and political associates 
she was tired of washington and longed for a more private life and 
she pledged in 1978 she would serve only two terms she has also 
said she needs to consider her elderly mother theo landon 
on the other hand she is sensitive to her partys dilemma and

the united states and the soviet union are 
likely to reach agreement this week on expanding direct flights 
between the two countries soviet refugees coming out in rising 
numbers will get some of the prized future seats on aeroflot 
next month american and soviet experts in counterterrorism 
techniques will meet in moscow to consider exchanging information 
on murderous groups and how to curb them 
in september several soviet judges engaged in a liberalization 
of the countrys legal system will come to the united states to 
study american procedures 
amid all this progress the soviets have not torn down the 
berlin wall or renounced the brezhnev doctrine which justifies 
military intervention in east european countries to snuff out 
rebellion against communist rule 
but the cold war is receding 
secretary of state james a baker iii on his first trip to 
moscow last week helped push the dark shadows back more he and a 
team drawn from all over the us government started working with 
their soviet counterparts on a framework for cooperation in central 
america the middle east and on nine specific global problems 
these include terrorism earthquakes and other natural 
disasters climate changes and narcotics traffic baker and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze agreed to meet three or 
four times a year with the next session here in september 
specialists on the two sides will work out their own schedules for 
meetings 
as a result the ussoviet dialogue is expanding the 
opportunity for cooperation enlarged even beyond the detente era of 
ussoviet reconciliation in the 1970s 
but these developments are getting slight attention despite a 
strong effort by baker to shift the focus away from arms control 
and to regional problems on which the two sides could work in 
concert mikhail s gorbachev rolled out two headlinemaking 
initiatives at their meeting thursday in moscow for cutbacks in 
nuclear and conventional forces in europe 
knocked offbalance and cautious by nature the bush 
administration responded slowly to the soviet leader whose 
initiatives were having these results 
1 further strains within the north atlantic treaty organization 
alliance already divided by a dispute over whether th improve 
shortrange nuclear missiles targeted on warsaw pact installations 
west germany and other opponents of the missile modernization 
plan are inclined to be more receptive to disarmament than the 
hardline us and british governments all agreed at a nato meeting 
on friday in brussels that gorbachevs decision to remove 500 
nuclear warheads from eastern europe was modest in comparison to 
the withdrawal of 2400 us warheads over the last decade 
but gorbachevs moves intensified the pressure for negotiated 
reductions in shortrange nuclear weapons on both sides that the 
united states and britain regard as threatening to the defense of 
western europe 
his proposal to sharply reduce troops tanks artillery and 
other nato and warsaw pact conventional forces lends support to the 
argument that it is safe to negotiate nuclear missile reductions 
because the warsaw pacts nonnuclear edge will disappear 
baker called the proposition hypothetical at a news conference 
in brussels on friday im reminded he said of the old 
saying back home if the dog hadnt stopped he would have caught 
the rabbit i mean lets see it happen and then address that 
question 
2 the nato summit meeting may 2930 in brussels that was 
supposed to celebrate 40 years of western unity is now more likely 
to be marked by division over missiles and how to cope with 
gorbachev both baker and sir geoffrey howe the british foreign 
secretary failed in separate meetings this week to persuade west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher to back off demands 
for missile negotiations 
3 president bushs longawaited first foreign policy 
declaration delivered friday to the graduating class at texas a amp 
m university appeared pallid in comparison to gorbachevs moves 
bush revived a 34yearold open skies proposal first made by 
president dwight d eisenhower under which nato and warsaw pact 
countries would allow surveillance planes from the other side to 
fly over their territory 
his declaration that the soviet union still had to earn the 
right to membership in the world order and to warmer relations 
with western nations seemed out of step with fastmoving events 
let him do what he says unilaterally it would be good bush 
told reporters traveling with him saturday in mississippi asked 
whether he was going to win the public relations war with 
gorbachev bush said he wanted to win the peace war

less than two months ago a criminal investigator 
turned an anticorruption crusade into political magic and won a 
parliamentary seat with 86 percent of the vote 
today telman gdlyan is in trouble with the supreme court for 
jailing a scientist who died in prison and the countrys highest 
executive power said saturday he is interfering with an 
investigation of alleged abuses of power 
but gdlyans fellow investigator nikolai ivanov has charged 
the two are running into trouble because their investigations are 
making highranking officials squirm 
the controversy gripping gdlyan is a lesson both in rapidly 
changing soviet electoral politics and in president mikhail s 
gorbachevs effort to make his country one ruled by law rather than 
personal dictate 
gdlyan a 49yearold senior investigator with the prosecutor 
generals office last year exposed a corruption scandal in the 
republic of uzbekistan that brought him national attention 
an article on the scandal written by gdlyan and ivanov and 
published in ogonyok magazine caused uproar at the communist party 
conference in june and turned the two into national heroes 
several months later a criminal investigation began and led to 
the conviction of yuri churbanov the soninlaw of former soviet 
leader leonid i brezhnev on charges of accepting bribes he was 
sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp 
gdlyan capitalized on his popularity in march congressional 
elections the countrys first multicandidate nationwide ballot in 
70 years voters in moscows tushinsky district swept him into 
office with 866 percent of the vote 
the balloting was marked by a strong antiestablishment streak 
boris yeltsins reformist campaign garnered 89 percent of moscow 
ballots and disgruntled voters in leningrad and kiev voted against 
government and party leaders 
but in a statement published saturday the presidium of the 
supreme soviet the countrys highest executive body came down 
hard on ivanov and gdlyan 
the statement in the communist party daily pravda accused the 
prosecutors of making provocative statements in meetings and in the 
media about alleged violations of law by soviet leaders 
it said the investigtors statements were designed to 
disorient people and interfere in the work of a specially formed 
commission to verify the numerous complaints of citizens 
about abuses by gdlyan and ivanov in carrying out their 
investigative work 
on may 7 the supreme court said it found systematic abuse in 
gdlyans handling of an investigation into prominent estonian 
scientist ia hint the 67yearold scientist who won the 
prestigious lenin prize was convicted in 1983 of bribery theft 
and smuggling he suffered from a cardiovascular illness and died 
in jail 
gorbachev a lawyer by training has encouraged the soviet 
courts to take on controversial issues that in the past they rarely 
touched he has demanded the legal system be strengthened to 
prevent a return to rule by personal dictate characterized by the 
leadership of josef stalin 
the supreme court overturned hints conviction and questioned 
whether gdlyan should keep his job based upon charges he refused to 
hear hints arguments and denied him access to a lawyer when 
hints wife died shortly after his arrest the scientist was not 
told 
the court charged gdlyan showed an antihumanistic character 
alien to soviet criminal procedure and a cruel relation to the 
accused 
in an april 29 issue of the popular weekly arguments and facts 
ivanov said highranking opponents were responsible for attacks on 
them 
efforts to shield participants compromise investigators 
endless verifications are links of the same chain having 
little to do with the idea of creating a a government based on 
law he said

reformist leaders are getting the soviet union and 
china together again after 30 years of estrangement but mistrust 
between the two huge neighbors is rooted in the centuries 
when mikhail s gorbachev and deng xiaoping meet in beijing this 
week they may find old scars are still sensitive 
nikita s khrushchev was perplexed by his inability to deal with 
mao tsetung and blamed the chinese leader for the collapse of 
relations 
years later he wrote in his memoirs you might say that china 
is both close to us and far from us its close in that its our 
nextdoor neighbor and shares a long border with our country at 
the same time china is far away in that the chinese have little in 
common with our people 
in the 1950s with the nationalists driven from the chinese 
mainland and anticommunism at its height in the united states 
fear spread that the worlds most populous nation would unite with 
the strongest communist power to overwhelm america they have been 
viewed as a triangle ever since 
the marriage of neighbors survived less than a decade and in 
1972 the united states and china began a normalization process that 
challenged the kremlin to catch up 
mistrust goes back at least to the 13th century when mongol 
hordes invaded russia burning towns and villages slaughtering the 
residents and enslaving those they left alive 
soviet children still are taught of the brutality visited on 
their ancestors and of the historic victory of ivan the great who 
threw off the mongol yoke and established the russian state in 
1480 
a more recent seed of suspicion was planted in the infancy of 
the world communist movement 
in 1927 a decade after the bolshevik revolution chiang 
kaishek began a bloody purge of chinese communists with whom he 
was ostensibly allied 
josef stalin remained silent apparently unwilling to alienate 
chiang and expecting him to prevail during world war ii he aided 
chiangs nationalists against japan 
chiang fled to taiwan in 1949 stalin was the first to recognize 
the communist government on the chinese mainland mao traveled to 
moscow but spent much of the 10 weeks he was there waiting to see 
the soviet dictator they signed a 30year treaty of friendship 
khruschev wrote that stalin ignored chinas special sensitivity 
to foreign exploitation the soviets wanted access to chinese 
resources but mao resisted mindful of the unequal treaties and 
trade concessions extracted by the english portuguese and others 
soviet suspicions arose after khrushchev in 1954 invited china 
to send a million laborers to siberia to help exploit the rich 
resources when mao accepted the soviets convinced themselves he 
was trying to take over the siberian economy and absorb the vast 
sparsely populated territory 
in short they wanted to make siberia chinese rather than 
russian khrushchev recalled it was a clever maneuver but it 
didnt work 
the kremlin quickly ended the labor program 
relations had become touchy by that time and were exacerbated by 
khrushchevs denunciation of stalin in the socalled secret 
speech at the 20th soviet party congress in 1956 
mao initially joined in criticizing the late dictator 
khrushchev wrote but then reversed course and began praising 
stalin 
i think that secretly he disapproved all along of our 
censuring stalin for his crimes khrushchev said why do i 
think so because i believe mao suffered from the same megalomania 
stalin had all his life he had the same diseased outlook on other 
people 
mistrust became animosity when the soviets reneged on an 
agreement to provide china with nuclear weapons technology 
khrushchev claimed mao was eager to use the bomb on his enemies 
despite the decline in relations khrushchev made a secret trip 
to beijing in hopes of persuading mao to let the soviet navy build 
a communications base and refueling facilities on chinese 
territory mao resisted 
at the last summit in september 1959 in beijing the warmth 
had gone out of our relations with china and it had been replaced 
by a chill that i could sense as soon as i arrived khrushchev 
recalled 
soviet advisers and engineers assigned to projects in china 
became the butt of antisoviet feeling the kremlin incensed and 
suspecting mao encouraged the behavior withdrew all technical 
personnel in the summer of 1960 leaving hundreds of projects 
unfinished 
maos rejection of what he considered soviet revisionism brought 
the great proletarian cultural revolution intended to purify 
chinese communism further widening the gulf soviet and chinese 
troops fought several border skirmishes in 1969 
as recently as 1979 the year the united states and china 
finally restored normal relations the threat of war loomed along 
the frontier 
in a book seen as a notsosubtle threat soviet author victor 
louis predicted chinas ethnic minorities would rise up and seek 
unity with their cousins in prosoviet mongolia and soviet central 
asia 
louis widely believed to have ties to the kgb secret police 
said fighting could start at any moment and hundreds of 
thousands of soviet volunteers would rush to aid the oppressed 
minorities

gen manuel antonio noriega has 
survived us sanctions drug indictments and years of opposition 
demonstrations the question of the hour has become can he survive 
his own mistakes 
noriega permitted an election and lost it and even worse 
showed weakness by failing to successfully steal it 
he also gave strength and a sense of unity to his enemies by 
ordering or allowing an attack on opposition candidates before the 
eyes of the world 
with all that noriega still has sources of support both in the 
country and apparently in the panamanian defense forces command of 
which has given him de facto control of the country 
the general genuinely thought his forces would win the election 
or at least come close enough so that a little fraud wouldnt be 
noticed he didnt have a clue that his man might lose said 
former president jimmy carter an international observer who talked 
to the general before last sundays election 
a win would have given noriegas regime credibility both 
internationally and internally 
it would have let him thumb his nose at the world said one 
western analyst 
one us official said carter served a particularly useful role 
because he accepted the process as fair until the last moment 
the spectacle of a former us president known for rectitude 
declaring that he personally had seen officials counting 
counterfeit vote tallies destroyed the elections credibility 
clusters of panamanians watched in fascination whenever the 
press conference was replayed on us armed forces television 
nevertheless the official count proceeded showing noriega 
candidate carlos duque leading 21 despite opposition counts and 
respected exit polls that showed a 31 win for opposition candidate 
guillermo endara 
by wednesday apparently the divide between fiction and reality 
became too great to bear and the election was nullified 
the opposition had a shocking majority said cesar quintera 
an independent lawyer 
the opposition demonstrated against the election monday but as 
so often in the past thousands of demonstrators scattered like 
frightened quail before a few dozen police 
such scenes raised questions about the oppositions fortitude 
but there was no question about what happened wednesday 
the opposition candidates including the pacific bespectacled 
and terrified endara were beaten bloody before television cameras 
by pipewielding thugs 
noriega showed his desperation said first vice presidential 
candidate ricardo arias calderon one of the victims 
the result was a hurricane of international disapproval 
isolating the panamanian government at a moment when it most needed 
help in a confrontation with the united states 
president bush sent additional american troops to us bases 
near the panama canal but the panamanian governments efforts to 
rally opinion against them had little effect and probably wont 
unless the united states actually intervenes 
the opposition is discussing calling for a oneday work stoppage 
wednesday they have offered to negotiate with noriega but only if 
he agrees to depart 
still one of the oppositions problems has been its tendency to 
look north for a solution a tendency it has not entirely lost 
the pdf soldiers would throw down their guns the moment us 
helicopters flew over the barracks said one opposition supporter 
thats unlikely unless us citizens are in danger 
the government coalition has shown a tense outward unity but 
some of the nine parties got virtually no votes and feel they were 
fatally damaged by their connection to noriega 
noriega has never been one for making public speeches but his 
silence during a national crisis has been remarkable and has 
encouraged speculation he is dealing with trouble in the officer 
corps 
noriegas support always has been based on the lower side of 
panamas racial and class divide a divide that some still feel 
strongly 
we kicked the oligarchy out in 1968 and we dont want them 
back said eric arce a noriega supporter 
the defense forces have been recruited largely from the lower 
class and noriega has remarked that if the rabiblancos which 
translates loosely to white butts paid more attention there 
would be a different commander today 
nevertheless the size of the opposition vote suggests support 
at all levels regime opponents claim that at some polls where 
hundreds of soldiers voted the government received fewer than 100 
votes 
they couldnt even keep the votes they bought said an 
opposition statement 
the only constitutional option is another election before sept 
1 when acting president manuel solis palmas term is up 
unconstitutional possibilities that noriega might favor include 
a provisional junta and extending solis palmas term 
but on an elemental level noriega has lost his biggest 
advantage 
whatever else he was he was panamas strong man and the 
opposition was seen as weak he will have trouble getting what he 
wants unless he can restore his position

teachers in the nations secondlargest 
school district seeking more money and more control of the 
curriculum are threatening a strike monday that could create chaos 
for 594000 students weeks before schools end 
the united teacherslos angeles representing 22000 of the 
districts 32000 teachers nurses and counselors said its members 
would keep at home with them the attendance and grade records that 
school superintendent leonard britton demanded be handed in by 
monday 
the records said telfair avenue elementary school teacher 
stanley malin are already gone thats no decision a monday 
strike would be the districts first since a 23day walkout in 1970 
brittons demand to teachers to hand in their grades by monday 
caused utla to move up its strike deadline from may 30 classes end 
june 26 for most schools in the 700squaremile district and 
britton said putting the strike deadline so close to the end of 
school was extortionate 
the district has vowed to keep its 800 elementary and high 
schools open with substitute teachers who were being masshired 
into the weekend officials admitted they may function just a step 
above babysitters 
the past week was filled with news conferences and posturing 
but little in the way of progress between the sides which have 
been bargaining on and off for 16 months teachers have been 
working without a contract for a year 
no formal negotiations were scheduled over the weekend but both 
sides were meeting informally and talking on the telephone still 
there was little optimism 
doing all that doesnt erase a 200 million difference said 
chief district negotiator dick fisher on friday people of good 
faith can talk and meet and do all those things and still not reach 
an agreement 
only late in the week was any move made by state legislators to 
push for a settlement or find additional money to help the school 
district meet salary demands 
bob forsyth a spokesman for senate president pro tem david 
roberti said the district would get at least 34 million in new 
revenue that could be used for teacher salaries 
asked if students were being used as pawns fairfax high school 
student body president yasmina porter said we are and we know 
that this is the only bargaining tool teachers have so we 
understand 
but parents expressed concern 
im not real thrilled about substitutes i think its going to 
be utter chaos said christen dingman 40 of chatsworth who has 
two sons in school the teachers are being greedy 
instructors want a twoyear contract with a 21 percent wage 
increase they also want elimination of nonpaid teaching duties 
such as faculty meetings and afterschool playground monitoring 
plus a say in how their schools are run an issue called teacher 
governance 
the district has offered a 215 percent pay increase over a 
threeyear period and has offered a teacher governance structure 
which the utla has said is too tilted toward administrators 
the teachers in march overwhelmingly rejected a district offer 
for a 20 percent pay raise over three years and voted strike 
authorization at that time the issues went to a state factfinder 
whose report is due wednesday 
currently teachers annually earn from 23440 to 43319 
administrators salaries start at 37000 and go to 95600 for 
associate superintendents britton earns 141000 as superintendent 
union president wayne johnson blamed britton for the impasse 
saying the superintendent has not been flexible enough but johnson 
admits that his unions derogatory references to brittons salary 
and administration style were aimed at pushing his buttons 
johnson said in an interview that he has not been able to 
establish the kind of informal contact with britton that usually 
keeps both sides talking 
i tried that with him he said i gave him my home 
telephone number and the only time he called me was because he was 
furious over some message we put out on our hotline that made me 
realize he was sensitive and takes things personally youd 
better have a pretty thick hide for that job 
several attempts were made by the associated press during the 
past week to reach britton or get his responses through a 
representative all without success 
so far the possibility of a teachers strike has not aroused 
parents and legislators as it usually does elsewhere one observer 
says 
in other cities theres usually a lot of pressure from the 
parents and business community you dont hear much here said 
priscilla wohlstetter an assistant professor of education at the 
university of southern california

americas mothers are finding more than ever 
that the empty nest left by grown children is quickly refilled 
by frail parents or other aging relatives in need of home care 
according to a private study 
most alarming says the mothers day report issued by the older 
womens league is that while life expectancy increases the ranks 
of younger people who can care for the elderly are shrinking since 
the babyboom generation has created a baby bust by having fewer 
children 
already americans 85 and older the group most in need of 
longterm care are the fastest growing segment of the population 
with their numbers projected to increase from 29 million to 5 
million by the year 2000 the study says it estimated that the 
over65 population meanwhile will more than double to 52 million 
or one in six people in the same period 
on average women today spend 17 years of their lives caring 
for children and 18 years assisting aged parents for the first 
time ever american couples have more parents than children the 
result will be a significant decline in the number of family 
caregivers at the same time the need increases dramatically the 
report said 
the study titled failing americas caregivers a status 
report on women who care was partially funded by the charles h 
revson foundation and the american federation of federal state 
county and municipal employes aflcio it was derived from census 
data and a dozens of congressional academic and other independent 
studies concerning the elderly as well as original research by the 
staff of the older womens league a nonprofit advocacy group with 
more than 120 chapters 
owl president lou glasse noted the findings indicate that in 
1989 a woman whose children are grown has completed on average 
less than half the caregiving she will provide during her life far 
from being free of responsibility in many cases her most difficult 
years lie ahead 
already she said nearly two million women are part of 
the sandwich generation caring simultaneously for children and 
parents millions more go very quickly from child care to elder 
care 
over the next few decades said ms glasse america will 
have fewer caregivers many more people who need care and more 
women in the paid work force with less time to give if these 
trends continue we will face a crisis of enormous proportions 
the report said that while child care has been the work and 
family conflict of the 1980s elder care will be the no 1 
workplace issue of the 1990s as women struggle to hold paying jobs 
while caring for elderly parents and spouses 
other findings 
among children who care for their parents daughters outnumber 
sons three to one the average caregiver is 45 years old female 
and married but 35 percent of caregivers to the elderly are 
themselves over 65 years old and 10 percent are over 75 as women 
outlive men and often marry older men many become caregivers to 
their spouses 
about 89 percent of women over age 18 will provide care to 
children parents or both and 31 percent will care for both 
children and parents 
about 52 percent of the married mothers of infants and 55 
percent of women caring for elderly relatives are in the work 
force and women working fulltime are four times more likely to be 
primary caregivers to the elderly as are working men 
ninetyfive percent of the elderly and 90 percent of the 
disabled elderly live at home with family members providing 
virtually all their care the cost of outside care for the elderly 
is enormously more expensive than for children day care for 
children averages 3000 annually compared to 25000 for a 
nursing home for the elderly 
during the 1990s the number of elderly in the south and west 
will increase about 20 percent with the greatest increases in 
nevada 70 percent arizona 50 percent and florida 39 percent 
owl said the report demonstrates the need for legislation to 
protect the jobs of people caring for parents and spouses as well 
as children and to provide more federal assistance for the 
longterm care of the chronically ill

the party founded by dictator 
juan domingo peron is poised to return to power for only the second 
time in three decades on sunday when argentines elect a new 
president 
polls show that voters upset with a collapsing economy are 
likely to favor peronist party candidate carlos menem over eduardo 
angeloz of the governing radical civic union 
in 1987 the peronists captured a majority of the congressional 
and gubernatorial races 
voters on sunday also will elect a vice president half of the 
chamber of deputies one national senator legislatures in 14 of 
the nations 22 provinces and several thousand municipal officials 
voting is obligatory for argentines between the ages of 18 and 
70 about 20 million of the countrys 31 million people are 
eligible the new president will be inaugurated dec 10 
menem has led public opinion polls since he was nominated by the 
peronists in july but angeloz has often reminded voters that 
president raul alfonsin also had been expected to lose when he ran 
in 1983 
alfonsin is prohibited by the constitution from seeking a second 
sixyear term 
menem 58 and angeloz 57 both are provincial governors and 
lawyers each is offering a different vision of how argentina might 
overcome a chronic budget deficit tripledigit inflation rising 
unemployment and a 59 billion foreign debt 
angeloz whose main support comes from the middle class pledged 
to sell inefficient state industries reduce the role of the state 
in the economy maintain a free exchange rate spur exports and 
revamp organized labor 
the hour of truth has arrived the stocky twotime governor 
of cordoba province said in his final campaign ads there are 
many ways of voting for the past there is only one way of voting 
for the future 
menem whose main support comes from the working poor 
recognized the need to balance the national budget but voiced 
lukewarm support for the privatization of state industries and said 
he intended to significantly increase wages 
the biggest of the approximately 300 companies controlled by the 
government were nationalized by gen peron when he was in power 
between 1946 and 1955 the year he was ousted by a military coup 
currently about 2 million argentines of a work force of about 11 
million are employed by the state 
to restart the economy menem pledged to implement a 
productive revolution a concept he never fully explained 
i am not promising miracles overnight im not a 
superman menem told 100000 cheering supporters at his closing 
campaign rally on thursday the only thing i can promise is work 
work and more work 
the main issue in the october 1983 election which followed 
brutal military dictatorship was democracy at the end of 
campaigns that were emotional and joyous argentines chose 
alfonsin an attorney and noted human rights leader 
but after five turbulent years marked by 13 general strikes a 
devalued currency and three military insurrections the level of 
enthusiasm this year has fallen considerably 
menem needs more than 50 percent of the electoral college votes 
to win outright angeloz must keep menem below that figure in order 
to forge a coalition of other parties and form a majority 
a side issue in the campaign this year is the military which is 
clamoring for a bigger budget more political power and an end to 
the trials of officers accused of antileftist human rights 
violations during the 19761983 military dictatorships 
angeloz and menem each has ruled out a pardon for officers 
convicted of rights abuses 
the peronist party claims 4 million members and has been the 
countrys biggest since it was put together by peron following his 
overthrow in september 1955 the party was banned and many of its 
leaders jailed or exiled 
the party was barred from competing in national elections until 
march 1973 when hector campora was elected president and menem the 
governor of la rioja the poor rural province where he was born 
campora stepped down in favor of peron who was elected by an 
overwhelming margin that september 
following perons death on july 1 1974 his third wife isabel 
took over as president she was deposed by coup in march 1976 and 
menem was jailed during that time

pennsylvanians vote tuesday on a 
controversial tax tradeoff that would allow counties to impose 
local income taxes in exchange for lower property taxes 
the measure is the cornerstone of a farreaching tax overhaul 
plan proposed by gov robert p casey but few state officials are 
expressing confidence that it will pass 
supporters say the plan would produce overall tax cuts while 
opponents say most people would end up paying more nonpartisan 
experts say the argument is virtually meaningless because the 
changes would differ from one county to the next 
despite extensive news coverage and advertising about the issue 
polls indicate that many voters remain undecided voter turnout is 
expected to be low outside pittsburgh where the race for mayor has 
been strongly contested 
theres such a tremendous uncertainty out there its 
difficult to say how they are going to go said mark schreiber 
executive director of the democratic state committee who knows 
the way this issue will play 
david sanko coordinator for citizens against higher taxes 
which opposes the plan said he was guardedly optimistic about the 
outcome of tuesdays vote 
weve been given plenty of reasons to be wary he said 
its tough to say what will happen over the weekend its 
hard to predict 
although the campaign has featured some heated dialogue the 
final weekend appeared to be relatively quiet casey scheduled a 
campaign stop in johnstown and both sides planned a flurry of 
lastminute advertising 
the ballot issue would change the state constitution to allow 
most counties to impose a 05 percent income tax and philadelphia 
and allegheny counties to impose a 1 percent tax allegheny county 
encompasses pittsburgh 
it also would allow residential property taxes to be set lower 
than business property taxes 
while the tax plan is the major statewide issue on tuesdays 
ballot there are local measures and mayoral races that also are 
drawing attention 
in pittsburgh mayor sophie masloff is trying to retain the seat 
she was appointed to when mayor richard s caliguiri died last 
year polls have shown her to be running neckandneck with 
allegheny county controller frank lucchino in the democratic 
primary election 
in erie the states thirdlargest city six democrats and two 
republicans are jockeying to succeed mayor louis j tullio who is 
stepping aside to battle the same rare disease amylodosis that 
killed caliguiri 
about 85 percent of the states communities and three counties 
also are voting on whether to allow nonprofit groups to hold 
raffles and other small games of chance

two former oakland police officers can 
avoid going to prison for perjury following a judges order to 
serve a 120day sentence of home detention and publicly apologize 
for lying about their sick leave 
johnnie f clark and theresa jeffery received the unusual 
sentence friday from us district judge john vukasin 
the couple now married and fired from the force in 1987 were 
convicted of lying in a discrimination lawsuit they filed with 
seven other black officers in 1985 the lawsuit which accused the 
city of racial bias in hiring and promotions was later dismissed 
for unrelated reasons 
during the lawsuit the two said they were harassed by other 
officers the two were disciplined when they called in sick in 
1983 a day before they were to go on vacation they told an 
opposing lawyer in the lawsuit that the sick call was truthful 
but records showed the two called in sick from iowa and had been 
stopped for speeding the previous day in nebraska 
both were convicted of perjury clark was also convicted of 
making a false statement to the us equal employment opportunity 
commission in a discrimination complaint each of the crimes was 
punishable by five years in prison 
vukasin sentenced the pair to 120 days of home detention 
monitored by electronic bracelets that will allow them to leave 
only for work or necessities such as grocery shopping he also 
ordered 150 hours each of community service and placed them on 
three years probation the apology must be published and be read 
at police roll calls 
clarks lawyer said the defendants would appeal their 
convictions contending the statements about sick leave were 
unrelated to the discrimination case and could not be the basis of 
perjury charges

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
told business leaders saturday he believes america has seen the 
peak in a wave of leveraged buyouts but the executives said that 
assessment may be premature 
we all hope alan is correct said david m roderick 
chairman of usx corp but he added there are still tremendous 
amounts of cash out there to keep this lbo highly leveraged 
situation going for some period of time 
greenspan addressed a private session of the business council 
made up of 65 chief executives of americas largest corporations 
the fed chairman declined to comment publicly but robert g 
kirby chairman of capital guardian trust co said greenspan had 
expressed an opinion that debtfinanced takeovers will subside 
because the easiest obvious ones already have been done 
kirby disagreed saying there are plenty more corporate 
sitting ducks that are potential takeover targets 
i wish mr greenspan were right but i dont think hes going 
to be kirby told a news conference after the session 
roderick gave a similar assessment hopefully alan is right 
but i think that when you look back you see that money markets do 
not tend to act that rationally 
in a leveraged buyout an investment group borrows heavily to 
buy out stockholders and take over the target company the new 
owners often either cut costs or sell off parts of the company to 
pay back the loans 
critics of the practice fear that high debt levels particularly 
in the event of an economic downturn could endanger both the 
boughtout company and the financiers of the transaction 
roderick said that while lbos are likely to persist in the near 
future over a period of time that is an unsustainable trend 
you create ultimately so much debt that in any recession or 
any downturn there would be tremendous negative potential 
repercussions he said 
roderick said that while companies and investment bankers can 
make horrendous sums of money on takeovers the overall effect 
on the economy is negative because high debt levels force 
corporations to cut back on investment research and development 
america long term is paying a horrible price he said we 
get shortterm gains at the expense of burdening the corporations 
with tremendous debt 
roderick said the negative effects of lbos may have to become 
more pronounced before the debtfinanced takeovers subside 
rep william thomas rcalif a member of the house budget 
committee who also spoke to the council said congress has 
considered legislation to cut down on lbos but is hesitant to make 
major changes 
the more we hold hearings the more we know the less inclined 
my colleagues are to determine who is and who is not a corporate 
raider thomas said the more we know the more hesitant we are 
to move in and make major fundamental changes in the law 
greenspan has said on other occasions that lbos may diminish 
without congressional action and that restricting the tax deduction 
for corporate debt could be dangerous to the economy 
roderick said even corporate leaders who are concerned about 
debtfinanced takeovers dont want legislative relief we dont 
want congress getting into the middle to say that this company 
cannot buy this company or this individual cannot buy that 
company roderick said the free market in the final analyses 
is the best judge 
the business council was gathered this weekend for its 
semiannual retreat at a virginia resort on friday the group 
released an economic forecast the predicts a sharp slowdown in 
growth later this year but an upturn by the end of 1991

portauprince haiti ap lt gen prosper avril has fired 
two widely criticized cabinet ministers in his first highlevel 
personnel move since rankandfile soldiers brought him to power 
eight months ago 
the government decree read saturday on state radio came less 
than six weeks after the haitian leader narrowly escaped an attempt 
by some officers to oust him 
the two cabinet members foreign affairs minister serge charles 
and information minister anthony saintpierre caused a public 
outcry for their role in granting a safe conduct pass out of haiti 
in december to former mayor franck romain romain was indicted for 
masterminding the massacre of at least 12 parishioners in a slum 
church 
the sept 11 massacre outraged soldiers and spurred the ouster 
of former ruler lt gen henri namphy a week later both namphy and 
romain now live in the neighboring dominican republic 
namphy ruled this impoverished caribbean nation after dictator 
jeanclaude duvalier fled to france in 1986 namphy turned over 
power to civilian leslie manigat in february 1988 but deposed 
manigat in june 
opposition leaders have persistently demanded the removal of 
saintpierre considered one of avrils most influential advisers 
in a memorandum to avril leaked to the press in january 
saintpierre encouraged the government to repress perhaps with 
bloodshed the peasant movement of papaye in central haiti which 
he accused of subversion 
the decree announcing the cabinet changes dated friday was 
read by staterun radio nationale privately owned radio metropole 
and radio soleil run by the roman catholic church 
the decree said the new information minister was ms rosemarie 
nazon avrils sisterinlaw and previously a civil servant in the 
ministry 
it said the new foreign affairs minister was yvon perrier 
formerly the ministrys general director 
soldiers loyal to avril blocked an attempted coup by 
produvalierist army officers on april 2 the ringleaders were 
exiled to the united states the coup attempt came four days after 
avril fired four officers accused of drugrunning 
a crackdown on drug trafficking in the army is one of the 
conditions for the resumption of us aid 
the united states suspended 60 million of a 90 million annual 
aid package after thugs protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 
voters at polling stations during elections on nov 29 1987 those 
elections were canceled 
avril has pledged to allow free elections though not for at 
least two years and has partially restored haitis 1987

hundreds of activists from throughout 
the restive baltic republics gathered for the first time on 
saturday to demand economic freedom and an end to moscows meddling 
in their homelands 
leaders of the peoples fronts from estonia latvia and 
lithuania also drafted a resolution charging that president mikhail 
s gorbachevs drive for perestroika or restructuring has failed 
to curb economic decline 
another resolution claimed the tiny republics have the right to 
choose any economic system that would meet material needs protect 
the environment and break the stranglehold of moscowbased 
planners and officials 
the only chance we have to get better is to get rid of this 
vampire that is sucking our blood dainis ivans president of the 
latvian peoples front told the assembly but we cant do it 
separately we can only do it together as three baltic sisters 
ivans was among more than 400 activists from the republics who 
gathered at the house of political education in tallinn the 
estonian capital after the meeting the visitors and an estimated 
5000 estonians rallied in the town square 
vytautas landsbergis chairman of the lithuanian peoples front 
expressed hope during the meeting that the activists would agree on 
the creation of a real commonwealth of the baltic peoples 
leaders of the peoples fronts have met several times since the 
groups were founded last autumn in the liberalized political 
climate fostered by gorbachev but this weekends twoday session 
in the estonian capital was the first to bring together members of 
their rankandfile 
the resolutions defy the ideas of a kremlin commission on baltic 
problems the kremlin plan would give control of food and consumer 
goods to the 15 soviet republics but keep moscowbased ministries 
in charge of energy defense production and at least half of heavy 
industry 
baltic activists want complete economic autonomy they contend 
soviet authorities have drained their tiny republics of consumer 
goods and food to subsidize poorer regions of the country 
lawmakers in estonia and lithuania convene friday in sessions 
expected to reject the kremlin plan and call for bolder steps 
estonias draft law gives the tallinn government control over 
virtually all industries except defense 
lithuanias law declares all its resources property of the 
republic and proclaims the right to issue its own currency said 
mathematician vytautas statulevicius a peoples front member and 
deputy in lithuanias supreme soviet legislature 
ceslovas stankevicius a lithuanian militant from kaunas said 
lithuanians have been told gorbachev had supported the republics 
communist party chief algirdas brazauskas when he explained the 
law to a meeting friday at the partys central committee 
headquarters in moscow but others attending the meeting reportedly 
opposed it 
the law being considered by the tallinn assembly calls for a 
transition to economic independence in the baltic republics by 
early 1990 
in separate caucusing more than 80 newly elected members of the 
new soviet parliament from the baltic fronts met to devise a common 
platform 
another resolution demands that national leaders recognize the 
stalinist genocide in estonia latvia and lithuania and convene 
a trial of its perpetrators hundreds of thousands of baltic 
residents were deported or killed under dictator josef stalin 
including 80000 in 1941 alone the draft charges 
the baltic republics were forcibly absorbed by the soviets in 
1940 after the nazis consigned them to moscows sphere of influence 
in a secret deal with stalin 
the republics are among several ethnic regions in the soviet 
union that are demanding more independence

matawan nj as she held her 1yearold son jonathan at a

successful people together because when youre actually down for a 
cycle you dont know whos going to be the ones who are going 
to be successful

egypt regained its seat on a major arab 
institution saturday taking a firm step back into the arab fold 10 
years after it was ostracized for signing a peace treaty with 
israel 
with dissension only from libya the 11member organization of 
arab petroleum exporting countries voted to reinstate egypt 
the vote was the clearest signal to date that egypt was likely 
to be allowed into a may 2324 arab summit in casablanca morocco 
egypts participation would be tantamount to regaining its place in 
the arab league sources say 
egypt was forced out of the 22member arab league and most 
affiliated institutions after it signed the 1979 camp david accords 
with israel the boycott gradually eroded with restoration of 
bilateral ties by most arab countries and reinstatement of egypt in 
several specialized affiliate bodies of the arab league 
only syria and libya have taken a hard line against readmitting 
cairo to the arab fold 
at the opening session of the kuwaitbased oapec conference 
saturday chairman mana saeed otaiba the oil minister of the 
united arab emirates called for reinstating egypt 
the arab family will remain incomplete as long as egypt 
remains outside otaiba said 
syria recently has moderated its stance against egypt 
i think that no arab will oppose egypts return to arab 
organizations because egypt is a sister state said syrian oil 
minister mutanius habib shortly after arriving 
the conference communique mentioned that libyan oil minister 
fawzi shakshouki expressed reservations about readmitting egypt but 
did not say what they were 
shakshouki said before the conference began that libya still 
opposed egypts reinstatement and said his country would continue 
to do so as long as the causes of its suspension did not vanish 
oapec was founded in 1968 by saudi arabia kuwait and libya as a 
forum for promoting arab oil policies other members are iraq the 
united arab emirates qatar algeria tunisia bahrain syria and 
egypt the first seven countries also sit on the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries

ago 
about 500 demonstrators marched through downtown tokyo with a 
dummy nuclear bomb and banners reading remove nuclear arms and 
lets repeal the usjapan security treaty 
the us military said monday that an a4 skyhawk jet carrying 
the bomb fell off the us aircraft carrier ticonderoga in 1965 
about 80 miles from a small island in southern okinawa 
japan the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons is 
especially sensitive about any kind of danger from nuclear arms 
and the disclosure has revived debate on the role of us forces in 
japan 
i got really angry when i heard about the us accident 
said demonstrator hajime takahashi who was a victim of the us 
atomic bombing of hiroshima near the end of world war ii 
no one can make accidentproof nuclear weapons said

president bush has been drifting away from the 
goitalone latin american policies favored by the previous 
administration and his cautious approach was underscored in 
addressing the crisis in panama 
bush and secretary of state james a baker appear to have 
concluded that the reagan administration failed to achieve its 
goals in the region because it refused to take into account the 
wishes of either the congress or of hemispheric countries 
so the emphasis has been on working with both in the hopes of 
coming up with more effective policies a bipartisan agreement with 
the congress already is in place on nicaragua and bush consulted 
closely with lawmakers this past week after the situation in panama 
became tumultuous 
bush said the will of the panamanian people was thwarted by 
massive fraud in the immediate aftermath of sundays election 
and by the subsequent decision of gen manuel antonio noriega to 
throw out the returns he also condemned the violence directed at 
opposition leaders on wednesday 
in support of the american commitment to democracy in 
panama bush announced a sevenstep plan the following day which 
won plaudits from both the democratic and republican leadership of 
both houses of congress 
but little of what bush did seemed to pose a threat to noriega 
some of the measures will have no effect at all including the 
presidents recall of ambassador arthur davis 
a recall of an ambassador is often used in diplomacy to register 
displeasure with the country in question but davis has had no 
contact at all with the noriegaled government in more than 14 
months 
on saturday however bush seemed to be trying to turn up the 
heat on noriega by noriega saying the panamanian people should 
do everything to get him out of office 
speaking with reporters aboard air force one the president 
declined to back away from his words when reporters raised 
questions about the strength of his language 
no i would add no words of caution bush replied the 
will of the people should be implemented 
at another point the president said i would love to see him 
out of there wed like to see him out the will of the people 
should not be thwarted by this man and his thugs 
he said he was making the statement to make clear to the 
panamanian people that they still had the affection of the united 
states 
he said sending additional us military personnel into panama 
should not be viewed as outside intervention and said we would 
have good relations with the panamanian people and the pdf the 
military if noriega were thrown from office 
the most controversial measure announced by bush was the 
dispatch of a brigade of american military personnel but he linked 
that move to the need to protect american citizens in panama not 
to promote democracy there 
no new economic sanctions were announced against panama bush 
merely said existing sanctions will continue in force 
bush ruled out a more heavyhanded approach realizing there are 
few issues around which latin americans rally more quickly than 
opposition to us interventionism thus bush rejected use of 
force against noriega as well as the scrapping of the panama canal 
treaties 
there was little support in the administration for a total trade 
embargo against panama that approach would set back panamas 
economy for years damaging us investment in the process with 
no guarantee noriega would be forced out 
bush appeared to place his strongest hopes for a democratic 
outcome in panama on diplomacy but made it clear the united states 
will leave it to other countries to take the lead 
the united states strongly supports and will cooperate with 
initiatives taken by governments in this hemisphere to address the 
crisis bush said 
less than 24 hours after bush spoke the organization of 
american states permanent council convened to take up a venezuelan 
proposal to hold an oas foreign ministers meeting on the panama 
situation 
at the conclusion of the twohour session the 31 delegates 
unanimously approved a meeting for this coming wednesday this will 
be perhaps the first major test for bush and bakers stated 
preference for diplomatic approaches 
in a speech two weeks ago baker alluded to the widespread 
desire for the united states to forgo unilateral measures but 
cautioned alternative approaches may have drawbacks as well 
all those who advocate diplomacy and political solutions to 
the regions conflicts now have a responsibility to prove this is 
the best and the surest route to achieve our common goals he 
said 
privately us officials are skeptical that the oas meeting 
will conclude with an unambiguous condemnation of noriegas rule in 
panama 
although the oas charter calls representative democracy an 
indispensable condition for peace in the hemisphere it also 
stresses that the principle of nonintervention must be respected 
as well 
this latter point was emphasized repeatedly during fridays 
permanent council meeting with countries as diverse as chile 
mexico and nicaragua alluding to it 
in the days prior to the meeting us delegates will be 
lobbying hard for a resolution which at a minimum denounces 
noriega while other delegates will be attempting to promote as 
bland a declaration as possible 
it is generally agreed that failure by the oas to confront 
noriega squarely on the events of this past week could lead to a 
reassessment of the administrations goal of governing on the basis 
of broad consensus rather than unilateral action

soviet soldiers who first arrived 
21 years ago to crush political reforms began a partial pullout 
saturday that generated little apparent enthusiasm among the 
countrys communist leaders 
staterun media noted tersely that a soviet battalion stationed 
in the north moravian city of olomouc close to the border with 
poland left for home early saturday 
local communist party officials bade the departing 65mile 
column farewell in a short ceremony the reports said it was not 
known how many troops left saturday 
the little attention given to the departure contrasted markedly 
with the treatment given the soviet pullout from neighboring 
hungary in an opposition march through budapest in march some 
100000 people called for a complete withdrawal of soviet troops 
and greater independence from moscow 
the withdrawals come as part of a pullout of 50000 soviet 
troops and 5000 tanks from east germany hungary and 
czechoslovakia announced by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
in december 
overall the red army is to withdraw half a million men over the 
next two years in a unilateral reduction seen by western analysts 
as directed at aiding new talks in vienna on reducing conventional 
forces in europe 
the estimated 80000 soviet troops in czechoslovakia began 
entering the country on aug 20 1968 in a warsaw pact invasion 
that crushed reforms ushered in by thencommunist party leader 
alexander dubcek 
the invasion led eventually to dubceks ouster and the expulsion 
of almost half a million communists from czechoslovakias ruling 
party 
under the current withdrawal 5300 soviet troops 708 tanks and 
20 planes are to leave for the soviet union only four battalions 
some 1500 men will depart this year according to figures given 
in february by czechoslovak chief of staff gen miroslav vacek 
the partial soviet pullout began in hungary last month with the 
departure of 31 t64 tanks

jimmy carters role in the panamanian election 
crisis has thrust him back onto the international stage eight years 
after leaving the presidency and he says his relationship with 
president bush is infinitely better than his relationship with 
president reagan 
carter a frequent and harsh critic of reagan after losing to 
him in the 1980 election lead a team of international observers 
monitoring the national elections in panama last week and later 
briefed bush at the white house 
panama was one of the topics that most bitterly divided carter 
and reagan so carters role in helping to serve as bushs eyes and 
ears in the central american nation vividly illustrates the change 
in his relationship from one administration to the next 
carter said in an interview friday that bush was receptive to 
what he had to say even though he wasnt part of the official team 
of observers chosen by the president 
its infinitely better he said i had no relationship 
with president reagan at all 
carters statements in panama in which he accused the 
government there of stealing the election drew international 
attention 
those who havent followed carters activities may have thought 
he was reemerging from a somnolent retirement but in fact the 
former president has been an active if unofficial player in world 
affairs since he left washington in 1981 
operating mainly out of the carter presidential center in 
atlanta he has pursued favorite causes and offered the resources 
of his facility as an aid in mediating international disputes 
i dont care for any official role said carter speaking 
from his hometown of plains ga im operating now in the same 
way that ive been for the last six or seven years i think if i 
had an official role to play it might hamper my freedom and limit 
greatly what influence or access i do have 
in the past few years carter has maintained an active schedule 
of speaking and traveling in the past year alone according to the 
carter center he has been to africa japan sweden norway the 
netherlands venezuela and panama 
the panamanian situation has special importance to carter in 
1977 carter signed an agreement with the late gen omar torrijos 
under which panama is due to take control of the panama canal in 
1999 
carter views the panama canal treaties as one of his most 
significant achievements and all this represents some threat to 
his achievements said gary fink a history professor at georgia 
state university 
although some observers have questioned whether the united 
states should still honor the treaty with noriegas abuses of 
power carter said in panama last week that the united states would 
alienate the panamanian people and every other nation in this 
hemisphere if it abrogated the pact 
the panama canal treaty was bitterly opposed by conservatives in 
the united states reagan foremost among them and carters return 
to the limelight opened some old wounds for those who worked 
against the pact 
kevin phillips a conservative political analyst in bethesda 
md suggested that carters presence in panama last week amounted 
to his returning to the scene of a political crime 
a crumbling panama is a fitting place for carter to 
reemerge he added it will be difficult for him to be taken 
seriously once we move along 
but carter apparently is being taken seriously by the bush 
administration 
in one sign of respect that would have been unthinkable in the 
reagan uears secretary of state james baker iii was a main speaker 
last month at a carter center conference on latin america 
in recent speeches carter a democrat has commented favorably 
on the republican bush and he has expressed agreement with bushs 
response to the situation in panama which included the dispatching 
of additional us troops

attorneys in the 1974 boston school desegregation 
case are seeking a court order to block a new student assignment 
plan that they fear could lead to further exodus of white students 
from innercity schools 
the lawyers thomas atkins and robert pressman filed a motion 
friday with us district judge w arthur garrity jr asking him 
to intervene and stop the student assignment plan 
as this plan is now drafted it will result in rapid 
resegregation of the schools in minority neighborhoods atkins 
said whites will choose schools near their homes because theyll 
have no basis to choose schools elsewhere 
city officials and the school committee devised the plan in an 
attempt to end 15 years of courtordered busing it would divide 
the city into three zones and allow parents to choose a school 
within their zone as long as student populations remain within 
racial balance 
busing was violently opposed in boston when garrity ordered it 
in the mid1970s supporters of the new plan say the competition 
among schools would spur improvement lure whites back to the 
system and cut long bus rides 
but opponents say it could be a back door to segregation and 
wont work without more money to improve the overall system boston 
schools now are struggling with a budget crunch 
boston school committee president thomas oreilly defended the 
plan 
the school committee has been informed by our legal staff 
theres nothing unconstitutional about what weve done he said 
we will defend it to every degree possible 
mayor raymond flynn was active in creation of the plan and 
pushed for its implementation this fall he said parents want more 
say in their childrens education 
it is unfortunate that once again boston parents have to 
deal with the uncertainties of a legal proceeding he said 
the plan was approved 94 by the school committee with all four 
of the committees black members voting against it 
at that time atkins and pressman agreed to take part in a 
90day review that ended last week atkins said friday that the 
plan was implemented too quickly and parents didnt get enough 
information to make good choices 
the plan is scheduled to begin for students entering elementary 
schools this fall and parents of those children already have 
received applications for schools 
critics of the plan say more time is needed for parents to 
understand how to choose their childrens school 
theres so much confusion out there now said hattie 
mckinnis head of the citywide parents council which has voted to 
recommend a oneyear delay of the plan

mayor tom bradley authorized a bank to handle 
more than 1 million in transportation funds in 1984 five years 
before the date he claimed he first learned the bank had any 
business with the city a federal document revealed 
the document obtained from the federal urban mass 
transportation administration was an authorization form signed by 
bradley in 1984 that allowed 1339230 in federal transportation 
funds earmarked for los angeles to be deposited in far east 
national bank 
the document was obtained by the los angeles herald examiner and 
passed on to city councilwoman joan milke flores the councilwoman 
introduced it during hearings friday on bradleys financial 
dealings 
bradley who was paid 18000 last year for his work as an 
adviser to far east national bank has said he didnt know until 
earlier this year that the bank had any dealings with the city 
bradleys financial dealings with far east and with valley 
federal savings amp loan which paid him 24000 a year as a board 
member until he resigned earlier this year are being investigated 
by city attorney james hahn 
also friday hahns office confirmed it has launched a second 
investigation of bradley this one to determine whether the mayor 
accepted illegal contributions during his reelection campaign 
earlier this year bradley won in a landslide 
i can say that we have asked the city clerk to provide us with 
information regarding some campaign contributions from the recently 
concluded mayoral campaign said mike qualls a spokesman for 
hahn 
city clerk elias martinez said hahn ordered him to audit certain 
contributions made to bradley he declined to elaborate 
bradley spokesman bill chandler said he was unaware of the city 
attorneys latest probe he said bradley would not discuss it 
the responsibility would seem to fall on the people who 
contribute and not the mayor for accepting the money he said 
fridays hearing by the city councils governmental operations 
committee at which the transportation funds document was 
discussed was held to review the status of hahns probe into 
bradleys finances 
chandler said the mayor would not answer any questions about his 
involvement with far east until hahn has completed that 
investigation

nimrod dancer the name of the operation 
that dispatched 2000 us combat troops to panama is the latest 
in a long list of fanciful hokey and sometimes incongruous codes 
used by the pentagon to describe its missions 
nimrod dancer didnt he come in seventh at the kentucky 
derby a pentagon official was overheard to wonder when word of 
the operations code name was announced thursday 
nimrod the bible tells us was a mighty hunter was he a dancer 
too 
no said lt kathy woods a pentagon spokeswoman these 
names arent supposed to mean anything they have absolutely no 
significance on the face of it 
to make sure the names are totally random a computer picks 
them woods said 
but once chosen the combination of words the number of their 
syllables or some other pattern does have significance for those 
who need to know said lt cmdr jim kudla 
or as explained in the encyclopedia of code names of world war 
ii codes serve as a type of mental shorthand for those in the 
know and to obfuscate the issue for those not in the know 
winston churchill the master tactician who led the allies to 
victory over nazi germany in world war ii may not have approved of 
the way codes are selected nowadays in instructions to gen sir 
hastings ismay in august 1943 churchill wrote 
operations ought not to be described by code words which imply 
a boastful and overconfident sentiment they ought not to be 
names of frivolous characters they should not be ordinary words 
names of living people should be avoided 
the pentagon also avoids the names of living people for 
operation names but what would churchill have made of operation 
urgent fury the code name for the us invasion of the 
caribbean island of grenada in 1983 to counter a cubanbacked coup 
and evacuate american medical students 
while names like urgent fury may sound inspirational their 
aim is purely operational you have to have a code name to use in 
communications during an operation said barry blechman an 
expert on defense issues at the school of advance international 
studies of johns hopkins university 
major operations have different code names for each component 
he said one must be precise if you use the wrong name you 
could land a unit at the wrong place or bomb the wrong target 
before computers got in on the act some operation names 
actually had meaning the public at large could understand 
for instance an operation mounted in 1968 by the 196th light 
infantry brigade in vietnam was code named attleboro after the 
town in massachusetts where the unit had trained 
in a more figurative although still understandable name 
operation niagara in january 1968 conducted an average of 300 
bombings daily in support of a besieged marine base at khe sanh 
vietnam the bombs rained down like a water fall get it 
former president nixon liked to keep his hand in on code name 
selections during the vietnam war there was linebacker one for a 
bombing operation and then linebacker two for another one 
in the old days some names appeared to reflect the portentous 
character of the operation like a drumbeat roll one of the most 
famous world war ii code names was operation overlord the us 
landing on the coast of normandy as part of the allied 
counteroffensive that rolled back nazi forces from western europe 
animals seem to be a favorite for code names of recent years 
operation golden pheasant was the 1988 deployment of 3200 
us troops in honduras as a show of force against an alleged 
nicaraguan incursion into honduras 
praying mantis the insect that eats other insects was the 
name used for the 1988 operation in which us gunboats and 
aircraft destroyed or sank six iranian naval vessels and two oil 
platforms in retaliation for a mine attack on a us ship 
and in the same waters earnest will was the operation in 
which us navy ships escorted kuwaiti oil tankers in 1987 to 
protect them against attacks by iran which was at war with iraq 
some servicemen believed the name described the fortitude needed to 
undertake the dangerous mission said a pentagon official 
eagle claw was the disastrous 1980 operation to rescue 
american hostages in iran the mission was aborted after a us 
helicopter collided with a c130 transport aircraft and eight 
servicemen were killed in the ensuing fire at a remote staging area 
codenamed desert one 
then there was eldorado canyon the us bombing of libyan 
targets in april 1986 in which an f111 fighter was shot down and 
its two crew members killed

a pair of newly discovered 400yearold german 
paintings highlights a collection belonging to sen john heinz 
rpa that goes on display sunday at the national gallery of art 
the finding of the two paintings was reported by ingvar 
bergstroem a leading authority on northern european art who 
teaches at the university of goeteborg in sweden 
bergstroem said hana seifertova of the prague national gallery 
turned up the two paintings in poor condition at the littleknown 
slovak national gallery in bratislava czechoslovakia 
the paintings date from 1595 but generally are considered as 
belonging to the 17th century because of their style 
they are some of the most important paintings done in germany 
in their century bergstroem said in an interview 
he explained that although an earlier period had been rich in 
german painters including albrecht duerer artistic activity in 
germany was slow at the time because of intense religious war 
the two newly found paintings are believed part of a set of 
four representing the seasons done in frankfurt germany there 
were two collaborating artists lucas van valckenborch from 
flanders in what is now belgium and georg flegel who came from 
olomouc olmuetz in what is now czechoslovakia though called 
still life paintings they include large and colorful human figures 
and are themselves unusually large about 47 by 75 inches 
the paintings represent summer and autumn van valckenborch 
painted the figures and flegel the still life parts 
in the heinz collection still lifes of the golden age the 
allegory of summer is almost precisely like one of the two 
newly discovered paintings bergstroem said he believes that 
picture was part of a set painted earlier than the set containing 
the two found in bratislava 
autumn looks like a fat hunter with game birds hanging from his 
belt and a handsome young woman in a starched ruff 
it may be the same model as in summer said bergstroem 
there are also great baskets of fruit and vegetables and two 
highly detailed landscapes in the background when first found it 
was so covered with grime that only the womans head and few 
baskets of fruit could be easily made out it has now been restored 
bergstroem hopes some day a complete set of four can be 
assembled in a single exhibit 
for now visitors to the national gallerys east building can 
see summer and 43 other paintings from the heinz collection 
mostly flowers and food by painters of the 17th century from the 
netherlands flanders and germany heinz who belongs to the 
foodmanufacturing family started buying them when he was a 
student 
bergstroem says it is the biggest of the worlds four main 
collections of its kind the show will remain at the national 
gallery until sept 4 then will go to the museum of fine arts in 
boston from oct 18 to dec 31

a doctor who says he was fired by a hospital 
for praying at patients bedsides has filed a civil rights 
complaint accusing the institution of religious discrimination 
dr ju woong jung 51 said in the complaint filed with the 
state civil rights commission this month that he had prayed with 
patients for 10 years while on the staff of st lukes hospital 
with no problems 
jung was fired in february by hospital president frank bartell 
iii who cited him for insubordination and willful neglect of duty 
hospital officials said the dismissal followed repeated warnings 
about praying with patients 
in his complaint the koreanborn baptist said he fulfilled his 
duties to his patients and that he discussed his beliefs and prayed 
with patients only with their consent in order to comfort them 
bartell said saturday that attorneys had advised him not to 
comment on the matter however as you well know there are two 
sides to every story he said 
bartell said the hospital once affiliated with the lutheran 
church is owned by a nonprofit private organization with a 
christian commitment but not tied to any religious denomination 
st lukes has no formal policy on staff members praying with 
patients he said 
jung said he began praying with patients in 1974 everybody 
knows i pray he said 
in 1981 the hospital gave jung a courtesy in action award for 
reflecting christs love 
six years later bartell told the doctor to seek patients 
permission to pray with them jung agreed to do so 
the physician said his dismissal stemmed from an incident in 
january and another in february 
in the first case jung said he discussed christ but did not 
pray with a 14yearold patient after noting the boys religious 
denomination on his medical form 
in the second case he said he went to dr marion detricks 
room on feb 10 when detrick complained of chest pains ordered 
pain medication and an electrocardiogram then suggested prayer 
i wanted to comfort him jung said he said detrick agreed 
however st lukes said jungs bible reading became prolonged 
and distracting and distressed detrick detrick said in a written 
account of the incident that he asked jung to stop and jung did 
in firing jung the hospital also cited a feb 6 incident in 
which jung treated a patient with acupuncture which st lukes 
does not permit jung has acknowledged he used acupuncture but 
said it only happened once and is not the central issue in his 
dismissal 
in 1986 another doctor complained that jung upset a terminally 
ill patient and the mans wife by asking him if he believed in 
jesus and wanted to pray 
jung was also suspended for three days in 1986 for incidents in 
october and november of that year in which he discussed religious 
beliefs with two patients he prayed with only one 
the christian medical and dental society which represents 
doctors who profess faith in christ believes spiritual issues are 
a crucial part of health said hal habecker director of the 
richardson texasbased organization 
you do need to be careful in this culture to ask permission 
habecker said you dont have the right to run up and down 
hospital corridors and force jesus on other people in that sense

a group of jewish leaders canceled a meeting with 
pope john paul ii after the vatican said it would not discuss a 
roman catholic convent at auschwitz that has offended many jews a 
group official said saturday 
jewish groups are upset about the presence of a dozen carmelite 
nuns on the site of the nazi death camp in poland which has become 
a memorial to the 6 million jews murdered in the holocaust 
rabbi david rosen of the antidefamation league of bnai brith 
said group members from the united states and israel were to meet 
the pope friday at the vatican for three purposes to compliment 
his recent document on racism to ask him to consider the situation 
of jews in upcoming documents and to discuss the auschwitz dispute 
but rosen said that in talks last week at the vatican cardinal 
johannes willebrands of the pontifical council for the promotion of 
christian unity said church leaders had not approved of the agenda 
he indicated that things couldnt go ahead under those 
terms the jerusalembased representative said in a telephone 
interview in rome we decided were not going to hide our 
agenda 
he said the antidefamation league which originally requested 
the meeting decided to put if off indefinitely 
it was obvious if everyone was insistent there was going to 
be a clash he said 
he added however that his group remains completely committed 
to the continuity of the dialogue between the faiths he said the 
disagreement would not hinder fruitful discussion of other issues 
a vatican spokesman could not be reached for comment saturday 
jewish leaders have expressed outrage that the carmelite convent 
has remained at the polish site of the death camp despite a 1987 
pact with roman catholic leaders to move the convent by early this 
year 
catholic leaders say the nuns new quarters are not ready

attack by neighboring pakistan where most of the rebels are based 
the threat of an offensive against kabul was reported by the

afghanistans marxist government had agreed to cooperate with the 
usbacked guerrillas 
president najib has insisted his forces are strong enough to 
withstand a rebel onslaught 
moscow continues to arm the kabul government although the last 
of more than 100000 red army troops withdrew from afghanistan on 
feb 15 under a unbrokered accord 
the ruling communist peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
seized power in a 1978 military coup sparking the moslem 
insurgency which aims to establish an islamic republic

subversive activities by the rebels

saturday hours after a group claimed to have taken a hostage to 
win freedom for comrades jailed in the slaying of a palestinian 
cartoonist in london 
also saturday a german newspaper reported that a west german 
man who disappeared in lebanon on may 4 had signed a letter saying 
he was abducted in connection with the case of twa hijacker 
mohammed ali hamadi 
there has been no claim of responsibility for the west german 
markus quint the bild am sonntag newspaper said west german 
security officials believe quint was kidnapped by hamadi associates

the interest of solving the case to comment on the newspaper 
report

pope john paul ii embraced reform of the 
mass in an apostolic letter released saturday but also warned of 
outlandish innovations and other excesses 
the pope said the changes in church ceremonies mandated by the 
second vatican council of 196265 were intended to help renew the 
roman catholic church he said the vast majority of pastors and 
other catholics have accepted the reforms with joy 
the word of god is now better known in the christian 
communities he wrote 
however the pontiff warned of outlandish innovations 
departing from the norms of the apostolic see or the bishops he 
said such changes were disrupting the unity of the church and the 
piety of the faithful and even on occasion contradicting matters of 
faith 
the second vatican council introduced the mass in the language 
of worshipers instead of latin and it called for the priest to 
face the congregation rather than keep his back to it lay people 
also were permitted to perform bible readings 
some traditionalists resented the changes and fought to keep the 
latin or tridentine mass which dates from pope pius v in 1570 
the vatican has acknowledged their attachment to the old mass but 
has limited its use 
last year archbishop marcel lefebvre and a swissbased group of 
traditionalists split with the church over the issue 
in his letter john paul addressed the 25th anniversary of 
sancrosanctum concilium the document on liturgical reform he 
called the first fruit of vatican ii 
the pope said the application of the reforms has been marked by 
a tendency to see religious practice as something of a private 
affair by a certain rejection of institutions by a decrease in 
the visibility of the church in society and by a calling into 
question of personal faith 
he stressed that only the church hierarchy has the power to 
alter the liturgy not priests or other church groups he said some 
innovations could even affect the validity of the sacraments 
on occasion there have been noted illicit omissions or 
additions rites invented outside the framework of established 
norms postures or songs which are not conducive to faith or to a 
sense of the sacred abuses in the practice of general absolution 
he wrote 
it cannot be tolerated that certain priests should take upon 
themselves the right to compose eucharistic prayers or to 
substitute profane readings for texts from sacred scripture 
initiatives of this sort far from being linked with the 
liturgical reform as such are in direct contradiction to it 
disfigure it and deprive the christian people of the genuine 
treasures of the liturgy of the church he said 
he called for bishops to root out such abuses 
however he encouraged continued adaptation of the liturgy to 
different cultures and languages 
he also appealed for church members to renew that spirit which 
inspired the church during the early days of reform

the image of a jet falling into the sea 
off japan while carrying a hydrogen bomb had become a dreamy 
memory for a navy veteran until the loss was disclosed more than 
two decades later 
bud dehnert said he watched in 1965 as the a4e skyhawk attack 
jet slipped over the side of the aircraft carrier ticonderoga after 
a nuclear bomb 70 times more powerful than the one dropped on 
hiroshima had been loaded aboard the plane 
driving to work this week the boca raton man heard a radio 
report about newly released documents confirming the united states 
lost the bomb in international waters about 70 or 80 miles from 
okinawa when he was a 21yearold sailor on the carrier 
there is a bomb at the bottom of the ocean with a plane 
attached to it with a body in it said dehnert the district 
manager of a consumer electronics firm here 
pentagon officials have confirmed the accident but released few 
details the japanese government requested an explanation and 
okinawans expressed anger over the secret handling of the loss in 
nearby waters 
until the news reports the accident had come to seem like a 
dreamy memory dehnert said in an interview published saturday in 
the sunsentinel of fort lauderdale 
what i saw was real said dehnert now 44 i saw it 
happen 
dehnert sat beside a stack of scrapbooks from his four years in 
the navy as he described the accident pointing out his photo in a 
yearbook on ticonderoga cruises 
it was 23 years ago it was a beautiful day the plane just 
rolled backwards off the ship there was no wind he said 
stars and stripes the unofficial us military newspaper 
reported friday that brake failure or a distracted pilot may have 
caused the jet to drop overboard as it was being prepared for 
takeoff and being put on an elevator to the flight deck 
the carrier was steaming toward japan for a few days of rest 
after combat in vietnam and dehnert learned later that the pilot 
was planning to meet his wife in japan 
the pilot was sitting there minding his own business and the 
ship took a slow roll into the ocean he said the plane 
trapped the pilot because it was a clamshell cockpit 
dehnert said he and others on board knew the ship was carrying 
nuclear wearpons but the united states never admitted it publicly 
trying to reconstruct the events leading to the accident 
dehnert said he thought a weaponsloading drill had just concluded 
and sailors were pushing the jet into place about to chain it 
down when it flipped off the edge of the ships port side the 
aircraft sank quickly and efforts to retrieve it failed 
the plane hit the water it was gone it disappeared 
dehnert said 
he said the accident was memorable for its unexpectedness 
when people died usually it was a hectic situation a flight 
a landing dehnert said but we were going to japan everyone 
was relaxed we were sunning ourselves

late said a twa ticket agent who would not give his name 
long said flight 402 had left new yorks kennedy airport and was 
flying over pennsylvania about 430 pm with 51 passengers and 
eight crew members aboard when the pilot radioed the tower to say 
the stairway door had opened 
the pilot indicated he would fly the remaining distance long 
said 
firefighters were called to the columbus airport runway and 
crash equipment was brought out as a precaution he said the plane 
landed safely about 515 pm 
the pilot wasnt excited so i didnt get excited long said

in its news conference saturday the opposition was careful to 
say it would respect the integrity of the defense forces a 
suggestion that if the officer corps dumps noriega its positions 
would be guaranteed 
in answer to a question arias calderon said the opposition 
wanted three things from the oas condemnation of noriega and an 
appeal that he recognize the election results diplomatic and 
political sanctions that would amount to a quarantine and a 
mission of oas foreign ministers to visit panama and deliver the 
resolutions to noriega

president bush on saturday urged the 
panamanian people and defense forces to drive gen manuel antonio 
noriega and his doberman thugs from power and pledged support 
for a successor government 
bush stopped short of directly urging violence or a coup but 
told reporters aboard air force one i would love to see 
noriega out of there right now 
noriega is under indictment in this country on drug charges but 
bush said he didnt care whether the panamanian leader went to a 
nation that has an extradition treaty with the united states 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said we know what countries 
are willing to take noriega but an administration official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said there are no signs the leader 
is getting ready to step down 
the president made his comments to reporters as us troops 
continued flying into panama on a mission of protection for 
americans and us facilities in the wake of violence that followed 
last weeks election bush has accused the noriega regime of 
stealing the election from the opposition candidate guillermo 
endara 
asked by reporters if his words could be seen as a call to 
revolution or violent overthrow bush chose not to temper the 
remarks 
no i would add no words of caution the will of the people 
should be implemented he said 
bush hedged a hypothetical question about the american military 
responding to request for aid from the 15000strong defense 
forces saying they wouldnt need support from the united states 
to get rid of noriega hes one man and they have a well trained 
force 
the presidents made his remarks as he flew from one college 
commencement address to another in mississippi his comments marked 
the latest in a series of steps designed to raise the stakes in a 
longrunning us effort dating to the reagan administration to 
bring about noriegas downfall 
asked if he was calling for the panamanian defense forces to 
overthrow noriega bush replied wed like to see him out of 
there not just the pdf the will of the people of panama 
the will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and 
a handful of his doberman thugs the president said noriegas 
riot police are referred to as dobermans 
asked if he cared where noriega went he said i care that he 
does whatever it takes to get him out of there right now 
he said going to a country that would bar extradition could 
well be the answer for noriega 
that could be a solution he ought to think about that 
bush said 
the president said he was anxious to make sure that the 
panamanian defense forces headed by noriega did not harbor the 
misconception that the administrations drumbeat of antinoriega 
statements were directed also at them 
if i were speaking to the panamanian people i would tell them 
that the affection by the american people for the people of panama 
is still very much intact strong bush told reporters flying 
with him to a graduation address at mississsippi state university 
and secondly i would say to the panamanian defense forces the 
pdf they have a useful role to play and they will in the future of 
panama the problem is not the pdf per se the problem is noriega 
bush again condemned what he called a fraudulent election last 
sunday in panama us offcials and observers have said the 
antinoriega opposition won overwhelmingly but that the election 
was as bush put it blatantly stolen by noriega 
noriegas government said their candidate for president had won 
based on partially counted returns but then noriega invalidated 
the whole election in the face of an outcry over fraudulent 
balloting practices 
the people should do everything they can to have the will of 
the people respected bush said they ought to just do 
everything they can to get mr noriega out of there 
bush declined to say if he has talked to representatives of 
other countries about accepting noriega if he steps down he would 
say only im confident they would receive him he did not name 
any countries or say how he had received such assurances 
bush said he is continuing to talk to us allies calling for 
international condemnation of noriega 
beyond that he did not state any additional actions the united 
states might take beyond the sending of 2000 troops this week to 
help protect american citizens and bases in panama and the 
withdrawal of the us ambassador 
however bush said 
were still at the plate and well stay at the plate until we 
can help the people of panama have the democracy for which they 
spoke so articulately in an election and were not going to give 
up on them 
no effort will be a success until he leaves bush said 
bush summoned reporters aboard air force one and made the 
statement concerning noriega and then answered questions 
he said that if noriega is ousted the panamanian people will 
have an instant normalization of relations with the united states 
and there will be a useful role for the panamanian defense force 
he said his administration would recognize the government of 
endara if he were sworn in as president the catholic church and 
other observers said endara won a 31 victory over noriegas 
candidate carlos duque last sunday 
bush said further he would return the us ambassador to panama 
and lift economic sanctions that have been in place for more than a 
year 
i think the election made so clear that the people want 
democracy and made so clear that that democracy is being thwarted 
by one man that that in itself could be the catalyst for removing 
noriega bush said

a us district judge has ruled that its 
possible for blacks to discriminate against other blacks based on 
the color of their skin 
judge charles a moye jr ruled that race and color are not the 
same thing 
it would take an ethnocentric and naive world view to suggest 
that we can divide caucasians into many subgroups but somehow all 
blacks are part of the same subgroup moye said there are 
sharp and distinctive contrasts amongst native black african 
peoples both in color and in physical characteristics 
in his ruling thursday moye certified for trial a lawsuit by 
tracy walker of union city a clerk typist for the internal revenue 
service she contended that her supervisor ruby lewis singled 
her out for close scrutiny and reprimanded her for many things that 
were false or insubstantial 
ms walkers skin was lighter than ms lewis 
margaret fernandez a spokeswoman for the equal employment 
opportunity commission in washington said moyes ruling may be a 
first 
if this issue had been raised everyone here would have been 
aware of it she said it is unique 
ms walkers suit said ms lewis considered her to be tardy 
lazy and incompetent and recommended that she be fired ms 
walker who disputed ms lewis appraisal of her eventually lost 
her job 
the defendants in the case including ms lewis the internal 
revenue service and the us treasury secretary argued that 
people of the same race cant discriminate against each other 
because color has generally been interpreted to mean the same 
thing as race 
moye disagreed citing a supreme court ruling that a white 
employer had discriminated against a naturalized american from iraq 
because of his arabian ancestry 
he said there is evidence that ms lewis might have harbored 
resentful feelings towards white people and therefore by 
inference possibly towards lightskinned black people 
ms lewis could not be reached for comment saturday 
no trial date for the lawsuit has been set

president bush in his first comments on 
soviet arms reductions said saturday he welcomed the move and said 
he wanted to win the peace war with soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev 
the president reacting to gorbachevs announced cut of 500 
shortrange missiles in eastern europe challenged the soviet 
leader to make good on his promise to reduce the soviets nuclear 
arsenal 
let him do what he says unilaterally it would be good 
bush said aboard air force one 
his remarks indicated adherence to his opposition to 
negotiations with the soviets for cuts in nato tactical nuclear 
weapons in western europe 
weve already removed 2000 tactical nuclear weapons and it 
would be nice to have him go ahead and make some moves bush said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush was 
referring to well over 2000 obsolete nuclear warheads that the 
army has taken out of service in western europe over the past few 
years 
bush commented a day after he called for a new openness in 
ussoviet relations that would bring the soviet unionback into 
the world order including a call for mutual surveillance flights 
over nato and warsaw pact territories 
but bush in fridays speech to texas aampm university mixed 
optimism over recent political reforms in the soviet union with an 
insistence that promises be met with deeds a theme he repeated on 
saturday in his chat with reporters 
gorbachevs announcement on the cuts on soviet weapons on 
thursday made to us secretary of state james a baker iii in 
moscow caught us officials by surprise 
however bush on saturday when asked if he thought he would win 
the publicrelations war with his soviet counterpart declared 
no such war i want to win the peace war lasting peace that 
built on action not on words 
action is what i talked about yesterday bush said 
i think we will prevail he added 
bushs refusal to consider reductions in us lance missiles in 
eastern europe until the soviet superiority in conventional weapons 
is erased has split nato 
meanwhile soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said 
saturday in west germany that the kremlin would consider a 
rearmament step or a break with the intermediaterange nuclear arms 
treaty if nato upgrades its shortrange nuclear missiles 
shevardnadze met with west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher in bonn saturday and the talks focused on the contentious 
missile issue 
fitzwater declined immediate comment on shevardnadzes statement 
bush said he had not yet received any reaction from allies to 
his call for mutual surveillance flights a revival of an 
eisenhowerera open skies proposal 
the president said he had talked by phone to baker on saturday 
morning when both of them were in houston to discuss briefly the 
secretary of states trip to moscow 
on other subjects bush declined to discuss the situation in 
panama brushing aside reports that venezuela might have offered 
political asylum to panamian leader manuel antonio noriega 
bush indicated he would have something to say on the subject of 
panama over the next few days although did not disclose the forum 
fitzwater suggested that the administration did not want to 
elaborate upon the tense situation in panama at this time because 
the stated policy is to protect american lives 
bush earlier in the week dispatched 2000 us troops to 
reinforce american bases and protect americans living there 
the president talked with reporters on air force one in houston 
before backtoback commencement speeches in mississippi speeches 
that extolled virtues of education family and work and did not 
touch upon current events 
in a speech to predominantly black alcorn state university here 
at lorman bush said the economic transformation wrought by 
historically black colleges such as alcorn is nothing less than 
astounding 
noting that while 85percent of graduates in such schools came 
from bluecollar families almost all go on to professional or 
managerial positions 
its an exciting tradition and one of the most 
underappreciated success stories in america he said 
deputy press secretary stephen hart said that a member of a 
mississippi swat team assigned to provide security at alcorn state 
accidentally fired his rifle 
the episode occurred before the presidents helicopter landed 
and no one was hurt hart said 
later in remarks prepared for commencement at mississippi state 
university in jackson miss bush spoke of the values of 
americas good quiet decent people americans who know that we 
are not the sum of our possessions but of how we conduct 
ourselves 
these people form the heart of our society bush said 
the postwar period has given way to a new world a world 
still perilous but alive with prospects for peace and with 
certainty of change yet there are some things that havent changed 
since 1948 americas values havent 
bush quoted slain civil rights leader martin luther king in his 
alcorn state speech intelligence is not enough intelligence 
plus character that is the true goal of educationand in the 
speech to mississippi state bush evoked the memory of mississippi 
novelist william faulkner who spent most of his life in the area 
let faulkners verities and truths of the heart be our 
values he said 
bush planned to outline his administrations emerging foreign 
policy strategy in a series of five speeches his texas aampm speech 
was the first and he is also to dwell on eastwest relations in a 
speech next weekend at boston university 
he was to travel to lexington ky later saturday to attend a 
fundraising dinner for the reelection campaign of republican sen 
mitch mcconnell it was bushs first appearance at a political 
fundraising event as president 
bush was to spend the night in kentucky at the home of a friend 
then return to washington on sunday 
bush spent friday night in houston at the houstonian hotel 
which had been his official voting residence as vice president

grounds and on friday night took a group of friends to a local

solidarity leaders urged members of the 
independent union saturday to resist pressures to strike and 
accused the countrys official unions of fomenting work stoppages 
solidarity which has used strikes in the past to advance its 
demands has taken the new tack since reaching an agreement with 
the government in april to take part in the political process as a 
legal organization 
its leader lech walesa stopped short of telling copper miners 
to end a sixday strike last week however he said the country 
faced more pressing problems than pay demands and that economic 
stability is needed for reforms to take root 
solidaritys national executive commission articulated the 
unions current position on strikes saturday saying the use of 
strike pressure for this purpose higher pay only makes the 
situation worse it creates political tensions leads to increasing 
inflation depreciates the currency 
it said union members should instead concentrate on making 
solidarity stronger 
organizing our union is now the most important task of all 
structures and activists of solidairty it said only as a 
strong and wellorganized union will solidarity be able to 
effectively influence reforms 
the declaration was made at a commission meeting chaired by 
walesa in the baltic port of gdansk 
hundreds of strikes over pay have occurred this year most of 
the work stoppages have been isolated and have ended quickly 
but the 15000 copper miners idled four mines for six days until 
management agreed last thursday to grant pay increases of 30 
percent and a 30 percent bonus 
the solidarity leadership also charged the official trade union 
alliance known as opzz of trying to provoke strikes 
in many regions and branches our union is provoked to strike 
and a special role is played here by opzz activists who try to 
make impossible the agreements of the roundtable it said 
the roundtable is a reference to the broadbased talks 
leading to the pact between the government and the solidarityled 
opposition on april 5

president bush on saturday called on the 
panamanian people to oust gen manuel noriega from power and said 
i would love to see them get him out 
but even as he showed a clenched fist to noriega bush extended 
a welcome to soviet president mikhail gorbachevs announced plans 
to eliminate 500 shortrange missiles from eastern europe let 
him do what he says unilaterally it would be good the president 
said 
articulating foreign policy literally on the fly bush spoke 
with reporters aboard air force one in two separate sessions as he 
made his way from texas to a pair of college commencement speeches 
in mississippi he was flying to kentucky for the night 
when a reporter suggested bushs words about noriega might be 
interpreted as a call to revolution or violent overthrow bush did 
not temper the remarks 
no i would add no words of caution he said the will of 
the people should be implemented 
no effort will be successful until he leaves bush said of 
the panamanian leader whom he again accused of stealing last 
weekends election 
as for gorbachev bush offered no reduction in us missiles in 
reply saying the united states has already removed warheads from 
western europe 
asked if he thought he would win a publicrelations war with his 
soviet counterpart bush declared no such war i want to win the 
peace war lasting peace that built on action not on words 
bush used his strongest words to date in addressing noriega and 
he did so as us troops continued flowing into panama to protect 
american citizens and property there 
the president went before television cameras to promise full 
support for a successor to noriega if the panamanian people force 
him from power 
while stopping short of urging violence or a coup the president 
declared he would love to see the panamanians get noriega out 
and pointedly declined to soften his language 
was he calling for a military coup 
wed like to see him out of there not just the pdf the will 
of the people of panama said bush the will of the people 
should not be thwarted by this man and a handful of his doberman 
thugs 
the panamanian defense force is panamas military 
bush instigated the contact with reporters on the panama issue 
making brief remarks on camera before submitting to a few 
questions 
only a few hours earlier this time only in response to 
questions bush had said he had no desire to engage in a public 
relations war with gorbachev but wanted to win the peace war 
in his first comments on gorbachevs announced cut of 500 
shortrange missiles in eastern europe the president told 
reporters he welcomed the move 
let him do what he says unilaterally it would be good 
bush said 
his remarks indicated adherence to his opposition to 
negotiations with the soviets for cuts in nato tactical nuclear 
weapons in western europe 
weve already removed 2000 tactical nuclear weapons and it 
would be nice to have him go ahead and make some moves bush said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush was 
referring to well over 2000 obsolete nuclear warheads that the 
army has taken out of service in eastern europe over the past few 
years 
bush commented a day after he called for a new openness in 
ussoviet relations that would bring the soviet union back into 
the world order including a call for mutual surveillance flights 
over nato and warsaw pact territories 
but bush in fridays speech to texas aampm university mixed 
optimism over recent political reforms in the soviet union with an 
insistence that promises be met with deeds a theme he repeated on 
saturday in his chat with reporters 
gorbachevs announcement on the cuts on soviet weapons on 
thursday made to us secretary of state james a baker iii in 
moscow caught us officials by surprise 
bushs refusal to consider reductions in us lance missiles in 
eastern europe until the soviet superiority in conventional weapons 
is erased has split nato however bush said saturday well work 
it out this alliance is strong 
bush said he had not yet received any reaction from allies to 
his call for mutual surveillance flights a revival of an 
eisenhowerera open skies proposal 
the president said he had talked by phone to baker on saturday 
morning when both of them were in houston to discuss briefly the 
secretary of states trip to moscow 
the president talked first with reporters on air force one in 
houston before backtoback commencement speeches in mississippi 
speeches that extolled virtues of education family and work and 
did not touch upon current events 
he brought up the panama matter en route from predominantly 
black alcorn state university at lorman to mississippi state 
university near starkville 
later bush raised the panama issue again at a fundraising 
dinner in lexington ky for the 1990 reelection effort of sen 
mitch mcconnell rky 
let me just assure you of this i will act prudently in 
central america bush said we do not want to return to the 
days of the imperial gringos of the north but let everybody be 
clear on one point i will protect the lives of americans in panama 
whether theyre military or civilians 
we will not let american lives be put at risk by a dictator 
down there he declared 
at alcorn state he said the economic transformation wrought 
by historically black colleges such as alcorn is nothing less than 
astounding 
noting that while 85 percent of graduates in such schools came 
from bluecollar families almost all go on to professional or 
managerial positions 
its an exciting tradition and one of the most 
underappreciated success stories in america he said 
departing from his prepared remarks bush told the audience at 
alcorn that as the soviet union moves toward greater openness and 
democratization and as they meet the challenge of responsible 
behavior we will match their steps with steps of our own 
he said over the past four decades the soviets have chosen to 
stand apart from and opposed to the world family of nations 
yesterday i announced a new policy for the 1990s one that 
moves beyond just trying to contain the soviet unionand if we 
succeed i can guarantee to you and your kids that the future you 
know is going to be safer and the world you know will be freer

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze on saturday said the kremlin might rearm or break the 
intermediaterange nuclear arms treaty if nato upgrades its 
shortrange missiles 
the veiled threat to match a nato proposal to increase the range 
of europeanbased lance nuclear missiles was the latest soviet 
effort to pressure the west into a new round of arms talks 
shevardnadze met with west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher for four hours saturday the talks focused on the 
contentious missile issue which has divided nato 
the united states wants nato approval this month of a plan to 
modernize or more than triple the range of the lance rockets 
by 1995 but west germany has balked and is pressing for superpower 
talks on reducing shortrange weapons 
most of natos shortrange missiles are based in west germany 
and public opinion here is strongly against the modernization step 
for fear it would jeopardize arms control efforts 
shevardnadze said the modernization project was tantamount to 
development of a new weapons system and he said the kremlin 
would not want to have to take a similar step 
this would have to be considered but it would not be by our 
own choice shevardnadze warned at a news conference before 
returning to moscow 
he likened the new missiles nato plans to develop to the soviet 
ss23s being dismantled under the december 1987 superpower accord 
eliminating mediumrange missiles 
why should we liquidate the ss23 if the other side is 
creating and will deploy an analogous lance2 rocket the foreign 
minister said it makes no sense to destroy these rockets then 
he said destruction of the ss23 would have to be halted or we 
would have to create a new system suspension of the ss23 
liquidation would violate the inf treaty 
asked about the possibility of the soviets rearming white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said saturday theyve already 
rearmed thats easy for them to say 
nato plans to replace the lance missiles which have a range of 
less than 75 miles with missiles capable of reaching up to 300 
miles that would keep them within the limits allowed under the 
1987 accord 
the united states has repeatedly said it wants a balance of 
conventional arms in europe before entering into talks aimed at 
elimination of shortrange missiles 
moscow and washington are already embarked on efforts to get rid 
of longrange and mediumrange missiles and nato officials argue 
that a shortrange nuclear option is necessary to defend against an 
attack by the warsaw pacts superior conventional forces 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev announced last week during 
secretary of state james a baker iiis visit to moscow that the 
kremlin would unilaterally cut its shortrange strength by 500 
warheads and he called again for negotiations on the remaining 
nuclear arms 
the move has been met with only a lukewarm response by 
washington 
baker deemed the kremlin gesture a good step but a small 
step 
president bush on saturday said let him do what he says 
unilaterally it would be good 
weve already removed 2000 nuclear weapons and it would be 
nice to have him gorbachev go ahead and make some moves bush 
added 
us national security adviser brent scowcroft accused gorbachev 
of a publicity ploy aimed at splitting the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
asked about scowcrofts view shevardnadze said it would be 
naive of the kremlin to try to disrupt the western alliance 
and he said the soviet measure was aimed at balancing eastwest 
defenses 
the western alliance estimates that the shortrange forces of 
the warsaw pact nations outnumber natos by 12to1 
shevardnadze admitted there is an east bloc superiority in 
some weapons but said moscow has renounced that advantage and 
taken steps to eliminate it 
in his talks with genscher and west german chancellor helmut 
kohl the soviet diplomat repeatedly pressed for superpower talks 
to reduce the shortrange forces and berated washington for its 
refusal 
what is to be feared by talking shevardnadze said during 
his news conference no one can be forced in negotiations to do 
what he does not want to do 
but when asked if he was frustrated by the bush administrations 
dismissal of the latest kremlin offers shevardnadze responded 
we have strong nerves we will wait we believe that nato 
will find in the nearest time a new approach on this 
shevardnadzes twoday visit was dominated by the superpower and 
internal nato disarmament dispute 
west germanys resistance on the missile modernization plan has 
drawn some support from other nato members creating a rift within 
the 16nation western alliance 
genscher who has long advocated a more trusting relationship 
between the superpowers in the wake of soviet democratic reforms 
and disarmament progress is the driving force behind west 
germanys stand on modernization 
genscher sidestepped a question about shevardnadzes threat of a 
kremlin rearmament move declaring it improper to address 
speculative considerations

more than 220 antiabortion demonstrators were 
arrested here saturday morning as throngs of protesters from both 
sides of the issue converged to draw attention to their views on 
mothers day weekend 
nearly 200 other antiabortion protesters were arrested in 
demonstrations in pittsburgh and outside san francisco 
in st paul minn more than 5000 people held a rally at the 
state capitol to demand that abortion remain legal in the united 
states and to denounce protests against clinics that perform 
abortions demonstrators carried signs with slogans such as 
mothers day not mandatory 
chicago police arrested 143 men and 80 women at the park medical 
center and charged them with resisting arrest and mob action said 
police spokeswoman tina vicini the street was closed to traffic 
police broke up occasional sidewalk skirmishes between the 
demonstrators and abortion rights protesters other antiabortion 
demonstrators were stationed at more than 25 clinics throughout the 
city organizers said 
park medical center continued seeing patients and abortion 
rights activists vowed to stay until the clinic had treated the 
last of 21 patients the clinic performs a range of gynecological 
services besides abortions 
police earlier estimated more than 300 people had been arrested 
the confusion arose because the arrests so overtaxed the local 
police district that protesters had to be sent to four other 
stations to be processed ms vicini said detainees further 
clogged the system by giving their names only as baby john doe 
and baby jane doe police said most carried no identification 
in california about 100 antiabortion demonstrators were 
arrested saturday outside a clinic in redwood city about 10 miles 
south of san francisco police said also arrested were five to 10 
abortion rights demonstrators involved in a brief scuffle with the 
activists representing operation rescue an antiabortion group 
said police chief tony guardino 
all were arrested for investigation of blocking a public 
sidewalk an infraction and were cited and released guardino said 
in pittsburgh 84 demonstrators were arrested for refusing to 
leave a womens clinic that performs abortions and three of the 
protesters were charged with assaulting police officers said 
officer tom melick 
a spokeswoman for operation rescue which organized that 
demonstration as well charged that police repeatedly kicked one 
protest leader keith tucci of pittsburgh 
tucci was listed in fair condition at mercy hospital where he 
was being treated for abdominal injuries according to nursing 
supervisor dorothy mckendry 
tucci said as many as four officers kicked him after he 
complained police were kicking demonstrators as they put them in a 
paddy wagon and threw them on top of each other 
i was pleading with them saying please dont do that 
he said in an interview from the hospital 
however assistant police chief donald aubrecht said tucci was 
one of several protesters who crawled under wooden police 
barracades to block doors to the clinic 
he grabbed a police officer by the leg and he wouldnt let 
go aubrecht said and she the police officer yelled let go 
of my leg let go of my leg 
we are saying he tucci was not kicked aubrecht said 
adding that tucci will be charged with two separate assault charges

a new book on pope john paul is death after a 
33day reign suggests he was so burdened by the task he stopped 
taking vital medicines according to a report in the sunday times 
the london newspaper is publishing edited extracts of the book 
a thief in the night by journalist john cornwell 
the author disputes theories that john paul i might have been 
killed by people in the vatican involved in intrigues and power 
struggles between conservatives and liberals in the roman catholic 
church hierarchy 
john paul i was elected pope on aug 26 1978 and was found 
dead in the bed of his vatican apartment the morning of sept 29 
the vatican said the pontiff nearly 66 years old died of a 
heart attack no autopsy was performed 
theories of a conspiracy against john paul i were fueled later 
by a scandal involving the vatican bank headed by american 
archbishop paul marcinkus and its links to the 1982 collapse of 
the huge italian bank banco ambrosiano roberto calvi the head of 
banco ambrosiano was found hanged under londons blackfriars 
bridge as italian police investigated the scandal 
in 1984 david yallop claimed in his book in gods name that 
the pontiff was poisoned because he intended to crack down on 
corruption in the vatican he mentioned marcinkus as a conspirator 
cornwell writes in his book the truth is much more shameful 
even than if the pope had been murdered that would have been the 
work of several criminals or madmen where in fact the whole of the 
vatican is responsible for the death of john paul i 
tormented by the conviction that he was unfit for the papal 
throne a feeling shared by many in the vatican john paul i was 
allowed to go to the solitary death he had prayed for untended and 
uncared for by those closest to him according to the newspaper 
excerpts 
it said cornwell found the pope had been taking medication for a 
bloodclotting condition that he recognized as a matter of life 
and death 
there is evidence that not through forgetfulness he 
deliberately stopped taking this medication because he could no 
longer continue as pope cornwell wrote 
he said the vatican encouraged his investigation hoping it 
would disprove the conspiracy theories 
no one was available for comment saturday night at the vatican 
press office and the telephone at the home of vatican spokesman 
joaquin navarro was not answered 
the first segment of the excerpts dealt mainly with an interview 
cornwell said he had with marcinkus at his office in the vatican 
bank 
according to the excerpts cornwell asked marcinkus about 
previous suggestions that the chicagoborn archbishop had conspired 
against the pope and became involved with banco ambrosiano 
marcinkus is quoted as saying both of these things are 
completely unfounded these guys are off their rockers he 
also was quoted as saying he had one audience with the new pope who 
couldnt have been nicer and asked marcinkus to remain with the 
vatican bank

cleared their basements turned off their electricity and bid their 
homes goodbye saturday as the androscoggin river inched onto the 
sidewalks of maines twin cities 
by 10 pm the river was nearly 5 feet above flood level at 
auburn and civil emergency staffers were watching anxiously 
im just not comfortable said peter van gagnon director of 
the androscoggin county emergency management agency ive seen it 
quiet for hours and then suddenly take a jump of 2 or 3 feet 
early in the weekend state and county emergency response 
officials advised residents to be ready to move quickly if the 
river should suddenly rise 
although no sweeping evacuations were made families living 
closest to the river moved out as water filled their basements and 
forced the shutdown of household utilities 
van gagnon predicted the river in that area to crest just this 
side of 20 feet late saturday the flood threshold ranges from 18 
feet to 13 feet at auburn

incredible said gagnon we dont want anyone to think its 
over yet and go back home

a group headed by a chicago commodities trader 
on saturday submitted a proposal to buy eastern airlines in a bid 
that would temporarily put former secretary of defense frank 
carlucci in charge of the airline 
the bid by joseph ritchie was the second submitted to a us 
bankruptcy court judge for the airline which has been flying 
limited schedules since its international association of machinists 
employees began a strike march 4 
details of the ritchie bid were unavailable but the commodities 
trader said in an interview with the new york times that his offer 
would give eastern unions a larger stake in the airline than 
offered by a group headed by peter ueberroth the former 
commissioner of professional baseball 
the ueberroth group had offered the unions 30 percent equity in 
the airline in exchange for 210 million in concessions 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland had extended a wednesday 
bidding deadline to 11 am saturday to allow the ritchie group to 
study confidential financial data in making its bid 
miamibased eastern has been under chapter 11 protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after the start of a machinists 
union strike supported by pilots and flight attendants that 
virtually grounded the airline 
the bankruptcy court must approve any sale of eastern or any of 
its businesses 
eastern however insists the airline is not for sale and is 
proceeding with a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and raise 
18 billion by selling aircraft and other assets 
in addition to carlucci ritchie who is head of the chicago 
research and trading group is being assisted by joseph wright a 
former director of the office of management and budget 
on wednesday an investor group led by william howard the 
former chairman of piedmont airlines submitted its bid before the 
prior 5 pm wednesday deadline the investment firm 
prudentialbache securities inc is a participant in the howard 
group 
billionaire hotel executive jay pritzker already has proposed 
buying all of eastern for around 500 million although it is 
unclear whether he has submitted a formal offer 
before submitting formal bids ritchie howard and their 
associates had extensive talks with representatives of easterns 
unions and creditors 
sources have told the associated press that both proposals 
address the issue of a temporary trustee who would operate eastern 
in a way that should prevent the issue from sabotaging a potential 
deal between a buyer and easterns parent texas air corp they 
declined to specify 
the issue of a trustee who would assume control of the airline 
from texas air chairman frank lorenzo was at the heart of the 
collapse of ueberroths 464 million deal to buy eastern 
the bankruptcy judge has scheduled a monday meeting on developer 
donald trumps deal with lorenzo to buy easterns profitable 
northeast shuttle service for 365 million

rep tony coelho dcalif said he failed to 
report a 50000 loan used to finance a personal investment on his 
financial disclosure form the washington post reported in sundays 
editions 
the post quoted coelho as saying the failure was the result of 
an oversight by his accountant who the house majority whip said 
also inaccurately reported several aspects of the transaction 
coelho told the paper he is amending his financial disclosure 
form to reflect the loan the paper said he acknowledged he knew 
about the loan but did not disclose it publicly when questions were 
raised in april about his 100000 investment in a junk bond 
his campaign committee was initially listed as the buyer of the 
bond from the brokerage firm of drexel burnham lambert but 
coelho said it actually was a personal investment and the brokerage 
firm erred in saying the bonds were bought by his campaign fund

stuffed with 17 more armored vehicles support trucks and marines 
were close behind 
col ronald sconyers a spokesman for the southern command said 
the troops are needed as the president stated yesterday because 
we feel its a prudent decision to increase the security for our 
installations and our personnel gen manuel antonio noriegas 
heavyhanded tactics and his willingness to abuse human rights 
prove theres a lack of control on the streets of panama 
we feel like although no americans have been directly 
threatened we felt like its only prudent to move our people out 
and increase security 
he said the marines and additional army troops will be used to 
provide security at the 10 bases and one radar site in panama 
he said the marines would guard the perimeter of howard air 
base which is about five miles east of panama city and an 
ammunition dump as well as assist with security at the us embassy

perimeters but said you can assume the perimeters of our bases 
will be protected

stock prices posted their biggest gain in nearly 
a year friday finishing at new postcrash highs following a 
government wholesale price report which analysts said eased wall 
streets fears about inflation 
the markets bestknown indicator the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks surged 5682 points to settle at a new 
postcrash high of 243970 
broader market indicators also rose in active trading with more 
than three issues gaining for every one that fell among issues 
listed on the new york stock exchange 
the dows previous high since its oct 19 1987 crash was 
241899 set on april 27 the daily gain was the biggest since a 
7468point jump on may 31 1988 
analysts attributed fridays gain to a smallerthanexpected 
rise in the labor departments producer price index for april the 
index rose 04 percent in april or about half as much as many 
analysts had expected 
the news sent longterm treasury bond prices which move 
inversely to interest rates soaring by 20 and more for every 
1000 in face value 
investors apparently concluded the report meant inflationary 
pressures were not building and the federal reserve might not 
continue its recent policy of encouraging higher interest rates 
analysts said 
the fear until now was not that the economy would overheat but 
that inflation would rise rapidly and keep the fed from making 
moves to ease credit said michael metz technical analyst for 
oppenheimer amp co now it looks like that has changed

president raul alfonsin urged 
argentina on friday to accept with prudence and responsibility 
the winner of elections and the opposition peronistas confidently 
predicted victory 
the nations 20 million eligible voters cast ballots this sunday 
for president vice president onehalf the chamber of deputies 
one national senator 15 provincial or territorial legislatures and 
thousands of local officials 
whatever is the result of the balloting i ask people to 
conduct themselves so that prudence and responsibility are with us 
still alfonsin begged the sometimes volatile electorate in his 
19minute broadcast speech 
i ask people to behave so no pretext can be used to alter 
the mechanisms that the constitution provides for the election of 
representatives and the transfer of power 
carlos menem of the peronist party has led in virtually every 
poll for months the latest surveys give him a seven to 10 point 
edge over eduardo angeloz of the governing radical civic union 
voting actually is for 600 presidential electors the winner 
needs at least 301 
sen eduardo menem the candidates brother and key adviser 
said friday that peronist polls and party projections are giving 
us more than 320 electors 
carlos menems campaign coordinator eduardo kohan said i am 
absolutely sure we will win in the electoral college peronist 
party president antonio cafiero governor of buenos aires province 
predicted that menem absolutely will carry the electoral 
college on sunday 
campaigns that began in earnest four months ago officially ended 
at 8 am friday 48 hours before polls are scheduled to open 
hundreds of thousands attended rallies held by all three main 
parties on thursday night 
in central cordoba province where he is governor angeloz 
pledged before an estimated 300000 supporters to unleash a 
battle with no quarter against inflation to promote womens 
rights and to uphold civil liberties 
never again will a montonero or a green falcon take away 
anyones son because he thinks differently he said 
argentinas repressive security forces drove green ford falcon 
cars during the 197683 military regimes crackdown on leftist 
subversion the montonero urban guerrillas were linked with the 
peronist party 
angeloz 57 his own campaign hurt by argentinas economic 
crisis repeatedly sought to damage menem by bringing up the 
violence and chaos of the 197376 peronist government which was 
overthrown by a coup menem has bitterly denounced the tactic 
angeloz says if menem wins democracy will lose menem 58 
told about 100000 supporters in buenos aires they the 
radicals demonstrated themselves to be democrats when in power and 
coupmongers when not 
menem three times governor of rural la rioja province arrived 
at the plaza rally site outside congress atop a bus that led a 
noisy motorcade through the capitals streets 
alvaro alsogaray of the conservative central alliance coalition 
addressed a much smaller less emotional crowd of about 30000 in 
the capital where his party has its most support 
the country cant last through a new radical or peronist 
government said alsogaray a 75yearold engineer and former 
economy minister 
he says his priorities would be to balance the budget sell off 
state companies and encourage foreign investment 
alsogaray was projected to get about 10 percent of the vote 
enough to play a pivotal role in the electoral college if neither 
menem nor angeloz wins outright alsogaray could negotiate to give 
his electors to one of them 
the main issue in 1983 elections was a return to democracy 
following a brutal military dictatorship alfonsin who was elected 
president cannot seek reelection under the constitution his term 
ends on dec 10 
the main issue this year is the economy argentina is suffering 
tripledigit inflation a devalued currency high unemployment and 
a 59 billion foreign debt

from alar apple ripener to animal feedcorn 
toxin to the molasseslike oil sludge polluting alaskas shore 
environmental hazards have been catalysts forcing industries to 
reappraise the way they do business 
the cost of these risks was clear this past week when apple 
processors changed policy and urged a ban on alar the largest us 
petroleum company capitulated to demands for more effective oil 
spill prevention and hog farmers expressed alarm about a 
mysterious piglet dieoff that some studies have linked to 
droughtparched corn tainted with aflatoxin a fungusproduced 
poison 
these developments were coincidental but they all reflected the 
increased sensitivity that businesses have been forced to acquire 
in order to thrive in an economy where consumers are focusing more 
on their health and surroundings 
the pressure on companies to quickly respond when questions are 
raised about their products or behavior is particularly acute among 
vendors of food and other consumer items as events earlier this 
year demonstrated 
when federal investigators found traces of cyanide in two 
imported chilean grapes in march and temporarily ordered all 
chilean fruit off the shelves grocers nationwide took 
extraordinary steps to assure shoppers their produce was safe 
wholesalers and retailers absorbed 41 million in losses from 
dumped chilean fruit 
when a woman in rogers ark reported that her mouth was burned 
after gargling with listerine antiseptic last month manufacturer 
warner lambert inc rushed the suspect bottle through laboratory 
analysis and found nothing wrong 
walmart stores inc the nations no 3 retailer where the 
bottle was purchased temporarily ordered all listerine off the 
shelves in its 26state chain 
we stand by our decision and feel it was the thing to do 
walmart spokesman donald shinkle said at the time our customers 
would more than agree with that 
it was pressure from customers that provoked apple processors 
into an aboutface on alar uniroyal chemical cos marketing name 
for an organic acid that keeps apples on the tree until ripe and 
prolongs their crispness in storage 
the processors urged the environmental protection administration 
to dissuade growers from using the substance basing their position 
on what they called public hysteria about alar and its effect on 
their business 
reports by some consumer groups that alar poses a health risk to 
children have sent sales tumbling this year and devastated the 
earnings of apple orchards industry figures reported friday 
suggested losses in washington state which produces most of the 
nations apples will exceed 90 million 
an even more dramatic policy change was announced by exxon 
corp the oil giant responsible for the oil spill march 24 in 
alaskas oncepristine prince william sound the company has faced 
blistering criticism not only from environmentalists but 
customers federal regulators and large shareholders 
a week before the companys annual meeting exxon executives 
said this past thursday they would support the appointment of an 
environmentalist to the board of directors and consider spending 
more money on pollution prevention 
in other business and economic developments this past week 
government reports that suggested a slowing economy rallied the 
stock and bond markets on the theory that inflation is no longer a 
big threat wholesale prices and retail sales both rose only 04 
percent in april significantly lower than many economists 
anticipated 
two significant personalities in the financial world announced 
their resignations gary lynch the securities and exchange 
commissions enforcement director who led an unprecedented 
crackdown on wall street corruption said he would step down in 
august american stock exchange chairman arthur levitt jr who 
presided over the markets expansion into innovative securities to 
compete with bigger rivals said he would leave when a successor is 
named 
the targets of potentially hostile takeovers grew to include 
the avon lady and the dunkin donuts man direct selling marketer 
amway corp announced a 2 billion takeover attempt of its much 
larger competitor avon products inc a canadian investment

the outlook for business conditions and business 
expansion took a dive in the latest smallbusiness survey by 
the national federation of independent business 
while the results indicate a definite slowing of the 77month 
expansion economist william dunkelberg who designed the survey 
said it did not portend a recession he expects growth to continue 
at a 2 percent annual rate 
the word is cooling he said 
the april survey is one of a quarterly series that obtains 
responses from nearly 2000 smaller businesses a series that over 
the past decade has had a high degree of accuracy in forecasting 
the general economy six months ahead 
in an overview of the survey results dunkelberg said the 
outlook for business conditions and business expansion resulted in 
the most negative set of figures since the second quarter of 1980 
he said the findings indicate a slowdown in growth of the gross 
national product employment inventories and capital spending and 
an upturn in unemployment and inflation 
dunkelberg who is dean of temple universitys school of 
business and management said inflation reports from the responding 
companies also added up to the most unfavorable set of inflation 
figures in the expansion 
only 9 percent of respondents reported lower selling prices in 
the first quarter while a stunning 36 percent said they raised 
prices twentyeight percent of respondents said they plan to raise 
prices in the next six months 
in spite of this he emphasized that inflation isnt rampant he 
forecast a 56 percent annual rate for the second quarter up from 
53 percent in the first quarter and 47 percent in the second 
quarter of 1988 
while such percentages might seem modest when matched against 
the doubledigit rates of the 1970s they are sharply higher than 
the rates reported in 1986 when the quarterly percentages never 
exceeded 26 percent 
summarizing the outlook in an interview dunkelberg said there 
will be a slowdown in growth but there will be growth in fact he 
even saw a bright side to the slowdown saying it will relieve a 
lot of pentup pressure 
he likened it to an earth tremor that forestalls a destructive 
earthquake saying a slowdown relieves upward pressure on interest 
rates reduces the price stress of consumer demand and allows 
needed slack to develop in plant capacity 
at the same time he said the next few months represent a 
ticklish time for economic policy with the federal reserve 
apparently using interest rates to deal with existing as well as 
feared inflation a downturn could occur 
he views a slowmoving economy as being vulnerable to shocks and 
surprises pointing out that among other things a considerable 
amount of credit has been extended to consumers in the expectation 
of continued steady employment 
in the event that this economy falters fiscal policy is on 
the ropes he said explaining that easy money in contrast to 
todays relatively tight money may be the only solution

the largest deal in history has spawned the 
largest corporate bond offering 4 billion in junk bonds to help 
finance the 2453 billion debtfinanced takeover of rjr nabisco 
inc 
the huge highyield bond issue has been the talk of wall street 
for weeks with market strategists and investors giving it great 
importance because of a recent lapse in the junk bond business and 
fears of an economic slowdown 
it also throws the spotlight on lead underwriter drexel burnham 
lambert inc as it tackles the record deal without michael milken 
the junk bond industrys chief architect who is under indictment 
and out of commission indefinitely 
its huge said warren greene president of the american 
investors income fund inc of greenwich conn four billion 
dollars is a lot of money to raise in this market 
the offer by rjr holdings capital corp which became effective 
friday dwarfs other corporate debt issues bci holdings in 1986 
offered 25 billion in noninvestment grade bonds and occidental 
petroleum corp the same year offered 248 billion in 
investmentgrade bonds no other offering has exceeded 2 billion 
the rjr bonds are part of an 8 billion securities package to 
raise money for the takeover of atlantabased rjr nabisco by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the investment firm that specializes 
in buying companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged 
buyouts 
the bonds have high yields partly because of fears that the 
sheer size of the offer would deter investment managers who dont 
think the market can absorb the load in fact some major 
institutions are tiptoeing around the noninvestment grade bonds 
despite universal acclaim for their quality 
when you have such quantities of merchandise thrown on the 
market regardless of how the deep the market is there is question 
about the appetite of any investor said an executive at a major 
capital management group that is limiting its takings 
drexel priced some of the securities to yield 15 percent more 
than 1 percentage point above what was initially planned 
the complexity of the deal also could scare off some investors 
underwriters have structured the bond sales in several tiers with 
the same securities having different prices depending on the amount 
purchased also interest rates on some securities will be reset at 
certain dates 
its a complicated transaction said gloria vila a senior 
analyst with moodys investors service inc a credit rating 
agency thats caused some difficulty with buyers 
there also is some skepticism about drexels ability to manage 
the deal without milken who took a leave of absence after pleading 
innocent to 98 counts of racketeering and securities fraud in march 
milken was working during drexels sale of 5 billion in 
shortterm rjr notes earlier this year which was smoother than the 
companys attempt to drum up support of institutional investors for 
the current offer 
the absence of milken is apparent in the delays and the 
difficulties as have been perceived in the marketplace the 
capital management executive said 
but he added they still have managed to do it thats a 
credit to drexels firepower 
the issue lifts drexel back to the top of the junk bond market 
with 502 percent of the 1096 billion in bonds issued this year 
its highest share since 1985 when it cornered 549 percent 
according to securities data co 
drexel had stumbled to a 159 percent firstquarter share which 
analysts had attributed to the loss of milken and the bad publicity 
over the firms securities fraud woes 
the total financing for the rjr transaction will approach 20 
billion including 4 billion in other securities such as preferred 
stock issued when the rjrkkr takeover was completed in april 
the rjr junk bonds are designed to replace the 5 billion in 
shortterm bridge notes sold earlier this year by drexel some 
variations in the sale are designed to induce investors to exchange 
the shortterm investment for longterm bonds 
despite its size and complexity many traders believe the market 
can absorb the rjr issue because of the stability of the companies 
under the food and tobacco giants umbrella 
the credit strength is there said ted reed vice president 
of aetna capital management inc which is buying 7 million of the 
bonds for its 130 million portfolio in a downturn that credit 
is going to hold up better than a company that makes widgets to 
compete with the japanese these are pretty high visibility 
brandname products 
you have to step back from all the trees and look at the 
forest and say does rjr have value i think the answer is yes 
said ed dalelio cochief investment officer for highyield bonds 
with the putnam cos a financial services firm in boston 
analysts believe the rjr sale will be a benchmark for the 180 
billion a year junk bond market which has been in a tailspin 
because of recession talk and a harvard university report that junk 
bonds may have a higher default rate than previously believed 
i always think the more liquidity we have in the market the 
better we are said john moran a junk bond trader with advest 
inc i think its much easier when you have a visible name like 
this rather than a company nobodys ever heard of

theres a threesyllable word wall street 
analysts are bandying around to describe the stock markets fickle 
mood conviction 
its something they say the market or rather investors 
dont have a whole lot of lately 
take for example the april report on producer prices the 
market waited all week for fridays data while traders talked of 
higher inflation and gloomy predictions of a recession 
in the first 30 minutes after the opening bell the dow jones 
industrial average zoomed over 40 points and remained near that 
level during most of the day traders had been expecting a number 
higher than the 04 percent rise the labor department reported 
the dow average closed 5682 points higher friday at 243970 
the highest level since the october 1987 stock market collapse and 
the biggest daily gain since a 7468point rise on may 31 1988 
the previous postcrash high was 241899 at the close on april 
27 the 5774point gain for the week was the thirdbest this year 
among other barometers the new york stock exchange composite 
index rose 299 for the week to 17513 the nasdaq composite index 
for the overthecounter market rose 412 to 43483 and the 
american stock exchange market value index edged up 146 to 34830 
it seems as one analyst put it that investors are living and 
dying on each piece of economic data shoveled out by the government 
old data at that 
the biggest problem the market faces is confusion and lack of 
conviction because of confusion says alfred e goldman vice 
president of the investment firm ag edwards amp sons inc it 
shows this market has little longterm conviction otherwise people 
wouldnt be so concerned with old news 
traders and the investing public hoped the numbers would unravel 
the previous weeks confusion over the april employment report the 
report showed more people were out of work an indication the 
economy might be slowing while hourly earnings rose a substantial 
7 cents hinting inflations tentacles might be stretching 
the jitters early in the week were reflected in the measly 
volume despite 22149 million shares traded on friday the weeks 
volume averaged just 16087 million shares a day down from 16325 
million the week before 
no sooner had some of the excitement died down than traders were 
talking about the upcoming consumer price data another measure of 
inflation that some said might not produce the same favorable 
results 
people want to keep the economy from overheating but we keep 
getting mixed signals says thomas walsh head of equity trading 
at nikko securities international its a critical period in a 
very fickle market a market with little conviction 
the critical period amounts to a turning point in the economy 
according to some economists 
with no clearcut longterm direction the market is relying on 
shortterm measurements to give it a jolt even though as one 
expert put it gambling on the ppi doesnt determine the value of a 
company 
even though there is no conviction with the market trend its 
difficult for traders to explain to clients why they havent 
participated in the last 200 to 300 points said eugene peroni 
technical analyst with janney montgomery scott its a 
selffulfilling thing the market begins to gain steam and it 
pressures those underweighted in equities to come in and commit 
funds 
early in the week the focus was on the dow jones industrial 
average and an eightday losing streak even though the average 
lost less over the eight sessions than it often has in one day 
the explanation for the consecutive losses its no calamity 
just a lack of conviction said larry wachtel analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc 
despite the overall uncertainty some wall street analysts 
believe ingredients are accumulating for a strong upward move in 
the next 12 months money managers and large institutional 
investors are moving into the market in an orderly fashion they 
say 
the economy is at a turning point said james solloway 
director of economic research at argus research corp thats why 
investors and traders are keying on each statistic they want to 
catch the turning point

you rarely see whitegloved avon ladies toting 
makeup samples door to door these days and tupperware parties have 
moved from the home to the office 
the business of direct sales long personified by the 
salesperson grinning through the screen door and trying to get his 
or her foot in it has changed dramatically 
sales pitches have been adjusted to suit the busy twocareer 
times and markets now stretch around the globe not just around 
the block 
when amway corp made a 21 billion takeover bid for avon 
products inc last week the deal focused attention on a business 
that has quietly shifted from blind calls to target marketing 
its just not productive to knock on doors at 10 oclock in 
the morning anymore because no ones home says george hescock 
executive vice president of the direct selling association 
the random calling knocking on doors arbitrarily up one side 
of the street and down the other is clearly less prevalent 
hescock says 
increasingly representatives of avon amway or other 
directselling outfits rely on previous contact with potential 
customers before seeking entry to their homes 
the clear pattern is fewer and fewer calls that are made 
unannounced at the doorstep according to hescock there is 
some degree of previous acquaintance a vehicle creating an 
entree 
relationships with coworkers are being exploited for instance 
tupperware home parties known over the years for presenting its 
food storage containers to homemakers now reaches out to customers 
with tight schedules with demonstrations during coffee breaks at 
work sites and rush hour parties at places convenient for people to 
drop in on their way home from work 
about a quarter of the companys worldwide annual sales now come 
from such party alternatives 
direct sellers have had to alter their approaches because more 
of their customers still predominantly female are working 
outside the home 
this shift also means a higher proportion of the women who 
typically fill most of the positions in the directselling sales 
force are employed in offices and other workplaces where they can 
deliver their sales pitches to colleagues 
about 36 million people are involved in direct selling in the 
united states and about 88 percent of them work at it part time 
eighty percent of the persontoperson sales force is female 
according to industry figures 
besides empty houses direct sellers have been motivated to 
modernize their methods by the personal safety concerns of their 
customers perhaps now more than ever before people in highcrime 
pockets of the country might think opening their doors to strangers 
a foolish thing to do 
a key reason why direct sellers felt they needed to make some 
changes was to preserve their profitability after booming sales in 
the 1960s they started to see their revenue growth stall in the 
early 1970s partly due to an economic recession in the united 
states 
much of the 1970s was a trying time for many direct sellers and 
the early 1980s didnt bring much relief traditional retailers 
were drawing away more customers who formerly favored direct 
sellers wares while fewer women were at home to recruit as sales 
agents and fewer were at home to buy 
us sales in the directselling business were essentially flat 
from 1982 through 1986 but rebounded to a record 88 billion in 
1987 the indications are that sales rose about 8 percent in 1988 
setting a new high the direct selling association says 
some of the sales rebound can be attributed to the changes the 
direct sellers implemented they clearly benefited from encouraging 
representatives to make more workplace solicitations from 
enhancing the training of their sales reps and revamping their 
sales literature 
the evolution of new nonstore retailing techniques also helped 
by making consumers aware that there are ways to buy things without 
having to venture out to the suburban shopping malls those 
techniques include mailorder catalogs homeshopping television 
networks videotex units and direct persontoperson contacts 
a recent report by the new yorkbased market research firm 
findsvp says the development of nonstore retailing is generating 
billions of dollars of sales that might never have existed if 
consumers only shopped at conventional retail establishments 
the greatest growth opportunities for direct sellers lie outside 
the united states japan is by far the biggest direct selling 
market in the world about twice the size of the us market by 
conservative estimates 
cultural factors largely account for the japanese preference for 
buying things through directsales respresentatives even things 
like automobiles are sold in this manner in japan 
other pacific basin countries in which traditional retail 
distribution channels are not well developed also are considered 
highgrowth areas by direct sellers indonesia malaysia and 
thailand to name just three have been identified as key countries 
for directselling expansion 
developing countries in latin america also appeal to direct 
sellers in fact the presence avon has in central and south 
america apparently was one of the things that convinced competitor 
amway to propose its takeover the acquisition would fill a hole 
for amway which already is peddling goods in more than 40 
countries

a report that wholesale prices rose moderately in april 
triggered furious rallies in the stock and bond markets and sent 
interest rates reeling lower 
the stock market posted its biggest oneday gain in nearly a 
year on friday and bond prices recorded their largest advance since 
last september 
the labor department said that despite a steep 72 percent climb 
in energy costs wholesale prices rose only 04 percent in april or 
about half as much as many market watchers had expected 
the rise in energy prices largely was offset by a broad fall in 
food prices and by a substantial decline in auto costs 
the financial markets have been restrained in recent weeks by 
concerns that inflation was accelerating even as economic growth 
slowed those worries have deepened as oil prices have climbed 
threatening to boost the costs of producing a wide range of items 
including gasoline 
but the price report appeared to reduce chances that the federal 
reserve would be forced to push interest rates higher in a bid to 
restrain inflation 
rising interest rates put stock yields at a competitive 
disadvantage to those available on new issues of treasury bills and 
notes drive up the costs of business borrowing and erode the 
corporate earnings outlook 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
climbed 5682 points to settle at a new postcrash high of 243970 
the dows previous high since its oct 19 1987 crash was 
241899 set on april 27 fridays gain was the biggest oneday 
rise since a 7468point jump on may 31 1988 
broader market indicators also rose in active trading with more 
than three issues gaining for every one that fell among issues 
listed on the new york stock exchange 
the indication of slowing inflation also helped the bond market 
whose investors dread inflation because it erodes the value of 
fixedincome holdings such as treasury notes and bonds 
prices of some 30year treasury bonds posted gains of more than 
23 for every 1000 in face value the biggest gain since a 2662 
advance last sept 2 yields tumbled to 883 percent from 906 
percent late thursday 
yields on shortterm treasury issues also dropped as much as a 
quarter of a percentage point 
the april advance in the labor departments producer price index 
for finished goods one stop short of retail followed an identical 
04 percent gain in march and 1 percent jumps in january and 
february 
in a separate report friday the commerce department said 
business inventories in march rose 03 percent while sales were 
flat confirming earlier government statistics showing economic 
growth slowing 
in another economic report fixedrate home mortgages slipped to 
an average of 1093 percent this week compared with 1097 percent 
last week according to a national survey released by the federal 
home loan mortgage corp
