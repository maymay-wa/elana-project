the united states and the soviet union have 
agreed to extend a military exchange program to help eliminate the 
atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust between the two countries 
a soviet official said thursday 
gen mikhail moiseyev soviet first deputy minister of defense 
and his american counterpart gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff announced the agreement signed earlier this 
week 
it extends a program of goodwill exchanges between the two 
superpowers until 1992 the previous agreement which included 
visits by us and soviet navy ships to vladivostok and san diego 
respectively expires this year 
the plan include a wide range of military exchanges said 
moiseyev speaking through an interpreter i do hope that the 
result of that mutual exchange program will give us the possibility 
to get to know each other much better and of course we do plan to 
carry on the military exchanges which will be instrumental in 
eliminating the atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust 
powell said improved relations between the former cold war 
rivals had already opened new avenues of trust 
obviously we both protect that information which we believe is 
classified and is essential to our national security powell 
said what is impressive is the degree of openness that now 
exists where we can share information with each other that a year 
or two ago we never would have thought of sharing 
the two generals made their remarks following a tour of two us 
navy vessels including a nuclearpowered attack class submarine 
at the north island naval air station in san diego 
moiseyev who is on a fiveday tour of the united states is 
expected to travel to washington on friday with powell to hold a 
joint news conference 
the soviet general said he was pleased with the welcome he had 
received at american military bases 
i was especially deeply impressed by the degree of openness 
by the degree of unlimited and open desire to tell us the members 
of the military delegation about their military hardware 
moiseyev said of his american hosts

a study published today found that patients who 
listened to soothing tapes during surgery required less pain relief 
during recovery 
fiftyseven women undergoing hysterectomies at two hospitals in 
glasgow scotland wore personal stereos into the operating room 
researchers reported in the current edition of the british medical 
journal 
half of the women were played blank tapes and the others 
listened to positive statements during the operation 
doctors found that the women who listened to the tape playing 
soothing remarks including everything is going very well were 
very pleased with your progress and any pain that you feel 
after the operation will not concern you used 23 percent less 
morphine while recovering than those who were played blank tapes 
the women were connected to a system that allowed them to 
administer the amount of morphine they wanted 
the report said none of the patients could recall hearing any 
sounds during surgery 
dr phil richardson who has conducted three similar studies at 
londons st thomas hospital said he agreed with the reports 
recommendation that more patients should be played tapes with 
positive messages during surgery 
richardsons studies have shown that patients who were played 
such tapes during surgery left the hospital sooner and had fewer 
unpleasant side effects than those who were played blank tapes

the sale of 73 billion in new weaponry to 
saudi arabia is just one step in creating a persian gulf 
coalition defense against the longterm threat posed by iraq 
say two senior bush administration officials 
that sale will be followed by more sales next year to the 
saudis perhaps to their neighbors bahrain and the united arab 
emirates and new military help for israel undersecretary of 
defense paul wolfowitz and undersecretary of state reginald 
bartholomew told congress on wednesday 
in doing so the united states hopes to build a saudi and a 
gulf force capability that will in effect drive up significantly 
the costs to anybody looking to take a whack at them bartholomew 
said 
we do not want to leave the road to bahrain open as it was on 
the second of august the day iraq invaded kuwait he told a 
hearing of two house foreign affairs subcommittees 
president bush has asked congress for permission to sell 73 
billion worth of weapons including tanks attack helicopters and 
antimissile defenses to saudi arabia 
the two officials said the weapons would help the saudis present 
a more credible deterrent to aggression from iraq or elsewhere and 
would permit them if attacked to resist long enough to allow 
reinforcements from friendly countries to arrive 
they noted that past us military sales to the saudis some 50 
billion over the past four decades helped build many of the 
facilities that now are supporting operation desert shield the 
americanled international troop deployment in that country 
some have said that once desert shield is over iraq will no 
longer be a threat because the us and allied forces will have 
destroyed the iraqi military wolfowitz said we cannot count 
on that no outcome is likely to permanently eliminate iraq as 
a regional power 
us strategy is based on a principle of coalition defense 
wolfowitz said he said that includes strengthening the ability of 
gulf nations to defend themselves encouraging defense cooperation 
among countries in the region and making it easier for them to 
receive reinforcements from allies 
the sale of 150 advanced m1a2 tanks is particularly important 
wolfowitz said noting that us strategists were particularly 
afraid of iraqi tanks in the early days of the military deployment 
we had severe concerns about the ability of iraqi armor to 
penetrate rather quickly he said we didnt have anything on 
the ground to stop iraqi tanks we dont want to ever be in the 
position of saying that again 
the officials asked that congress quickly approve the newest 
sale to saudi arabia they said additional sales to riyadh as well 
as to the united arab emirates and bahrain would be proposed early 
next year 
next years saudi package will include f15 fighter planes 
additional patriot antimissile batteries and more tanks and 
antiarmor weapons bartholomew said the administration also is 
considering requests from bahrain for apache attack helicopters and 
multiplelaunch rocket systems and from the united arab emirates 
for apaches he said 
responding to concerns from supporters of israel wolfowitz 
noted the administration is prepared to quickly transfer two 
patriot batteries from current us stocks and is looking at 
additional ways to aid israel militarily 
asked by rep lee hamilton dind whether it is us policy to 
retaliate against iraq immediately if it attacks israel 
bartholomew said i dont have any reason to open that up to 
question 
rep tom lantos dcalif raised the possibility that weapons 
sold to saudi arabia could fall into enemy hands if its current 
government ever falls and cited similar past occurrences in iran 
and kuwait 
bartholomew acknowledged that some us weapons that had been 
sold to kuwait now are in the hands of iraqi forces including a 
number of improved hawk antiaircraft missiles tow antitank 
missiles selfpropelled 155millimeter howitzers and ammunition 
and about 16 a4 attack aircraft

it wasnt the message but a word president 
bush used that elevated eyebrows after his television speech on the 
deficit the other night 
there he was in about the most solemn setting at a presidents 
command a primetime oval office address only the fourth of 
bushs presidency and he used a phrase more appropriate to a 
bumper sticker 
and now let me tell you what this agreement will not do the 
president said it will not raise income tax rates personal or 
corporate it will not mess with social security in any way 
will not mess with 
brilliant choice of words said ken khachigian a san clemente 
calif lawyer who used to write oval office speeches for richard 
nixon and ronald reagan thats the conversational bush he 
said thats one of the reasons he is doing so well 
no mess was a bad choice said a student of language 
william lutz of rutgers university chairman of the committee on 
public doublespeak of the national council of teachers of english 
the language does not flow from the man it strikes our ear as 
artificial said lutz in a matter of such grave seriousness 
and in a formal address by a president people look for more formal 
language a more elevated tone would have been more appropriate 
if nothing else the issue shows the importance that can be 
attached to every presidential word especially those uttered in 
formal settings 
robin lakoff professor of linguistics at the university of 
california at berkeley thought bushs choice of mess was 
very characteristic of bush hes trying to be a regular guy 
american people like to see their presidents as populists 
said ms lakoff author of talking power the politics of 
language in our lives 
bush is by birth an aristocrat she said so he has to 
spend a whole lot of his energy proving that he isnt 
he used mess as though saying see i empathize with 
you she said i think it is too manipulative to work it 
doesnt work for me on the other hand he has an 80 percent 
popularity rating 
ms lakoff also commented on another phrase in the same speech 
bush said it is the best agreement that can be legislated now 
thats an insiders use of legislated usually legislators 
legislate 
ms lakoff said bush was expressing authority by choosing that 
buzzword 
mess says i talk your language im one of you she 
said legislated says i understand complicated issues i am at 
the hub of where things happen so you can trust me as an 
authority theyre two ways of appealing for trust 
fred mish the dictionary man comes down on bushs side 
its a little offbeat said mish editorial director of 
merriamwebster inc of springfield mass speaking of bushs use 
of legislated he added what he means seems clear enough 
as for mess thus spake mish its sort of an informal 
word in a fairly formal context its quite intentional and 
possibly effective 
if franklin roosevelt had said it it would have been almost 
unbelievable but the nature of public discourse has changed in the 
last 50 years

when grace kelly married monacos 
prince they seemed like lovers favored by the stars in an old 
romantic tale now the oyal family is starting to seem as 
starcrossed as players in an ancient tragedy 
the death wednesday of princess carolines husband stefano 
casiraghi in a speedboat crash added to the pain of a family 
troubled by marital problems and the death of princess grace eight 
years ago 
grace kelly a beautiful american film star married a dashing 
prince rainier in a civil ceremony on april 18 1956 after a 
courtship in his tiny riviera realm 
miss kelly who came from a blueblood philadelphia family 
became her serene highness princess grace she gave up filmmaking 
and bore three children caroline albert and stephanie 
the couple looked down on their debtfree taxfree fully 
employed realm from the royal palace atop le rocher the rock 
which dominates the bay of monaco 
the years passed smoothly although some gossips whispered that 
princess grace grew bored with palace life and spent too much time 
visiting paris 
but the general sentiment was reflected in the words of a 
journalist who wrote on the occasion of the couples silver wedding 
anniversary in 1981 they have been living happily ever after 
the sky fell a year later 
on sept 13 1982 grace and stephanie were traveling a winding 
road from the familys summer residence near la turbie france in 
the hills overlooking monaco 
the automobile failed to negotiate a hairpin turn and tumbled 
down a ravine grace 52 died of a stroke a day later stephanie 
suffered neck injuries and deep emotional stress 
the royal palace has steadfastly maintained that grace drove the 
car although persistent rumors put stephanie behind the wheel at 
the time stephanie was 17 a year too young to drive legally 
graces death plunged the principality into mourning a 
distraught rainier seldom appeared in public for the next four 
years and was said to spend most of his time alone 
stephanie became the familys wild child posing nude for a 
photographer dancing through the night at discotheques and 
modeling swimsuits 
she has been linked romantically to race driver alain prost 
actor rob lowe actor jeanpaul belmondos son paul actor alain 
delons son anthony and the scion of another troubled clan john f 
kennedy jr 
all that was to end when she became engaged to property 
developer jeanyves le fur in april but the wedding announced for 
june never came off no public reason was ever given 
brother albert the heir to the throne strikes a sober 
contrast the 32yearold has worked in business and law and 
represented the nation on the bobsled team in the 1988 winter 
olympics in calgary 
caroline 33 has had troubles beyond the loss of her mother and 
husband 
as the oldest child she attracted enormous attention from 
celebritywatchers when she came into adulthood in the 1970s 
in 1978 caroline married french playboy philippe junot a man 
17 years her senior she later said she married him to rebel 
against her mother who challenged her to marry junot or dump him 
and i think he married just because it was another lark she 
told le figaro magazine it was as stupid as that 
the union ended two years later after several press photos 
showed him in the company of other women 
caroline dated roberto rossellini and tennis star guillermo 
vilas before marrying casiraghi an italian financier in 1983 
the couple led a relatively lowprofile lifestyle and had three 
children andrea charlotte and pierre 
a practicing roman catholic caroline unsuccessfully sought a 
vatican annulment of her first marriage so her children could be 
recognized by the church 
a year after their marriage casiraghi developed a passin for 
the dangerous sport of offshore boat racing in which speeds often 
exceed 125 mph 
casiraghi won the 1989 world championships and was defending his 
title wednesday when his boat struck a wave and flipped killing 
him instantly 
one of his friends italian journalist franco bartolini said 
casiraghi planned to quit the speedboat circuit after this race 
he was going too fast bartolini told reporters i think 
he wanted to go all out one last time at his place at monaco

as carl gillis sees it president bush has a 
problem with hardline antitax people in rural georgia he done 
told us one time he wasnt going to tax i think in the backside of 
their minds there may be a little backlash 
not that gillis is against the president hes a republican 
national committeeman from georgia 
but the people hes talking to the vocal ones are strongly 
opposed to the budget compromise bush is trying to sell to the 
country and congress 
in massachusetts where a fullblown tax revolt is under way 
the compromise also gets a negative reception according to 
republican party chairman ray shamie 
people dont blame the president said shamie they blame 
congress 
as the house moved toward a vote on the outlines of the package 
of tax increases and spending cuts there was a strong sense of 
bipartisan political nervousness around the country 
clearly the most nervous are those in tough political races 
if youre a marginal member of congress this is a 
disaster said democratic pollster celinda lake she described 
the electorate as a very very crabby and unhappy set of 
voters 
she said democrats are in a very hard place and conservative 
republicans are making it harder for democrats 
conservatives like house gop whip newt gingrich of georgia were 
quick to break with the republican president on the budget 
compromises equally swift in putting distance between themselves 
and the package were gop candidates 
reps tom tauke of iowa claudine schneider of rhode island 
lynn martin of illinois and bill schuette of michigan were among 
the first to declare their opposition to the package 
all are republicans all are challenging democratic senators and 
are behind in the polls but remain within striking distance 
rep pat saiki rhawaii was the only gop senate challenger in 
the house who was not flatly opposed to the compromise she also 
was the only one leading her democratic opponent sen daniel 
akaka in the polls 
i think most republicans recognize were in a very difficult 
position said richard schwarm chairman of the iowa republican 
party republicans are truly divided over whether this is the 
best deal possible how it falls out politically i have no way of 
knowing 
in iowa and in neighboring south dakota and nebraska similar 
complaints were heard about the proposed increase in the gasoline 
tax and the higher premiums for medicare as well as cuts in farm 
programs 
but there also was a sense that the country needed to stand 
behind the president in a difficult time 
my feeling is we have to do something said norm riffel the 
nebraska gop chairman we have to share in taking care of this 
deficit 
but candidates were less inclined to be supportive than party 
officials 
former congressman hal daub challenging nebraska democratic 
sen james exon said he was skeptical of the figures included in 
the compromise 
theyre very false numbers he said theyre not 
realworld numbers they have painted far too rosy a scenario 
alabama republican bill cabaniss challenging sen howell 
heflin said the plan was almost guaranteed to drive our economy 
into a recession 
the budget compromise often provided an area of agreement 
between opposing candidates 
sen tom harkin diowa joined with tauke in opposition to the 
plan as did the republican and democratic candidates battling to 
succeed rep bill frenzel rminn who is retiring 
the accord is antigrowth antijobs said republican jim 
ramstad 
another example of politics as usual said democrat lou 
demars 
the people im talking to in the real world dont want tax 
increases said ramstad they are particularly angry with the 
gas tax increase 
lake said higher gasoline taxes were a key element in a 
public sense that the economy is rapidly going downhill 
in a televised appeal for support for the compromise bush urged 
americans tuesday night to call members of congress 
the joke however said rep pete geren dtexas is theyre 
all calling their congressmen a whole lot more than yesterday but 
theyre all calling to say vote against it 
the staff member who answered the telephone in the washington 
office of gingrich laughed when asked if the office was getting a 
lot of calls 
gingrich the no 2 republican in the house was on the budget 
negotiating team but opposed the agreement and refused to 
participate with the president in announcing the settlement 
at 10 oclock this morning in our morrow ga office we had 
143 calls against it and 20 for it and wed only been open since 
nine said the gingrich aide she said the washington office had 
received 91 calls against the budget and 22 for it by the same 
time

president bush is trying to quell regional 
concerns about the 500 billion deficitreduction plan by arguing 
that failure to pass the package will hurt every area of the 
country equally 
im not sure there wont be any adverse effects by one 
provision or another i am totally sure that failure to get a 
deficit deal will adversely affect every region of the country 
the president said wednesday 
bush budget director richard darman and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady briefed regional journalists in an effort to win 
support in the heartland for the package of taxes and spending 
cuts 
bush defended the proposed 12cent increase in gasoline taxes 
which would be phased in over two years against complaints that 
people living in the south and west would be hardest hit because 
they drive more 
i think when you look around at world prices on gasoline i 
mean we are still substantially below world markets the 
president said so i would simply say that it is a tax that 
everybody has to pick up as i said last night some share of the 
burden 
darman argued that certain tax increases would be offset by an 
overall improvement in the nations financial health 
the package hasnt been designed to try to equalize by 
region he said it is also not in my opinion something that 
discriminates by region in a way thats especially preferential to 
one or unfavorable to another 
darman defended the budget negotiators decision to increase the 
tax on home heating oil by 2 cents a gallon a proposal that is 
opposed by new england legislators 
its legitimate and a legitimate worry he said on the 
other hand you cannot say in the end that a package is balanced 
and fair and not have little bits and pieces from almost 
everything and this is one more little bit and piece

the cost of food clothing and medical 
supplies for american troops in the mideast is nearing 600 million 
as the deployment approaches the twomonth mark and begins to 
generate lucrative business for pentagon suppliers 
in the past week alone the pentagon has issued 100 million in 
contracts for meals and new desertstyle suits designed to protect 
troops from deadly chemical weapons 
the deployment of 170000 troops some 7000 miles from the 
united states is a major test for the militarys supply operations 
so far defense department officials say they have filled from 
existing stocks about90 percent of orders from units deployed to 
the middle east 
but major orders already are going to suppliers to rebuild 
inventories and they will have to do so increasingly as the 
deployment drags on 
food clothing and medical supplies are by far the greatest 
needs of the stillgrowing deployment the need to feed troops sent 
so far from home has forced the pentagon to scrap plans to cut 
purchases of the modernday cration meals ready to eat or mre 
and instead spend millions ordering more 
suplly depots also are being called on to supply cots to sleep 
on coolers to protect ice from the heat of the saudi arabia 
desert circuits switches and other parts for radios and other 
equipment exposed to the harsh conditions and thousands of other 
items ranging from nuts and bolts to sunscreen and chigger 
repellant 
at the defense industrial supply center in philadelphia for 
example some 9 million worth of spare parts from washers and 
bearings to heavyduty cable are being supplied for the 
deployment nearly 200 new contracts have been negotiated and 500 
others modified because of the buildup most of them to replenish 
stocks according to center records 
and the defense electronics supply center in dayton ohio has 
processed 22000 orders for goods valued at 67 million for the 
mideast buildup filling 905 percent from depot stocks according 
to its records the center is letting 200 contracts a month to fill 
back orders now totaling 1600 for supplies earmarked for the 
middle east 
the biggest crunch is at the support center that handles orders 
for food clothing and medical supplies which as of tuesday had 
received 47208 requisitions for 563 million worth of goods 
directly related to desert shield the pentagons code name for the 
mideast operation 
those orders were for 558 million in medical supplies 293 
million in food and 214 million in clothing and textiles 
according to records at the philadelphia center 
requested so far by units in and around saudi arabia were nearly 
40 million meals 30 million mres and 78 million servings of hot 
meals packaged in readytoheat trays 
just monday the pentagon awarded two new contracts for mres 
worth more than 52 million the contracts with southern packing 
co of south carolina and cincinnati packaging of ohio were for 
nearly 33 million mres the 3000calories meals served to troops 
when they have no access to hot meals 
those companies assemble and box the meals which on average 
cost the government 370 apiece some of the components are 
supplied by the government others are purchased by the packing 
firms from subcontractors 
also on order are thousands of new desert uniforms and 
protective suits 
last friday the pentagon exercised an option it had with isratex 
inc of west virginia to provide 294550 chemical suits to be made 
with desert camouflage fabric isratex has supplied the suits to

the united states and canada will open 
negotiations next year to dismantle barriers to free and open 
competition in the skies between the airlines of the two nations 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner said the talks could 
result in an unprecedented deregulation of air traffic across 
international borders and add up to 2 million passengers a year to 
what is already the worlds largest aviation market 
skinner and canadian transport minister doug lewis made the 
announcement in a joint statement issued simultaneously in 
washington and toronto on wednesday 
skinner told reporters that all aspects of air service between 
the two nations will be up for discussion when the talks begin in 
early 1991 
lewis said negotiators will explore the possibility of creating 
an open regime 
the goal airlines from each country would be allowed to operate 
between any point in one country and any point in the other as well 
as between points in the other country 
skinner said the possibility of permitting canadian airlines to 
open hubs in the united states and american air carriers to open 
hubs in canada also will be on the table 
in their statement skinner and lewis noted that the current 
aviation agreement between the two countries has remained basically 
unchanged since 1974 they said it is now out of step with the 
transportation needs of canada and the us 
we want an aviation market in which the flow of goods and 
services would be unimpedd by governmental economic regulation 
the two officials said 
skinner noted that the two countries have already deregulated 
their domestic airline industries and said that fact should make it 
easier to deregulate air service across their common border 
the united states and canada signed a freetrade agreement in 
1988 and skinner said that created a totally new economic 
atmosphere and the opportunity to expand and deregulate air links 
we will basically take down the barriers that exist he 
said 
about 13 million passengers fly between canada and the united 
states each year producing annual revenue of more than 2 billion 
us airlines carry about twothirds of the scheduled traffic 
about 11 million passengers a year while almost all of the charter 
passengers about 2 million a year are carried by canadian 
airlines 
skinner said growth of the uscanadian air market has been 
sluggish in recent years because of the restrictions the two 
countries impose to limit the numbers of air carriers and flights 
the national transportation policy announced by skinner earlier 
this year calls for improving access to international markets for 
us airlines the transportation secretary said the uscanada 
air negotiations will mark a good first step toward that objective 
tom lydon a lawyer for the air transport association the 
principal trade group of us airlines said member carriers 
generally support the new negotiations in part because the present 
air service treaty with canada is one of the more restrictive 
of all such international agreements 
for example only one airline from each country may operate on 
any route and us carriers would like to serve more cities in 
canada regardless of how many companies are doing so already he 
said

markus wolf the late east germanys spymaster of 
legend is reported to have fled to the soviet union but his 
successor was arrested hours after the two germanys became one 
for weeks officials have been debating what to do with the 
spies from east germanys hardline communist regime who routinely 
infiltrated west germany during the cold war era plans for an 
amnesty were rejected 
when unification came on wednesday the spies became fair game 
for federal prosecutors eager to bring them to justice east 
germany had about 8000 spies but officials say fewer than 50 
arrest warrants have been issued 
wolf is by far the biggest fish among them 
an urbane espionage wizard who gained the grudging respect of 
his western foes wolf left behind tales of intrigue before 
retiring in 1987 
as the struggling east german communists sought to hang on to 
power last fall wolf claimed he wanted to help reform the 
government 
prodemocracy figures mocked him citing his role as a central 
figure in the communists wellmaintained spy and secret police 
apparatus 
since then wolf has apparently lived off and on near moscow 
writing his memoirs in the relatively safe haven there 
in todays editions the masscirculation bild newspaper of 
hamburg quoted the new germanys chief prosecutor alexander von 
stahl as saying wolf was probably in the soviet union right 
now 
von stahl told berlins rias television on wednesday that he had 
received a letter from wolf 
he wrote to me and said he wanted to avoid arrest von stahl 
said adding he still plans to try to apprehend wolf 
ard television also said that wolf had fled as had hansjoachim 
tiedge a longtime east german spy in bonn who fled to east berlin 
in 1985 
according to bild wolf contacted the federal prosecutors 
office through his lawyer last week indicating he would turn 
himself in expecting to receive clemency 
one of wolfs major coups as head of the former east german spy 
network was the planting of top agent guenther guillaume as a close 
aide to thenwest german chancellor willy brandt 
when guillaumes true identity was revealed in april 1974 an 
embarrassed brandt took full responsibility for the grave security 
breach and resigned 
wolf was replaced by werner grossmann who was arrested on 
wednesday in the eastern side of berlin 
the chief federal prosecutors spokesman hansjuergen foerster 
said investigators originally went to grossmanns home early 
wednesday to arrest him but he was not home he was there when 
they returned in the afternoon 
grossmann was the last spy chief in the nowdissolved east 
germany

the judge considering a federal 
conflictofinterest case against neil bush says he didnt 
prejudice the case by calling it a pain because his remarks 
didnt favor either side 
but some legal experts said this week that administrative law 
judge daniel j davidson went against professional ethics by 
talking to reporters about the case against the presidents son 
in two newspaper interviews published before a public hearing on 
regulators charges against bush davidson called the savings and 
loan case a pain a political football and one of the 
minor ones from a legal standpoint 
stephen gillers a law professor at new york university called 
davidsons remarks illadvised 
you dont want the judge to become a player the judge is 
first of all a neutral gillers said judges shouldnt comment on 
cases outside of court because the publics confidence in the 
process becomes compromised he said 
the usual practice is that judges dont give interviews 
said nahum litt the chief administrative law judge at the labor 
department 
normally he said administrative law judges tell reporters 
seeking interviews to call an official spokesman of the federal 
agency where the judge works 
court judges rarely speak publicly about pending cases 
administrative law judges who interpret federal law and 
regulations enforced by the agencies for which they work are 
generally expected to follow the same standards as other judges 
i am not infallible davidson told the associated press on 
tuesday 
he said he may have breached ethical standards by making the 
statements to the reporters but that he spoke to them because 
im a nice guy 
shame on me for not hanging up the telephone davidson 
joked 
he said his remarks didnt compromise the case because they 
didnt indicate that he leans one way or the other 
davidson who has been an administrative law judge for 22 years 
wont make a binding ruling in the case he will recommend to the 
director of the office of thrift supervision what sanctions if 
any should be imposed on bush 
bush 35 an oil and gas developer in denver could be barred 
from the banking and savings industry 
he has been accused of conflict of interest in his role as a 
director of silverado banking savings and loan association of 
denver which collapsed in late 1988 several months after bush 
resigned from the thrift the failure is expected to cost taxpayers 
1 billion 
the ots alleges bush failed to adequately inform fellow 
silverado directors of his business ties with two developers who 
eventually defaulted on more than 132 million in silverado loans 
this one is going to be a pain davidson told the new york 
times in a story published sept 25 the day the bush hearing began 
in denver its a political football and i dont get involved in 
politics 
a day earlier in the denver post davidson was quoted as saying 
the case had received public attention only because bush is a son 
of the president and that from a legal standpoint it is one of 
the minor ones 
ots spokesman tom mason and bushs attorney james nesland 
declined comment on davidsons statements as did american bar 
association spokesman robert evans 
bush testified last thursday in a combative threehour 
appearance insisting that his actions as a silverado director 
involved no conflict 
davidson showed a feisty sometimes humorous style at the 
hearing scolding bush several times for interrupting the 
government attorney and making judgments from the witness stand 
that should be made by the judge 
please dont try to decide what questions are proper 
davidson told bush ill do that ok 
davidson 56 first served as an administrative law judge at the 
interstate commerce commission he now works for the food and drug 
administration but has been loaned out to other federal 
agencies 
the office of personnel management chose davidson to preside 
over the bush proceeding and his selection was approved by the ots 
the model code of judicial conduct for federal administrative 
law judges states 
an administrative law judge should abstain from public comment 
about a pending or impending proceeding before a judge in any 
agency in which the judge serves and should require similar 
abstention on the part of agency personnel subject to the judges 
direction and control

a prominent physicians organization and the 
us surgeon general accuse the tobacco industry of being 
irresponsible by the unconscionable targeting of women in 
cigarette advertising 
tobacco companies must stop encouraging young women to smoke 
cigarettes the american college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists said wednesday the health of women and of our 
future generations demand at least that much consideration 
surgeon general antonia novello said at a news conference that 
pregnant women who smoke are more likely to have miscarriages 
premature deliveries and lowbirthweight babies smoking is 
responsible for about 4000 infant deaths in the united states each 
year she said 
let no woman be deceived novello said tobacco is an 
addictive and deadly drug it leaves its sinister mark across the 
entire physiological landscape hypertension bronchitis chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease heart disease and cancer 
the obgyn group said more than 126000 women die each year from 
smokingrelated disorders and that smoking causes 75 percent of 
lung cancer cases about 27 percent of american women smoke it 
said 
it is irresponsible for tobacco companies to single out women 
especially educationally or otherwise disadvantaged women and 
encourage them to smoke the organization said in a statement 
tobacco companies must stop encouraging young women to smoke 
cigarettes it said the health of women and of our future 
generations demand at least that much consideration 
thomas lauria of the tobacco institute representing cigarette 
manufacturers said in response we are pointing out its 1990 
and to segregate women as being incapable of making the same 
choices as men about an adult consumer product seems 
paternalistic 
george gross executive vice president for the magazine 
publishers association said magazines support commercial free 
speech the advertising of a legal product 
dr ezra c davidson president of the physicians group said 
the most vulnerable women are teenagers who have limited 
understanding of the health risks of smoking 
the magazines they read extol the glamour of cigarette smoking 
in the advertising and the advertising revenue very often makes the 
magazines reluctant to publish the other side the side that warns 
of miscarriages low birthweight stillbirths lung cancer heart 
attacks and the many other deadly results of the cigarette habit 
davidson said 
dr virginia ernster of the university of california medical 
school in san francisco said tobacco companies have dealt women a 
low blow 
their advertising is fictitious she said it associates 
female smoking with images of physical fitness and independence 
the reality of smoking for women is often quite different 
addiction and death she said the ads suggest that women who 
smoke are in control but it is actually the women in our society 
who have the least going for them in terms of income education and 
jobs who are the most likely to smoke

the childhood death rate in parts of the world 
where malnutrition is common can be cut in half by giving underfed 
children 2 worth of vitamin a annually according to a study 
released today 
doctors who conducted the study in india gave children the same 
amount of vitamin a that they would get in a healthy diet with 
dramatic results according to the study published in the new 
england journal of medicine 
the study was conducted by dr laxmi rahmathullah and colleagues 
from aravind childrens hospital in madurai india the united 
nations estimates that 20 million to 40 million children have at 
least mild vitamin a deficiency and nearly half of them live in 
india 
in an accompanying editorial dr gerald t keusch of new 
england medical center called the results positive impressive 
and convincing but said the 2 pricetag still might be too high 
for impoverished nations 
it is time that the international community did something more 
about this than talk he wrote 
the study was conducted on 15419 preschool children in southern 
india they were randomly selected to receive vitamins a and e or 
vitamin e alone 
during the oneyear study 125 children died but the risk of 
death among those taking vitamin a was only half that of those who 
got vitamin e alone 
the vitamin a appeared to reduce the risk of dying from diarrhea 
or other infections in malnourished children 
an earlier study conducted in indonesia reached similar 
conclusions

sen john mccain says hes frustrated with the 
slow pace of an investigation of his and four colleagues efforts 
to help political donor charles h keating jr when his savings and 
loan was failing 
mccain an arizona republican was asked to appear beoore the 
senate ethics committee today to explain why he joined the four 
other senators to intervene with us banking regulators on 
keatings behalf 
sen john glenn dohio appeared before the committee wednesday 
in a closed session the first of the five asked to testify 
congressional sources insisting on anonymity have confirmed 
that committee special counsel robert s bennett proposed that the 
investigation of mccain and glenn be dropped 
bennett recommended the investigation go forward against 
democratic sens alan cranston of california donald w riegle jr 
of michigan and dennis deconcini of arizona the sources said the 
three are expected to meet with the committee individually next 
week 
glenn met with the ethics committee for 2 hours and said 
afterward i survived i appreciated very much the fact that the 
committee would take the time to discuss this whole issue with me 
which we did there was adequate time to present everything 
he would not discuss the substance of the meeting committee 
vice chairman warren rudman rnh said there was no committee 
decision in glenns case nor would any action be taken on mccain 
today 
mccain said wednesday i am frustrated by the lack of progress 
and i see no reason for delay now that the special counsel has made 
his recommendations 
the five senators received a total of 13 million for their 
campaigns and political causes from keating and his associates all 
five have said they were trying to ensure that keating was treated 
fairly by regulators they said their contacts with the regulators 
were not motivated by the donations 
keatings irvine califbased lincoln savings and loan was 
taken over by the federal government in may 1989 and its losses 
may cost taxpayers more than 2 billion keating has been indicted 
on state criminal fraud charges in california 
bennett submitted his recommendations on sept 10 to the 
committee which announced its preliminary investigation on dec 
22 1989 
one republican congressional source insisting on anonymity 
said there was concern among senate gop members that any failure to 
act quickly on bennetts recommendations would be seen as 
absolutely totally political 
mccain is the only republican among the five and if his case 
was dropped before the election only democratic senators would be 
under a senate ethics investigation for their roles in the savings 
and loan crisis 
this could be a counterpoint to a possible move by democrats to 
make an issue of conflictofinterest allegations against the 
presidents son neil bush for actions he took as a board member 
of a failed thrift in denver 
ethics committee members have declined to comment on any aspect 
of the investigation including their timetable since receiving 
bennetts report 
mccain in the past has pointed out that lincolns parent 
company american continental corp was based in phoenix and has 
said i did nothing that i wouldnt do for any major employer or 
economic factor in my state 
the arizona republican received 112000 in campaign 
contributions from keating and associates and said he would return 
the money if it was found to have been diverted from lincoln more 
than a third of the money was donated while mccain was a member of 
the house including contributions that preceded keatings purchase 
of lincoln 
in may and june 1989 mccain paid back 13433 to american 
continental for the cost of nine corporate and charter jet flights 
the senator and his family took to the bahamas in keating planes 
from 198486 
the trips were not disclosed at the time by mccain then a 
member of the house mccain said his failure to pay for the trips 
earlier was a serious error but it doesnt mean i did anything 
improper for charles keating

the house has given final congressional

court decision that allowed employers to limit job benefits for 
older workers 
the house voted 40617 wednesday to approve the same version of 
legislation passed by the senate on sept 24 
it now goes to the white house for president bushs signature 
the supreme court held in a 1989 ruling that employee benefits 
were not afforded protection under the age discrimination in 
employment act of 1967

the high courts decision went against lawmakers intent when they 
passed the landmark age discrimination bill 23 years ago

court ruling more than two years ago in a case pitting june betts

the drug enforcement administration seized 
more than 1 billion in cash and other assets from drug traffickers 
in the fiscal year that ended sunday says agency chief robert c 
bonner 
reaching the 1 billion mark shows that dea has been quite 
aggressive in stripping drug traffickers of their illgotten gains 
the proceeds of their illegal activities bonner said 
the 1025 billion seized according to preliminary figures for 
fiscal 1990 was far higher than the deas budget of 5487 million 
for that year bonner said it represented a 44 percent increase 
over the 9791 million in assets seized by the dea the previous 
year 
but bonner said in an interview tuesday that the seizures wont 
help defray the federal budget deficit just yet the assets must 
first be forfeited which can take years

at about the same time philippine soldiers 
began a rebellion on the southern island of mindanao a us 
admiral was expressing concern to congress over attitudes within 
the countrys military 
since a coup attempt in december 1989 said rear adm m a 
mcdevitt it has become apparent that some philippine officers want 
to take roles that transcend defense and security 
mcdevitt speaking for the pentagon testified wednesday 
afternoon before the house asian affairs subcommittee he was 
joined by committee members and other bush administration officials 
in reiterating warnings that any military overthrow of president 
corazon aquino would bring an immediate cutoff of all us aid 
he spoke shortly after mutinous soldiers seized an army base and 
the city of butuan on mindanao at 1 am local time noon in 
washington military leaders in manila apparently remained loyal to 
the government however and said they were taking steps to isolate 
the uprising 
a military takeover would only compound not alleviate 
current problems and frustrations mcdevitt said in written 
testimony submitted to the committee it would not be as some 
suggest a short cut to solutions and reforms but rather a short 
cut to disaster 
mcdevitt summarized his testimony for the hearing and answered 
questions from the panel 
he said there is no hard evidence of serious plotting among 
leading elements of the philippine military and discounted 
speculation in manila of a possible constitutional coup in 
which top brass would back a bloodless overthrow of mrs aquino 
even that kind of overthrow said mcdevitt would require a 
total aid cutoff under us law 
however he said that has not deterred the plotters from 
moving twice in the past and therefore probably would not be a 
pivotal factor in any future decision to launch another coup 
attempt 
mcdevitt said soldiers attempts to influence issues that go 
beyond their traditional role seem now to be an established 
feature of the philippine political landscape 
we continue to hope and to emphasize that the military use its 
voice wisely and responsibly and continue to reject radical action 
as a short cut to social economic and military reform he said 
in other testimony officials said the philippines continues to 
lag behind in using foreign aid but problems facing the country 
require more rather than less assistance 
congress has been cutting president bushs aid requests to the 
country which is struggling to overcome devastation from a strong 
earthquake drought and flooding and has been rocked by the persian 
gulf crisiss impact on oil prices and overseas filipino workers 
remittances 
carole adelman assistant administrator of the agency for 
international development said 40 million remains uncommitted 
from the firstyear us contribution to a multinational aid plan 
and the pipeline of unspent aid to the philippines from all sources 
totals about 500 million dollars 
she said however that much of the backlog is understandable 
because of the windfall 35 billion dollars pledged under the 
multilateral assistance initiative which is in addition to aid 
tied to the us bases and other bilateral assistance

in what was seen as a vote of 
support for president fernando collor de mello conservatives led 
or won most races in nationwide congressional and gubernatorial 
elections exit polls indicated 
but polls also indicated that about 12 percent of brazils 83 
million voters cast blank ballots wednesday to protest collors 
harsh economic policies and to express a general sentiment that 
politicians are not serving the people 
final results will not be known for more than a week however 
exit surveys indicated conservatives had captured at least eight of 
27 gubernatorial races and a majority of senate and house seats 
the farright liberal front party which won only one 
governorship in 1985 won in five states on wednesday collors 
tiny national reconstruction party made gains across the country 
including the governorship in collors home state of alagoas in 
northern brazil 
besides the governorships in all 26 states and the capital 
district of brasilia all 503 seats in the federal house of 
representatives and 31 of 81 senate spots were at stake 
runoffs will be held nov 25 if no gubernatorial candidate 
receives 50 percent of the vote a majority is not required in 
other races 
voting is mandatory in brazil and from the southern pampas to 
the northern amazon jungle voters lined up to cast ballots 
troops patrolled many areas to ensure peaceful voting the first 
since december when collor became the countrys first popularly 
elected president since 1960 
the military gave up power in 1985 after ruling the country by 
dictatorship for 19 years 
collor cast his ballot before cheering residents in his home 
city of maceio 1400 miles northeast of rio 
we have shown with this election that our democracy is stable 
and consolidated the 40yearold president said 
local issues largely prevailed in the election campaigns but 
analysts said the vote was an important indicator of collors 
popularity 
there has been growing resentment of his economic austerity 
plan which aims to halt annual inflation of nearly 5000 percent 
but brazils left appeared unable to capitalize on the discontent 
city streets were littered with pamphlets and streamers when the 
polls closed but the election fervor that marked last years 
presidential vote was absent in major states polls showed that 
most voters did not even know who the congressional candidates 
were 
politicians show up in the slums the day before the election 
and throw a few barbecue parties to get votes then do nothing for 
the next four years said machine operator joao alves filho 34 
as he stood in a voting line in rios middleclass district of vila 
isabela 
he said he would cast a blank ballot 
in sao paulo the top electoral prize with almost 19 million 
voters rightist paulo maluf of the social democrats the official 
party of the former military regime led the gubernatorial race 
with 42 percent of the vote 
leftists won governorships outright in just two states in rio 
de janeiro and in the northern state of ceara according to exit 
polls by the brazilian institute of public opinion and statistics 
the militant socialist workers party nearly captured decembers 
presidential election and had been seen as a growing force in 
brazilian politics but it faded dramatically in this campaign 
only in one gubernatorial race in the farwestern amazon state 
of acre was a workers party candidate close to the lead and even 
there he is expected to face a runoff 
in remote areas a number of elderly voters traveled miles by 
canoe mule and horseback to reach regional electoral centers 
ballot boxes are delivered by mules and the vote count is mainly 
done by hand 
the new congress will meet on feb 3 1991 the winners in the 
governors races take office on march 15

gathered with her cabinet senior military officers and congressmen 
at the presidential palace 
im calling once again on the people to rally against these 
troublemakers mrs aquino said on the radio the constitution 
will be upheld with force when challenged with force 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa said the mutiny 
appeared a secessionist move and vowed to do whatever is 
necessary to prevent any dismemberment of this republic 
officials said about 200 rebels launched the revolt about 1 
am seizing the 402nd brigade army base in butuan about 500 
miles south of manila flights to mindanao were canceled and 
schools on the island closed 
the rebels later moved into cagayan de oro 70 miles west of 
butuan 
manila radio station dzxl interviewed their leader renegade 
col alexander noble at the regional national police headquarters 
in cagayan de oro 
this shows that the free mindanao movement is not just 
propaganda noble told reporters at camp evangelista 
in the city of iligan just west of cagayan de oro loyalist 
troops secured government buildings and blocked roads to the nearby 
military camp after residents said a rebel helicopter had hovered 
overhead and urged troops to join the mutiny the residents said 
government planes chased the helicopter away 
national security adviser rafael ileto said that the rebels hope 
to establish a secessionist government on mindanao then move up 
north 
there have been rumors that a coup attempt was brewing in the 
region for nearly six months 
military sources said the mutineers were planning to stage 
pocket rebellions in remote areas of the country before 
striking in the capital 
mrs aquino has survived six coup attempts since she took office 
in february 1986 in the most recent attempt in december rebels 
seized manilas financial district in bloody fighting and nearly 
toppled the government more than 100 people were killed 
also thursday a bomb exploded outside a manila army base three 
hours after the mindanao base was taken there were no injuries 
it was the 35th explosion in the capital since august officials 
see the bombings as the work of military officers hoping to 
destabilize the country 
de villa said soldiers from the 53rd infantry battalion one of 
the units at the 402nd brigade organized the takeover about 3000 
soldiers are based at the brigade 
the brigades commanding officer col hercules galon 
apparently escaped the rebel soldiers said a military spokesman 
brig gen emiliano templo but later templo said galon may have 
joined the rebels 
templo said the dissidents cut off communication lines from 
butuan and officials in manila were relying on commercial radio 
stations and the military regional headquarters in cagayan de oro 
de villa said he called commanding officers of various camps 
around the country and was assured of their loyalty 
i think this is small thing and we can control this de 
villa said in a radio interview we wish to inform the public 
that the armed forces is united except for this breakaway group 
we are in control of all units in manila and the entire country 
templo said there were no plans to send troops from luzon the 
main island to reinforce government forces on mindanao 
we are guarding against the possibility that this butuan 
incident has a second part in another part of the country that we 
are not aware of de villa said we are just taking 
precautions 
rumors of a new coup plot in recent months have suggested that 
military dissidents would seize strongpoints in the south to draw 
government forces out of manila then start a new uprising there 
the bomb thursday exploded at a water pumping station at the 
philippine army headquarters in manila de villa said there were 
no injuries 
de villa appealed to the mutineers to surrender 
i just want to tell them that this uprising is a big mistake 
and may endanger our civilians de villa said what they did is 
something that cannot be supported by our civilains and the 
majority of the armed forces of the philippines 
dont allow our armed forces to be divided think it over 
because there is still time he said 
since august government troops had been chasing noble in the 
jungles of agusan del sur province south of butuan 
noble was involved in the december coup and escaped to mindanao 
where he organized a private army

bertha lindsay the last eldress of the 
shakers a celibate religious sect that promoted communal living 
and pacifism for more than 200 years has died she was 93 
lindsay who died wednesday was one of the last members of the 
religion that once boasted 6000 members in 24 communities one 
woman in her 90s remains in canterbury once home to 400 shaker 
residents fewer than 10 live in maine able to add to their ranks 
only by taking in orphans or converts shaker spiritual leaders 
decided to halt new membership in 1965 but lindsay often said the 
movements beliefs would not die with the last shakers 
mother ann lee who brought the religion to the united 
states in the 1774 prophesied that ultimately shakers would 
diminish to as many as a child could count on one hand and then 
there would be a revival of the spirit lindsay once said 
lindsay born july 28 1897 in braintree mass died nearly 2 
years after eldress gertrude soule who also lived at shaker 
village in canterbury 
only 94yearold sister ethel hudson remains in the new 
hampshire village a small community in sabbathday lake maine 
includes five pre1965 members and at least three admitted 
afterward despite the decision by canterbury leaders 
the religion originated in england in the 1770s as the shaking 
quakers and grew under lees leadership she who moved to new york 
in 1774 with eight followers the community in canterbury was 
founded in the 1780s 
the shakers formally the united society of believers in 
christs second appearing gained their nickname from trembling 
brought on by religious fervor they advocated living apart from 
society at large in communal villages 
everyone was considered equal and shaker government offered 
women leadership roles little known in the 19th and early 20th 
centuries two eldresses and two elders formed the ministry that 
made decisions for the society 
lindsay said she believed lees prophesy that shaker beliefs 
would gain broader acceptance 
it wouldnt be called shakers she said they wouldnt 
live in communities but it would be worldwide felt and known and 
we think that is coming to pass 
as evidence lindsay noted that more visitors come to shaker 
village every year including many from europe they view exhibits 
of the efficient homespun handicrafts and furniture that made 
shakers famous including creations like the flat broom clothespin 
and ladderback chairs 
lindsay came to canterbury in 1905 as an orphan orphans taken 
in by the shakers had to decide at age 21 whether to take a vow of 
celibacy and remain in the community or leave 
i had studied the laws and regulations of the church and felt 
this was the life for me lindsay said i could give as much 
here as i could anywhere else in the world and could have more 
friends both men and women if i had gone into the world and 
married i wouldnt have had that it has been a busy active 
life and a wonderful experience 
when she turned 90 lindsay lost her sight and put her energies 
into recording her life story and memories of shaker life 
i want people to know we did have fun and plenty of it she 
said 
lindsay is survived by a niece at lindsays request no funeral 
will be held but a memorial service will be held at an unspecified

prostitution has been banned at mustang ranch 
americas bestknown legal brothel by county officials who are 
tired of its notoriety 
the prohibition leaves no room for the internal revenue service 
to sell the 105room 440acre ranch as a working bordello when it 
goes up for auction to pay the longtime owners tax debt estimated 
at 13 million 
the storey county commission decided tuesday to make 
prostitution illegal in the area of the county where the mustang is 
located leaving in the clear a nearby brothel 
commissioners stressed they remain in favor of legal 
prostitution in nevada but rezoned the mustang because of the 
circus surrounding it for 35 years 
it just wouldnt look good for storey county commissioner 
karl larson said 
the mustangs owners joe and sally conforte had tried 
unsuccessfully to sell the ranch they filed for liquidation sept 
18 and federal bankruptcy trustees assumed management of the 
mustang 
the trustees had expected to operate the ranch as a brothel to 
pay off creditors but us bankruptcy judge james thompson said 
the only creditor of significance was the irs so he turned the 
mustang over to the agency sept 21 to dispose of as it wished 
irs spokeswoman norma lally said wednesday she did not know 
whether the commission action would affect bidding at the auction 
the irs said it will let the buyer decide what to do with the 
property 
the agency is making an inventory of the brothel and its 
contents the auction is at least one to two months away lally 
said 
the county commissions action gives confortes nephew david 
burgess a monopoly in the countys brothel business at the old 
bridge ranch next to the mustang 
larson said the county would more than double burgess 30000 
annual license fee to make up for lost revenue from the mustang 
burgess wife ingrid manager and coowner of the old bridge 
ranch said business is booming 
its been very busy here ever since the mustang shut down we 
have all the girls over here we can hold she said i think 
its sad a lot of people have lost their jobs there is nothing 
wrong with a little competition

for the us currency in 14 months 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
fell 57120 points or 256 percent to 2227819 points it had

day 
in bond dealings the yield of the benchmark 10year government 
bond fell to 8290 percent down from 8310 percent on wednesday 
the price rose to 8240 yen up from 8232 yen on wednesday 
currency traders said the dollar weakened after us federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan said wednesday that the proposed 
us budget would almost certainly depress interest rates 
greenspan told a congressional committee that failure to approve 
the budgets 500 billion deficitreduction package would be a 
grave mistake with serious consequences for an already weakened 
us economy 
the market seems to have reached a floor at 135 yen to the 
dollar however said hiroyuki yamaguchi at commerz bank ag 
there seems to be a lot of buying orders at 135 i think maybe we 
will not see 134 for the rest of this week he said 
the recovery on the stock market shortcovering and pessimism 
about lower interest rates in the united states are moving the 
dollaryen exchange said masato hayashi chief customer dealer for 
the bank of tokyo 
every morning we see a much lower level so every day at 
first people try to sell then there are more buyers until the 
dollar reaches the high from outside markets then the dollar 
falls again he said 
the dollar probably already has hit its high for the day he 
said 
stock traders cited higher oil prices and an overnight fall on 
the new york stock market as reasons for the falling nikkei 
average 
basically i think what we are seeing is a fair amount of 
profit taking said steve usher of kleinwort benson 
international inc tuesdays record surge left people 
confused but the basic sentiment is still depressed because of 
poor fundamentals and uncertainty in the externals he said

a black record store owner 
convicted of obscenity for selling a sexually explicit album by the 
black rap group 2 live crew says the allwhite jury doesnt 
represent my community 
its unfair the jury was all white they dont know where ec 
records is they dont know a goddamned thing about the ghetto 
charles freeman yelled to reporters after he was convicted 
wednesday 
critics of the rap group hailed the verdict as a milestone in 
the battle against material they consider obscene the music 
industry and civil libertarians decried it as censorship 
2 live crew and its album as nasty as they wanna be have 
been at the center of a first amendment dispute since june 6 when 
a federal judge deemed obscene lyrics that include references to 
sodomy and sexual intercourse some also have objected to the 
lyrics as violent and degrading to women 
the jury of five women and one man took only 2 hours to return 
the verdict against freeman 31 on a misdemeanor charge jurors 
later declined to discuss their decision 
its the first time in musical history that a piece of work 
has been found to be obscene said trish heimers spokeswoman for 
the recording industry association of america a washingtonbased 
trade association for us record companies 
i would most certainly characterize this as censorship she 
said 
donald wildmon founder of the conservative american family 
association based in tupelo miss said the conviction is a sign 
of a national trend against obscenity and pornography 
theres definitely a shift in attitudes in america about this 
kind of trash he said 
luther campbell leader of 2 live crew said he wasnt surprised 
by the verdict 
i had figured that the guy would be found guilty based on the 
jury that was chosen campbell said in a statement the 
community standards in the black area and white area are completely 
different 
campbell and two other members of the rap group face trial 
tuesday on charges of performing obscene material at a nightclub 
show in nearby hollywood broward county judge paul backman set 
freemans sentencing for nov 2 the conviction carries a possible 
oneyear jail sentence and 1000 fine 
freemans trial was the first jury test of us district judge 
jose gonzalezs ruling that the groups lyrics were obscene 
the us supreme courts legal test for obscenity asks whether 
the dominant theme of the work appeals to prurient interest in sex 
whether the work is patently offensive based on contemporary 
community standards and whether the work lacks serious artistic or 
political value 
gonzalez banned the sale of the album in three south florida 
counties including broward county shortly after the decision 
sales of the 2yearold album approached 2 million nationwide 
freeman whose legal expenses are being paid by the american 
civil liberties union was arrested two days after the federal 
ruling when he sold the album to undercover police officers at his 
fort lauderdale store 
freemans attorneys said they would appeal 
its clear that the jury is not from the black community or 
familiar with the community that this record comes from said 
bruce rogow a lawyer for freeman this music was like a foreign 
country to them 
prosecutors said cultural differences did not influence the 
jurys decision 
i dont think race is a factor said leslie robson the lead 
prosecutor the jury paid very close attention to the evidence 
they came back with a verdict that spoke the truth 
defense attorneys had objected to the makeup of the 35member 
jury pool which included only one black whose name was not picked 
when a dozen names were drawn at random as the final group of 
prospective jurors 
the group will not change its music despite the result of 
freemans trial and the upcoming trial of three of its members 
said david hobbs the groups disc jockey 
we feel that we have to do what we have to do and thats to 
make the same records that weve been making he said thats 
it

the source of a suspected salmonella outbreak 
among nearly 300 conventioneers remained a mystery today as two 
dozen hit hardest by the food poisoning recovered in a hospital 
eightfive people attending the annual true value hardware 
stores convention were sickened wednesday after a group of 200 
reported symptoms monday said mike mccarthy a spokesman for the 
chicago health department 
it would certainly seem to be a salmonella problem he said 
at this particular time we have not determined what substance 
may have been the agent 
both groups were poisoned by the same tainted food despite the 
delay in reactions mccarthy said 
these people either had original symptoms that declined and 
then flared up again or they did not go for examination or 
treatment originally he said 
ambulances carried the victims to hospitals wednesday said 
randi killian spokeswoman for the midamerica chapter of the 
american red cross twentyfour people were admitted at grant 
hospital and most were listed in fair condition spokeswoman pat 
leck said 
health officials inspected the kitchens at the hyatt 
regencychicago where conventioneers shared a buffet dinner sunday 
night but no tainted food was found and kitchens were allowed to 
remain open 
authorities also were checking into a meal served monday at the 
headquarters of true values parent firm cotter amp co mccarthy 
said 
preliminary results of laboratory tests showed that 10 patients 
admitted at grant earlier this week suffered from salmonella 
poisoning said ginny sharp another hospital spokeswoman 
symptoms of the contamination by the salmonella bacteria include 
nausea vomiting diarrhea and fever sufferers must take care to 
avoid dehydration mccarthy said

mayor david dinkins wants to free more police 
officers to confront street and subway crime by having firefighters 
and city ambulance workers respond to more emergency calls without 
police accompaniment 
the proposal is part of dinkins 18 billion safe streets 
safe city program to hire nearly 8000 new police officers after 
a summer of stinging criticism about the citys escalating 
violence 
new yorkers placed 83 million 911 calls last year the most of 
any city in the nation and officials estimate that police officers 
spent 90 percent of their time answering 42 million of those 
calls 
more than 2 million were crank calls or incidents that were 
resolved by the time police arrived the police department said 
the loadsharing proposal would let firefighters and emergency 
medical services ambulances respond to about 450000 medical calls 
and nonresidential fires where there is no need for police no 
crime has been committed police spokesman michael amarosa said 
wednesday 
police commissioner lee brown wants more officers on the 
streets a cornerstone of the plan is to keep the number of 911 
calls that police respond to at 42 million a year for the next few 
years 
we cant control the input the 911 call amarosa said 
what theyre looking to stabilize is the 42 million radio 
runs 
police dont want to be 911driven amarosa said 
it is also hoped that the high visibility of the additional 
officers will encourage people to report incidents to officers 
directly rather than relying on 911

the soviet unions top general preached 
peace and urged expanded eastwest cooperation in europe in a 
speech he delivered during a us tour with his pentagon 
counterpart 
gen mikhail moiseyev chief of the soviet general staff said 
wednesday his country is reducing its military forces in europe in 
reaction to the end of the cold war symbolized by german 
unification 
europe has used up the allotted limit of wars and human 
losses moiseyev told about 1000 people at a dinner at the 
fairmont hotel it can no longer be looked upon as a potential 
theater of war 
moiseyev toured us military installations in five states with 
army gen colin powell chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff 
his speech wednesday was his first during the tour 
moiseyev is the highestranking soviet military officer to visit 
the united states since marshall sergei akhromeyev met with 
thensecretary of defense frank carlucci in december 1987 
since then however the face of eastwest relations has changed 
drastically with the fall last year of communist governments 
throughout eastern europe and continuing reforms in the soviet 
union 
speaking through an interpreter moiseyev said the mission of 
nato needs to be reevaluated because the threat of war between the 
superpowers has been reduced dramatically 
who are nato members training to fight against in europe he 
asked in our view the key to establishing a system of 
collective security on the european continent lies in eliminating 
the standoff of military blocs 
noting the official joining of the postworld war ii german 
nations wednesday he said the question of europes future 
security is inseparably linked with the unification of the two 
german states 
the soviet leadership stands for setting up a new alleuropean 
security system a united europe of peace and cooperation he 
said 
soviet military strength has been reduced by 300000 servicemen 
he said 
in the european zone alone we have reduced our strength by 
20000 tanks 24000 artillery pieces over 860 combat aircraft 
and 40 warships moiseyev said 
in 1991 the soviet forces will completely be withdrawn from 
hungary and czechoslovakia and in the near future from germany and 
poland 
powell introduced moiseyev to the gathering sponsored by the san 
francisco chamber of commerce world affairs council and the 
commonwealth club 
moiseyev began by saying the postwar epoch has ended and is 
being replaced by a new world that would shape the makeup of this 
planet for many years to come 
this new world cannot be seen in its entirety yet he said 
but part of it is undergoing severe testing in the crisis 
situation in the middle east

the house is nearing approval of an anticrime 
bill that would expand the use of the death penalty but it first 
must choose between two plans designed to shorten delays in 
carrying out executions 
we who are the lawmakers believe that when the death penalty 
is meted out it should be done fairly but it should be done 
expeditiously rep jack buechner rmo said wednesday as 
debate got under way 
conservatives clamoring for tougher death penalty provisions 
were blamed by the chief sponsor rep william hughes dnj for 
turning the bill into a political football a month before 
congressional elections 
under the bill federal courts could impose the death penalty 
for assassination of a range of government officials the offenses 
of treason and espionage also would be punishable by death 
the bill also seeks to limit the number of habeas corpus 
petitions inmates under death sentence could file and thus postpone 
execution by a decade or more in some case such petitions 
challenge whether a prisoner is being held legally 
other features range from a shutoff in federal benefits for 
convicted drug offenders to a oneyear prison term for illegal 
possession of steroids 
if approved the bill would go to a conference committee for 
resolution of differences with a senatepassed version 
president bush has criticized the house bill saying some 
features are less stringent that current law he has been critical 
of provisions that would allow death row inmates to use racial 
statistics to bolster their appeals 
bush also has attacked the habeas corpus provision saying that 
far from speeding up the appeals process it would stretch it to 
greater length 
conservatives led by rep henry j hyde rill are pushing for 
a tightened version and last week succeeded in blocking floor 
action until democrats agreed to a vote on their plan 
the bill would require those under death sentence to file their 
habeas corpus petitions within a year after exhausting their direct 
appeals it would limit them to one petition but provide for a 
number of exceptions hyde wants to substitute a provision that 
would allow state to impose the limits as long as the defendants 
were represented by competent lawyers 
republicans also have forced sponsors to allow a vote on an 
amendment sponsored by rep chalmers p wylie rohio that would 
permit confiscation of the homes of those convicted of savings and 
loan fraud im tired of the lavish lifestyles of the sampl 
crooks rep john hiler rind declared 
hughes pleaded with republicans not to try to pepper the bill 
with unconstitutional amendments he said a tough bill was needed 
but also a bill we can all be proud of a bill we can all go home 
and campaign on 
gop lawmakers however made it clear they wanted a substantial 
reshaping of the legislation 
rep craig james rfla denounced endless appeals and 
twisting the rules to prevent the will of the people from being 
carried out 
in its present form it would not help law enforcement it 
would hinder law enforcement said rep lawrence coughlin rpa 
some of my republican colleagues want to play political 
football with this issue hughes finally said but the 
republican colleagues in my opinion are wrong in their belief that 
the american public will award the moral high ground to whoever 
claims to be the most bloodthirsty

the govermment increased 
security at embassies today after a bomb exploded at the us 
ambassadors home and police said they had seized dozens of weapons 
from rightwing extremists 
police patrols were increased at embassies in pretoria and 
consulates in other cities after a small bomb exploded wednesday at 
the back gate of us ambassador william swings residence no one 
was hurt in the blast 
in other developments today police said one man was killed in 
black factional fighting in natal but the rest of the country was 
quiet some 800 people have died in recent weeks in factional 
battles 
south african foreign minister pik botha said the government was 
determined to catch whoever was responsible for the bombing at the 
us residence 
no group took responsibility for the blast south african press 
reports today said it appeared to be the work of white 
rightwingers opposed to government plans to end apartheid and 
share power with the black majority 
ambassador swing was home when the explosion occurred said 
larry schwartz of the us information service its a total 
surprise schwartz said its never happened before 
the united states backs president fw de klerks efforts to end 
apartheid de klerk was given a warm welcome during a state visit 
to washington late last month 
rightwing whites also are angry with the united states for the 
limited sanctions it has imposed on south africa to protest 
apartheid 
police said in a statement today that they had seized large 
amounts of guns explosives and ammunition at several houses in the 
pretoria and johannesburg areas the arms included machine guns 
mines mortars and pistols they said 
police commissioner gen johan van der merwe said some of the 
weapons were stolen by rightwingers in a raid april 14 on air 
force headquarters in pretoria he said the weapons were found 
after the arrest last week of fugitive rightwing leader piet 
rudolph 
rudolph declared war on the de klerk government earlier this 
year to try and halt efforts to end apartheid rightwingers were 
blamed for a series of bombings in johannesburg

promised immunity to people holding them

engineers will rewrite the magellan 
space probes computer programs to reduce the risk of again losing 
contact with the venus orbiter an official says 
scientists have abandoned efforts to determine why they lost 
contact with the spacecraft twice in august said tony spear 
magellan project manager at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
were reaching the point of diminishing returns in trying to 
determine the root cause so we are phasing that out were 
focusing on fixes now spear said 
magellan on wednesday continued using its radar to map and make 
pictures of venus marking its 396th orbit since reaching the 
planet aug 10 
the spacecraft has now collected more bits of computerized 
data than any other single planetary exploration spacecraft said 
steve wall magellan experiment representative nasa has said that 
by the end of magellans mission it will have gathered more 
information than all other spacecraft combined 
the spacecraft made some test pictures of venus aug 16 but 
lost radio contact with earth that night and again aug 21 that 
delayed the start of fullscale mapping until sept 15 
engineers suspect the malfunctions stem from possible damage 
that happened when the spacecraft jettisoned its braking rocket 
several hours after it started orbiting venus spear said 
the damage might be a broken wire or circuit wall said if 
there was such damage it apparently caused or aggravated 
noise or static that interferes with magellans computers 
spear said 
rewriting the compute programs will help magellan automatically 
detect future glitches reduce the chance of a complete loss of 
radio contact and allow the most troubleprone of the four 
computers to operate while bypassing corrupted portions of its 
memory spear said 
that computer a backup computer that helps aim the spacecraft 
hasnt been used since the communications blackouts the new 
software will allow it to be used in case the primary directional 
computer ever fails 
the new computer programming will be radioed to magellan to 
replace existing software only as problems develop and we will 
test the living daylights out of it on the ground spear said 
he said some of the new programs will be installed by the end of 
this year the rest by the end of 1991 
magellans pictures of venus have shown extensive faulting and 
fracturing of the planets surface giant meteorite impact craters 
and a wide variety of volcanoes 
laboratory spokesman jim doyle said 989 percent of all radar 
mapping data collected by magellan since sept 15 was transmitted 
to earth successfully that means about four hours of information 
were lost or damaged in transit 
spear said the most recent incident happened tuesday when 
highenergy particles in space slightly degraded one orbits worth 
of picture data computer processing should restore the quality of 
those images he said

of earths climate by the greenhouse effect according to a 
study published today 
it would be one small step in the right direction a manmade 
contributon to global warming that can be remedied by mankinds own 
efforts said stanley tyler an atmospheric scientist at the 
national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo 
the new study was published in the journal nature by chemists f 
sherwood rowland donald blake and neil harris at the university of 
california irvine 
its very significant work because it shows one relatively 
easy way to reduce future global warming said kathleen hogan of 
the us environmental protection agencys global change division 
if we went in and found the leaks and fixed them in the 
natural gas systems in eastern europe and the soviet union youd 
have a very large start at reducing the contribution of methane 
natural gas to global warming hogan said wednesday by 
telephone from washington 
some scientists dispute the theory that gases from human 
activities are heating earths atmosphere by trapping heat as glass 
does in a greenhouse but the scientific consensus is that the 
greenhouse effect exists and is worsening it is believed to have 
warmed earths climate by onehalf to 1 degree fahrenheit during 
the past century and will raise temperatures by 3 to 8 degrees more 
by 2050 
such warming could trigger famine by disrupting agriculture and 
coastal areas could be flooded if sea levels are raised by melting 
of glaciers melting of the greenland ice sheet and thermal 
expansion of water 
about half of global warming is caused by carbon dioxide gas 
from fossil fuel burning about 20 percent is due to chemicals 
called chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs and an additional 20 percent 
is caused by methane which is natural gas rowland said other 
trace gases cause the remaining warming 
researchers measured natural gas concentrations in several 
areas they found that compared with us and western european 
cities and eastern european rural areas methane levels in urban 
air were very high in berlin budapest hungary krakow poland 
prague czechoslovakia istanbul turkey and yerevan in soviet 
armenia 
previous research found natural gas concentrations in earths 
atmosphere increased 1 percent annually during the 1980s and that 
it takes 10 years for chemical reactions in the atmosphere to 
remove natural gas 
that means a 10 percent reduction in natural gas emissions 
worldwide would halt increasing atmospheric concentrations of 
methane and cancel its contribution to increased global warming 
rowland said 
he said reduction could be achieved by controlling leaks in 
natural gas valves pipelines compressor stations and other 
facilities especially in eastern europe and asia 
hogan said some studies estimate up to 10 percent of eastern 
europes natural gas leaks into the atmosphere because of aging 
poorly maintained transmission facilities 
leakage in the united states is less than a few percent said 
george strang vice president for engineering at southern 
california gas co

a warehouse owner says police officers advised him 
how to dispose of a body before a booby trap he set killed a 
burglar a newspaper said today 
philip connaghan who pleaded guilty to manslaughter said 
wednesday the police advice came in discussions about repeated 
burglaries at his warehouse the denver post reported 
police chief ari zavaras said he was not aware of connaghans 
allegations about police advice and ordered an investigation 
connaghan a handyman from suburban arvada didnt disclose the 
officers names nor detail their suggestions 
he said police told him steps of how to dispose of a body if i 
found a body in my shop they knew the terrible predicament i was 
up against and they knew they couldnt help me 
a singlebarrel 12gauge shotgun was propped inside the 
warehouse and attached to a trip wire killing michael mccomb 19 
on april 14 authorities said 
connghan set two shotgun booby traps at the warehouse after a 
breakin in january during another burglary in march one booby 
trap was tripped but malfunctioned he dismantled one of the traps 
but told authorities he forgot to disarm the other 
connaghan said he set the traps because he was increasingly 
frustrated by breakins and the theft of expensive tools personal 
items and electronic equipment he needed for his work 
the case triggered overwhelming support for connaghan from 
residents who said they were fed up with the high crime rate some 
people put up signs warning their businesses also were booby 
trapped 
district attorney norm early said if officers did advise 
connaghan on how to dispose of a body it would not constitute a 
crime 
colorado has a make my day law that allows use of deadly 
force to protect householders from intruders but the district 
attorneys office said it only applied to people in fear of their 
lives 
prosecutors said connaghan was not at the warehouse at the time 
of the burglary and therefore not entitled to protection under the 
law 
connaghan was sentenced in august to pay 9500 in fines and 
restitution to mccombs family and was placed on six years 
probation

three britons and two frenchman 
escaped from iraq by small boat in a daring 25hour voyage british 
diplomats and saudi officials said today 
it was the first report of western men escaping in six weeks 
guided only by a small compass and provisioned with cheese 
bread vodka and whisky the men were concealed by a rare mist that 
arose as they drifted in high seas 
the men were found wednesday drifting in a shipping lane by the 
saudi coast guard off the town of khafji on the border with kuwait 
officials reported they said the five were suffering the first 
effects of exposure 
the britons contacted their families in england who put them in 
touch with the daily mail newspaper 
the london paper quoted them as saying they spent 25 hours in 
rough seas after taking a 10foot fiberglass boat through the 
marshes of southern iraq 
we only just made it and we know were lucky mike teesdale 
40 was quoted as saying when we got off the boat the relief was 
enormous we sat down and tried to be big men but we all felt like 
crying 
the mail said the five britons had worked on a key oil 
installation near the southern iraqi port of basra and the two 
frenchmen were barge masters 
the escapees were among a small number of europeans living on 
dwindling food supplies and denied permission to leave 
it was the first report of western men escaping from iraq in 
more than six weeks baghdad has prevented thousands of western men 
from leaving iraq and kuwait after iraqi forces invaded the tiny 
emirate on aug 2 
iraq has taken several hundred westerners hostage and put them 
near key military and civilian targets as a human shield against 
military strikes by the usled multinational force building up in 
saudi arabia 
iraqis were allowed to go fishing tuesday because of a religious 
holiday so the men chose that night for their escape they said 
they made their way through the shattalarab waterway into the 
persian gulf 
the shattalarab which forms the southern boundary between 
iran and iraq has been closed to shipping since the 198088 
iraniraq war 
teesdale said the men only had a small compass to guide them and 
got lost several times as they tried to avoid villages and other 
craft 
a 10foot swell prevented them from using their diesel engine as 
they tried to follow the shoreline in the gulf past occupied 
kuwait a rare heavy mist and overcast skies helped prevent them 
from being spotted 
another of the britons 44yearold ivan manning told the mail 
we took supplies of bread cheese whisky and vodka we knew 
the risks 
the five worked in rotation one on lookout one steering and 
one working the bilge pump

a harvard graduate student combing archives 
uncovered new clues in the search for the origin of baseball in an 
1845 newspaper sports story and box score 
abner doubledays invention of baseball in a cooperstown 
ny cow pasture has been debunked as a popular myth the city of 
hoboken nj then claimed the first game was played there in 
1846 
the story and primitive box score appeared in a copy of the new 
york morning news and recount a game played oct 21 1845 between 
the new york ball club and a team from brooklyn the new york 
times reported today 
the find by edward l widmer a harvard doctoral candidate 
researching his dissertation at the new york historical society 
indicates baseball had been in existence for some time when the 
story was written 
the newspaper account began a friendly match of the 
timehonored game of base was played yesterday 
new york won 244 aided by a grand slam or in the vocabulary 
of the time four aces off a single hit 
the newspaper account went on to say two new brooklyn teams had 
formed recently 
after it was proved that doubleday did not create baseball 
historians credited alexander cartwright a new york bank clerk 
said to have drawn up the rules and organized the first game in 
1846 for the knickerbocker base ball club at the elysian fields 
in hoboken 
the game reported in the morning news also was played at elysian 
fields and widmer found another clipping recounting a rematch oct 
24 1845 that was played in brooklyn 
the find indicates that new york city is the cradle of 
baseball said david q voigt a baseball historian and professor 
at albright college in reading pa 
baseball was a city game not a rural or farm game he said 
adding that the find supports his theory that baseball developed in 
stages

his lieutenant governors mutiny ended weeks ago 
but gov michael s dukakis still faces dissension within his 
ranks 
dukakis has been slashing money from the state budget which 
itself has defied the governors attempts to bring it into balance 
just three months into the fiscal year dukakis twice has ordered 
cuts now totaling 460 million the cuts have dug deeply into 
health care and welfare accounts 
but on tuesday communities and development secretary amy s 
anthony said an order to cut 12 million from the states 
rentsubsidy account would increase homelessness forcing almost 
5000 families onto the streets so she declared she would not 
comply with the orders 
i think weve bitten the bullet an enormous amount in this 
department anthony said weve done everything conceivable 
but there are limits to what is doable and what is responsible 
dukakis who met with anthony on wednesday said there may be 
ways of dealing with the problem without putting 5000 people out 
in the street 
some programs might be spared if the legislature can find cuts 
elsewhere he said dukakis imposed the cuts only where he had 
authority to do so in the executive branch he has not touched 
other accounts such as aid to cities and towns which the 
legislature controls 
on wednesday state human services secretary philip johnston 
also pledged to avoid some of the proposed budget cuts he told a 
group of hearingimpaired people that the state would find money to 
pay for a phone system for the deaf 
for his part dukakis said im bound and determined as much 
as possible when we walk out of here to leave a budget in 
balance 
reaching that goal has turned into an endless task for dukakis 
who has been struggling with the states fiscal troubles since the 
day he lost the 1988 presidential election 
in the last fiscal year the state ran up a deficit of more than 
1 billion and its bond ratings plnged to the nations lowest 
dukakis is not seeking reelection but he has become the target 
of wrath for many residents and politicians last month lt gov 
evelyn murphy who was foundering in her campaign to succeed 
dukakis staged a revolt against him with dukakis away on a 
european trade mission she grabbed control of the states finances 
as acting governor 
murphy unveiled her own set of cuts but dukakis administration 
officials said they wouldnt save as much money as she promised and 
the governors budgetcutting plans would go further 
with her mutiny and election campaign swirling in disarray 
murphy dropped out of the governors race 
but that has not stopped the state budget siege a continuing 
slide in the state economy along with gloomy national forecasts 
have forced state officials to repeatedly lower their estimates for 
tax collections

president mikhail s gorbachev said today it was 
unnecessary to send soviet troops to the persian gulf to join the 
usled multinational force 
gorbachev made the comment to reporters before meeting in the 
kremlin with qais abdul munim alzawawi omans deputy prime 
minister for finance 
asked if he thought war would break out in the gulf gorbachev 
replied i think not 
in response to a query whether soviet troops would be sent to 
the gulf gorbachev said i think there are already more than 
enough troops there 
the comment came as a gorbachev envoy yevgeny primakov arrived 
in baghdad today to discuss ways of seeking a peaceful resolution 
to the crisis soviet diplomatic sources said primakov was carrying 
a message from gorbachev but did not disclose its contents 
the soviet union joined international efforts to condemn iraq 
following its invasion of kuwait on aug 2 it cut off arms sales 
to baghdad as part of the un trade embargo against iraq and has 
warships in the gulf region 
soviet officials previously had said the soviet union might 
consider joining the international military force in the region if 
it is placed under un command an estimated 200000 troops from 
various countries including 170000 americans were dispatched to 
saudi arabia after iraqs invasion 
tass the official soviet news agency said gorbachev and 
alzawawi were expected to discuss relations between the two 
countries and international issues particularly the middle east

each side had its script and its props each 
performed its role to perfection it wasnt a play acted out 
however but a riot 
more than 40 people including a dozen police officers were 
injured and 246 rioters were arrested police said 
west berlin police and a veteran radical group reenacted yet 
another of their violent confrontations only this time it took 
place in what was once east berlin 
thousands of leftist radicals opposed to wednesdays german 
unification used the first full day of the historic merger to 
rampage through east berlins sprawling central square 
alexanderplatz 
the radicals trashed outdoor concessions stands destroyed cars 
smashed windows hurled rocks and fired flare guns at police 
police in riot gear used water cannons and tear gas against the 
radicals the two sides battled for hours for control of the 
square taking turns charging each other well into the night 
about 500 leftists and 200 turkish youths took part in the 
riots police said 
its almost comical said east berliner herbert schneider 
he watched dumbfounded as running gangs of radicals and hooligans 
were chased around the square by hundreds of police with helmets 
shields and nightsticks 
we have a complicated future here he said 
the clash began as a huge protest against german unity the 
leftists gathered in a grassy square in what was west berlin for a 
rally against what they said was rising racism and nationalism in 
both sides of germany 
about 20000 demonstrators marched into east berlin to a square 
just outside of alexanderplatz where they tore down the new west 
german flags from six flagpoles and hoisted the redandblack flag 
of their anarchist movement and old communist east german flags 
the protest turned violent when the leftists began smashing 
windows and trashing cars police ordered thousands of other people 
celebrating unity to leave the area and the leftists eventually 
took over alexanderplatz 
each side took turns charging and retreating repeating in near 
exact form past clashes that have been played out for many years in 
west berlin 
the rioters joked and raided beer stands on the square to 
unity laughed a young woman after police briefly drove the 
thousands of people most of them young west berliners to the 
squares perimeter 
older people walked past the strewn rubble on the square and the 
surrounding streets with shocked expressions beer kegs and 
teargas canisters littered the area 
a man who tried to drive through a swirling crowd of youths 
angrily stopped his car and challenged them he was escorted gently 
back into his vehicle by three towering police officers 
east germany has been marred by rightwing and leftwing 
extremist violence since it opened its borders to the west but 
wednesday was the first time west berlin leftists staged one of 
their patented hourslong giveandtake riots 
leftists had told the associated press earlier this week that 
the march against unity would turn into a clash with police police 
likewise had said that unity day celebrations would be marred by 
extremists 
the predictions came true

michael feinstein could be the worlds biggest 
fan of classic popular music 
thats part of his appeal a genuine enthusiasm for the songs of 
george gershwin richard rodgers jerome kern jule styne harry 
warren stephen sondheim richard whiting and scores of other 
broadway and hollywood composers 
his affection for these melody masters comes through in 
michael feinstein in concert piano and voice his third trip 
to broadway since 1988 
once the technical glitches particularly a balky sound system 
are ironed out feinsteins new show which is on view at 
broadways golden theater through oct 27 could be his best yet 
the evening has been constructed carefully with songs grouped 
together by theme or composer or lyricist feinstein always has 
been adept at intertwining different songs by the same writers the 
numbers reverberate off each other making the listener doubly 
aware of what a composer or a lyricist was trying to say 
for example feinstein does it with two standards that have 
lyrics by oscar hammerstein jerome kerns make believe and 
richard rodgers i have dreamed both numbers reveal the mans 
unabashed sense of romanticism and his firm belief in true love 
the evenings highlight is a medley of songs by burton lane 
with whom feinstein recently has recorded an album a spry 
ebullient lane was on hand tuesday night to assist feinstein and 
it was tin pan alley heaven the 78yearold composer is a marvel 
playing his own songs with a zest no mere secondhand interpreter 
could ever muster 
besides such lane evergreens as babes on broadway how 
about you and on a clear day you can see forever feinstein 
and lane ripped smashingly through a witty little ditty called 
anything can happen in new york the lyrics were by ey 
harburg and recall a time when the unexpected in the big apple 
actually could be fun 
feinstein has a conversational rapport with the audience he 
talks to them as if he were sitting in their living rooms theres 
a bit of a true believer in him as well he knows hes right when 
he extols the virtues of these songwriters 
near the end of the long evening he delivers a little lecture 
on lyricist johnny mercer peppered with musical illustrations 
ranging from the wellknown come rain or come shine to the 
more than obscure girlfriend of the whirling dirvish 
but feinstein relishes even these most unknown of songs he has 
the same preciseness of enunciation that he gives such standards as 
rodgers and harts manhattan or gershwins ill build a 
stairway to paradise and he can be heartfelt with an unknown 
jule styne song killing time which has the last lyrics ever 
written by carolyn leigh 
feinstein certainly doesnt hold anything back he gives his 
all you wonder what kind of voice hell have at the end of a 
fourweek engagement there may be better singers and better piano 
players but nobody tops michael in his love of performing these 
grand musical standards

gen curtis e lemay was 
remembered at his funeral as a skilled military leader with little 
time for small talk but strong concern for his troops and his 
friends 
he was a great man great airman great american said 
retired lt gen william craigie a former test pilot and longtime 
friend of the gruff cigarchomping air force general 
about 1000 people crowded the base chapel for the formal 
military funeral ceremony wednesday lemays coffin was draped by 
an american flag burial was scheduled today at the air force 
academy in colorado springs colo 
lemay who directed the atomic bombing of japan organized the 
berlin airlift and headed the strategic air command suffered a 
heart attack monday and died at a base hospital he was 83 
the fourstar general and onetime air force chief of staff was 
known for his skill as a military tactician but his public 
statements and sparring with former defense secretary robert s 
mcnamara often generated controversy 
but speakers at lemays funeral remembered the general in more 
personal terms 
lemay believed in one thing taking care of his people 
said retired maj gen edward nichols 
nichols voice wavered as he spoke of lemays concern for 
military families 
he said lemays first priority was that bases were set up to 
take care of our wives and children when we are gone 
the base chaplain col benjamin perez said that lemay spent 
his final days helping untangle the government red tape of military 
care for people living in his retirement complex air force 
village which lemay helped found 
there is much of general lemay that remains said perez of 
the generals contributions we remember and we celebrate 
taps were played after a traditional military rifle salute 
bringing tears to mourners 
lemay a muchdecorated veteran of some of the fiercest air 
battles over europe during world war ii later commanded us air 
forces in europe and led sac 
shortly after his retirement from the military in 1965 lemay 
was quoted as having made the infamous remark about bombing north 
vietnam back into the stone age 
lemay later denied the statements but then kept the controversy 
alive by saying he saw nothing wrong with using nuclear weapons to 
shorten any war and to save lives

this time the suits brought by four wouldbe 
nightclub patrons were correct 
a small claims court ordered the owner of a chic nightspot to 
pay damages to the four who claimed they were kept out of the club 
because the doorman didnt deem them trendy enough 
commissioner diana wheatley on wednesday awarded 250 apiece to 
the plaintiffs who waited in vain to get in the downtown mayan 
club on may 19 
they filed lawsuits under the unruh civil rights act of 1959 
claiming they were kept out by an arbitrary and discriminatory 
decision 
the case pitted plaintiffs jeff stolzer kenneth lipton 
teresita dubrall and stephen ambrosini against sammy chao 
president of the company that owns the mayan 
the club has become a popular nightspot since it opened about 
six months ago some clubgoers are waved right in others must wait 
as the doorman chooses among them 
chao testified tuesday that no dress code exists and that the 
doorman picks and chooses to keep out people who are drunk or 
otherwise look like trouble as well as save room inside for 
patrons with reservations 
stolzer differed he told the court i think we were met at 
the door by a flippant and arrogant doorman they just looked you 
over like you were scum 
the plaintiffs claimed the decisions were arbitrary had there 
been a posted dress code they argued they would have complied 
vertigo a nearby club faces a similar legal problem the state 
alcoholic beverage control department has recommended suspending 
vertigos liquor license for 30 days because undercover inspectors 
were refused entry 
the clubs owner said the state inspectors were dressed 
improperly

scientists believe they are zeroing in on the gene 
responsible for marfan syndrome an inherited cause of heart 
disease but in a report released today they caution that no cure 
is in sight 
the researchers reported finding the general area of the gene 
an important step toward pinpointing the defective gene and finding 
out how it causes the disease according to the study in the new 
england journal of medicine 
people with marfan syndrome usually are tall and lanky they 
often suffer heart ailments that can cause death 
the dsease runs in families and finding its genetic roots 
should help doctors diagnose who is likely to have it even before 
birth but the disease also does its damage during fetal 
development so that simply replacing the defective gene with a 
good one later in life would not reverse the disease 
for the foreseeable future the discovery of the cause of 
marfan syndrome will be of primarily psychological benefit to 
patients dr reed e pyritz of johns hopkins hospital wrote in 
an editorial published with the study 
he said the biologic and technical problems of gene replacement 
make the task seem insurmountable at present 
the report was based on a genetic analysis of five families with 
the disease in finland it was conducted by dr leena peltonen and 
colleagues from the national public health institute in helsinki 
the researchers narrowed down the location of the defective gene 
to chromosome 15 one of the strings of genes that determines how 
people develop 
the findings have been widely known in medical circles for 
several months and efforts are under way to see if the same 
genetic pattern shows up in other families with the disease 
if they pinpoint the defective gene scientists will be able to 
figure out what it does normally and how it causes disease when it 
malfunctions 
some experts believe the crucial gene may turn out to be one 
that controls the bodys production of fibrillin a protein that 
helps make skin and blood vessels stretch

a woman has been convicted of killing 
her 4yearold son and now faces trial in texas in the deaths of 
four other children three of them her daughters the other a 
relatives child 
a finney county district court jury returned a firstdegree 
murder verdict wednesday against diana lumbrera 32 who moved to 
garden city from texas in 1985 the jurors deliberated a little 
more than three hours 
besides the four deaths with which ms lumbrera is charged in 
texas the deaths of two other sons are under investigation there 
the prosecution in kansas contended ms lumbrera smothered her 
son to get sympathy and life insurance money 
as the verdict was read ms lumbrera who has no living 
children stood next to her lawyer michael quint and cried 
quint said he would appeal the conviction in the may 1 death of 
jose lumbrera 
we made it perfectly clear from the start that we believed the 
trial should have been moved because of prejudicial pretrial 
publicity he said 
jurors said the decision was difficult they said many of them 
had been leaning toward acquittal until two pathologists testified 
as rebuttal witnesses for the prosecution 
dr william eckert a wichita pathologist called by the defense 
said the boy died of a viral infection 
but the pathologists called to rebut his testimony said there 
were no signs jose died of natural causes 
for a year before joses death ms lumbrera had been lying to 
her landlord and friends telling them the boy was dying of 
leukemia finney county prosecutor ricklin pierce said he believed 
that coupled with the fact that she had not given the boy 
prescription medicine the day he died convinced the jury she was 
not intent on keeping her son alive 
the real heroes of this case were the forensic pathologists 
and garden city police who refused to give up on their 
investigations he said 
jurors said they had limited knowledge of the texas cases and 
that they had no influence on their verdict 
ms lumbrera who will be sentenced in november faces life in 
prison with eligibility for parole in 15 years three of the cases 
against her in texas carry the death penalty on conviction 
an extradition hearing was set for friday 
estella espinoza the defendants sister said she thought 
jurors had made up their minds before the trial began 
i dont think it was fair she said they didnt give her 
a chance they made up their minds a long time ago they convicted 
an innocent woman that will be on their conscience for the rest of 
their lives 
ive known her all my life and i still dont believe she 
killed the kid said ms lumbreras uncle lupe salazar a farmer 
from bovina texas 
he said he felt the trial should have been moved 
ms lumbrera a former resident of bovina texas is charged in 
texas with killing three young daughters in 1976 1978 and 1982 to 
collect life insurance benefits 
she also is charged in the 1980 death of a cousins sixweekold 
daughter

heard jet engines and saw an orange glow in the sky from the 
window of his home that overlooks the town of 3000 
the glow appeared to be growing larger and coming downward 
he said the next thing i saw were shapes falling to the ground 
somewhere in lockerbie there was a horrendous noise an 
explosion 
the explosion was like a miniature atomic bomb and a mushroom 
of cloud and flame went upward he said it just kept going up 
id say it reached 1000 feet

robby a 1 million robot rover vehicle 
designed to explore mars successfully picked its way along a rocky 
dry river bed without human help nasa said 
this is the first time that an autonomous vehicle has ever 
navigated rugged terrain using video cameras said roger bedard 
planetary rover program manager at the space agencys jet 
propulsion laboratory robby himself wouldnt go to mars hes a 
test vehicle 
nasa called the sept 13 test a significant milestone in 
developing a planetroving computerguided vehicle that would 
explore mars to find suitable landing sites for a manned mission to 
the red planet 
it will be about 1995 before engineers fully develop rover 
technology and about 2000 before one can be built to go to mars 
bedard said wednesday 
during the test robby took four hours 20 minutes to crawl 
along a 109yard course in the rugged arroyo seco a dry river bed 
in a canyon next to the laboratory nasa wants a real mars rover to 
travel about 13 miles daily 
bedard said engineers told robby where it was and where it was 
supposed to go but the sixwheeled vehicle used its twin 
television cameras and computer to navigate a safe course around 
boulders and other obstacles other tests were conducted last week 
robby is about 15 feet long 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall it was 
named after robby the robot in forbidden planet a 1956 science 
fiction film 
the robots television cameras give it stereoscopic vision 
allowing it a threedimensional look at objects about 6 feet in 
front of it robby moves about 6 feet at a time then stops to 
survey another 6foot stretch of terrain before proceeding 
robby runs on a battery recharged by an onboard gasoline 
generator a mars rover would be powered by the radioactive decay 
of plutonium bedard said 
the only unmanned rovers to explore another planet were two 
soviet lunakod vehicles that explored the moon in the early 1970s 
bedard said nasa astronauts used a manned vehicle on the moon 
the national aeronautics and space administration doesnt yet 
have specific plans to put rovers on mars bedard said the soviets 
are considering using rovers and terrainhopping balloons during a 
1994 mission to mars 
during the past week 30foottall balloons that would 
repeatedly rise and settle on mars surface were tested in 
californias desert by engineers from france the soviet union and 
the planetary society a group that advocates space exploration 
balloons have the advantage of not needing to navigate rough 
terrain rising during the heat of day and settling to the martian 
surface at night to take measurements 
bedard said rovers can be directed to explore areas of 
scientific interest rather than taking a route that depends on 
prevailing winds

that dennis stout will win the upcoming mayoral election and lose 
and maybe even lose twice 
incumbent dennis stout is fending off a challenge by dennis 
stout in the nov 6 election in this san bernardino county 
community 
confused thats what the third candidate francine manzano is 
hoping for 
its great for me she said i think it will cause a lot 
of confusion at the polls i hope that works 
manzano even built her campaign slogan on the theme 
one small woman against two stout men 
measures have been taken to guard against voter mixups a 
warning will be printed at the top of each ballot alerting people 
to the samename candidates 
mayor dennis lee stout whose name appears second on the ballot 
has chosen to place a no 1 by his name 
challenger alfred dennis stout who goes by his middle name is 
emphasizing the word new in his campaign one slogan calls for 
new leadership and direction 
the businessman said he chose to run for mayor out of genuine 
desire not because of the shared moniker 
i dont want him to think i was doing it just to confuse the 
issue he said i wish it was different but if i ran under the 
name alfred stout my kids wouldnt even know who it is 
the incumbent who is seeking a second term said he isnt too 
concerned 
the voters of rancho cucamonga are extremely sophisticated

chancellor helmut kohl told the first meeting of 
unified germanys parliament that as they shape their new nation 
germans must never forget the nazi holocaust or the repression of 
the east german communists 
for the first time in nearly six decades german lawmakers met 
in the reichstag prewar germanys parliament building 
the ceremonial session one day after unification brought 
together 664 deputies 520 from the west and 144 from the east 
who will serve until elections on dec 2 
todays session was only five minutes old when the opposition 
social democrats heckled parliament speaker rita suessmuth a 
member of kohls christian democrats who opened the session 
kohl confronted a barrage of verbal attacks from oskar 
lafontaine the social democratic candidate for chancellor in the 
december elections 
lafontaine waving his glasses and motioning energetically 
criticized kohl for his environmental policies and the cost of 
unification 
he read from a london newspaper article saying kohl had made a 
series of mistakes for promising not to raise taxes and for 
allegedly giving east germans an overly favorable rate for their 
nowworthless east german marks 
the chancellor sat three yards away looking impassively 
straight ahead 
while most of the west germans wore suits and welltailored 
dresses some of the east germans came more casually dressed 
quite frankly i feel a little bit like a guest here said 
gregor gysi who was leader of east germanys reformed communist 
party told reporters while drinking coffee during a break before 
his speech 
in her opening speech televised live ms suessmuth welcomed 
the lawmakers to the newly refurbished chamber decorated with 
flowers and with the huge eagle that symbolizes germany 
we remember all the victims of the nazis and we remember the 
victims of the sed regime east germanys ousted communists the 
victims of the berlin wall and barbed wire she said 
the lawmakers then stood for a moment of silence 
kohl told them we must never forget suppress or play down 
the crimes committed in this century by germans above all we 
owe this to the victims of the holocaust the unparalleled genocide 
of european jews 
the chancellor also condemned the communists who until last 
autumn ruled eastern germany he said their dictatorship and 
repression had left behind wounds in peoples hearts 
billions of dollars are needed to rebuild the devastated economy 
left by the communists and already the wealthy west is complaining 
about the cost 
it is now essential to ensure that germany is also swiftly 
reunited in economic and social terms kohl said this will 
call for great exertions and we shall also have to make 
sacrifices 
the reichstag still scarred by world war ii had not hosted 
parliament since it was gutted by a mysterious fire on feb 27 
1933 one month after adolf hitler became chancellor 
leaders of the new germany assured the world wednesday the 
official day of unification that it would strive for peace and 
never forget the harsh lessons of its nazi past 
unification officially came after midnight tuesday and germans 
across the new nation celebrated into wednesday their newest 
national holiday 
about 20000 leftist radicals protesting unity rampaged in 
berlin on wednesday police fired tear gas and water cannons in 
street battles about 40 people were injured and 246 arrested 
numerous heads of state from around the world sent cables of 
congratulations to chancellor helmut kohl and the german people 
a goverment spokesman said soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev widely credited with making unification possible will 
visit germany next month a heros welcome is expected 
as the chancellor of a united germany kohls first big 
political test comes in less than two weeks when elections are held 
in eastern germany for the governments of the five states that will 
be added to the existing 11 in the west the 16 states will form

drifting in the small boat in a persian gulf shipping lane off the 
saudikuwait border british diplomats and saudi officials said

through the marshes of southern iraq into the shattalarab 
waterway and then the gulf 
it was the first report of western men escaping iraq since

near the iraqi port of basra and the two frenchmen were barge 
masters they were among a small number of europeans living on 
dwindling food supplies and denied permission to leave

his country would keep out of a military confrontation between iraq 
and the us forces

the lawyer for a homosexual fbi agent who 
has filed a discrimination suit over his firing says his clients 
security clearance was revoked to provide a reason to get rid of 
him 
they used a security clearance as an excuse to get rid of the 
gay person assuming the court will defer in security matters 
said richard gayer representing former agent frank buttino 
gayer made public on wednesday a letter from fbi director 
william sessions to a congressman saying that the issue of 
homosexual conduct by employees of the fbi raises serious policy 
considerations involving public trust and confidence 
sessions also wrote that he was unaware of any openly homosexual 
agents 
a federal magistrate ordered wednesday that sessions must say 
whether he had anything to do with revoking buttinos security 
clearance 
buttino 45 was fired in june after 20 years with the fbi his 
security clearance required for all agents had been revoked the 
previous month 
in papers seeking to dismiss his suit the justice department 
said buttinos clearance was lifted not because he was homosexual 
but because he had lied repeatedly to fbi investigators and placed 
himself in a position that was vulnerable to coercion 
buttino said those explanations are a pretext for an 
antihomosexual policy that the fbi is unwilling to acknowledge he 
told reporters wednesday that he has learned through contacts in 
washington that the fbi investigates and dismisses 50 homosexuals a 
year 
the only lie he told in hopes of saving his career was to 
deny initially to investigators in 1988 that he had written a 
letter to another person that indicated his homosexuality buttino 
said the letter was forwarded to the fbi by an anonymous person 
buttino said he met with investigators two months later and 
volunteered that he had written the letter and that he was 
homosexual 
buttinos lawyer sought permission to question sessions about 
the fbis policies and about the directors meeting early this year 
with rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights 
edwards later sent sessions a letter mentioning that they had 
discussed buttinos case and asking about the fbis policies on 
homosexuals 
us magistrate wayne brazil said he had seen no evidence in the 
case that would justify requiring the sessions to submit to 
questioning 
but brazil said sessions must submit a sworn statement in 
writing within 30 days saying whether he had any involvement in the 
decision to revoke buttinos clearance 
gayer gave reporters sessions sept 6 letter to edwards in 
which the director denied that homosexual conduct was automatic 
grounds for firing 
however where sexual conduct whether homosexual or 
heterosexual reflects a lack of judgment or discretion or a 
susceptibility to undue influence or duress the granting or 
retention of a security clearance would not be consistent with the 
interests of national security sessions wrote

house the remains of most other czechoslovak presidents of the 
communist era along with those of nationally renowned artists and

immediate postwar years

that they are not to deal with drug money judge michael parker 
said in convicting syed akbar 
akbar 46 was given an 18month jail sentence and ordered to 
pay 94500 
he was the second of two london financiers to be convicted in 
connection with drug money laundering last month a court 
sentenced asif baakza 40 to two years on the same conspiracy 
charge but suspended half the sentence 
both men worked in the corporate unit of the bank of credit and 
commerce international and were convicted of conspiring with amjad 
awan and akbar bilgrami bcci officials in miami 
awan who once worked for the bank in panama told a us senate 
subcommittee that he kept a secret bank account for noriega the 
deposed panamanian leader is awaiting trial in the united states on 
drug charges 
juries in the trials of akbar and baakza heard tapes made 
clandestinely in a us customs service sting operation on the 
tapes the two financiers agreed to help in processing drug 
money 
baakza was said to have accepted about 1 million which was 
later withdrawn in the bahamas under the guise of a loan akbar was 
said to have laundered drug money into gold on the london futures 
market 
both men were arrested by british customs officers shortly after 
arrests were made in the united states in october 1988 
bcci pleaded guilty in the united states earlier this year to 
laundering cash a number of people including awan and bilgrami 
were found guilty and are awaiting sentencing

fortdefrance martinique ap tropical storm klaus spawned 
torrential rain and severe flooding on this french island in the 
caribbean today leaving at least two people dead and four missing 
authorities said 
the storm with winds of 60 mph was centered about 140 miles 
north of martinique and prompted tropical storm warnings and 
watches throughout the leeward islands it was the 11th named storm 
of the atlantic hurricane season 
among the missing in martinique were two sisters aged eight and 
14 who were swept from a flooded bridge wednesday in st joseph in 
the center of the island rescuers were searching for the girls 
today 
the bodies of two men were found late wednesday authorities 
said one of the victims was a 56yearold farmer who fell from a 
tractor into a flooded ditch circumstances of the second mans 
death were unclear but it was believed he also drowned in 
floodwaters that reached nearly 10 feet in places 
two fishermen were reported missing today in riviere pilote in 
the southeastern part of the island officials told radio caribbean 
international that the local outdoor market and soccer stadium were 
under 55 feet of water 
many houses were flooded in the northern part of the island 
which was particularly hard hit schools were closed throughout the 
island flooding disrupted telephone and electrical service 
martinique a popular tourist spot is an overseas department of 
france with a population of 336000 people 
klaus remained almost stationary during the night and this 
morning at noon edt its center was near 166 north latitude and 
605 west longitude or about 95 miles eastsoutheast of antigua 
the hurricane center in miami said 
the storm was expected to resume a northwestward drift later 
today and pickup strength over the next 24 hours the hurricane 
center said 
its far enough off so that if it stays on that track it 
wont move directly over the leeward islands but just a little jog 
to the west and it certainly could hit some of the islands said 
hurricane specialist max mayfield 
right now there wouldnt be that much damage from the wind 
the biggest damage would be done by the rainfall they could have 
as much as 10 to 15 inches of rainfall he said but they could 
really have a problem with mudslides and flash floods 
tropical storm warnings were issued for the islands of the 
northeast caribbean including st martin st barthelemy saba 
st eustatius antigua and barbuda anguilla the british virgin 
islands montserrat and st kittsnevis 
a tropical storm watch was in effect for the island of 
guadeloupe and the neighboring french islands according to the 
national hurricane center in suburban coral gables

a british fighter pilots log book recording the 
shooting down of red baron manfred von richthoven in world war 
i was sold thursday for 5700 
the auction house christies said a businessman in the northern 
english city of manchester bought the log book in a telephone bid 
at the sale of aviation art and literature held at the commonwealth 
institute the buyer wanted to remain anonymous 
the log book belonged to a friend of the late lt lionel lomas 
a member of the flight led by capt roy brown a canadian who is 
credited with shooting down the famous german ace behind british 
lines over the somme battlefield in 1918 
richthofen was known as the red baron because his fokker 
triplane was painted red he was credited with 80 victories 
the log records that on april 21 1918 14 british camel 
fighters attacked 24 enemy planes shooting down three and that 
brown brought down richthofen 
the claim was contested by australian troops who said they shot 
down richthofen when they fired on his plane from the ground as it 
flew low pursued by brown 
we think the log book kept by another pilot is good evidence 
to support brown said susan adams of christies south kensington 
salesroom 
we have never had a log book from the first world war in a 
sale here before and because of von richthofens fame we had many 
inquiries about it from europe australia and canada as well as 
britain she said 
bidding began at 1890 and went up in 189 increases the final 
price was double the presale estimate

success is sorely needed in shuttle 
discoverys mission with the disputed nuclearpowered probe 
ulysses said nasa which encountered yet another problem today 
a 70pound metal beam measuring 8feet11inches long was 
found inside another shuttles engine compartment where workers 
mistakenly had left it 
nasa workers heard the beam bang around atlantis engine 
compartment as the orbiter was being raised into a vertical 
position inside the assembly building on wednesday nasa spokesan 
bruce buckingham said today 
they were unable to open the engine compartment until today 
after the solid rocket boosters and external tank were attached to 
the orbiter 
officials were assessing the damage and an investigative team 
was being formed it was not known whether the accident would 
affect atlantis secret military flight in early november 
buckingham said 
the mission already is four months late because of atlantis 
hydrogen leaks 
discovery was scheduled to blast off at 735 am edt saturday 
to launch the solar probe on a 186 billionmile journey spanning 
five years the countdown began wednesday and proceeded without 
mishap 
nasa test director mike leinbach said today two computer circuit 
cards in discoverys mobile launcher need to be replaced a minor 
job 
other than that its very clean he said 
the space agencys inability to launch a shuttle in nearly half 
a year because of technical glitches heightens the need for a 
successful mission said edward smith nasa project scientist for 
ulysses 
i think its very very important considering all the 
problems that nasa has had smith said wed certainly love to 
have a success it gets everybodys morale back up it adds to 
their confidence 
ulysses a european space agency probe has been ready for a 
ride since 1983 after several delays that included changes in the 
satellites upper stage rockets the mission was set for may 1986 
but was put back on hold after the shuttle challenger exploded 
earlier that year 
weve never gotten this close before smith said i think 
all of us are excited and apprehensive at the same time 
antinuclear and environmental activists however want the 750 
million mission canceled for safety reasons 
they oppose nasas use of nearly 237 pounds of deadly plutonium 
in a generator attached to ulysses as it decays the plutonium 
will provide electricity for the satellite 
a hearing was scheduled for late today in washington before us 
district judge oliver gasch who last year refused to halt 
atlantis launch with a plutoniumpowered satellite bound for 
jupiter 
peter wenzel project scientist for the european space agency 
said a plutonium generator is the only means of getting ulysses 
into an orbit over the suns poles 
nasa officials said there is little chance plutonium would be 
released and if it did would pose little health risk 
the 807pound spacecraft will be hurtled toward jupiter which 
will give ulysses a gravity assist and push it out of the ecliptic 
plane if all goes well it will become the first spacecraft to 
pass over the solar poles 
everybody is quite optimistic that many of our views about the 
sun and the solar system will be absolutely revolutionized smith 
said 
columbia has been grounded by hydrogen leaks since may none of 
its four countdowns in four months proceeded past fueling atlantis 
has been crippled by leaking hydrogen since june 
discovery was the last shuttle to fly when it carried the hubble 
space telescope into orbit in april although the flight went 
smoothly nasa suffered harsh criticism when the telescopes 
primary mirror was found to be flawed 
nasa officials are confident discovery will not spring any leaks 
when more than a halfmillion gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid 
oxygen are pumped into the shuttle friday night 
discovery boasts topoftheline plumbing that has been checked 
thoroughly in addition hardly any work was performed in 
discoverys main engine compartment after its last flight

an art gallery director on trial for 
displaying robert mapplethorpes work says graphic photographs at 
the center of the obscenity case are tough brutal sometimes 
disgusting but worthwhile art 
the nations first obscenity trial of an art gallery and its 
director was expected to go to the jury by early friday after 
rebuttal testimony from the prosecution and closing arguments but 
todays proceedings were delayed by a defense challenge of the 
credentials of a rebuttal witness for the prosecution 
were in a holding pattern hamilton county municipal court 
judge david albanese told jurors were not under any pressure to 
rush it and we hope youre not under any pressure to rush it 
the prosecution wanted to present testimony by judith reisman a 
former producer for the old captain kangaroo tv show and author 
of a 1600page study on children crime and violence 
defense lawyers said ms reisman lacked the qualifications to be 
a witness 
dennis barrie director of the contemporary arts center scoffed 
wednesday at a prosecutors suggestion that he and the gallery 
showed an exhibit of mapplethorpes photographs as a publicity 
stunt 
this has been a strain on all of us a strain on me personally 
and a strain on my family barrie testified but we were very 
committed to the principle at stake here 
barrie and the gallery were charged april 7 with pandering 
obscenity and using children in nudityrelated material both 
misdemeanors the trial is focused on seven of 175 photos in the 
exhibit robert mapplethorpe the perfect moment 
three of the photos show penetration of a mans anus with 
various objects one shows a man urinating in another mans mouth 
a fifth shows penetration of a penis with a pinkie finger and two 
show children with their genitals exposed 
barrie said some of the acts depicted in the show were tough 
brutal sometimes disgusting but part of the photographic 
challenge mapplethorpe accepted in trying to create a work of art 
as difficult as the subject matter may be you see the ability 
of the man working through he was brilliant with a camera 
barrie said 
every standard i had in terms of art exhibitions said this was 
a perfectly fine exhibition and there should be no change in the 
way the exhibition was presented 
mapplethorpe who was known for pursuing homosexual themes died 
of aids in march 1989 at age 42 
the exhibit set an attendance record 81000 for an art 
exhibit in cincinnati during a sevenweek run at the gallery ending 
in may the show closes this week in boston where 103000 tickets 
have been sold 
in january 1989 the contemporary art centers board endorsed 
barries proposal to schedule an exhibit of mapplethorpe photos 
in june 1989 three months after mapplethorpe died sen jesse 
helms rnc disputed use of national endowment of the arts 
funding for work that might be considered obscene 
barrie said the board talked about the controversy and decided 
to go ahead with the exhibit 
the boards legal counsel stuart schloss jr testified earlier 
wednesday that the board tried to get legal protection before the 
show the board filed a lawsuit asking the court to rule whether 
the exhibit was obscene but the case was dismissed the day before 
the public opening of the exhibit in cincinnati 
after barries testimony albanese refused a defense request to 
dismiss the charges defense lawyers argued the prosecution never 
proved its case 
the us supreme courts legal test for an obscenity 
determination asks whether the dominant theme of the artwork 
appeals to prurient interest in sex whether the work is patently 
offensive based on contemporary community standards and whether 
the work lacks serious artistic or political value 
if convicted of both charges barrie could be sentenced to one 
year in jail and fined 2000 the gallery could be fined 10000 
for conviction on both counts

a us navy guided missile frigate prevented a 
sudanese freighter from entering the gulf of aqaba today after a 
boarding party found that its cargo manifest did not account for 
all of its cargo the pentagon announced 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said no shots were fired 
williams said a party from the frigate samuel b roberts boarded 
the 12900ton blue nile registered to the sudanese shipping line 
in the northern red sea 
williams said it was the seventh time a us ship had diverted a 
vessel as part of the enforcement of the united nations embargo on 
most shipping to iraq and kuwait 
he said the vessel was a rollon rolloff ship carrying mostly 
industrial equipment 
the problem that resulted in the diversion was that the 
maniest on board the ship did not indicate the shipper and 
destination for all the cargo found during the boarding williams 
said 
he said he did not know where the sudanese ship headed after 
agreeing not to enter the gulf of aqaba he said navy personnel 
left the ship after the diversion 
williams said there had been 170 boardings since the beginning 
of the embargo 139 of them by us ships 
he said 1675 ships had been intercepted

when president bush scrapped a new england 
campaign swing to lobby congress for a deficitreduction plan the 
white house scrambled for a popular cabinet secretary to take his 
place 
the presidents political operatives quickly settled on labor 
secretary elizabeth dole consistently a big draw on the national 
campaign scene 
shes warm sincere and one of the best campaigners ive ever 
seen said steve beaujon a spokesman for gary franks 
congressional campaign in connecticut 
bush had been scheduled to appear for franks on thursday in 
waterbury conn but mrs dole was asked to make the trip instead 
she also was asked to step in for bush at a 1000aplate luncheon 
in boston to raise money for the massachusetts gop gubernatorial 
candidate william weld and senate candidate james rappaport 
mrs dole 54 is campaigning in more than a dozen states this 
fall for more than 60 gubernatorial and house and senate 
candidates 
among bushs cabinet secretaries shes at the top of the list 
of campaigners that gop candidates eye when scouting for big names 
to invigorate rankandfile party members republican officials 
said jack kemp secretary of housing and urban development also 
is in high demand 
she gets down off of the pedestal and she becomes one of the 
many said hillard selck a republican national committeeman from 
missouri 
theres no stay away from me stay behind the barrier im 
too good for you that impresses people they like to be able to 
touch selck said 
sen pete wilson of california has lured mrs dole in twice 
since july to help his gubernatorial race hes made a bid to have 
her back for a third swing right before the november election 
on her last visit to help wilson 600 tickets for a 100aplate 
dinner sold out netting wilson a quick 50000 or more that 
evening said campaign manager otto bos 
mrs dole also has campaigned for rep lynn martin in illinois 
who is trying to unseat democratic sen paul simon gov kay orr in 
nebraska running for reelection clayton williams bidding for 
the governorship in texas gov mike hayden seeking a second term 
in kansas and rep claudine schneider of rhode island attempting 
to oust democratic sen claiborne pell 
part of her draw republicans say is that mrs dole herself is 
a gop success story the harvardeducated lawyer served as 
president reagans transportation secretary before bush nabbed her 
for the labor department post 
shes a good speaker and very dynamic here you have a prime 
example of someone who is a pro who excels at what she does to 
have someone like that showcased for you is a plus bos said 
mrs dole is not without critics 
champions of workers rights give her credit for resurrecting an 
agency widely considered a nonentity during the reagan era yet 
they also wonder if some of her projects such as wellpublicized 
crackdowns on child labor violators and mandatory seat belts for 
jobrelated travel carry much substance 
i dont think anyone in the administration signifies the 
dichotomy within the white house better than liddy dole said 
rep pat williams dmont she presents a kinder and gentler 
face but precious little decisionmaking or leadership 
joseph kinney who runs the national safe workplace institute a 
private watchdog group in chicago contended that mrs doles 
pledge to improve worker safety is all bark and no bite 
still despite her skeptics mrs dole has few enemies on 
capitol hill 
she dismisses speculation that she plans to step down to run for 
the north carolina senate seat now held by terry sanford a 
firstterm democrat up for reelection in 1992 
i have plenty of challenges right where i am mrs dole said 
during a recent interview from her labor department office 
one politician in the familys probably enough for the time 
being she said referring to her husband senate minority leader 
bob dole of kansas but she didnt rule out a future bid for some 
type of elective job 
thats not to say that some time at some point i think if 
youre a person who enjoys people who has been in the political 
system all your life thats a possibility but i have no plans 
to do that now she said

the uss independence the first american 
aircraft carrier to enter the persian gulf in 16 years headed out 
of the waterway today after a brief show of force 
the carrier and its battle group entered the waterway on 
tuesday 
the 79000ton independence left through the strait of hormuz 
the narrow outlet of the gulf in the early afternoon 
the carrier and its battle group were sailing out to the arabian 
sea said a us military source in the region who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in washington a defense department public affairs officer lt 
cmdr edward lundquist confirmed that the independence and its 
crew had left the gulf because they completed their operation 
there 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said we consider the mission 
of the independence in the gulf a success the mission was to 
demonstrate to our friends and allies in the region that it is 
possible to put a carrier in the gulf and carry out operations 
those were the goals and they were accomplished he said flight 
operations were carried out 
he declined to say what the independence would do next 
the carrier with at least 70 aircraft aboard had been inside 
the gulf on a training mission few details had been publicized 
the gulf voyage was seen as a way of showing saddam hussein the 
extent of the us naval air power in the usled military buildup 
confronting him 
the independence was not meant in any way to increase regional 
tensions lt cmdr mark walker a navy spokesman had said 
earlier he said its presence was a visible demonstration of the 
operational capabilities of a carrier battle group to our friends 
and allies in the region 
the independence had been in the northern arabian sea since 
july before iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
aircraft carriers rarely enter the gulf because it is a 
restricted body of water that has a high volume of shipping 
leaving little room for maneuvering there is also only one outlet 
the strait of hormuz in addition its aircraft can reach iraq and 
kuwait even when the carrier is outside the gulf 
the last us aircraft carrier to enter the gulf was the 
constellation in 1974

two trustees of the dartmouth review 
apologized today for an antisemitic quote that appeared in the 
offcampus weekly but they also criticized the college president 
for creating a lynchmob mentality 
students faculty and others at the ivy league school planned to 
rally in protest of the quote by the independent paper known for 
its attacks on minorities president james freedman and other top 
administrators planned to speak 
the newspaper infuriated jews by printing a quote from adolf 
hitler in its latest edition that edition was distributed 
saturday yom kippur the jewish day of atonement and judaisms 
most solemn day 
the quotation from hitlers mein kampf was inserted 
unattributed into the statement of principles on the reviews 
masthead therefore i believe today that i am acting in the 
sense of the almighty creator by warding off the jews i am 
fighting for the lords work 
backlash from the quote prompted the resignation of the reviews 
president and two staffers 
student officials of the independent newspaper said the quote 
was put in by an unknown staffer without the authorization or 
knowledge of editors one called it sabotage and the paper 
offered heartfelt apologies to jews at dartmouth and to the 
dartmouth community at large 
trustees dinesh dsouza and wendy stone apologized at a news 
conference called by the review today 
dsouza lashed out at freedman he called freedman a bully 
who has contributed to the lynchmob mentality on campus 
he said freedman and other administrators have manipulated the 
case to ruin the lives of the staffers at the review 
he said the trustees will contact the jewish organization bnai 
brith to send someone to dartmouth to help investigate the 
incident 
editor in chief kevin pritchett who also has taken over as 
president said he should have been more vigilant i will do 
everything in my power to find the person who did this 
pritchard said that if anything the paper is proisrael 
alumni and even congressmen protested the incident some saying 
conservatives whove supported the review should withdraw that 
support 
about 2000 members of the campus community signed positions 
denouncing the quote 
it was not the first time the paper has attacked jews in 1988 
the review ran a column likening freedman who is jewish to 
hitler and the effects of his campus policies to the holocaust 
on tuesday us rep chester atkins dmass asked his 
republican challenger in the general election john macgovern to 
resign from the reviews board of directors atkins called the 
newspaper nothing more than a fountain of venom 
macgovern an 1980 graduate of dartmouth and one of the reviews 
founders said he would not resign unless a senior editor was found 
responsible for putting the quote in 
a day later an angry open letter to the reviews advisory board 
signed by 84 congressmen was obtained by the associated press 
the letter which originated in the office of reps mel levine 
dcalif called the papers actions inexcusable and offensive 
and said the time has come to end all alumni and public support 
for the review 
students have published the review since 1980 in their numerous 
clashes with the schools administration they have enjoyed backing 
from some of the nations most prominent conservatives 
the reviews 10member advisory board includes syndicated 
columnist patrick buchanan and former us rep james cleveland 
rnh 
in their letter the congressmen said conservatives should no 
longer dirty their hands with this kind of antisemitic racist 
rhetoric 
the letter said the review should not be censored but that 
anyone who supports the paper financially or otherwise must 
understand that by doing so they support its views

convicted bank robber dannie martin has broken 
the rules most of his life so hes not intimidated by prison 
regulations affecting his writing for the san francisco chronicle 
a recent court ruling upheld us bureau of prisons regulations 
that say a federal prisoner cant be paid for writing for a 
newspaper cant be given a byline and cant act as a reporter 
the ruling is being appealed and martin continues to write the 
features and commentary about prison life that have fascinated 
chronicle readers since 1986 
hes not getting paid and his stories dont carry a byline but 
he says he risks additional jail time if he is found to have acted 
as a reporter 
ive been an outlaw so long and saw myself that way ive 
usually been against what rules they had anyway so that doesnt 
bother me as much as it would a square said martin a former 
drug abuser who has spent 25 of his 51 years in prison 
i think the heart of the problem here what really gets them 
worried is the experiences of prison the things that happen in 
here have never been defined in a mainstream newspaper said 
martin who is 10 years into a 33year sentence for two bank 
robberies in washington state 
martin has written more than 40 essays about prison life for the 
chronicles sunday punch section since 1986 
he spent time in solitary confinement at the federal 
penitentiary in lompoc calif after he wrote an article in june 
1988 that warned of a possible riot because of restrictions imposed 
by a new warden 
shortly after that he was transferred to the federal prison in 
phoenix martin and the chronicle then filed suit to challenge the 
rules the bureau of prisons said he violated 
us district judge charles legge ruled in june that the 
regulations were justified by the bureaus authority over prison 
security he said outside newspaper reporting by inmates could 
cause rifts within a prison and improperly focus attention on 
individual inmates 
dan dunne a spokesman for the bureau of prisons said the rules 
were made for security reasons long before martin started writing 
for the chronicle 
reporting for a newspaper from the inside can focus attention 
on individuals and when you focus on individual prisoners it 
could lead to violence or unrest or create situations where you 
have tension within the prison dunne said 
free speech advocates say the rules infringe on freedom of the 
press by denying the chronicle its editorial discretion in 
soliciting freelance work purchasing outside articles and 
deciding who merits a byline 
for their efforts to overturn the regulations martin and his 
chronicle editor peter sussman are to be cited by the society of 
professional journalists at the groups national convention oct 
12 
as the criminal justice system is collapsing all around us it 
is important that we hear articulate voices from inside the prison 
its clear that the government does not want us to hear those 
voices said bruce w sanford a washington dc lawyer who is 
the journalism groups first amendment counsel 
since the ruling the chronicle has published articles by 
martin without his byline describing the prison systems war on 
drug smuggling and a fellow prisoners ordeal when he was wrongly 
accused of having swallowed contraband drugs martin said he is 
working on a story on how prisoners react to very long sentences 
he said the courts should throw out the regulations he is 
challenging because the prison system has enough other rules in 
place against lying or inciting a riot to curb abuses by 
inmates writing for newspapers 
they let people write books and get the money for it or sell 
leather goods or paint pictures that rule against compensation 
is ridiculous theres no logical reason for it martin said 
the prohibition on bylines is nothing but a thinly veiled 
attempt to destroy my credibility he said my readers know me 
and they know thats me writing but if i hadnt established that 
theyd be saying who is this guy and why is he saying these 
things i wouldnt have any credibility 
martin said he would like to get a job as a journalist when he 
leaves prison hes up for parole in february 1992

health and human services secretary louis w 
sullivan told drug dealers thursday to beware of an angry and 
active community as he announced grants of 42 million to 95 
coalitions of community groups 
those who deal in drugs and death will lose this war those 
who deal in community spirit will win sullivan said at a white 
house news conference attended by many of the grant recipients 
let the traffickers and drug dealers take note of what we do 
here today he said they may fear the police but they should 
fear an angry and active community even more 
the community partnership demonstration program to fund local 
drug prevention efforts was part of the initial national drug 
control strategy developed by william j bennett national drug 
control policy director 
our experience indicates that nothing works as well as a 
community mobilized top to bottom to prevent drug use bennett 
said describing the program as remarkably unbureaucratic 
the 95 recipient coalitions generally consisting of a minimum 
of seven organizations or agencies including at least one local 
government were selected from 200 applicants sullivan said the 
money included in the budget for fiscal 1990 which ended sunday 
will cover the first 15 months of the fiveyear program he said 
plans developed by the coalitions will be reviewed he said but 
he rredicted the recipients will receive additional federal grants 
in the future to carry out their programs and that other 
coalitions will be added later 
unlike many federal programs the money will go directly to the 
95 recipient coalitions not to state governments that usually dole 
out federal dollars 
we dont view this as going over the heads of the governors 
sullivan said we view this as working with local organizations 
and these are of course grants that are competitive 
these awardees today are those who really developed the best 
coalitions the best plans and have the best projections for 
future success he said

eight republican senators are helping out a 
democratic colleague by urging louisiana voters to reject the gop 
candidacy of former ku klux klansman david duke 
all of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve 
in the united states senate with david duke masquerading as a 
republican sen john danforth rmo said wednesday 
the senators endorsed democratic sen bennett johnstons 
reelection bid in saturdays louisiana primary election duke 
represents hatred and bigotry and gopendorsed candidate ben 
bagert cant win the senators said 
bagert pulled his ads from a radio station cancelled scheduled 
campaign appearances today and scheduled an afternoon news 
conference 
charles black chief spokesman for the national republican 
party said bagert planned to drop out 
i think thats just the final insurance against duke getting 
any further black said 
five of the gop senators signed an open letter to louisiana 
voters urging johnstons reelection and three more are joining in 
the public endorsement 
duke has no place in our party or in this body their letter 
said the need to speak out against hatred and bigotry far 
outweighs any partisan interest we may have in this election and 
we urge the republicans in louisiana to vote for sen bennett 
johnston 
dukes candidacy and his previous election to the state 
legislature as a republican have caused discomfort for national 
republicans and prompted the republican national committee to 
repudiate him 
sen ted stevens ralaska campaigned for johnston in louisiana 
recently and urged bagert to drop out still the occasion was the 
first any could recall that a group of republican senators had 
urged reelection of a democratic colleague 
johnston is seeking a fourth term in louisianas unique open 
primary election system a candidate can win the election outright 
by receiving more than half of the vote saturday but if no 
candidate achieves a majority the two top votegetters will face 
each other in the general election nov 6 
in addition to johnston duke and bagert a state senator the 
field also includes two political unknowns both democrats 
bagert has run a distant third in polls and the gop senators 
said it appeared he could not win stevens said he took the step 
after seeing three polls each showing bagert with less than 10 
percent of the vote polls have shown johnstons support at around 
50 percent 
the senators said they hoped louisiana voters would give 
johnston a majority saturday and deny duke the opportunity to run 
as the sole republican candidate in the general election runoff 
while the republican tent is a large one and really can 
include just about anyone it has no room for hatred it has no 
room for racism it has no room for antisemitism and some of the 
other things david duke has espoused said sen rudy 
boschwitz rminn 
bagert called the national gop support for johnston 
treachery and denounced the senators 
the letter was signed by boschwitz danforth stevens and sens 
warren rudman of new hampshire and william cohen of maine sen 
dave durenberger of minnesota intends to sign it aides said 
in addition alaska sen frank murkowski of alaska endorsed 
johnston at a news conference with the others and boschwitz said 
sen nancy kassebaum of kansas was joining them too 
should duke win election to the senate stevens said he and 
others would seek to deny him membership to the republican caucus 
in effect ostracizing him 
rick shelby political director of the national republican 
senatorial committee said it still was backing bagert but if duke 
is in a runoff with johnston shelby said my recommendation 
would be that everyone from the president on down endorse bennett 
johnston

auto and truck horns outside the white house 
trumpeted a clamorous lunchhour protest thursday to the 500 
billion package of tax hikes and budget cuts pushed by president 
bush and congressional leaders 
responding to a half dozen demonstrators bearing honk if you 
hate taxes signs motorists leaned on their horns by the scores 
let george bush read your lips one demonstrator dressed in 
a dark pinstripe suit shouted at traffic want to pay 12 cents 
more for gas then honk another yelled 
a majority of motorists and nearly all cab drivers seemed to 
go along with the suggestion eagerly leaning on their horns and 
raising an earrending racket along pennsylvania ave outside the 
white house gates 
several booming blasts from truck horns added to the din 
we figured if we came down here maybe george bush would look 
out the window and say hey whats the racket said amy 
morris an organizer of the protest 
she said she was with the national center for public policy 
assessment a conservative research organization but that 
various groups were participating in the demonstration 
we plan to stage as many highvisibility events as we can to 
protest the package she said 
at the time of the demonstration bush was having lunch inside 
the white house with house speaker thomas s foley to discuss the 
budget stalemate 
although there was no indication that either heard the noise 
the blaring horns were clearly audible throughout the white house 
grounds and inside the press area

china faced severe criticism thursday for the 
handling of its worst reported air disaster with aviation experts 
western diplomats relatives of passengers and a probeijing 
newspaper joining the chorus 
aviation experts and hong kong newspapers questioned chinese 
authorities decision not to evacuate cantons baiyun international 
airport tuesday morning while a hijacked boeing 737 circled above 
for 40 minutes before it crashed into two parked jets killing an 
estimated 127 people 
fortyseven of the deaths occurred aboard a full boeing 757 that 
was parked awaiting takeoff to shanghai 
the management of the airport was in a mess said hong 
kongs wen wei po there should be an urgent review the 
editorial was highly unusual because the paper is considered a 
strident supporter of beijings hardline leadership 
experts and hong kong newspapers also expressed surprise at the 
apparent decision to fight the hijacking attempt with little regard 
for the possible consequences 
chen kaizhi a highranking official of the communist party in 
guangdong province said the pilot was told he could follow 
international practice and fly the hijacked plane outside china 
but survivors of the crash quoted the pilot as saying the plane 
did not have enough fuel to fly to taiwan or hong kong in reality 
both destinations could have been reached chen said 
once the hijacker discovered he had been tricked he either 
detonated explosives or scuffled with the pilot causing the plane 
to lose control and careen into the two parked jets engulfing them 
in a ball of flames 
this is copsandrobbers stuff said one hong kongbased 
aviation expert who spoke on condition of anonymity because his 
company does busiess in china they are playing with hundreds of 
peoples lives and still they want to get the bad guy 
the expert noted that chinese flight crews on previous hijacked 
airliners were also more concerned with thwarting hijackers than 
ensuring the flights safety 
the policy has apparently backfired at least once before 
more than 100 people are believed to have been killed in 1981 
when a jetliner went out of control and crashed after pilots 
struggled to resist an armed hijacker chinas staterun media 
never reported the incident 
chinese survivors also noted this as a factor in the crash 
is killing one hijacker worth the deaths of more than 100 
people one chinese woman said from her hospital bed why 
didnt our leaders just let the plane leave china 
relatives of passengers hurt or killed in the disaster said they 
were angry because chinese authorities gave them no information 
about the crash 
taiwanese relatives had to wait two days to see injured family 
members a group of relatives of the 31 taiwan passengers killed in 
the crash issued a statement blasting the chinese authorities for 
their slowness 
we were anxious and upset that details were only released 30 
hours after the crash the statement said referring to a list of 
dead and injured circulated by chinese authorities more than a day 
after the accident 
a hong kong resident choi manchoi said he learned of the 
death of his brother choi manfat from a news report in the 
british colony on wednesday 
ive had no confirmation from chinese authorities 
whatsoever he said their arrangements are in chaos 
taiwanese and hong kong relatives of deceased passengers were 
told they would have to wait until friday to view the remains of 
their kin richard stites spokesman for the us consulate in 
canton reported that us officials had been turned back at the 
gates of cantons mortuary when they went to view the remains of 
the lone dead american identified by her parents as mary anna 
gilbert a 23yearold english teacher from alexander city ala 
chinas media has so far issued little information on the 
disaster the first official report two sentences from the xinhua 
news agency came about eight hours after the jet went down

iraq could survive for a matter of weeks at most 
against the multinational force in the persian gulf the 
international institute for strategic studies said thursday 
in cold war days nato commanders talked in terms of days and 
weeks of their capacity to sustain conventional battles 
institute director francois heisbourg said at a news conference to 
present an annual survey of global forces the military balance 
199091 
the situation is not very different given the nature of 
conflict in that part of the world he said adding that the 
impact of sanctions on iraq would also mean the conflict would 
not last terribly long 
analysts presenting the report said iraq totally rearmed 11 army 
divisions between the end of its eightyear war with iran in 1988 
and invading kuwait on aug 2 
but president saddam hussein was forced to abandon an attempt to 
raise 10 new divisions 100000 to 150000 troops for his nearly 
1millionstrong army because the nation of 16 million people 
simply does not have enough men the analysts said 
assessing iraqi strength and tactics if hostilities break out 
institute spokesman andrew duncan said saddam likely will turn his 
chemical weapons against civilians because of the difficulty of 
attacking wellprotected and mobile us troops in the gulf 
the institute like american analysts assumes that iraq has 
surfacetosurface missiles capable of carrying chemical weapons 
but duncan said iraq would find it tough to pinpoint us and 
other multinational forces with missileborne chemical attacks in 
the desert while its aircraft would be highly vulnerable to 
airborne attacks 
the institute said the 955000strong iraqi army varied from six 
formidable divisions of republican guards wellpaid and 
politically motivated to poorly armed and trained conscripts 
the army includes seven armored divisions and 40 infantry 
divisions as well as the republican guards which led the kuwait 
invasion 
there are 1 million men in the forces and there are less than 
1 million men aged 18 to 22 in the country duncan said thats 
one of the reasons there are over 15 million egyptian farm 
laborers in the country 
the institute analysts also said iraqi tanks will be highly 
vulnerable to us air attacks if they move in the desert rather 
than acting as static firing platforms heavily defended in the 
desert 
on iraqs nuclear capability institute director heisbourg said 
iraq in a peacetime situation with reasonable access to outside 
markets would be a number of years away from a nuclear bomb 
on sovietus tank strength the survey showed the soviets have 
increased their overwhelmingly superior forces despite the end of 
the cold war and the imminence of a major conventional arms 
reduction agreement 
by early 1990 the report said the soviets had destroyed some 
2600 tanks and converted 500 to civilian use but still had 61500 
main battle tanks compared with 60000 last year 
the united states has 15440 main battle tanks slightly down 
from 15600 last year the institute said 
the institute said the soviets appear to have pulled some 7000 
tanks east of the ural mountains out of the area covered by the 
arms negotiations 
these games are tolerated games as long as the numbers dont 
become wholly unreasonable heisbourg said 
the survey was released a day after the united states and the 
soviet union announced agreement in principle on a major 
conventional arms reduction treaty 
the treaty requiring the sovietled warsaw pact to withdraw 
40000 tanks from eastern and central europe and move them east of 
the urals is likely to be signed at a 34nation eastwest summit 
in november 
draftees into the red army have fallen by 26 percent in the past 
year the survey said it predicted that soviet active forces 
nearly 4 million strong compared with the united states 217 
million will be cut by half into a better equipped and more able 
army 
the institute an international nongovernmental center for 
research on security and arms control is funded by private 
foundations membership fees and sales of its publications

president bush and congressional leaders 
pressed an allout lobbying blitz today for their 500billion 
deficitcutting plan still shy of enough votes to move the 
electionyear plan through the house 
bush and house speaker thomas foley dwash discussed strategy 
at a white house lunch as armtwisting continued on capitol hill 
congressional leaders planned to hold off a vote until enough 
support was assured 
with congress poised to vote on an outline of the budget 
compromise foley and other lawmakers said specific elements of the 
plan could be changed slightly before the package itself comes to a 
vote in two weeks 
they are not necessarily voting for every i and every t in 
the budget agreement summit agreement the speaker said 
the focus of the battle was in the house where despite public 
expressions of confidence by democratic and republican leaders the 
white house and bushs top allies said they did not yet have the 
votes to pass it 
bush wooed 60 republicans over coffee and doughnuts at the white 
house this morning house minority leader robert michel rill 
emerged to say bush had convinced several of the republicans to 
vote for the pact 
but michel acknowledged were not there yet presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said were inching along but we dont 
have the votes yet were getting closer 
democrats and republicans met separately on capitol hill as 
their leaders tried to drum up votes house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo expressed confidence that 130 democrats a 
majority of the 258 democrats in the house would support the 
plan 
we dont have 130 people who said yes count me in but we 
have enough expressing indecision that i think we can get to 
the number gephardt said 
facing a possible vote later in the day sources on capitol hill 
said wednesday night that each side was about 40 votes short of 
getting majority support in the house for the measure with many 
uncommitted members in both parties 
i feel real good about our meeting with the president this 
morning with a number of those who were on the fence michel told 
abctv as he emerged from the white house today several said 
your arguments are compelling the alternatives just are not 
acceptable 
michel said he was still hoping to have the showdown vote today 
bush will absolutely not sign another stopgap spending bill 
without a deficit agreement he said 
we just cant delay any more were up against it said the 
republican leader 
were still worried one democratic staff aide said late 
wednesday were still working hard 
some 27 gop lawmakers made the trip down from capitol hill to 
the white house on wednesday to hear bushs pitch the president 
cancelled a fiveday politicalandholiday trip to new england to 
stay in the capital and keep the pressure on fellow republicans 
bush also dispatched lieutenants to the capitol to buttonhole 
lawmakers in corridors in what one white house aide called the 
administrations biggest lobbying effort 
we have people who have been advocating certain positions 
coming out of the left coming out of the right coming out of the 
broad center and im having to say to them now look lay aside 
that passion for that specific issue and put the national 
interest first the president told reporters 
senate leaders seemed more confident of prevailing in todays 
vote which was to be on a broad outline of the spending plan 
congress will vote in two weeks on a separate measure containing 
the actual spending cuts and tax boosts 
ive got mine unless somebody discovers a time bomb in 
there said senate minority leader bob dole rkan when asked 
if gop senators would support the compromise 
lobbyists for various interest groups also fanned out across 
capitol hill dole for instance was visited by vintner ernest 
gallo who was unhappy with the packages eightfold increase in 
the 3centperbottle tax on wine 
the plan would produce 134 billion in new taxes 109 billion 
in cuts in benefit programs and about 200 billion in reduced 
military spending over the next five years including 40 billion 
in savings in the fiscal year that started monday 
taxes would be raised on alcohol tobacco yachts and other 
luxury items gasoline heating oil and a small portion of the 
incomes of the wealthy 
but since its unveiling sunday after four months of white 
housecongressional bargaining the package has been under attack 
from lawmakers on both ends of the political spectrum 
liberal democrats are unhappy with the 60 billion in cuts in 
medicare especially the 30 billion in higher costs and reduced 
benefits for the elderly and handicapped people 
they also believe the taxes would dispropotionately hurt poor 
people and that the plans 11 billion in tax breaks for small 
businesses were nothing more than a gift to the wealthy 
were making available for the very wealthy an opportunity to 
shelter income complained rep dan rostenkowski dill 
rostenkowski chairman of the taxwriting house ways and means 
committee said he did not know how he would vote but he and other 
lawmakers said they would push for changes in the package before it 
is considered in two weeks 
conservatives were upset with the tax increases and with what 
they considered insufficient spending cuts and benefits for 
business 
rep newt gingrich rga a leader of the opposition said he 
believed the vote was too close to call he had predicted tuesday 
that the supporters would win 
ive had members walk up to me and say theyve gotten so many 
phone calls from their districts against the package that they 
dont know if they can stay with it said gingrich the no 2 
house gop leader 
supporters of the plan readily conceded that it contained 
something for everyone to dislike but they argued it was needed to 
help the economy and no alternative was available 
its sort of an indulgence to pick the agreement apart when 
you dont have anything else to put on the table that has the 
possibility of passing said sen wyche fowler dga who was a 
budget negotiator

chancellor helmut kohl signaled an end to the 
nations wedding celebrations thursday telling germans to expect 
hard work and sacrifices as they rebuild the easts shattered 
economy 
during the first meeting of the new german parliament lawmakers 
from all sides urged that they work together to face the enormous 
tasks ahead 
otto lamsdorff the head of kohls junior coalition partner free 
democrats said the bottom has not been reached in revamping 
the failed businesses in what before wednesday was east germany 
labor statistics showed that 444825 east germans were 
unemployed when the two germanys merged up from 361286 in 
august some predictions say east germanys transition to a free 
market economy after four decades of communism may throw 4 million 
people out of work within a few mnnths 
as the leaders of former east and west germany met in berlins 
warscarred reichstag building the day after unification 
nationwide celebrations were quickly fading into memory 
the german wedding party is over said wolfgang thierse of 
the opposition social democrats now the married couple has to 
earn a living set up a home in a humane way and take care of the 
children 
chancellor kohl said economic recovery will call for great 
exertions and we shall also have to make sacrifices the 
destruction caused in the course of four decades in east germany 
cannot be set right within a few weeks and months 
the chancellor also cautioned that financial demands of 
unification will have to be weighed against the need to keep the 
overall economy sound 
five former east german officials including prime minister 
lothar de maiziere were sworn as ministers in kohls cabinet 
differences in style were immediately evident among the 
lawmakers 
most of those from the west wore dark suits or appropriately 
reserved dresses some of those from the east wore more casual 
clothes and no ties gregor gysi a member of parliament and head 
of the renamed communist party wore a tie but left his top button 
unbuttoned 
quite frankly i feel a little bit like a guest here gysi 
said before his speech 
gysi had pleaded for a preservation of a socialist german state 
or at least some of its advantages in his speech he promised to 
fight for such things as goverment financial support for children 
and the sick 
i warn against using the history of east germany just to 
glorify west germany gysi said noting that even the west has 
poverty and social troubles 
thierse a leading member of the social democrats from what was 
east germany said people are worried about looming massive 
unemployment womens right to work and pensions for the elderly 
thierse also cited the worry that we soon will lose our 
apartments because we wont be able to afford the rent 
the lawmakers spoke at the daylong televised meeting of the 
parliament made up of 144 members from the former east germany and 
519 from the west they will hold office until parliamentary 
elections dec 2 
the reichstag hall was hastily renovated by workers under tight 
deadlines and a giant eagle germanys emblem was brought in 
from the old west german parliament building in bonn and placed on 
the front wall outside the patchedover bullet holes in the 
rugged sandstone buildings walls testify to the heavy fighting 
that raged there as adolf hitlers third reich was collapsing in 
flames 
kohl remarked on the developments that crushed erich honeckers 
communist government in the east and led to unification 
we have been able to restore german unity in freedom without 
war and violence without bloodshed in full agreement with our 
neighbors and partners kohl said 
kohl also paid tribute to the victims of the holocaust and those 
who suffered at the hands of the communists 
kohl later sat impassively as oskar lafontaine the social 
democrats candidate for chancellor berated him for alleged 
mistakes in the unification process 
lafontaine chastised kohl for refusing to disclose the costs of 
unification estimated by some in the hundreds of billions of 
dollars 
he said the mistakes included the promise not to raise taxes 
and an allegedly overly favorable exchange rate given the east 
germans for their nowworthless money 
the bad decisions of the government will cost an extra 100 
billion marks nearly 65 billion a year for the next few years 
lafontaine said 
in berlin authorities freed east germanys spy chief from jail 
but forbade him to leave germany werner grossmann arrested 
wednesday is being investigated on espionage charges 
grossmans organization was a division under former east german 
secret police chief erich mielke mielke and another member of the 
former communist leadership labor boss harry tisch were moved to 
a prison in the western part of berlin on thursday officials said 
both men were arrested earlier this year mielke is being 
investigated for persecution of dissidents and for giving sanctuary 
to west german terrorists while tisch is under a investigation for 
corruption

a supreme court justice thursday refused to 
reinstate campaign contribution limits for californias 
gubernatorial and other state races to be decided next month 
justice sandra day oconnor rejected without comment an 
emergency plea to suspend a federal judges ruling that threw out 
contribution limits imposed by california voters in 1988 
the lower court ruling lets candidates for governor other 
statewide posts and some local offices exceed the contribution 
limits from now until election day nov 5 
us district judge lawrence karlton ruled on sept 25 the 
limits give an unfair advantage to incumbents karlton also tossed 
out a ban on transfers of funds between candidates that was imposed 
by the same ballot initiative 
his ruling invalidated proposition 73 which among other 
things limits individuals to a maximum of 1000 in contributions 
to a particular candidate per fiscal year the measure also limits 
political action committee donations to 2500 or 5000 per 
candidate per fiscal year depending on the size of the committee 
it is unclear what effect the ruling may have on the 
gubernatorial race between democrat dianne feinstein and republican 
pete wilson 
wilson who had only token opposition in the june primary 
raised 125 million through june and had 39 million in the bank 
as of july 1 feinstein raised 81 million through june but had 
only 645344 left over from her primary campaign against state 
attorney general john van de kamp 
the limits were challenged by the democratic party and labor 
unions which said proposition 73 unfairly limited constitutional 
rights to free speech and association 
california assembly minority leader ross johnson a republican 
and independent state sen quentin kopp two of the coauthors of 
proposition 73 asked oconnor to block karltons ruling

president bush today hailed a tentative 
eastwest agreement to reduce conventional forces in europe saying 
it would redraw the military map to match dramatic political 
changes 
he said the agreement announced wednesday in new york would 
pave the way for the signing of the treaty next month in paris at a 
34nation conference 
twentytwo nations will be signatories to the treaty the 16 
nations of the north atlantic treaty organization and the six 
members of the warsaw pact 
bush said that despite the recent easing of tensions throughout 
the region europe is still the site of the greatest 
concentration of armed strength in the world bush said 
bush standing beside secretary of state james a baker iii in 
the white house news briefing room said we must also redraw 
military map of the continent and lift some of the shadows and 
fears lived with for a century 
baker and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
announced the resolution of all remaining major issues on wednesday 
on the most comprehensive arms reduction accord since world war ii 
the two nations next will try to conclude a second pact slashing 
their nuclear arsenals 
success in completing both treaties would carry arms control to 
new heights and contribute to the reduction in eastwest tensions 
bush said that the soviet union and the united states had 
agreed in principle on all the remaining issues on the 
conventional forces in europe treaty and on essential details as 
well 
baker giving some new details of the agreement said that tanks 
would be limited to 20000 each for both nato and warsaw pact 
sides armored combat vehicles to 30000 helicopters to 2000 
baker said that within that ceiling any one country can have 
up to 13300 tanks 13700 artillery pieces 1500 helicopter and 
5150 combat aircraft baker said 
however he said there was still no agreement on the overall 
ceiling on combat aircraft this is still subject to some 
discussion with allies on both sides he said 
baker said he did expect to bring an agreement on overall combat 
aircraft levels to paris for the nov 1921 conference 
baker and shevardnadze both cautioned that final approval must 
await consultation with their allies but if the allies go along 
the treaty should be ready for signing at the summit 
baker flew home to washington on wednesday planning to return 
to new york on friday for a critical meeting with shevardnadze on 
nuclear weapons limits 
they made some headway on cutting intercontinental ballistic 
missiles nuclear submarines and bombers by up to 30 percent but 
after nearly six hours of talks they decided on a oneday break 
baker and shevardnadze want to push on while the soviet foreign 
minister is in new york for the un general assembly session 
the conventional forces in europe treaty will set ceilings on 
nonnuclear weapons that may be deployed in europe but it does not 
cover the number of soldiers that may be put in the field a topic 
baker and shevardnadze agreed to skip in order to meet the paris 
deadline 
shevardnadze said one sticking point remained concerning limits 
on helicopters but that is not very difficult and could be 
resolved by negotiators in vienna who have been working on the 
treaty for 19 months 
the last issues settled were limits on landbased airplanes and 
verification procedures to guard against cheating 
the two superpowers agreed in 1989 to limit their 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons in europe 
in may bush slowed the competition in shortrange nuclear 
weapons by terminating a program to develop more potent us lance 
missiles and deciding to withdraw shortrange us nuclear 
artillery 
bushs action was prompted by a series of moves by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to end the cold war 
a steady withdrawal of soviet troops and tanks and us cutbacks 
already are doing what the treaty seeks to accomplish but a treaty 
represents a formal commitment by both sides 
the conventional arms treaty would require the warsaw pact to 
withdraw 40000 tanks more than 51000 artillery pieces and more 
than 40000 armored personnel carriers from eastern and central 
europe foursevenths to twothirds of estimated current 
deployments 
the arms would have to be moved east of the ural mountains in 
the soviet union about 1200 miles east of the soviet border with 
poland 
the restrictions on the smaller nato forces would be minimal 
requiring only the removal of about 2000 tanks 
artillery strength could be built up to a new ceiling of 20000 
for each alliance the ceiling for tanks would be 20000 as well 
and 30000 for armored personnel carriers 
the soviets agreed to limit navalbased aircraft with a 
statement outside the treaty 
turning to another unfinished arms accord one between the 
united states and the soviet union to cut longrange nuclear 
weapons baker reported that we have been able to make 
substantial progress 
the three major unsettled strategic armsreduction issues are 
the kinds of restrictions to impose on the 154 heavy 
groundbased ss18 intercontinental missiles the soviets will 
retain under the treaty 
whether the soviet backfire bomber is to be classified as a 
strategic weapon as the united states demands that would mean 
counting backfires against limits established in the treaty 
the restrictions to be imposed on us and soviet transfers of 
weapons barred under the treaty to allies from the united states 
to britain for instance

espresso flows at cafes and streetcorner stands 
throughout this caffeinecharged city its served to moviegoers

espresso dental 
it wouldnt fly in topeka dr ron wallach acknowledges but 
in seattle where red neon espresso signs seem nearly as abundant 
as stoplights wallach is booked weeks in advance hes been only 
in operation one month 
its been an overwhelmingly positive response wallach said 
standing in open casual shirt and cotton slacks in his north 
seattle office 
coffee especially the carefully steamed concoctions from 
elaborate espresso machines is as essential to most seattlites as 
a raincoat the brew can be found in video shops and laundries 
movie houses and sporting goods stores and the city boasts nearly 
150 espresso carts on its streets 
wallachs office a former home was split into a reception area 
in front with a pressedwood log burning in the fireplace and a 
silvery espresso machine sitting on a corner stand in the rear are 
three dental chairs including one in a childrens room where two 
stuffed bears sit before coffee cups at a cafe table 
the name is intended to overcome patients fear of dentists 
wallach said 
with the connotations of the word dental its the last place 
youd want to go but espresso is leisure time friends 
conversation 
encouraging further relaxation is sharing lawrence a licensed 
massage therapist whose hands help calm patients traumatized before 
they go under the drill 
coming to a dentist is one of the hardest thing for people to 
do lawrence said when you even mention a root canal peoples 
shoulders go up 3 inches 
lawrence said her massage is a human connection and thats 
whats missing in health care 
the steamed espresso drinks and massages are free to patients 
lawrence said several people have walked in off the street thinking 
they could order a cafe mocha or latte they can if they make a 
donation to greenpeace or the protective animal welfare society 
she said 
wallach talked of opening a fullservice espresso cafe in an 
extension of the office if the business continues to do well 
the experience wouldnt be foreign before his 17 years as a 
practicing dentist wallach helped friends manage a couple of 
vegetarian restaurants in vancouver british columbia he described 
them as places to hang out all night listening to guitar and 
drink coffee he hopes to capture that same atmosphere at espresso 
dental 
its like coming home said patient cherie paulo 35 
espresso dental is just everything i would want in a dentist

the republican senate candidate is 
dropping out of the race leaving former ku klux klansman david 
duke as the only major candidate to challenge the incumbent a 
ranking gops official confirmed today 
charles black the republican partys main spokesman in 
washington said gop hopeful ben bagert planned to drop out and 
urged his supporters to vote for the 18year incumbent democrat 
sen j bennett johnston 
i think thats just the final insurance against duke getting 
any further said black 
asked if national party leaders had urged bagert to drop out 
black replied not exactly 
at the point at which we concluded that it was unrealistic to 
think that he bagert could get into a runoff we sort of 
encouraged him not to carry the thing through he said 
black said it was clear to him three weeks ago that bagert could 
not beat out duke and get into a runoff against johnston 
the party spokesman said that although he and other party 
leaders had no role arranging endorsements of johnston by senate 
republicans we sure didnt discourage anybody 
he added the republican national committee should not endorse 
a democrat while there is a bone fide republican in the race 
johnston is seeking a fourth term in louisianas open primary 
system a candidate can win the election outright by receiving more 
than half of the vote saturday but if no candidate achieves a 
majority the two top votegetters will face each other in the 
general election nov 6 
besides johnston duke a firstterm state representative and 
bagert a state senator the field also includes two political 
unknowns both democrats 
bagert has run a distant third in polls which also have shown 
johnstons support at about 50 percent 
local radio and television stations earlier said bagert had 
canceled all commercials and would announce his withdrawal today 
bagerts staff confirmed that he had canceled all campaign 
appearances and scheduled a 2 pm news conference 
kelly johnston deputy political director of the republican 
senate campaign committee earlier said a runoff between johnston 
and duke would be the worst possible thing that could happen to 
us 
it would allow democrats across the nation to link any 
republican in the november general election to duke she said 
on wednesday eight republican senators in washington urged 
louisiana voters to reject duke 
duke represents hatred and bigotry and bagert cant win the 
senators said 
all of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve 
in the united states senate with david duke masquerading as a 
republican sen john danforth rmo said wednesday

the justice department on thursday stepped up 
its investigation of the steep rise in gasoline prices by 
subpoenaing records of major us oil companies 
the departments announcement that it had sought records from a 
large number of oil companies independent refiners and marketers 
signalled that the civil antitrust investigation was entering a new 
phase 
in august justice department lawyers began informally 
interviewing petroleum industry executives to seek explanations for 
the steep rise in gasoline prices since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
james f rill assistant attorney general for antitrust said 
the records being sought by civil investigative demands cids 
would enable investigators to examine more closely those 
explanations and also pursue some issues for which we dont yet 
have answers 
within two days of the invasion us oil companies raised their 
gasoline prices an average of 4 cents a gallon according to one 
survey another showed that wholesale gasoline prices jumped 95 
cents a gallon in the three days 
the public outcry over price rises of up to 15 cents a gallon 
prompted several major oil companies to freeze or roll back their 
wholesale costs 
we aggressively will pursue this investigation until we 
determine whether or not violations of antitrust law contributed to 
the rise in gasoline prices rill said in a statement 
to establish antitrust violations investigators would have to 
determine that producers refiners or marketers colluded to raise 
prices antitrust laws carry both civil and criminal penalties 
the department has not opened a criminal investigation into the 
price hikes to do so prosecutors would have to convene a grand 
jury 
the federal trade commission the energy department and several 
state attorneys general are assisting the justice departments 
investigation 
rill said the interviews with petroleum industry executives 
developed substantial information about the nature of crude oil 
and gasoline markets and how they behaved in the wake of the august 
2 invasion 
it also provided us with an opportunity to have the parties 
explain the factors that caused them to raise gasoline prices he 
said 
the departments antitrust division will continue to interview 
executives of oil companies as well as independent refiners and 
marketers and collect price and supply information rill said 
the average pump price of gasoline has risen 271 cents a gallon 
since the invasion according to a survey issued this week by the 
american automobile association crude oil prices have nearly 
doubled and the threat of war in the persian gulf have produced 
wild price gyrations on commodities markets 
oil company spokesmen expressed confidence that investigators 
would conclude there was no illegal conduct 
mobil oil corp spokesman john lord predicted that the justice 
department probe would result in the same conclusion that antitrust 
investigators reached when they found no evidence of price gouging 
during a jump in heating oil prices last winter 
when the cold weather passed the prices fell but the 
investigations continued and when the investigations were 
completed as usual they found no price gouging whatsoever lord 
said that will be the case again 
mike libbey a spokesman for chevron corp said that gasoline 
prices went up in august to keep pace with the rising cost of crude 
oil which shot up after the invasion 
we are quite confident there was absolutely no price gouging 
of any kind libbey said

a trendy club is trying on oldfashioned 
justice appealing a court ruling that it was too discriminating 
when it kept out four people who couldnt pass muster with the 
doorman 
a small claims court on wednesday ordered the owner of the 
downtown mayan club to pay 250 each to the plaintiffs who werent 
allowed in on may 19 apparently because of their appearance 
larry nagler a beverly hills attorney representing the club 
said he would appeal the case in superior court 
the plaintiffs meanwhile celebrated the verdict as a victory 
over arbitrary discrimination 
i feel vindicated plaintiff jeff stolzer said this will 
give these nightclubs something to think about 
either there will be some guidelines that are known to 
everybody or they should just stop all door policies altogether and 
let people in first come first serve 
the mayan opened about six months ago in an old porn theater by 
the same name in a custom more typical of new york clubs than west 
coast nightspots getting in is a seemingly mysterious process 
some arriving patrons get waved right in while others must wait to 
be chosen if at all 
the case pitted stolzer kenneth lipton teresita dubrall and 
stephen ambrosini against sammy chao president of the company that 
owns the mayan 
chao testified tuesday that there is no dress code and that the 
doorman is picky about who is let in to keep out people who are 
drunk or otherwise look like trouble that system also saves room 
inside for people with reservations 
stolzer differed he told the court i think we were met at 
the door by a flippant and arrogant doorman they just looked you 
over like you were scum 
the plaintiffs argued that the decisions are arbitrary if there 
had been a posted dress code they said they would have been able 
to comply 
vertigo a nearby club is facing a similar legal problem the 
state alcoholic beverage control department has recommended a 
30day suspension of vertigos liquor license because undercover 
inspectors were refused entry 
the clubs owner has said the state inspectors werent dressed 
properly

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki agreed 
thursday to run for president of poland in a contest that would pit 
him against his former ally and mentor solidarity chairman lech 
walesa 
the decision opens the way for the first popularly contested 
race for president in polish history and for a competition that 
will involve the countrys two bestknown politicians 
when mazowiecki became the first noncommunist head of 
government in the east bloc in the summer of 1989 his nomination 
was engineered by walesa 
since then however walesa has accused mazowieckis government 
of being too slow to privatize the statedominated economy and to 
dismiss former communists from positions of authority in government 
and industry mazowiecki supporters accuse walesa of personal 
ambition and demagoguery 
mazowiecki made his announcement on national television 
the time for an answer has come and today i want to give this 
answer a short one mazowiecki said speaking into the camera at 
the start of the main evening news program 
following great deliberations and consideration of all 
circumstances i have decided to express approval to run for 
president if my candidacy is put forward he said 
one must move forward one cannot retreat from the path poland 
has chosen and fought for so hard this year 
elections are scheduled nov 25 aside from walesa and 
mazowiecki several minor candidates are also expected to seek a 
place on the ballot 
walesa announced his campaign for president sept 16 and held 
his first meeting with potential voters monday in the central city 
of torun 
the office will be vacant because gen wojciech jaruzelski the 
former communist leader last month asked parliament to have his 
sixyear term shortened after 17 months as president citing public 
demands for a popularly elected leader 
the senate passed the final legislation setting up the elections 
saturday and jaruzelski signed it into law monday 
mazowiecki 63 a longtime catholic journalist and former 
political prisoner became prime minister aug 24 1989 
his nomination came after communists failed to win sufficient 
support to govern in partially free elections in june 1989 
for most of the 1980s mazowiecki was an adviser and ally to 
walesa participating in the gdansk shipyard strikes in 1980 and 
1988 that helped to topple communist rule in poland 
supporters of mazowiecki have already begun gathering the 
required 100000 nominating signatures 
it is true we have started to collect signatures said 
halina bornowska spokesman of citizens movement for democratic 
action known by its polish initials road the main group 
supporting mazowiecki 
for the time being we are doing it among ourselves among our 
sympathizers that is why we are not making much fuss about 
it she told the associated press in a telephone interview

pease 23 said it was just as well he didnt discover he was 
running the wrong race right away 
if i had known i was going to do all that i might not have 
finished he said 
when pease discovered the mixup he was going strong and 
decided to finish 
pease said he originally intended to run the marathon but 
settled for the fivemile race because the combination of a hot 
summer and a busy work schedule left him without time to train 
seriously 
peases father charles blames himself for the mixup at the 
starting line 
the races were scheduled to begin within half an hour of each 
other sunday peases father told him to get ready while he went 
back to a hotel to pick up a friend who was taking part in a 
fivemile walk 
in the meantime the gun went off and pease who happened to be 
in the marathon line started the race with thousands of other 
runners he became suspicious after about four miles when he 
noticed that other runners were wearing green and orange tags but 
his was white 
but by then he decided to see if he could stick it out 
peases parents contacted race officials who spotted pease at 
mile 16 
the couple said their son had run 17 miles in the special 
olympics torch light run two years earlier and he was allowed to 
continue after officials checked on him 
we were very proud it was such an accomplishment charles 
pease said the doctor said he was in better shape than a lot of 
them in the race

they had spent 25 hours in rough seas after taking the 10foot boat 
through the marshes of southern iraq into the shattalarab 
waterway and then the gulf 
 
yevgeny primakov a senior adviser to soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev arrived in baghdad carrying a message from gorbachev 
soviet diplomatic sources said its contents were not disclosed in 
moscow gorbachev said he did not think the crisis would lead to 
war and he also told reporters he saw no reason to send soviet 
troops to the gulf 
 
in the jordanian capital amman prime minister toshiki kaifu of 
japan met with iraqi deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan 
ramadan rejected a negotiated settlement to the gulf crisis as long 
as foreign troops remain on arab lands baghdads official iraq 
news agency reported kaifu insisted on iraqs withdrawal from 
kuwait first said shigeo takenaka kaifus spokesman 
 
in saudi arabia king fahd met with french president francois 
mitterrand whom iraqi president saddam hussein has tried to engage 
in separate peace talks linking the invasion with israels 
occupation of the gaza strip and west bank and syrias military 
presence in lebanon there was no immediate statement on the 
saudifrench discussions 
 
in baghdad a radical palestinian group loyal to iraq threatened 
to launch powerful strikes if the united states endangers iraqi 
aircraft while enforcing the un air embargo on iraq the 
statement by the arab liberation front was the second such threat 
in as many days by radical palestinians and heightened fears of a 
terrorist campaign against the western and arab nations confronting 
iraq 
 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said american sailors from the 
frigate samuel b roberts boarded the sudanese freighter blue nile 
and turned it away from the gulf of aqaba williams said no shots 
were fired 
williams said the freighter carrying industrial equipment was 
diverted because the ships log did not account for all of its 
cargo under the un embargo shipments to the jordanian port of 
aqaba a prime port for iraqi cargo has been cut severely 
 
iraq hurting from the international sanctions following its 
invasion of kuwait planned to argue its case before the united 
nations on thursday night the world body which has condemned 
iraqs invasion and placed a naval and air embargo on the country 
may consider stronger measures 
 
an australian newspaper said iraq has set up two interrogation

persian gulf crisis he also said force should be the last 
possible resort for solving this crisis concerning armed 
conflict he said iran will not be participating in this in any 
way the remarks monitored in cyprus indicated iran is 
distancing itself from iraq following earlier suggestions that it 
could circumvent the usled embargo and provide food and 
medicine 
 
the proposed sale of 73 billion in weapons to saudi arabia is 
one step in creating a persian gulf coalition defense against 
the longterm threat posed by iraq to other countries in the 
region according to administration officials in washington the 
sale would be followed by more sales to the saudis next year and 
perhaps to bahrain and the united arab emirates as well 
undersecretary of defense paul wolfowitz and undersecretary of 
state reginald bartholomew told congress 
 
the bush administration is ready to quickly provide two patriot 
antimissile batteries to israel to strengthen its position against 
military action by iraq wolfowitz told congress he said the 
administration is also looking at other ways to help israel but 
bartholomew declined to say whether the us would retaliate 
immediately against iraq if it attacks israel

president mikhail s gorbachev moved to boost the 
output of soviet businesses on thursday by allowing them with 
certain restrictions to negotiate their own wholesale prices 
a presidential decree on prices released by the tass news 
agency was billed as a step toward a market economy it was 
gorbachevs second decree since the soviet legislature on sept 24 
gave him sweeping new powers to rescue the collapsing economy and 
maintain law and order 
economists have said freeing prices to respond to market forces 
rather than having them set by the government is essential to 
curing the economy 
it is unclear however whether the decree frees prices enough 
to make a difference 
the decree says businesses can sign contracts with each other 
for 1991 using negotiated wholesale prices but it then adds three 
restrictions it says the prices must be based on those outlined by 
the council of ministers in june 1988 that profits over a 
stateset limit will be taxed and that wholesale prices of some 
goods will remain fixed 
finance minister valentin pavlov told soviet television the 
decree was a compromise but did not say what the differences had 
been 
a correspondent for the nightly tv newscast vremya said the 
decree should put more goods into the stores by offering price 
incentives for increased production shortages have left many 
stores nationwide bare of such essential goods as flour matches 
cheese and bread 
pavlov insisted the decree has no direct relation to retail 
prices and assured viewers that state subsidies will continue but 
it appeared stores would have to raise retail prices if they had to 
pay more to receive wholesale stocks 
the finance minister said the decree was necessary so businesses 
can know now what prices they will be able to charge and 
therefore how much product to plan in 1991 
in his first decree issued one week ago gorbachev ordered 
businesses to fulfill supply contracts and the government to ensure 
distribution in 1991 he threatened businesses with fines if they 
did not fulfill supply contracts to government retailers 
many workers and businesses are uncertain how they will fit in 
the market economy gorbachev is trying to establish and find it 
more profitable to trade goods on the black market rather than 
distribute them in the established structure 
the supreme soviet legislature is to choose a plan for switching 
to a market economy on oct 15 the most radical blueprint written 
by economist stanislav shatalin calls for junking the central 
planning system and moving to a market economy within 500 days by 
selling factories to private owners and breaking up collective 
farms

three britons who escaped from iraq 
by sea said thursday their fear of iraq sustained them through 
their long hours bobbing in 10foot swells of the open persian 
gulf 
the three rescued wednesday morning along with two frenchman 
off the border city of khafji spent 25 hours in a 10foot 
fiberglass boat floating through the marshes and canals of southern 
iraq down the shattalarab waterway and into the gulf 
they avoided lights used a small compass to navigate and got 
lost several times before being picked up by a saudi coast guard 
vessel 
its a trip i wouldnt like to do again but it was well worth 
it now that i am here mike teesdale 40 told a news conference 
my fear was of iraq not of the trip 
the men said they would fly back to london early friday 
it was the first report of western men escaping iraq in over six 
weeks baghdad has permitted hundreds of women and children to 
leave iraq and kuwait since its invasion aug 2 of kuwait but has 
restricted departures of thousands of western men 
iraq has taken several hundred of the hostages and put them near 
key military and civilian targets describing them as guests 
serving to prevent a military attack on iraq western leaders have 
described them as a human shield 
the britons said they knew of some americans being held near the 
oil installation where they worked south of the iraqi port of 
basra they said they did not want to reveal the information about 
the detainees publicly 
the other escapees were britons ivan manning 44 and keith 
barkworth 36 the frenchman were amedee du paty 53 and janel 
cellier de buriane 55 both barge masters they refused to talk to 
the press on the advice of their embassy 
the britons said they had been planning their trip for a month 
while they had plenty of food and water and were not being held 
at gunpoint they were worried about what might happen if a war 
breaks out over the iraqi occupation 
the conditions were ok teesdale said what we feared most 
was if trouble started who knows what would have happened i just 
dont trust a lot of people in iraq 
actual preparations took one day and it took about four weeks 
to build up the courage to do it barkworth said 
throughout the time the men were pretending to work he 
said 
the boat was readily available to them because of their 
exploration work in the marshes so they chose it over a land 
route they packed the boat with beer whisky vodka and cheese 
sandwiches like they were going out for a picnic 
in hindsight manning joked we hadnt enough ice for the 
trip 
at the last minute at least one briton backed out he said 
they made their way along canals out into the gulf through the 
shattalarab waterway closed to shipping since the 198088 
iraniraq war 
a 10foot swell prevented them from using their diesel engine as 
they tried to follow the shoreline in the gulf past kuwait a rare 
heavy mist and overcast skies helped prevent them from being 
sighted 
the five worked in rotation one on lookout one steering and 
one working the bilge pump 
after 25 hours they thought they were near bahrain but had 
actually gone just 80 miles and were drifting back to kuwait when 
they were found by a japanese barge which notified the saudi coast 
guard 
saudi officials said the men were suffering from exposure but 
all felt fine after a night in khafji

beginning friday seats by exit doors on us 
airlines will be restricted by government order to the ablebodied 
only 
the federal aviation administration regulation says only people 
able and willing to open exit doors in an emergency and help flight 
crews evacuate the airplane will be seated in rows adjacent to 
them 
those barred from seats near exit doors include parents with 
small children people too frail to operate the door passengers 
with broken limbs or other disabilities that would inhibit 
movement obese people children under 15 and the blind 
the faa regulation limits seating in exit rows to passengers who 
can locate the door quickly follow instructions for its use are 
physically able to open the heavy doors and can judge whether it is 
safe to leave the aircraft 
they must also understand verbal and handsignaled instructions 
from flight attendants and be able to get around obstacles to lead 
other passengers off the aircraft 
at the time the regulation was issued last january organizations 
representing the blind called it discriminatory and said it would 
reduce a blind persons chances to survive an airplane crash 
some airlines already bar blind travelers from exitdoor seats 
and several blind people have been arrested in recent years for 
refusing to move from the seats 
a lobbying effort to prevent implementation of the regulation 
proved unsuccessful 
under the new procedures gate agents at each airport will 
assign the exit row seats to passengers who meet the new 
requirements and appear able and willing to perform emergency 
functions 
information cards will be provided at exit row seats describing 
the functions passengers sitting there may have to perform during 
an emergency 
flight attendants will describe these functions before each 
flight 
this is an important safety initiative said william hoover 
executive vice president of the air transport association which 
represents the nations airlines 
airline accidents are rare but when they do happen it is 
essential that the people seated in exit rows are capable of 
hearing and understanding instructions opening emergency exits and 
assisting their fellow passengers in an evacuation of the 
aircraft hoover said 
the faa describes an exit row seat as one from which passengers 
may go directly to an exit without stepping first into an aisle

new england telephone and new york telephone 
have agreed to pay 14 million to the us treasury and cut 
longdistance rates 355 million to resolve allegations they 
overcharged customers through a subsidiary the federal 
communications commission said thursday 
the payment is a voluntary contribution and doesnt constitute a 
fine the fcc said 
under the consent decree nynex corp admitted no guilt and the 
fcc said it made no findings of wrongdoing and was ending its 
enforcement action nynex is the regional parent company of new 
england telephone and new york telephone 
the fcc said in february that it intended to fine the two 
telephone companies 14 million over apparent violations of fcc 
rules governing transactions between regulated telephone companies 
and unregulated affiliates 
the fcc had ordered the companies to return 355 million to 
customers because of alleged 1185 million in overcharges to the 
companies by materiel enterprises co an unregulated nynex 
purchasing subsidiary 
nynex agreed to the 355 million rebate to be made within 30 
days and said the two phone companies would reduce their capital 
accounts by 326 million to remove the alleged excess profits on 
plant and equipment bought from the purchasing subsidiary 
local phone rates wont be affected 
we hope this puts to rest any questions concerning nynexs 
desire to comply with all fcc regulations and policies in 
transactions among affiliate companies nynex chairman william c 
ferguson said in a statement 
the agreement ends one of several pending federal or state 
actions against nynex one of the seven regional bell holding 
companies created in 1984 from the old bell system 
nynex also has been the focus of investigations that new york 
telephone suppliers helped pay for bawdy parties and prostitutes at 
annual conventions of company employees in florida from 1984 to 
1988 nynex has denied that any ratepayer funds were involved in 
the conventions 
in may the justice department filed a onecount criminal 
indictment alleging that nynex had violated the information 
services restrictions in the 1982 consent decree that created the 
regional bell companies nynex denied any wrongdoing 
on wednesday new york state utility regulators authorized a 
study into whether nynex should be forced to divest new york 
telephone 
toby webb nynex vice president for government affairs said 
thursday he could not estimate how much the 355 million rebate 
would affect longdistance prices for new york and new england 
phone customers 
webb said nynex had agreed to the latest consent decree to avoid 
a potentially long court battle over accounting and purchasing 
procedures that no longer were in effect materiel enterprises was 
merged into new york telephone and new england telephone earlier 
this year making materiel a fully regulated company under fcc 
rules 
the agreement is preferable to engaging in prolonged 
litigation over past events and practices which have been 
changed webb said 
the 14 million contribution to the treasury will be paid by 
nynex shareholders webb said and will not affect rates

the communist party on thursday rejected demands 
to abandon the traditional celebration of revolution day on nov 7 
saying such suggestions are unjustified and unfounded 
the mayors of moscow and leningrad have proposed the traditional 
celebrations be scrapped because shortages and long lines give 
russians nothing to celebrate this year 
the anniversary of the 1917 revolution is one of the major 
holidays on the soviet calendar a day usually devoted to praising 
the glories of communism 
but this year instead of plastering cities with propaganda 
posters and carrying giant portraits of marx engels and lenin 
through the streets mayors gavriil popov of moscow and anatoly 
sobchak of leningrad suggested that russians spend the day planting 
bushes and insulating buildings for winter 
the communist party central committees secretariat however 
said in a statement released by the tass news agency that the 
holiday was valid as an outstanding date in the revolutionary 
renewal of the world 
any attempts to deprive our multinational people of its main 
allstate holiday are unjustified and unfounded the secretariat 
the party managers said 
it has become a holiday for all who believe in the creative 
potential of socialist ideas 
in the past revolution day has been marked in the capital by a 
parade of military equipment including tanks and rockets followed 
by a vast peoples demonstration in which hundreds of thousands 
of moscow residents streamed through the citys main avenues and 
across red square 
there at the heart of soviet power members of the communist 
partys ruling politburo and top generals stood on lenins tomb 
the celebration marks the day the bolsheviks seized power oct 
25 by the old czarist calendar nov 7 by the new one introduced 
later 
popov and sobchak urged soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to 
limit the festivities in moscow to a military parade so far he 
has not responded 
may day another major soviet holiday was marked this year by 
counterdemonstrations involving tens of thousands of people in 
moscow as they passed through red square many shouted resign 
and jeered at gorbachev who suffered the embarrassment stoically 
for 20 minutes and then left the reviewing stand

in a measure of how severely the political 
playing field is tilted against challengers a private study 
released thursday found that 95 percent of house incumbents are in 
financially uncompetitive races 
the study by the lobbying group common cause found that only 23 
of the 405 house members who are seeking reelection face 
challengers with comparable campaign funds the other 382 had 
opponents with less than half as much money to spend on a campaign 
or no opponents at all 
the money could serve to protect incumbents against a widely 
reported public disgust with congress said common cause president 
fred wertheimer 
house members are shielded by a wall of political money that 
makes them nearly invincible wertheimer said house incumbents 
will have a free ride in 1990 largely financed by specialinterest 
pac contributions 
of the 119 million total raised by all incumbents so far during 
the election cycle just under half 572 million came from 
political action committees challengers received just 19 million 
from pacs during the same period 
topping the groups list of the financially unopposed was 
rep stephen solarz dny who has nearly 2 million amassed 
against an opponent who hasnt even filed a campaign finance 
report candidates are not required to file unless they raise or 
spend at least 5000 
in all 296 house members faced opponents with less than 25000 
in campaign money or no opponents incumbents in that category had 
a total of 130 million compared with just 11 million for their 
challengers 
another 86 house incumbents were in what common cause called 
financially noncompetitive races where the challenger had 
more than 25000 but still less than half the war chest of the 
incumbent 
the most lopsided was the contest between incumbent democrat mel 
levine in california who had 21 million on hand and republican 
david cohen with just 31000 
the total on hand for lawmakers in that category was 403 
million compared with 79 million for challengers 
seventyeight incumbents had no major party opposition but 
those lawmakers still raised 192 million in the current twoyear 
election cycle more than half of it from pacs

two days after announcing plans to hire 8000 
new police officers mayor david dinkins ordered a freeze on city 
hiring and promotions thursday and was considering 15000 layoffs 
he said the freeze would save 115 million during this fiscal 
year and the next one 
his office of management and budget had recommended the layoffs 
and other agency reductions which dinkins said would cut an 
additional 800 million from an expected budget deficit in fiscal 
1992 of 14 billion 
comptroller elizabeth holtzman meanwhile said the budget gap 
for next year could reach 26 billion she also projected a budget 
deficit in the current fiscal year of as much as 738 million 
the mayor claims the budget is balanced for this fiscal year 
holtzman called for a summit meeting of the citys top fiscal 
officers labor leaders and academic and financial experts to deal 
with the problem 
dinkins issued a statement saying that a recessionary economy 
and the hard times that come with it are facts of life in our city 
and region 
with hard times come hard choices the mayor said we all 
hope and pray for better economic times until they arrive 
however i will continue to impose strict budgetary discipline 
on tuesday dinkins announced a 18 million crimefighting plan 
that included the hiring of nearly 8000 police officers 
mayoral spokesman leland t jones said dinkins has ordered 
budget director philip michael to devise a plan for layoffs to 
determine what impact they would have on city services 
hes inclined to do it jones said 
the last layoffs of such scale were at the height of the citys 
fiscal crisis in 1975 when about 25000 workers were laid off

latest tv ad shows him in a madcap effort to engage republican sen 
rudy boschwitz in debate 
the looking for rudy ad which aired wednesday and thursday 
is a takeoff on the 1989 documentary roger and me in which a 
filmmaker tries to track down general motors chairman roger smith 
to ask him about autoworker layoffs 
the twominute video four times the usual length of a tv 
political spot shows democrat wellstone striding into boschwitzs 
campaign headquarters and senate offices confronting startled 
campaign staff members and getting politely rebuffed 
wellstones newest entry in the tv ad campaign and earlier radio 
and tv ads have prompted boschwitzs campaign press secretary to 
label the challenger a leftist hustler and an abbie 
hoffmantype character 
an oct 14 debate between the candidates tentatively has been 
agreed on and negotiations on two additional debates are under way 
said boschwitzs press secretary jay novak 
wellstone is more interested in dramatic gestures and 
generating notoriety for himself than in advancing any serious 
agenda said novak 
wellstone adviser pat forciea said boschwitz should be the last 
to criticize anyones use of ads 
his entire career has been based on show business and 
ads said forciea who added that boschwitz is spending far more 
on ads than wellstone is 
i guess our peashooters got pretty good aim forciea said

i would like to answer today a question that has been put to me 
for many weeks it is the question about whether i will agree to 
run for the office of president of the polish republic if my 
candidacy is put forward 
this is the question i have been thinking about for many hours 
many days and weeks it was even commonly thought that it took too 
long but this is a question that is very difficult for me 
personally and generally personally with regard to the 
circumstances in which i must answer it and generally in view of 
the great responsibility of this office 
the time for an answer has come and today i want to give this 
answer a short one 
following great deliberations and consideration of all 
circumstances i have decided to express approval if my candidacy 
is put forward 
one must move forward one cannot retreat from the path poland 
has chosen and fought for so hard this year one cannot expose it 
to dangers one has to go forward in a better faster and more sure 
way but along this path not a different one 
poland which has a great chance in todays world and in europe 
should take the place that is due to it of a wise country based 
on christian values of a country of people who are tolerant toward 
each other a country that coexists well with all its neighbors 
i want to defend this line and these values and my decision 
stems from these motives i am making it with a total feeling of 
modesty i know there are many who are more worthy of this 
position i am making it because the historical situation has put 
me in such a position 
this is all i can say today about the difficulty of this 
decision about a broader and further program i will talk at some 
other time 
today i only want to pass my best greetings to all of you who 
are listening to me

another group of americans will be flown out 
of iraq and kuwait next wednesday on a usgovernment charter 
flight the state department said thursday 
the approximate number of americans who will board the flight 
was not disclosed but officials said the total could be significant 
because a boeing 747 has been chartered 
during september about 1900 americans almost all of them 
women and children were allowed to fly out of iraq and kuwait 
the flights were halted sept 22 because the state department said 
virtually all those who wanted to leave and had permission to do so 
had departed 
but us officials asking not to be identified said that since 
sept 22 a number of americans with permission to leave have made 
their presence known to us diplomatic officials and said they 
wanted to return to the united states 
the state department said late last month that at least 900 us 
citizens remained trapped including 600 to 700 in kuwait and 300 
to 350 in iraq 
almost all are adult males more than 100 of whom have been 
detained by iraqi authorities and taken to military and industrial 
sites the iraqis believe the presence of the americans these 
locations will deter a us military attack

here is president bushs statement at the 
white house on thursday on prospects for a conventionalarms 
treaty 
yesterday in the rose garden we celebrated the dawn of a new era 
for germany and welcomed the prospect of a europe whole and free 
but despite these dramatic political events europe is still the 
site of the greatest concentration of armed strength in the world 
as europe is transformed politically we must also redraw the 
military map of the continent and lift some of the shadows and 
fears that we and our allies have lived with for nearly half a 
century 
today secretary baker will describe our latest efforts to 
ensure that the political transformation of europe is matched in 
the military field in our negotiations to reduce and limit 
conventional armed forces in europe the socalled cfe talks 
some of you here will remember when in may of 1989 at the nato 
summit i proposed a series of initiatives to quicken the pace in 
cfe and i pledged then to devote our full effort to the speedy 
conclusion of a cfe agreement a treaty that would decisively 
improve the balance of military power on the continent and back our 
hopes for lasting stability 
we followed through on that commitment and there is still 
lets face it more work to do and i want to remind you that cfe 
is not an accord between the united states and the soviet union it 
will be a treaty among 22 states east and west all must be 
satisfied with the treatys provisions 
weve consulted repeatedly with our allies about our efforts 
both before new york and then during the many talks up there we 
believe our allies are pleased with the progress being made 
pending further consultation with our nato partners we have agreed 
in principle with the soviet union on resolution of all the major 
remaining issues in cfe and on many of the essential details as 
well 
along with our allies we will continue to push to complete this 
treaty next month so that the way is clear for convening a csce 
summit in paris 
in conclusion i want to thank the secretary of state and the 
people that have been working with him during these negotiations 
and let me just say how pleased i am with the progress that we have 
achieved here 
and i would like to now turn to secretary baker who has a 
statement and then hell be glad to take your questions well done 
good luck to you

the official gop candidate dropped out of 
louisianas us senate race thursday to boost the democratic 
incumbents chances of defeating exku klux klan leader david duke 
without a runoff 
state sen ben bagerts withdrawal turned saturdays senate 
primary election into essentially a twoman race between threeterm 
sen bennett johnston and duke a state legislator who is running 
as a republican without party support 
bagerts name will remain on the ballot but the secretary of 
state fox mckeithen said votes for bagert would not be counted if 
he formally notified state officials he was out that makes it 
almost certain one candidate would get more than half the votes and 
avert a runoff 
national gop leaders had openly expressed fear that bagert would 
pull enough votes to force duke and johnston into a runoff nov 6 
with duke on the ballot labeled as a republican the race could 
hurt gop candidates nationwide 
all of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve 
in the united states senate with david duke masquerading as a 
republican said sen john danforth rmo 
bagert said his polls indicated that dukes support was 
unwavering and that the bagert ads were drawing votes from 
johnston 
as my campaign finally began to get on track in the last 
couple of weeks bagert said it became more and more apparent 
that instead of forcing a runoff between myself and bennett 
johnston i might very well be forcing a runoff between somebody 
else and bennett johnston 
after announcing his decision bagert was asked if he would vote 
for johnston yes reluctantly he replied im not endorsing 
anybody but im not voting for david duke 
duke and johnston said bagerts withdrawal was good news 
its been a twoman race for some time and this makes it very 
clear the bagert vote kind of confused things said johnston 
im very much hoping that that bagert vote which has been about 
8 percent would come to me 
i think if he gets out well just have to whip johnston in the 
first primary duke said he called it a clear choice between a 
liberal and a conservative 
louisianas unique open primary system puts all candidates on 
one ballot regardless of party if no one gets more than 50 
percent of the vote a runoff is held between the top two 
votegetters 
despite several polls that have shown him a distant second to 
johnston in recent months duke said his own polls show him running 
even with the incumbent he said bagerts withdrawal will help him 
win the election because he will pick up bagerts votes 
but pollster joe walker said bagerts decision kind of decides 
it for johnston 
the polls ive seen indicate that the bagert vote is not a 
duke vote said walker bagert has run as a very strident 
antiduke candidate from the very beginning so as a result the 
vote he did attract is not one that would transfer to duke 
although johnston has voted a conservative line on such issues 
as defense spending and aid to the nicaraguan contras he was 
attacked by duke and bagert as an ultraliberal one reason was 
his lead role in defeating former president reagans nomination of 
judge robert bork to the supreme court another was his support of 
the civil rights act of 1990 which his opponents said would impose 
racial hiring quotas on american businesses 
im going to vote for the things the people of this state want 
and now were going to have a clearcut choice and i can win on 
saturday said duke who has run a campaign calling for welfare 
reform and an end to affirmative action programs 
but the most recent poll indicated johnston could eke out a 
firstballot victory even with bagert in the race 
the poll released wednesday by masondixon opinion research of 
columbia md showed johnston was the choice of 53 percent of 
voters surveyed duke drew 26 percent while bagert polled 8 
percent thirteen percent were undecided according to the poll 
which had a margin of error of 35 points the poll of 825 
registered voters was taken sunday through tuesday 
still masondixon officials and other pollsters generally agree 
that duke has hidden support as susan howell a pollster at the 
university of new orleans put it duke flies under radar 
bagert had been endorsed by president bush in radio and 
television ads but polls consistently showed him running a poor 
third 
eight republican senators from other states endorsed johnston on 
wednesday a move johnston called unprecedented in party politics 
in washington charles black chief spokesman for the republican 
party said bagerts withdrawal was just the final insurance 
against duke getting any further 
three minor candidates also were on the ballot but one dropped 
out earlier this week to help johnston the others werent 
expected to affect the outcome

education secretary lauro cavazos vowing to 
protect the integrity of the federal student aid programs on 
thursday stopped funding to 14 trade schools for alleged violation 
of rules 
using emergency authority granted the education department less 
than two weeks ago cavazos said an investigation found the 
forprofit institutions violated rules governing student financial 
assistance programs including falsifying student records and 
misrepresenting education programs facilities tuition and fees 
we are honoring our pledge to take action against those who 
would abuse such programs cavazos said in a statement 
the schools named include transwestern institute and 
metropolitan business college both of long beach california 
balin institute of technology atlanta metropolitan business 
college port orchard wash and hartford modern school of 
welding hartford conn 
nine others are located in florida they are cocoa beach beauty 
college cocoa beach national beauty academy tampa titusville 
beauty school titusville and various romar schools in winter 
park palm bay merritt island melbourne and kissimmee 
the schools will have an opportunity to show cause why the 
sanction should be lifted 
cavazos action is the first under regulations implementing the 
student loan reconciliation amendments of 1989 which became 
effective sept 21 those rules say that funds may be withdrawn 
from a school and its students if there is reliable information 
that the school is violating the law and immediate action is 
necessary to prevent misuse of federal funds 
according to officials the emergency actions taken against the 
14 schools were based on 
falsification of student records 
using the availability of federal student aid funds to recruit 
students to an institution that has misrepresented its education 
programs facilities tuition and fees or the employment prospects 
of its graduates 
failure to make required refunds to students who withdrew prior 
to graduation 
approving federal financial aid for students enrolled in 
ineligible programs 
failure to account for federal funds received 
approving federal financial aid for students who did not have 
the ability to benefit from the training

the informer was supposed to fight 
crime by printing the names of everyone arrested for a crime in the 
st petersburg area but readers of the newspapers very first 
issue were misinformed 
the informer erroneously reported that a man had been arrested 
on a cocaine charge costing him his job the newspapers 
publisher ray aden is contrite but still believes his publication 
can serve its purpose 
unfortunately he said some people might be hurt 
he was relying on his people to be accurate and one of them 
messed up said shawn exposito 23 who was fired from his 
500aweek job as a carpet installer just a month after the birth 
of his third child it couldnt have come at a worse time 
aden said he will print a retraction and do everything he can to 
help out exposito but that doesnt include an offer to make up for 
his lost income 
expositos boss at mampm floor co coowner bert butler has 
tried to help by giving him a lesser job at half the pay until his 
previous position reopens butler already had hired someone else to 
replace his employee of eight years 
even before its first issue the informer drew skeptical 
comments from civil libertarians concerned that it would overlook 
the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven 
the informer correctly printed that exposito was arrested last 
month for driving with a suspended drivers license it also 
printed that he was arrested on a cocaine charge which jail 
records show is inaccurate 
butler saw the drug arrest item friday and fired exposito the 
next day 
maybe i acted a little too quickly but still in my business 
im sending this man into another persons house butler said 
would you want a drug addict someone thats thought of as doing 
drugs in your home i know i wouldnt 
exposito took work in the carpet warehouse until his old job 
opens up 
its a raw deal for shawn butler said these people 
shouldnt print anything before they get the facts straight 
aden said he is still trying to determine how the mistake was 
made and is trying to find another job for exposito 
he calls me sometimes two or three times a day exposito 
said im sure hes losing sleep over this probably not as much 
as i am

the flag atop the royal palace flew 
at halfstaff thursday as the family prepared to bury princess 
carolines husband killed in a speedboat accident defending his 
world champion title 
a public funeral for stefano casiraghi was scheduled for 
saturday morning at the cathedral of monaco three days after he 
died during the world offshore championships the palace announced 
the 41 other boats competing in the event withdrew from the 
third and final round also scheduled for saturday and planned a 
memorial mass on friday followed by a wreathlaying at sea 
organizers said 
several racers competing wednesday against the 30yearold 
casiraghi said he was driving too fast to handle the choppy water 
one newspaper called his boat a floating coffin 
the catamaran which hit by a large wave somersaulted and 
casiraghi slammed into the water 
the principality press office said casiraghi was strapped in to 
a seat in the boat but was standing as was his custom at the time 
of the accident 
that explains why he died on impact said a spokesman 
adding that casiraghis head caught the brunt of the crash in a 
seated position the driver has some protection in his plexiglass 
cockpit 
race organizers had announced the resumption of the competition 
saturday saying the interrupted second round would be abandoned 
but organizers speaking at a news conference said all 41 
remaining boats withdrew from the competition and the 1990 offshore 
championships were canceled 
press reports said casiraghi had told his family he would quit 
racing after the championships in a letter reproduced in the 
events official program casiraghi paid homage to caroline 33 
who supported me throughout despite the fears that i caused her 
 
it was not immediately clear whether casiraghi would be buried 
in the royal familys tomb or in the casiraghi familys chapel at 
fino mornasco in italy 
residents of the principality but not tourists were allowed to 
file past casiraghis body in a mortuary near the princess grace 
hospital 
he lay in a simple brasshandled mahogany coffin still wearing 
the redandwhite racing suit in which he died there was a slight 
cut under one eye 
a press aide to the royal family said caroline went to the 
mortuary wednesday night after hurrying back from a visit to 
paris and again thursday morning she was described as composed 
and dignified 
prince rainier iii who never married after the death of former 
hollywood star princess grace eight years ago in a car accident 
spent the day at the casiraghi home not far from the palace 
according to press reports 
several drivers and crew members while expressing sorrow at his 
death said casiraghi was going too fast and should have realized 
he was risking death 
the guy was driving like a madman said simon fletcher a 
british mechanic for one of the other boats all the other boats 
had slowed down after the first buoy after it the water got 
rough 
nice matin the main regional newspaper claimed the pinot de 
pinot was a floating coffin its design illsuited to its 
enormous potential for speed 
bruno plchetti another italian driver was quoted as telling 
the newspaper francesoir we were going much too fast but 
nobody wanted to slow down because we wanted to catch the ones in 
front of us including casiraghi 
several people connected to the offshore racing circuit said 
casiraghi normally has his own helicopter rescue crew flying near 
his boat during a race but did not have one in the air wednesday 
shops and businesses in monaco remained open thursday and 
streets were busy throughout the city there were posters 
promoting the speedboat race showing a picture of casiraghi and 
his copilot patrice innocenti 
according to other racers innocenti who was injured was 
handling the steering while casiraghi was controlling the throttle 
of the boat the 42foot boat flipped over while ahead of the pack 
at the start of the second round 
innocenti ejected but casiraghi did not as the twoengine 
fiveton boat slammed into the water upside down it sank moments 
after rescuers reached it 
casiraghi had competed in offshore racing since 1984 winning 12 
of 80 races including last years world championship held off 
atlantic city nj 
caroline the oldest child of prince rainier and princess grace 
divorced french playboy philippe junot in 1980 she married 
casiraghi on dec 29 1983 in a simple civil ceremony under a 
portrait of her late mother 
they had three children andrea 6 charlotte 4 and pierre 3

a house subcommittee approved a bill thursday 
that would put into federal law a womans right to an abortion as 
ruled in the supreme court decision roe vs wade 
the language of the bill is drawn directly from roe said 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights 
he said the freedom of choice act was necessary to preserve the 
reproductive options women have had since the supreme court 
decision was issued 
it is clear from recent supreme court decisions that roe is in 
jeopardy edwards said american women can no longer rely on 
the courts to protect their right to choose nor can we leave this 
vital issue up to a patchwork of state laws 
five democrats voted for the bill and three republicans voted 
against it the action came after two days of hearings a similar 
version is pending in the senate 
edwards said he would press the house leadership for speedy 
consideration of the measure however time is running out on the 
session and the prospects of the bill making it through congress 
this year are dim 
rep christopher smith rnj said he would welcome a floor 
fight on edwards bill calling it an abortion on demand 
measure 
although smith said it was unlikely to reach the floor during 
the current session he said the bill would seek to overturn many 
state laws restricting abortion 
among other things he said it would override state laws 
requiring spousal and parental consent for the procedure 
republican reps william dannemeyer of california and james 
sensenbrenner of wisconsin offered a host of amendments seeking 
provisions restricting abortions under certain circumstances and 
each failed by a straight party line vote 
i think the bill is an extremist bill said sensenbrenner 
who failed in an attempt to attach an amendment permitting states 
to enact laws shielding physicians who refuse to perform abortions 
for religious or moral reasons 
this goes far beyond the scope of roe vs wade he said

the loss of wetlands on private lands slowed 
significantly during the mid1980s agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said thursday 
yeutter said new figures by the departments soil conservation 
service indicated wetland losses ranged from 100000 to 200000 
acres per year from 1982 to 1987 including areas that reverted to 
open water 
this was significantly less than wetland loss estimates 
before 1982 he said 
no previous conservation service estimates were available 
spokeswoman diana morse said the agency began its fiveyear surveys 
in 1977 the new figures comparing 1987 with 1982 were the first 
she said 
the new figures came from the agencys 1987 national resources 
inventory or nri which is conducted on nonfederal lands every 
five years in cooperation with the iowa state university 
statistical laboratory 
officials said the inventory serves as the main source of 
information on the status condition and trends of soil water and 
related resources it also provides a soilandwater data base for 
nonfederal rural lands 
the report said there were about 82 million acres of wetlands on 
nonfederal rural lands in 1987 down from 832 million acres in 
1982 a decline of nearly 12 million acres 
however the service estimated the loss of wetlands to 
agricultural and development uses at closer to 500000 acres 
or an average of 100000 acres a year 
the remaining change in wetlands was due to factors such as 
300000 acres changing from private to federal ownership still 
likely remaining in wetlands but not included in the services 
nonfederal lands inventory and over 400000 acres that changed 
to open water primarily adjacent to the great salt lake in utah 
and in southern louisiana the report said 
of the nearly 500000 acres lost to agriculture and development 
about 215000 were converted farmland including wetlands drying up 
because of drought and about 280000 acres to development 
regionally the inventory indicated wetland losses over the 
fiveyear period were greatest in the southeast mississippi delta 
states and the great lakes states 
losses were reported at 170000 acres in the southeast 150000 
in the delta and 80000 in the great lakes 
morse said that there were no available breakdowns by state and 
that the service considered those estimates too inexact for 
publishing she said the regional estimates were the only ones the 
agency had available at the present time

a vaccine that prevents bacterial meningitis 
and other lifethreatening diseases now can be given to infants as 
young as two months to protect them when they most need it 
the food and drug administration in approving thursday use of 
the vaccine at younger ages said new studies show it is safe and 
effective for these infants and could prevent hundreds of deaths a 
year 
the vaccine was approved in 1988 for use in children 18 months 
and older and later for use in children 15 months and older 
however bacterial meningitis and other diseases caused by the 
haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria take their heaviest toll in 
infants ages six to 12 months 
the vaccine has significantly reduced incidence of the 
haemophilus b diseases in children 18 months and older but 
physicians still diagnose about 10000 cases of haemophilus 
meningitis a year mostly in children under 18 months the fda 
said 
about 500 of these children die and of those who survive about 
3800 children suffer blindness deafness mental retardation and 
other neurological complications the fda said 
when the vaccine was first approved federal health officials 
said data were not available to show the vaccine was effective in 
younger children 
but a recently completed twoandahalf year multiracial and 
multiethnic study of more than 60000 infants less than six months 
old showed the vaccine was safe and would protect against the 
haemophilus b diseases the fda said 
the vaccine can be given at the same intervals as the 
diphtheria tetanus and pertussis vaccine two months four months 
and six months the agency said a booster dose would be given when 
the child is 15 months or older 
researchers found only mild and transient side effects among the 
infants in the study including swelling and warmth at the 
vaccination site and occasional fever 
besides bacterial meningitis the vaccine is effective against 
epiglottitis which is an often fatal inflammation of the flap that 
covers the breathing tubes pneumonia septicemia and septic 
arthritis 
the vaccine is not effective against viral meningitis 
the vaccine marketed under the name hibtiter is made by praxis 
biologics inc and is distributed by lederle laboratories both

rep ralph regula rohio had hoped to spend 
wednesday evening in the presidents box at the kennedy center 
watching the playboy of the western world with constituents 
but the white house took away his seats because he opposes the 
giant deficitreduction bill that president bush and congressional 
leaders are trying to ram through congress regula said thursday 
regula said he received a telephone call wednesday from a white 
house lobbyist seeking his support for the package of tax increases 
and spending cuts 
when he said he remained in opposition it was clear the box 
wasnt available 
the congressman bought six tickets on his own for the play 
there have been better moments he said 
regula and his wife had planned to use the seats with two 
couples who had won a trip to washington at an annual charity 
auction for aultman hospital in canton ohio 
members of congress and the cabinet may use the presidents box 
when the president is not there and they frequently do but the 
president controls the tickets 
regula said he opposes the budget measure because its 134 
billion hit poor people too hard and because it doesnt shrink 
spending enough 
white house spokesman stephen hart said he was not aware of the 
incident

black community leaders worried that police 
may be preoccupied with finding a serial killer have mobilized to 
help track down the killer of a black college professor 
charles w thomas a professor at the university of californias 
san diego campus was found mortally wounded in his car friday 
night his death has prompted james del rio a retired michigan 
judge and legislator to organize a reward fund for information 
leading to an arrest 
i think black people owe him they are indebted to him and im 
seeking to get them to repay it said del rio he used to have 
a famous saying dont mourn organize thats what were trying 
to do 
del rio a longtime friend of thomas made a personal 1000 
donation to start the fund this week 
by thursday he said the fund had reached 4200 
though he said he would work closely with police and the local 
crime stoppers chapter del rio said the fund is an independent 
effort by the black community to try to help bring thomas killer 
to justice 
police spokesman bill robinson said the department welcomes 
assistance from the black community and will take the tips passed 
on to investigators seriously 
theres no law preventing citizens from helping police and as 
long as these efforts dont interfere with our investigation we 
welcome the help robinson said 
del rio noted that the police departments resources are being 
taxed by the manhunt for a serial killer believed responsible for 
the murders of five women in san diego this year 
theyve got more murders going on than this one thats why i 
feel the black community should get off their duff and do 
something he said 
robinson insisted that the police department is working 
vigorously to solve the thomas case despite the personnel drain 
caused by the serial killer investigation 
thomas 64 died saturday at a hospital before he died he was 
able to describe his attacker but police had not determined a 
motive 
a lot of people are trying to catch the peron who committed 
this crime said the rev george walker smith who is black 
white folks do it all the time black folks dont i dont know 
why but now were trying to do this so whoever did this gets 
caught 
smith pastor at christ united presbyterian church in southeast 
san diego contributed 1000 to the reward fund 
businessman hartwell ragsdale said he contributed 1000 because 
weve had too many unsolved murders in the black community 
the black community must do what we can do to see to it 
that the people who are destroying our leaders and other citizens 
are brought to justice 
memorial services for thomas were scheduled friday at ucsd and 
at the first united methodist church at the college flags flew at 
half staff this week in memory of thomas a psychologist and urban 
studies professor at the university since 1971 
thomas sometimes surprised people with his teaching methods 
which were geared toward helping people understand root causes of 
societal problems for instance to help his students understand 
racism thomas brought white supremacist tom metzger into the 
classroom 
thomas didnt consider that reading a persons work was 
enough he wanted the students to see for example that racists 
truly believed in racism said cecil lytel a provost at ucsd 
he took teaching beyond teaching and created lasting learning 
experiences for his students

two california producers of adult videotapes 
were charged thursday with violating federal obscenity laws by 
shipping what prosecutors called hardcore pornography to oklahoma 
the indictment of the president and vicepresident of a van 
nuys calif video company stakes out our commitment to 
aggressively pursue largescale producers of illegal hardcore 
pornography attorney general dick thornburgh said in a 
statement they will be pursued in every state in the nation 
the indictment returned in tulsa okla is one of the few 
federal obscenity cases brought against producers of pornography 
officials said 
the justice departments pornography unit which has generally 
targeted distributors rather than producers has been criticized by 
civil libertarians since it was begun in the reagan administration 
sidney niekerk the president of cal vista ltd of van nuys 
calif and jack gallagher the companys vice president were 
charged in the fivecount indictment with shipping four movies to 
broken arrow okla 
the indictment which also named the company as defendant 
charged the two with conspiracy interstate transportation of 
obscene material aiding and abetting and engaging in a business of 
selling obscene matter 
if convicted niekerk and gallagher could be sentenced up to 25 
years in prison and fined as much as 125 million the company 
faces a maximum fine of 25 million 
the indictment resulted from a series of 24 searches in the los 
angeles area conducted earlier this year by the the fbi and los 
angeles police the justice department said 
the videocassettes showed a variety of sexual acts including 
group sex and lesbianism the department said 
denver defense attorney arthur schwartz who represents niekerk 
said evidence will show that the company had never shipped its 
videocassettes to oklahoma until it was lured into doing so by 
undercover federal agents 
they were really ensnared into doing it schwartz said 
the lawyer charged that justice department chose to bring 
charges against his client in oklahoma to take advantage of 
conservative moral standards in that part of the country 
the approach of the government in trying to regulate access to 
sexually oriented material is to go to the most conservative areas 
in the united states in an effort to pressure companies located in 
more liberal areas out of existence schwartz said 
are the people in tulsa going to decide what the people in new 
york feel they have a right to have 
federal juries are allowed to apply prevailing community 
standards in deciding whether material is obscene what may be 
found to be obscene in utah or oklahoma may not be considered so by 
a jury in another federal jurisdiction

nasa suffered another setback 
thursday when a toppled beam was found inside the space shuttle 
atlantis but the countdown continued for the scheduled weekend 
launch of discovery 
the space agency also faced another hurdle in a washington 
dc courtroom a federal judge took under advisement a request by 
antinuclear activists to halt discoverys launch because its 
satellite is powered by highly radioactive plutonium 
he did not say when he would rule the satellite called 
ulysses is being sent to study the sun in the discovery mission 
scheduled for liftoff saturday 
the 70pound metal beam painted bright yellow was accidentally 
left by workers inside atlantis engine compartment said forrest 
mccartney director of kennedy space center the beam was heard 
crashing around in the compartment wednesday when the orbiter was 
being raised into an upright position in the assembly building 
workers found the 8foot11inchlong beam on a pile of cables 
inside the compartment after the solid fuel booster rockets and 
external tank were attached to the orbiter thurday 
mccartney said a quick survey of the compartment found that 
insulation covering some components and plumbing had been dented 
he said it was too soon to tell if the accident will delay 
atlantis secret military flight scheduled for early november 
atlantis mission already is four months late because of 
hydrogen fuel leaks that grounded the craft in june the leak 
repairs were completed friday 
the beam which had been used in a work platform was left by an 
experienced crew mccartney aid the paperwork indicated everything 
had been removed he said 
it should have been caught and wasnt mccartney said 
mccartney said he did not see any connection between the latest 
mishap and other accidents this year involving the shuttle fleet 
an investigation board concluded last week that workers failure to 
follow procedures and improper use of a clamp led to an accident 
involving a thruster in july 
the thruster one of 14 on discoverys right orbital maneuvering 
system pad was dented when it fell off a work stand 
i dont think we can say procedures were a problem with 
atlantis mccartney said i dont think we can say training was a 
problem i think what we can say is that we did not do the job in 
the way we intended to do it 
an investigative team was being formed to look into the matter 
nasa officials also were reviewing discoverys paperwork and 
equipment inventory to make sure nothing was overlooked in that 
shuttles engine compartment 
brewster shaw deputy director of shuttle operations said he 
did not anticipate any problems with discovery 
in washington the activists said they fear an accident like the 
explosion of the shuttle challenger would spew the deadly plutonium 
over florida 
the same judge oliver gasch of us district court refused to 
interfere with atlantis launch last october with a 
plutoniumpowered satellite bound for jupiter 
the activists in their latest action cited nasas inability to 
launch a shuttle in nearly half a year columbia like atlantis 
has been grounded for months by hydrogen leaks 
ulysses carries nearly 237 pounds of plutonium238 half as 
much as the jupiter satellite the decaying plutonium will provide 
electricity for ulysses during its 186 billionmile journey 
through space to place it into an orbit over the suns poles 
ulysses will be sent to jupiter to be kicked back by the planets 
gravity 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
insist a plutonium generator is the only way to power ulysses 
through its long journey solar panels large enough to collect 
light as far away as jupiter could have been built but they would 
have added so much weight to 807pound spacecraft that there would 
not be a powerful enough launcher to lift it said derek eaton 
ulysses project manager for the european space agency 
the agency provided the 250 million spacecraft 
nasas environmental impact study on ulysses indicates a less 
than one in 1 million chance of an accident resulting in a 
plutoniumrelated cancer death an energy department team of 70 
people is setting up radiationmonitoring equipment as a 
precaution 
after ulysses is released from discovery a twostage engine and 
a smaller booster engine will send it hurtling toward jupiter at a 
record speed of 34450 mph after jupiter gives it a gravity 
slingshot it will pass over the suns south pole in 1994 and the 
north pole in 1995 
scientists expect to know whether ulysses is safely on its way 
shortly after the last engine fires and the spacecraft separates 
from the booster about 7 hours after liftoff 
ulysses ready to go since 1983 was assigned after several 
launch delays to a may 1986 flight aboard challenger the shuttles 
explosion earlier that year resulted in the spacecraft being put 
back in storage 
if discovery does not lift off by oct 23 the mission will have 
to wait 13 months for the proper planetary alignment 
it success is important for the project because weve been 
around for a long time and a delay means a delay in science and 
more money said willis meeks nasas project manager for 
ulysses but i think it would be very important to the morale of 
all of us in this business to see the shuttle flying again

a special counsels report that recommends an 
ethics investigation proceed against sen donald w riegle jr 
gives important weight to the timing of a fundraiser held by 
savings and loan figure charles h keating jr sources close to 
the probe said thursday 
the march 23 1987 fundraiser occurred just before meetings 
between senators and us banking regulators 
five senators intervened with regulators on behalf of keating a 
major political donor as his sampl headed for collapse 
also influencing the recommendation was a brief discussion about 
keating between riegle and the top us thrift regulator edwin j 
gray on march 6 1987 the sources said riegle suggested gray 
meet with senators and such a meeting occurred the next month 
the information on bennetts report was confirmed to the 
associated press by sources who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
the ethics committee is looking for any connections between 
actions by the senators and the 13 million in political donations 
they received from the businessman and his associates 
congressional sources previously confirmed that special counsel 
robert s bennett recommended the probe continue against riegle 
dmich and sens alan cranston dcalif and dennis deconcini 
dariz 
he also proposed that two senators be dropped from the 
investigation john mccain rariz and john glenn dohio 
mccain met with the committee privately thursday a day after a 
similar session with glenn the other three senators are to appear 
over the next two weeks 
emerging after about three hours mccain said he felt good 
about the session and predicted he would be exonerated before the 
senate adjourns later this month 
the senator said the investigation has been politically damaging 
and that arizonans will judge my conduct by the outcome of the 
inquiry 
i refuse to believe the ethics committee would be motivated by 
political concerns said mccain the only republican among the 
five 
if his case is dismissed only democrats in the senate would be 
under investigation for their roles in the savings and loan mess 
in the recommendations on riegle one source said bennett was 
throwing up for committee the possibility that when a political 
contribution is so close to an event is there way it cannot be 
connected 
hes wrestling with a new concept not articulated before in an 
ethics ruling the source said theres never been a case like 
this where people are looking to the appearance and proximity of 
contributions as possible problems riegle epitomizes this because 
his conduct absent receipt of keatings political contributions 
amounts to nothing 
both the march fundraiser and riegles meeting with gray were 
in close to crucial meetings between senators and banking 
regulators april 2 and 9 1987 
riegle only attended the second meeting while the other 
senators went to both sessions the senators said they were trying 
to ensure that keatings lincoln savings and loan was treated 
fairly and have denied any links between keatings money and their 
assistance 
the irvine calif thrift was taken over by federal regulators 
in april 1989 and it may cost taxpayers more than 2 billion to 
cover its losses 
at the april 2 meeting between four senators and gray the chief 
regulator said the lawmakers offered a deal that would have helped 
keating the senators vigorously denied such an offer was made 
the april 9 meeting was between all five senators and the san 
franciscobased regulators who were investigating lincoln the 
examiners told the senators they were referring results of their 
investigation to the criminal section of the justice department 
riegles office has denied any links between the timing of the 
march 23 1987 fundraiser and the april meetings 
the senators aide david krawitz has said the event was 
confirmed and scheduled on jan 30 1987 months before the 
meetings with regulators were set up 
riegle raised 78250 at the fundraiser from keating and his 
associates a year later while maintaining there was no connection 
between the contributions and the april 9 meeting riegle announced 
he returned the money because it could create the appearance of a 
conflict of interest

deputies in slovenia on thursday 
proposed a plebiscite on independence from yugoslavia after 
declaring many federal laws incompatible with the republics newly 
drawn constitution 
in the neighboring republic of croatia deputies voted down a 
proposal to follow slovenias lead and declare independence debate 
also raged over ethnic tensions between croats and serbs one irate 
deputy hurled his briefcase at an opponent 
in the parliament of slovenia the smallest of yugoslavias six 
republics legislators ruled that 30 federal laws touching on the 
economy politics and defense were incompatible with the slovenian 
constitution as it was amended last week 
a legislative committee called for a plebiscite on the creation 
of an independent sovereign state of slovenia the state news 
agency tanjug reported but it was unclear whether such a vote 
would have legal standing 
the committee proposed the vote take place before the new 
constitution is adopted in early november tanjug said 
slovenia has about 2 million people less than 10 percent of the 
yugoslav population 
most leaders in the republic favor transforming yugoslavia a 
loose federation of six republics into a confederation in which 
each state would have de facto sovereignty 
this view is supported by croatia the only other republic to 
have held free elections 
centerright parties trounced the communists in recent balloting 
in both republics 
but the communist rulers of serbia the largest republic favor 
more centralized control and vehemently oppose confederation 
tensions eased somewhat thursday in a serbianmajority enclave 
of the croatian republic that has been wracked by rioting in recent 
days 
in knin where armed serbs set up roadblocks last friday rail 
traffic to the coast gradually resumed tanjug said 
the protesting serbs who make up 10 percent of croatias 5 
million people claim the centerright government of the republic 
discriminates against them croatian authorities charge the 
communist government of serbia is whipping up ethnic tensions to 
destabilize croatias newly established democracy 
deputy croatian interior minister perica juric said scores of 
guns and 60000 rounds of ammunition were seized by serbs from 
police armories in petrinja glina and dvor na uni last week 
serbian democratic party delegate radoslav tanjga of knin 
accused croatian authorities of continuous tyranny against the 
serbian people in croatia 
deputy ivan bobetko of the governing croatian democratic party 
hurled his briefcase at tanjga hitting the lectern tanjug said

context said a plo source the plo has maintained ties with iraq 
since the invasion 
gorbachev said thursday he saw no reason to send soviet troops 
to join the usled multinational force in the gulf in response 
to a query gorbachev told reporters in moscow i think there are 
already more than enough troops there 
in the jordanian capital of amman prime minister toshiki kaifu 
of japan met with iraqi deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan 
ramadan considered no 2 to saddam rejected a negotiated 
settlement to the crisis as long as foreign troops remain on arab 
soil baghdads official iraq news agency reported 
kaifu insisted on iraqs withdrawal from kuwait first said 
shigeo takenaka kaifus spokesman kaifu meeting later with 
jordans king hussein granted 250 million in development loans to 
jordan which has been hardhit by the embargo of iraq 
french president francois mitterrand assured saudi king fahd 
that he backed international efforts to isolate iraq the meeting 
in the saudi port of jiddah followed iraqi attempts to engage 
france in separate peace talks 
also in saudi arabia three britons on thursday said their fear 
of iraq sustained them during their daring escape the three 
britons and two frenchmen crammed aboard a 10foot boat and spent 
25 hours much of the time being tossed in 10foot swells before 
being rescued wednesday 
its a trip i wouldnt like to do again but it was well worth 
it now that i am here mike teesdale 40 told a news conference 
in the saudi border town of khafji my fear was of iraq not of 
the trip 
it was the first report of western men escaping iraq since 
august iraq has allowed hundreds of western women and children to 
fly home aboard chartered planes 
the british escapees said they had taken the 10foot boat 
through the marshes of southern iraq into the shattalarab 
waterway and then the gulf teesdale said the men had only a 
compass to guide them and got lost several times before being 
picked up by the saudi coast guard 
the britons said they had been working on an oil installation 
near the iraqi port of basra and the two frenchmen were barge 
masters they were among a small number of europeans living on 
dwindling food supplies and denied permission to leave 
iraq is holding about 2200 westerners hostage in kuwait and 
iraq some at strategic installations to discourage attack by the 
usled military forces that began massing in the region after 
iraq seized kuwait 
nine of those hostages all frenchmen returned to paris on 
thursday after being freed by iraq also thursday 173 brazilians 
arrived home after brazil negotiated their release from iraq 
the us state department announced thursday that another 
special flight is planned for wednesday for americans to leave iraq 
and kuwait the exact number of americans expected to board the 
usgovernment charter was not disclosed but a boeing 747 is 
scheduled to be used some 747s can carry more than 500 passengers 
the last ussanctioned special flight was sept 22 but more 
americans with permission to leave iraq or kuwait have come 
forward said us officials who askednnot to be identified 
the state department said late last month that at least 900 us 
citizens mostly men remained trapped in kuwait and iraq 
in baghdad a radical palestinian group loyal to iraq threatened 
to launch powerful strikes if the united states endangers iraqi 
aircraft while enforcing the un air embargo on iraq the 
statement by the arab liberation front was the second such threat 
in as many days by radical palestinians and heightened fears of a 
terrorist campaign against the west 
the united states now has about 170000 troops in saudi arabia 
and on ships in the area making up most of the estimated 
200000member international force the pentagon says iraq has 
massed 460000 troops in kuwait since the invasion 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said sailors from the navy 
frigate samuel b roberts boarded the sudanese freighter blue nile 
on thursday 
williams said the freighter carrying industrial equipment was 
diverted from the gulf of aqaba because the ships log did not 
account for all of its cargo under the un embargo shipments to 
the jordanian port of aqaba a prime port for iraqi cargo has been 
cut severely 
williams also said the aircraft carrier uss independence which 
left the persian gulf two days after entering the waterway had 
sucessfully completed its mission to demonstrate to our friends 
and allies in the region that it is possible to put a carrier in 
the gulf and carry out operations those were the goals and they 
were accomplished 
he declined to say what the independence would do next

the united states is responding to the 
unification of germany by altering its strategy in europe to a 
military presence rather than troops massed near the borders a top 
pentagon official said wednesday 
forward deployed forces will be smaller with greater emphasis 
on mobility and versatility than in the current nato structure to 
allow maximum flexibility in times of crisis said army maj gen 
john seawall 
the vice director for strategic plans and policy and two other 
defense department officials described for the senate armed 
services committee details of the unification and its impact on 
american and nato troops 
as the soviet union withdraws its forces from what was east 
germany with a target for completion of 1994 the military 
situation undergoes significant changes 
in the past the united states and its nato allies maintained 
forces shouldertoshoulder with the best defense closest to the 
warsaw pact nations under the new strategy the concept is 
defense of the borders as opposed to defense on the border 
seawall said 
stephen hadley assistant secretary of defense for internationl 
security policy said that based on dramatic changes in europe the 
withdrawal of soviet troops and the expected treaty to reduce 
conventional forces a new nato force is warranted 
the allies will move toward a reduced reliance on nuclear 
forces smaller and restructured active forces which are highly 
versatile and rely increasingly on multinational corps composed of 
national units and greater reliance on reserves and the ability to 
reconstitute larger forces as and when necessary 
president bush has proposed a troop level of 195000 in central 
europe however the withdrawal of soviet forces and action by the 
congress could cut deeper into the troop strength 
the senate in its defense bill approved a reduction in active 
duty troops of 100000 including 50000 in europe the house 
adopted a budget calling for a cut of 129500 including 50000 in 
europe 
negotiators for the two sides are currently working on a final 
package 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said the planned change in strategy represented a 
very very important statement 
this is the first reference i have seen to a new thinking of 
nato strategy nunn said

rwandan forces firing helicopterborne 
rockets and cannons blocked rebels advancing toward the central 
african nations capital in a bid to overthrow the government a 
diplomatic source said thursday 
frankly the tide has turned the diplomat said from 
rwandas capital kigali its not looking good for the rebels 
he said the invading force estimated at several hundred to more 
than 1000 was sharply reduced during the armys counterattack 
wednesday and thursday near gabiro 40 miles northeast of kigali 
there were no reliable reports of casualties diplomats in 
kigali said the government was trying to move civilians out of the 
combat zone 
the region is sparsely populated and relatively flat compared 
with the steep hills covering much of the impoverished nation 
despite the twoday blitz on the rebels main force around 
gabiro a group of more than 100 guerrillas reportedly has reached 
the shores of lake muhazi 30 miles east of kigali using unusual 
hitandrun tactics 
the rebels have eluded government forces by changing into 
civilian clothes aftens conference in new york 
the wellarmed rebels made up of rwandan refugees 
predominantly of the tutsi tribe invaded rwanda from its northern 
neighbor uganda on sunday many are deserters from ugandas army 
the rebels have lived in uganda since fleeing bloody ethnic 
battles in rwanda in the late 1950s and early 1960s when the 
majority hutu tribe gained control of the country 
uganda has denounced the invaders and closed its border with 
rwanda cutting off any possibility of retreat or resupply by the 
rebels 
the rebels admit their forces are predominantly tutsi but say 
that is a function of history and deny they are bent on ethnic 
revenge according to interviews with guerrillas in ugandas state 
newspaper new vision 
but in kigali authorities have arrested about a dozen prominent 
tutsi and hutu citizens including army officers government 
officials business people and intelligentsia charges against them 
were not immediately announced 
eightyfive percent of rwandas foreign earnings come from 
coffee exports and have fallen by more than half in recent years 
because of lower coffee prices on the international market 
the rebels said they also would like to end the refugee problem 
and give citizenship to all rwandans including those outside the 
nations borders 
there are more than 100000 rwandan refugees in africa and the 
rebels estimate more than 1 million worldwide rwanda says it has 
no place to put the refugees 
the nation is among the most crowded in the world with an 
estimated 566 people per square mile it also has a population 
growth rate of nearly 4 percent annually among the worlds 
highest

the chairman of the national endowment for the 
arts said thursday that evangelist pat robertson should apologize 
for lying about whether federal money was used to produce an 
atlanta puppet show he said featured simulated oral sex 
nea chairman john e frohnmayer said the charge was false 
at a news conference in atlanta where he flew to talk to local 
arts leaders about the controversy frohnmayer said robertson has 
subjected americans to an irrational sometimes irresponsible 
debate about public support for the arts in this country 
earlier in the day robertson charged on his 700 club 
television show that if members of congress vote to give the 
federal arts agency more money next year it shows they are 
totally out of touch with america and with morality 
a report on robertsons show said atlanta puppeteer jon ludwig 
had use of a large bloc of nea money when he presented the 
controversial puppet show sept 21 at the arts festival of atlanta 
frohnmayer urged robertson to apologize to congress to 
apologize to the people of atlanta and to apologize to those who 
look to him for truth 
he said he hopes the issue can be put to rest and a healing 
process can begin 
i believe the time has come for fairness i believe the time 
has come for honesty said frohnmayer 
in washington the nea released a copy of a sept 28 letter in 
which frohnmayer told robertson that the evangelists claim of 
endowment support for the festival to present the puppet show was 
categorically false 
in that letter and in an nea letter circulated in congress 
frohnmayer denied that any federal funds went either to the arts 
festival or the puppet show 
his assertion was supported last week by festival officials and 
the executive director of the georgia council on the arts a state 
agency that receives nea funds festival officials said the puppet 
show was financed entirely by ticket sales and concession receipts 
and did not receive any government money 
robertson earlier said the puppet show included simulated 
foreplay followed by an exhibit of oral sex acts before an audience 
of 800 including children 
ludwig said the scene was a satirical treatment of sexual 
temptation as part of an adult morality play but that it did not 
include oral sex 
the rev john norton of marietta ga who originally complained 
about the pupet show later backed down 
the methodist clergyman said he objected not to the performance 
but to allowing unaccompanied children to view adult material 
festival officials promised they would solve that problem 
in an indirect reference to robertson norton said we do not 
feel it is appropriate for us to be placed in the position of being 
connected with the greater issues others have attempted to draw us 
into 
the christian coalition a nonprofit organization headed by 
robertson said the nea gave 132500 last year to the center for 
puppetry arts in atlanta where ludwig is artistic director 
that was confirmed by the nea but the agency denied that any of 
the money was spent on the puppet show vincent anthony the 
centers director said the festival signed an independent contract 
with ludwig to produce the show 
robertson told his tv viewers that there is this incredible 
shell game that goes on in washington with the nea and its grant 
money 
at a time when congress is considering raising taxes to reduce 
federal budget deficits robertson said there shouldnt be one 
dollar of it spent on oral sex at puppet shows or jesus christ 
immersed in urine or the mapplethorpe exhibit of homoerotic art 
the evangelist who ran for the 1988 republican presidential 
nomination was referring to controversial nea grants for 
exhibitions of works by artist andres serrano and photographer 
robert mapplethorpe which conservatives have denounced as obscene 
and blasphemous 
in his letter to a christian whose religion values truth 
frohnmayer told robertson that robertson clearly made a mistake 
about nea support for the puppet show and should correct his error 
robertson said thursday he had not actually seen the puppet show 
but relied on newspaper accounts 
in an oct 1 reply to frohnmayer the evangelist said the puppet 
show was another example of what can happen when federal money is 
given without supervision and oversight

the prime minister of trinidad and tobago 
said thursday that us authorities failed to tell his government 
of arms purchases in miami by moslem coupplotters 
if we had the information possessed by us authorities in 
miami this coup would have been avoided prime minister arthur 
nr robinson told a news conference 
later a us state department official requesting anonymity 
said we did not withhold information which would have enabled 
prime minister robinson to prevent the coup detat 
on july 27 moslem militants stormed parliament and the 
governmentrun tv station and took the prime minister and more than 
50 others hostage 
the ensuing sixday siege and accompanying looting left 24 
people dead and 500 wounded trinidad is a caribbean island nation 
of 12 million people off northeast venezuela the fighting caused 
an estimated 60 million damage to the main shopping district in 
portofspain 
in answer to a question robinson said his government has 
evidence the rebels had ties to libya 
in fact the leader of the terrorist organization has 
confessed openly about his visits and relations with libya 
he declined to say however whether the coup was backed by 
libya saying the case was in the courts 
rebel leader yasin abu bakr a former policeman who converted to 
islam and 113 followers were jailed to face charges of treason and 
murder after the coup was suppressed saying it fearing that bakrs 
supporters might be plotting another attack the government 
extended a state of emergency until midnovember the proclamation 
gives security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest 
robinson who was shot in the leg by the rebels said in a 
speech to the united nations general assembly that the coup was 
launched by a new breed of fanatics claiming divine inspiration 
but acting rather under satanic impulse 
robinson walked with a cane as he went to the podium at un 
headquarters 
after his speech robinson told reporters that he would raise 
the issue of exchanging information about security when he meets 
president bush on monday in washington 
we must find out why there was not a proper transfer of 
information he said we want to ensure that in the future 
more effective arrangements are made about information exchange 
he said it was common knowledge that some of those later 
involved in the coup were buying weapons in miami with large 
amounts of us currency and shipping the arms to the island 
nation a former british colony 
us authorities in miami knew about the arms purchases he 
said 
oh yes he said there was much more information that 
us authorities had which was not passed along to his 
government 
federal agents from the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
arrested an moslem louis haneef of pompano beach fla on charges 
of supplying assault rifles ammunition and other equipment to the 
coup leaders 
but jack killorin a spokesman for the bureau in washington 
said its agents were not aware of any contact between the man 
buying the guns and trinidad until after the coup attempt 
had it been known that the firearms were going to go to 
trinidad the trinidad authorities would have been notified 
killorin said it simply was not known until trinidad authorities 
captured the arms and we matched them to the arms shipment in 
miami 
we couldnt agree more with the prime minister that 
governments should set up avenues of communication to crack down on 
this gun running he added

the defense rested its case thursday at the 
obscenity trial involving robert mapplethorpes photos and closing 
arguments in the case were expected friday 
most of the day was taken up with legal arguments over the 
qualifications of a rebuttal witness for the prosecution prompting 
an expression of frustration by defendant dennis barrie 
i just wish something would happen said barrie who could 
go to jail if the jury finds him guilty of the misdemeanor charges 
of pandering obscenity and using children in nudityrelated 
material 
barrie 43 is director of the contemporary arts center a 
hamilton county grand jury indicted barrie and the art gallery 
april 7 because of seven photographs in a 175picture exhibit that 
day 
five of the photos depict sexually explicit acts involving men 
and two show children with their genitals exposed if convicted of 
both charges barrie could be sentenced to one year in jail and 
fined 2000 the gallery could be fined 10000 
although the jury could get the case as early as friday 
hamilton county municipal judge david albanese told the 
eightmember panel he felt no pressure to speed things along 
if we have to recess over the threeday weekend we will 
albanese said the court wont be in session monday because of 
columbus day 
the defense contended the exhibit was legitimate art by a 
nationally known photographer and that the display was part of the 
art gallerys cultural mission 
in testimony wednesday barrie said some of the acts depicted in 
the show were tough brutal sometimes disgusting but part of 
the photographic challenge mapplethorpe accepted in trying to 
create a work of art 
as difficult as the subject matter may be you see the ability 
of the man working through he was brilliant with a camera 
barrie said 
defense lawyers thursday challenged the credentials of proposed 
prosecution rebuttal witness judith reisman of arlington va they 
said she was not qualified to offer expert testimony regarding the 
seven photographs 
ms reisman listed among her qualifications having prepared 
educational videotapes and slide presentations for the smithsonian 
institution in washington she said she also has been a consultant 
for televisions captain kangaroo show former attorney general 
edwin meeses commission on pornography and for the conservative 
american family association 
albanese allowed the testimony 
ms reisman who practices what she called content analysis of 
images was asked to testify about the five photographs on which 
the obscenity charges are based 
do you see in them any expression of human feeling 
assistant city prosecutor frank prouty asked 
no i do not ms reisman said there is no expression of 
joy anger fear shame happiness sadness intent or distress 
by displaying sexually explicit photos that lack human emotion 
one receives the information that that is an appropriate 
activity ms reisman said 
she said that displaying nude photos of children is a standard 
technique for getting children into a child abuse situation 
art experts testifying for the defense have described the 
exhibit as a retrospective of the career of mapplethorpe who died 
of aids in march 1989 at age 42 
as the trial recessed for the day albanese cautioned jurors to 
ignore about 40 demonstrators in front of the hamilton county 
courthouse 
most of the protesters were dressed in black some wearing death 
masks as they staged a funeral for the bill of rights 
it was the first such demonstration at the trial since jury 
selection began sept 24 when about 150 gay rights and 
anticensorship demonstrators marched outside the courthouse 
the exhibit drew 80000 people during its seven week run an 
attendance record for an art exhibit in cincinnati the show closes 
this week in boston where 103000 tickets have been sold 
the exhibit was canceled at a washington museum because of 
controversy over the photographs

the influx of soviet jews into israel will 
significantly add to the jewish states military potential the 
international institute for strategic studies said thursday 
while this soviet immigration will not in the long term 
redress the demographic imbalance between jews and arabs both in 
israel and the west bank and gaza strip it will add significant 
numbers to the pool available for conscription and reserve the 
institute said 
the institute noted in its annual survey of global forces the 
military balance that the soviet jewish immigration is the focus 
of much attention among israels arab neighbors 
it said a total of 100000 soviet jews were expected to arrive 
in 1990 with perhaps as many as 1 million coming over the next 10 
years 
the report said israels defense forces have accepted they 
cannot quell the palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza 
strip which began in december 1987 it said military service there 
continues to erode training standards among israeli troops and 
undermine moral 
elsewhere the institute said in its section on the middle east 
that both iran and iraq continued to rebuild their forces following 
the end of the eightyear gulf war in 1988 
the report written before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
said iraqs new acquisitions included 12 sovietmade mig29 fighter 
planes this year 
iraqs ballistic missile development has been relatively 
successful with the 900 km560 milerange alabbas missile and 
the 600 km370 mile alhusayn having been deployed and five other

sen daniel p moynihan dny said thursday 
he will offer his proposal to cut social security tax rates as an 
amendment to a stopgap budget bill when it goes before the senate 
this measure is not a dealbuster moynihan said in a letter 
to his senate colleagues it is transparently just overwhelmingly 
popular economically sound and as a matter of public trust an 
elemental duty 
moynihan has attracted much attention this year with his plan to 
cut social security tax rates but the idea has never come to a 
vote 
the senate was slated to consider a combined stopgap budget and 
an extension of the debt ceiling friday the house passed both 
measures sunday and if the senate cant finish work on the bills 
by midnight friday the federal government will run out of money 
if moynihans gambit succeeds the house and senate would have 
to appoint a conference committee to come up with a reconcilation 
of differences 
moynihans press secretary brian connolly dismissed concerns 
that such an outcome would gum up the works 
theyve done it before he said 
the social security payroll tax is currently producing more 
revenue for the federal government than the government is paying 
out in benefits an estimated 74 billion more in the fiscal year 
that began oct 1 
last december moynihan introduced a bill to cut the social 
security tax rate for two years reducing collections this year by 
about 60 billion and to take social security offbudget that 
is not use its surplus to make the overall federal deficit smaller 
than it would otherwise appear 
in july he modified the plan to spread the cuts over five 
years reducing the rate more gradually in an attempt to appeal to 
convert congress to his cause 
this latest version would spread the cuts over six years and 
provide for a trust fund reserve equal to a yearandahalfs worth 
of benefits by 1995 under this plan the social security tax rate 
would be reduced from the current 62 percent to 51 percent by 
1996

the overthrow of president corazon aquino 
could prompt the world to turn its back on the philippines in 
disgust the chairman of the senates asian affairs subcommittee 
said thursday 
and the result could be that in 20 years the country will turn 
into an economic backwater similar to burma today sen alan 
cranston dcalif added in a floor speech 
cranston urged senators to support the bush administration next 
week in providing the current 200 million us installment of the 
fiveyear multilateral assistance initiative pledged with japan and 
other countries to speed economic recovery in the philippines

against government positions in mindanao island represent the start 
of the longthreatened next coup attempt against the aquino 
government target of six attempted coups in four years 
now is the time for the united states to demonstrate anew its 
support for philippine democracy cranston said at this very 
moment when democracy is once again being challenged by 
totalitarian elements we must not be pusillanimous

president fw de klerk was 
cheered thursday when he made an unannounced visit to black 
townships in natal province that have been wracked for years by 
factional fighting 
he praised local leaders of the warring factions for negotiating 
a shongweni township truce that halted the fighting which has 
claimed 5000 lives in natal in five years 
such a trip would have been unthinkable a year ago before de 
klerk pushed for an end to apartheid and freed african national 
congress leader nelson mandela from prison 
the whiteled government and the anc have held peace talks since 
may on eliminating apartheid 
the black faction fighting spread to johannesburg area townships 
in august killing about 800 people it has eased the past two 
weeks but strained relations between the government and the anc 
most of the fighting has pitted zulu supporters of the 
conservative inkatha movement against xhosas and other blacks 
linked to the anc 
it was the second time in a month de klerk has ventured into 
black townships an extremely rare act by a south african leader 
he also drew a warm reception on his visit last month to the soweto 
township southwest of johannesburg 
residents of shongweni and the imbali township cheered and sang 
thursday when de klerk appeared accompanied by his wife and other 
government leaders 
tight security was evident with yellow police helicopters 
circling the presidential partys helicopter 
de klerk presented bibles to victor kabisi of inkatha and tulani 
zulu of the united democratic front an anc affiliate and praised 
them for the peace agreement in shongweni 
i hope other leaders throughout the country will follow your 
example de klerk said 
the entourage also visited the king edward hospital in durban 
where patients lying on mattresses on the floor cheered de klerk 
he announced the government had allocated an additional 20 million 
for health services in natal and the kwazulu tribal homeland 
he later expressed disappointment that mandela and inkatha 
leader mangosuthu buthelezi were not meeting to discuss the 
violence 
the time has arrived for us to put down our instruments of 
conflict and to turn our back on conflict and violence and to 
speak our minds in a peaceful manner de klerk said 
mandela and buthelezi who also is kwazulu leader had been 
invited to take part in an anccalled meeting with homeland leaders 
friday to discuss the violence 
but buthelezi rejected the invitation saying he should meet 
with mandela as the inkatha leader because the fighting involves 
inkatha and anc supporters 
he said thursday he doubted a meeting with mandela would happen 
in the near future mandela is scheduled to leave the country 
sunday for a trip abroad of almost four weeks 
the anc has refused to meet with buthelezi in a oneonone 
format it charges inkatha spread the violence from natal to the 
johannesburg townships to broaden its constituency 
inkatha accuses the anc of trying to monopolize power among 
black opposition groups as the country moves toward negotiations on 
a new constitution 
the anc and inkatha both oppose apartheid but differ on a future 
south africa inkatha wants a free market economy and appeals to 
zulu nationalism while the anc is more leftist and pantribal

officials said thursday they were close to 
eliminating a bus driver shortage that caused thousands of pupils 
in the nations thirdlargest school system to miss some classes 
early in the year bus delays affected about 4000 students in 
15 to 20 of the more than 350 schools served said robert l 
johnson director of student transportation for chicago public 
schools as of thursday morning the number of children that 
are still affected would be less than 150 
some children missed entire school days because their buses 
never picked them up but johnson said no one apparently missed 
school thursday because of bus problems 
johnson said a new tougher federal commercial drivers 
licensing law caused tremendous difficulty for bus companies 
but they knew what our needs were going to be he said 
theres no doubt that when contract renewal comes up those 
companies that have not performed satisfactorily will feel the 
effects johnson said 
mark schmidt of the secretary of states office said the bus 
companies were able to recruit enough potential drivers but more 
than usual failed the tests because of the tougher law 
drivers were so sparse early this year that more buses than 
usual had to make double runs causing some students to miss their 
first hour of school and important classes often taught in the 
morning like reading some children also had to wait longer than 
usual for afternoon buses 
the delays were particularly hard on disabled pupils who must 
receive medicine and physical therapy on schedule said sue stoll 
assistant principal at hanson park school

standup tragedy is music video theater a 
contemporary kaleidoscope of story song and dance about the 
futility of teaching in an innercity high school 
if that sounds depressing well it is and it isnt the play 
which opened thursday at broadways criterion center theater is 
fast furious often funny and startlingly different call it a 
raw raucous updated blackboard jungle with a rap beat but 
with no easy answers and a pessimistic ending 
the story comes from author bill cains reallife experiences 
teaching in a catholic school on manhattans lower east side tom 
griffin played by jack coleman is an idealistic new teacher from 
a wealthy wasp family hes trying to save a little bit of the 
world and until now his only problem has been deciding on whether 
or not to go to law school 
instead he finds himself battling to teach young hispanics 
particularly a withdrawn student named lee marcus chong who has a 
problem home life lee an accomplished artist also has an 
overactive imagination the youth has created a fantasy world of 
comicstrip superheroes an exotic environment where he can block 
out his junkie of an older brother and his alcoholic mother 
tom tries to get through to lee but the more he tries to help 
the more it hurts lee your familys your fate says the 
fatalistic student and playwright cain poohpoohs the quickfix 
solution of education lifting these teenagers out of a life of 
poverty and crime his spokesman is a craggy nearly disillusioned 
cleric father ed larkin played with a fine sandpaper edge by 
charles cioffi 
larkin explains that an ecology of evil permeates the 
neighborhood and once you upset the balance who knows what will 
happen this environment is portrayed at warp speed by director ron 
link who never lets standup tragedy stop 
one scene blends quickly into the next the dialogue and music 
often machinegunning the actors all over the stage and some of 
the performers play more than one role often at the same time the 
babyfaced chong does triple duty in an unnerving series of 
transformations he changes from the bewildered lee to his defiant 
brother to the boys haughty mother its an amazing performance 
coleman exudes the right amount of whitebread benevolence as 
the dogood teacher and there are distinctive portraits drawn by 
john c cooke and dan gerrity as his cynical cohorts in the 
teaching profession 
four other students rap and jive their way through the 
production under the rapidfire choreography of charles 
randolphwright they are all over designer yael pardess grim 
graffitiscarred set with four high school lockers placed at stage 
center 
standup tragedy is unlikely broadway fare its 
unconventional and almost aggressive in its determination to turn 
the norms of straightforward plot and character upsidedown and 
insideout but stay with it its a wild and most satisfying ride

the bush administration is withdrawing the 
nomination of frederick vreeland to be ambassador to burma a 
republican senator who raised questions about the nomination said 
thursday 
sen alfonse damato of new york said state department officials 
told him that vreelands name had been withdrawn because of 
objections from burma about prodemocracy statements vreeland made 
but damato said the real reason was evidence linking vreeland 
to efforts to cover up bulgarian and soviet involvment in the 1981 
assassination attempt against pope john paul ii 
if you believe the state department reason you believe the 
moon is made of green cheese damato said 
state department spokesman david denny said he could not confirm 
that vreeland had been dropped as the ambassadorial nominee for 
burma 
another official however confirmed that vreeland had been 
dropped 
this official who spoke on condition of anonymity said burmese 
objections to vreelands prodemocracy statements were indeed the 
real reason and the attempt to kill the pope had nothing to do 
with the case the prodemocracy statements were described as 
nothing more than oftstated us policy 
denny said assistant secretary richard solomon met with burmese 
deputy foreign minister ohn gyaw on wednesday and had expressed 
concern about lack of progress toward democracy in the country 
harrassment of us embassy employees and continued opium 
production 
he declined to say what gyaw replied and said he could not say 
whether there was any discussion of vreeland 
damato said one state department official told him vreeland had 
irked the burmese with statements concerning the need for a free 
and independent government in burma where a military junta has 
refused to yield power to a civilian government elected in may 
a senate foreign relations committee on vreelands nomination 
monday was held behind closed doors 
at the request of damato and sen jesse helms rnc the 
committee had scheduled a second hearing on the nomination thursday 
but later postponed it until next week 
damato said he wanted to question vreeland about reports that 
he tried to cover up details about the assassination attempt and 
discourage journalists from writing about the bulgarian connection 
congressional sources said some senators were concerned over 
published reports about vreelands career as a cia agent 
an official biography supplied to the committee by the 
administration described vreeland as a career diplomat with several 
state department assignments vreeland 63 is son of the late 
vogue magazine editor diana vreeland 
damato said that by law he could not discuss whether vreeland 
was a cia agent but he said the senate hearing would have 
questioned him about his activites as a us embassy officer in 
rome at the time the attempted assassination was being 
investigated 
ali agca a turk who wounded the pope in st peters square is 
serving a life term in italy agca at first said he acted alone but 
later claimed soviet involvement an italian court ruled there was 
not enough evidence to convict three bulgarians charged in the 
case 
damato said he has met with the new president of bulgaria 
zhelyu zhelev and asked him to pursue an inquiry into both the 
bulgarian connection to the attempt on the pope and any us 
efforts to cover it up 
zhelev on a us visit last week said he would press for an 
independent investigation into charges that bulgarian police 
participated in the papal attack 
the motive for the coverup said damato may have been to 
prevent an escalation of ussoviet differences or to prevent 
facts from coming out that might be embarrassing to us officials

sandinista labor unions agreed to 
participate in talks thursday with the government and business 
groups seeking a common program to relieve the country of its 
economic ills 
it was a victory for president violeta chamorros 5monthold 
government which had met stiff sandinista resistance to its 
economic recovery program 
former president daniel ortega has said the sandinista front 
would support any agreement the unions reach with the government 
the sandinistalinked unions have about 200000 members 
after meetings with ortega this week antonio lacayo mrs 
chamorros senior aide announced the government would distribute 
food create job banks and freeze planned layoffs of government 
workers 
the sandinistas in turn agreed not to oppose a government review 
of state property the sandinistas gave away during the twomonth 
transition period between their feb 25 election loss and mrs 
chamorros april 25 inauguration 
the government also has agreed not to return property previously 
owned by the family of the late dictator anastasio somoza ousted 
by the sandinistas in 1979 
the sandinistas had refused to take part in a first round of 
talks which began sept 20 but decided to submit to the forum 
after a series of protest marches failed to muster support 
the superior council of private enterprise nicaraguas most 
important business group opposed the sandinista unions 
participation 
the group blames nicaraguas economic woes on sandinista 
mismanagement and claimed the government has showed weakness in 
dealing with the ousted leftists 
lacayo the most powerful member of the government has taken 
great pains to obtain the cooperation of the sandinistas further 
discord can only hurt nicaraguas chances of getting badly needed 
foreign aid he has said 
the sandinistas have opposed to nearly every facet of mrs 
chamorros economic plan that plan aims at reigning inflation 
which has been running at about 80 percent monthly reducing a 
fiscal deficit and increasing production 
the government has tried to slash the public payroll privatize 
most of the 400 state enterprises confiscated by the sandinistas 
during their decade in power end state subsidies of public 
services and devalue the currency to make nicaraguan exports such 
as coffee and bananas competitive

dropped the debate without a final vote in order to take up the 
budget compromise 
the measure calls for the death penalty for assassination of the 
president and numerous other government officials treason and 
espionage also would be punishable by death 
other features range from a shutoff in federal benefits for 
convicted drug offenders to a oneyear prison term for illegal 
possession of steroids 
in a victory for bush the house voted 285146 to replace major 
provisions requiring death row inmates to file their habeas corpus 
petitions in federal court no later than a year after exhausting 
direct appeals 
prisoners use these petitions to claim they were denied their 
constitutional rights some death row inmates have filed repeated 
petitions and thus delayed their executions for more than a decade 
democratic sponsors of the crime bill had incorporated in the 
bill a plan that besides setting a time limit for filing 
petitions would have guaranteed prisoners competent lawyers in 
capital punishment cases it also would have limited the defendants 
to one habeas corpus petition in normal circumstances 
rep henry j hyde rill a leading critic said exceptions to 
the limit would result in endless endless endless delays 
the house adopted instead a hyde provision leaving the matter up 
to individual state legislatures to limit the time in which their 
prisoners could file habeas appeals in federal court conservatives 
who seek to shorten delays in carrying out executions hailed the 
plan while liberals blasted it 
rep don edwards dcalif complained that the plan drafted by 
a commission headed by former supreme court justice lewis powell 
actually represented a plot by the chief justice of the 
supreme court 
chief justice william rehnquist has been pressing for changes in 
the habeas corpus law 
as it came to the floor the bill prescribed capital punishment 
for 10 groups of offenses approved by the judiciary committee 
the house approved 271159 an amendment sponsored by rep george 
gekas rpa calling for the death penalty for offenses ranging 
from genocide to murder by mail bombing it included murder through 
terrorist bombing of an airplane train wreck and destruction of a 
motor vehicle 
gekas told the house that the bill needed stiffening and that 
his plan was supported by a wide range of americans from the cop 
on the beat to the man on the street 
democratic sponsors of the measure said some of its provisions 
appeared unconstitutional i hope we never bring up another crime 
bill a month before an election rep william hughes dnj 
said because today we are tearing up a document that has served 
us well for many years 
sarcastic cries of kill kill kill wafted briefly from a 
knot f lawmakers near a door on the democratic side of the chamber 
the senate already has approved a different bill that unlike 
the house version would curb nine semiautomatic assault weapons 
differences will have to be resolved by a housesenate conference 
committee 
as it became clear that the gekas plan would be approved 
overwhelmingly tempers started to fray rep craig washington 
dtexas accused gekas of not answering his question about how the 
amendment would work 
thank you for not answering my question he said 
thank you for not quoting a good question gekas said 
washington who had already left the microphone and taken his 
seat shouted you wouldnt know a good question if you heard 
it 
the substititute provision on semiautomatic weapons was 
sponsored by rep jolene unsoeld dwash 
handgun control inc a washingtonbased group that campaigns 
for firearms restrictions released a report to the federal 
election commission from unsoelds campaign committee reflecting a 
4950 contribution from the national rifle association shortly 
after she introduced the amendment 
the group issued a statement saying unsoeld sold her political 
soul to the assault weapon lobby in the hope it will help her get 
reelected 
absolute baloney unsoeld said she said she had not 
discussed the amendment with the nra before introducing it and had 
not known about the campaign contribution at the time 
she said the amendment was needed because there are a lot of 
us who support the second amendment right to bear arms who would 
feel compelled to vote against the bill otherwise

the last time josef felder attended a parliament 
session at the reichstag the future looked ominous as he and other 
opposition lawmakers battled vainly against growing nazi powers 
on thursday however felder returned to the building full of 
hope for the newly united germany 
i believe we have a good development in the sense of securing 
democracy said felder 90 the only member of the prewar 
parliament to attend the opening session 
felder took a seat next to president richard von weizsaecker to 
observe the first meeting of parliament in the reichstag since dec 
9 1932 when felder was a newly elected deputy in a nation in 
chaos as nazis consolidated power 
in the coming years felder would face nazi harassment flee 
underground and ultimately be sent to a concentration camp 
adolf hitler dissolved the legislature after he was named 
chancellor on jan 30 1933 and called new elections a fire 
gutted the reichstag before the vote was held march 5 
felder a social democrat from bavaria was reelected but 
faced increasing threats from the nazis the regime had already 
jailed many opposition communists and socialists the first targets 
of hitlers repression 
more than 100 members of the reichstag were killed or 
imprisoned 
the election campaign in february 1933 was exceptionally 
difficult for the opposition the social democrats were forbidden 
access to the press by hitler recalled felder 
after the nazis marched into bavaria on march 9 1933 felder 
and other lawmakers changed apartments to avoid arrest determined 
to take their seats in parliament 
felder recalled the tumultuous march 23 1933 session held in 
the nearby kroll opera when hitler forced through a plan allowing 
his government to make laws without the reichstags approval some 
of the social democrats were called scoundrels by crowds 
felder attended a parliament meeting may 17 1933 when a 
resolution calling for equal treatment of germany at the geneva 
disarmament convention was debated it was his last session 
in july the nazis banned the social democrats and felder fled 
to austria 
he continued underground work under an assumed name until 1934 
when the nazi threat forced him to flee for czechoslovakia 
but fearing reprisals against his family felder returned to 
bavaria and was thrown into the dachau concentration camp outside 
munich for two years 
he worked as an accountant following the war and gradually 
returned to politics in 1957 he was elected to the west german 
legislature in bonn the bundestag the west german parliament is 
also the name of the new german legislature 
after his third term expired in 1969 felder devoted himself to 
political education traveling thousands of miles each year to talk 
to school children about his experiences 
parliament president rita suessmuth on thursday warmly welcomed 
felder who said it was a great satisifcation to attend the 
historic meeting 
felder warned the new government must not permit the rise of 
obsessive nationalism which would endanger everything we 
achieved through negotiations with our allies

david h souter said thursday that 
soontobe colleagues on the supreme court are eager for him to be 
sworn in to avoid the possibility of tie votes in controversial 
cases 
souter who will take his oath tuesday as historys 105th 
supreme court justice said he needs to find a home and would love 
to play tourist perhaps with a paper bag over my head to hide 
his newly famous face 
but he said of the other justices who have already heard three 
days of case arguments they very much wanted me to start sitting 
on tuesday because there is always the possibility of a 44 
decision if theyre sitting without the full complement 
the difficulty with that is if the case has to be reargued 
everybody knows that the whole reargument is going to be addressed 
to the one judge who is sort of there to make the difference 
souter said in an interview with the associated press they were 
very solicitous about not getting me in that position if we could 
avoid it 
the court is expected to be closely divided in the first major 
case souter will participate in a sexbias dispute over an 
employers fetal protection policy barring all women of 
childbearing age from some hazardous jobs the case will be argued 
wednesday 
souter said he knows he has a big task ahead so many of the 
justices have said or written that nothing prepares a person for 
the responsibilities of that court and i know thats going to be 
true in my case i can feel it already 
the 51yearold judge said finding a home in the nations 
capital is one of the first orders of business he said sen 
warren rudman rnh would be showing him some prospects over the 
weekend 
souter indicated he intends to live in the district of columbia 
not its maryland or virginia suburbs told that all the current 
justices are suburbanites he said im going to break new ground 
for a year anyway 
when not house hunting souters weekend will be spent reading 
legal briefs in preparation for his first week on the high court 
he said he would have to put off a secret ambition playing 
tourist 
there are some things i have never done that most school kids 
have done i have never for example toured the capitol he 
said some day i may have to do it with a paper bag over my 
head im going to do some of those touristy things 
souter said he once was more familiar with his future home 
right after law school i had various friends down there and 
there was a woman down there i was interested in so i made some 
trips to washington he said 
acknowledging a recent washington post article that named him 
one of the citys most eligible bachelors souter smiled and said 
ive really got to wait and see what effects it brings it 
sounded pretty good to me 
asked about his emotions during his three days of testimony 
before the senate judiciary committee last month souter said 
there wasnt time to be that reflective i guess i could tell you 
this much as we got toward the end of the third day sure i was 
getting tired im glad that the most vigorous questioning of the 
three days did not come at the tail end 
souter said neighbors and lawyer friends from concord would be 
on hand for his swearingin but that his mother who will be 83 
this week would not make the trip she gets along fine but she 
said she does it by not pushing herself too far he said

salvadoran guerrillas thursday 
denounced president alfredo cristianis recent ceasefire offer as 
a tactic taken only to win more military aid for his government 
in a speech monday to the 45th general assembly of the united 
nations cristiani proposed a government ceasefire if the fmln 
would do the same 
it is an old offer that seeks to end the war without ending 
the causes that originated it the rebels said in the broadcast 
on radio venceremos their clandestine voice 
the offer isnt really directed at us who have a promise with 
the government and the united nations to negotiate ahead of time 
the conditions for a ceasefire the rebels said it is aimed 
at the american senate who cristiani is trying to impress to 
get more military aid for the war 
cristiani returned this week to el salvador after meeting in new 
york with president bush who is seeking 85 million in new 
military aid to el salvador the aid package faces an especially 
tough battle in congress where there is indignation over 
continuing human rights abuses 
six jesuit priests who taught at the university of central 
america were murdered in november little progress has been made in 
bringing evidence against officers believed to have ordered the 
killings 
cristiani told a news conference thursday that he met with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar during his trip and 
wanted to step up the pace of talks with the rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front 
i consider it necessary to implement some formulas whic will 
make the process more dynamic which will move more quickly than 
what has happened until now cristiani said 
government and guerrilla representatives met under un 
sponsorship five times this year but failed to reach agreement on 
terms for ending the decadeold civil war which has claimed at 
least 73000 lives mostly civilians 
cristiani expressed regret at the guerrilla rejection of his 
proposed ceasefire saying he had offered it thinking that the 
salvadoran people should not have to continue suffering violence

a judge ruled thursday that the roman catholic 
church may evict a theater company from a former parochial school 
where it staged a play about a cardinal who kills a pregnant woman 
while driving drunk 
the church had sought the ruling against the rapp theater co 
charging that the group violated the lease by performing material 
detrimental to the landlords reputation as a roman catholic 
church 
an attorney for the church frank c mclaughlin argued before 
state supreme court justice irma vidal santaella that the lease on 
the building states clearly that the church is the sole and 
absolute judge of what is detrimental to its reputation 
thomas disch who wrote the play the cardinal detoxes and 
rapps artistic director r jeffrey cohen both accused church 
officials of trying to censor the play because they find it 
offensive 
rapp attorney richard sbeglia argued that it was 
unconscionable and a violation of public policy to force a 
tenant to give up free speech rights to get a lease 
but santaella found that the lease was not unconscionable 
because there was not a lack of meaningful choices by either of the 
parties she also said cohen had voluntarily relinquished his 
constitutional rights he read the lease and signed of his own 
free will 
im astonished said disch after the ruling 
santaellas ruling lifted a temporary restraining order and 
allowed the church to begin eviction proceedings immediately 
however cohen and sbeglia said they would seek another 
restraining order from the state supreme courts appellate 
division if they fail to get it cohen said he has rented a 
storefront across the street from the former school and will stage 
the play there 
the play is a 35minute monologue by a cardinal who is being 
treated for alcoholism by the church after he kills the woman 
after the cardinal calls the church a sham and suggests he will 
expose its problems a silent monk in the room with him gives him 
poisoned wine

hundreds of rioters in a crimeridden 
neighborhood torched stores and threw rocks at police friday in a 
protest that began over reports a policeman took a bribe from a 
gangster 
at least 88 people including 58 police have been injured since 
the violence in the nishinari district began tuesday police said 
forty people had been arrested by early friday authorities said 
the scope of the violence is extremely rare for japan where 
public issues rarely inflame passions to such a degree 
the rioting started after news reports a police sergeant had 
taken 20000 in payment for leaks of police information the 
officer has not admitted guilt but the osaka police chief 
apologized thursday in an attempt to ease the tension 
early friday a convenience store was set ablaze and ransacked 
and a grocery store also was looted as the violence spread to the 
northern areas of the nishihari area 
up to 1000 demonstrators confronted about 600 riot police 
thursday night on streets near the station high schoolage youths 
lunged out of the crowd to throw rocks and firecrackers at police 
come out dirty policemen we will not stand this any longer 
kyodo quoted one of the workers as shouting as he hurled rocks at 
the police headquarters in this city in western japan 
some charged police shields with their shoulders and were driven 
back 
most of the people who are throwing rocks at us are 
juvenile delinquents who saw this on television and thought it was 
a rare chance to take advantage of the police said one officer 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
police earlier had said the demonstrators were mostly menial and 
day laborers who live in the shabby hotels of the seedy district 
there have been bad feelings between area residents and police 
whose anticrime tactics include a 24hour surveillance camera 
system on street corners in nishinari residents also complain of 
widespread gang activity 
since tuesday as many as 1400 residents of the district have 
faced off with police about a quartermile from the district police 
station burning cars and throwing rocks bicycles and beer 
bottles police said 
such street violence is seldom seen in japan in recent years

between riot police and leftist extremists who oppose expansion of 
narita airport outside of tokyo 
osaka police chief masahiro tsubakihara issued an apology at the 
prefectural legislature thursday in response to reports the officer 
had taken the bribe kyodo news service reported

a technical foulup by state officials 
shouldnt block oregons initiative petition process the oregon 
supreme court said thursday in explaining its decision to return 
five measures to the nov 6 ballot 
the court had no desire to entirely thwart the right of 
citizens to propose laws and amendments to the constitution and 
enact or reject them independently of the legislature chief 
justice edwin peterson wrote in the opinion written sept 28 and 
released thursday 
the unanimous ruling overturned a lower court decision that 
removed five of 11 measures from the ballot 
the problems began when a state committee missed a deadline for 
certifying statements for the ballot that explained what the 
measures would cost marion county judges invalidated those 
statements because of the missed deadline 
marion county circuit judge richard barber later invalidated 
five measures because they wouldnt be accompanied by the cost 
estimates 
the measures targeted by barbers ruling would limit property 
taxes shut down the trojan nuclear plant ban some nonrecyclable 
packaging allow tax credits for private schooling and set up a 
pilot work program for welfare applicants 
the ninemember supreme court reversed barber but upheld the 
lower court decisions to keep the estimates off the ballot 
despite the failure to meet the deadlines on fiscal impact 
statements a statewide vote on the measures goes on without the 
estimates petersons opinion said 
the ballot measure dispute has become an issue in the governors 
race 
attorney general dave frohnmayer the republican candidate said 
secretary of state barbara roberts must accept blame because as the 
states top election officer she should have kept closer tabs on 
the deadlines 
roberts a democrat in turn has accused frohnmayer of playing 
politics with the issue she said frohnmayer also has missed 
deadlines as attorney general

substitute which actually includes a small capital gains

you can take the boy out of baltimore but 
barry levinson keeps returning to his home town for distinctive 
movies 
between such commercial ventures as rain man for which he 
won an academy award good morning vietnam the natural 
and young sherlock holmes he has weaved the story of his life 
growing up in baltimore 
his debut as a director came in 1982 with diner about 
neighborhood pals who reunion at their old gathering place then 
came the tin men with richard dreyfuss and danny devito as 
aluminum siding salesmen at war with each other 
now avalon the title is the name of the baltimore rooming 
house where members of levinsons family the krinchinskys first 
settle on their arrival to the united states early in the century 
the movie spans 50 years tracing the changes in the family and the 
nation 
levinson is portrayed in avalon first as a boy then as a 
young man visiting his dying grandfather played by armin 
muellerstahl the east german actor the director recently talked 
about on why he keeps returning to baltimore for films in an 
interview with the associated press 
q just how autobiographical is avalon 
a more than i thought i wasnt necessarily trying to make it 
absolutely true to life but when i finished it and took a look i 
realized it was even more autobiographical than i thought most 
of the incidents that take place did happen i was surprised 
q what was the origin of the film 
a one day i realized perhaps because i have kids how 
different it is for them nowadays i grew up with grandparents 
around me and my parents and my uncles and my aunts and friends 
of the grandparents they were all around and you were i touch 
with that as a kid people talking different languages telling 
different stories you had this big extended family 
thats almost ended and i think its a loss thats what i 
started to write into and more and more of the things from my life 
kind of got into the piece 
q you have a large ensemble cast does that present certain 
problems 
a unfortunately the jeopardy that you run into when youre 
making nonaction noncrazy comedy things is that youre putting 
an enormous demand on the actors to accomplish the work because if 
we miss in a scene in a relationship the movie is like derailed 
action movies can sustain scenes that dont really work because 
you say wait till we get to the big action scene 
q is there a quality that runs through the levinson films a 
certain gentleness perhaps 
a i think what i try to do is not hype the characters i try 
not to push them beyond what they may in fact do im looking for 
what you might call the smaller dramatic moments rather than the 
bigger ones im trying to find those little moments that we laugh 
at and recognize 
avalon is not a gritty gritty movie because this was not a 
gritty environment it was the end of the 40s before things began 
to radically change 
q how did you break away from baltimore 
a i left to go off to college american university in 
washington dc 
q thats not far from baltimore 
a no 40 miles i ended up coming to la i didnt know 
what i was going to do out here i just came out then i got 
involved in a theater group here 
q what did you study in college 
a i took broadcast journalism i worked in local baltimore 
television and did ok in it but i got fed up with it and didnt 
know what else to do there was not really any place to go unless 
you were interested in sales after youd directed a news show 
youd done it so i came out here with absolutely no idea of what 
to do 
q when you started writing for comedy shows carol burnett tim 
conway and films silent movie high anxiety did you 
think about directing 
a not at all but working with mel brooks was like an 
apprenticeship we were writing when we were on the set since he 
was in the movie hed say what dya think youre watching 
it you saw it being edited and scored things start coming into 
your head 
when i got to diner then i knew it was something i wanted 
to direct 
q whats so great about baltimore 
a i think its a greatlooking city in terms of a period kind 
of look different you know row houses suburbia old woodframe 
homes and trees its always made sense to do those movies there 
q during one scene in avalon a diner is being set in place 
by a crane is that your own kind of grace note 
a yeah i like the idea that it began with diner and 
whatever link these movies might have i like the idea that this 
kid might be going to that diner in the future

smiling cavorting cartoon pandas look out on 
every street but real ones are fading quietly toward extinction 
poachers defy the death penalty to capture their pelts farmers 
and foresters encroach on the shy animals feeding grounds even 
inside reserves 
scientists either from lack of funds or flagging interest have 
stopped studying pandas in the wild 
all except one 
pan wenshi a biologist at beijing university spends half of 
each year huddled on the cool damp slopes favored by pandas 
tracking their movements in hopes of devising better preservation 
strategies 
he has studied the rare animals for a decade and said he nissed 
his daughters childhood in the process 
i want to know why pandas are becoming extinct and to 
help them pan 52 said in an interview only after study can 
we come up with a method for saving pandas otherwise any 
proposals will be blind and unscientific 
for a national symbol whose name and image adorn hundreds of 
chinese products surprisingly little is known about the panda 
organizers of the asian games held in beijing last month chose 
the panda as mascot and plastered images of it all over the city 
but depicted the animal with four digits on each paw real ones 
have six pan pointed out 
ignorance can have more serious consequences hopes of using 
pandas born in zoos to replenish the wild population now estimated 
at 1100 to 1500 have foundered because of the pandas poor 
breeding record in zoos 
pan said many zoos give pandas too much food and too little 
exercise which makes them too fat and weak to mate 
only 37 pandas have been born in captivity in five decades and 
14 of them died within six months he said 
even the 1 million breeding center at wolong in sichuan 
province built help from the world wildlife fund and great 
fanfare has succeeded in producing only one panda in 1986 
scientists have virtually deserted the facility 
people dont know what conditions a mother needs to raise 
cubs pan said does the mother need quiet what diet does she 
need what kind of cave 
such questions have sent him to the remote qinling mountains of 
shaanxi province more than620 miles southwest of beijing where 
an estimated 220 pandas roam 
he snares the animals fits them with radiotransmitting 
collars then releases them and tracks their movements sometimes 
college students and teachers join him as shortterm volunteers 
but graduate student lu zhi is his nnly steady assistant 
its easy to see why 
look at this pan said holding up the 25yearold womans 
hand to show knuckles permanently swollen from cold 
you lose a lot but the rewards are great she said 
among them was the sound of a suckling panda mother and cub the 
mother wore a radio collar 
pan and lu have videotaped hours of mothercub scenes they 
learned that mother pandas leave their cubs for up to two days to 
hunt for food which means cubs found alone in the wild may not be 
abandoned after all 
they learned that fewer than half the qinling mountain pandas 
are fertile and their isolation has led to much inbreeding some 
scientists have proposed introducing one or two pandas from another 
part of the country to enlarge the gene pool but pan said the 
qinling pandas might not accept a newcomer 
one of pans major concerns is how much human presence pandas 
can tolerate tradition and bureaucracy have prevented the removal 
of thousands of peasants from designated panda reserves despite 
the pleas of scientists 
china has so many people moving them wont work pan said 
we need to find out ways that people and pandas can exist in a 
common area 
he has found up to 60 percent of the forest cover in panda 
habitats can be cut down without ill effect he said farming is 
possible if limited to the lower slopes of mountains and if 
forested corridors between mountains are preserved 
firm policing and clear directives from the central government 
are necessary and pan said he would ask for such directives in a 
2000page report he was submitting to the forestry ministry 
too much logging already has been done in some forest areas of 
the qinling mountains he said and others are threatened 
pan said prompt action was needed to save the habitat which he 
described as more promising for longterm panda survival than 
sichuan province to the south more pandas live in sichuan but 
also many more people 
i think there is hope pan said the problems are great 
but we have to continue making efforts if we dont it is over

the swedish army wishes the gripen 
combat plane were as imaginary as the mythological birdbeast whose 
name it bears 
army officers competing with the air force for dwindling 
military funds in a neutral nation call the singleseat gripen the 
greatest threat to defense since swedens last war with napoleon 
ended in 1814 
the griffin which had the head and wings of an eagle on a 
lions body symbolized strength and vigilance the supersonic 
gripen way behind schedule is more than 1 billion over budget 
and the first prototype crashed 
sweden a neighbor of the soviet union with only 84 million 
citizens says it needs a strong defense to reinforce its 
neutrality it has a conscript army of 750000 and produces most of 
its own weapons including missiles tanks submarines artillery 
and explosives 
inflation has reduced the value of military budgets for two 
decades and some experts fear the gripens rising costs will force 
sweden to compromise security for lack of money 
gen bengt gustafsson supreme military commander told 
parliament last month the military budget of 46 billion must be 
increased or sweden will have to revise its defense plans close 
bases reduce military service and dismantle the defense industry 
he also says however that the computerized jet is essential 
it can be programmed for aerial interception ground attack or 
reconnaissance in sweden which has long borders and is surrounded 
by water the air force would hold off an enemy until the army 
could mobilize 
the gripen is a about 45 feet long with a takeoff weight of 
eight tons half the size of the viggen warplane sweden has used 
for 15 years and is much more maneuverable 
army commander ake sagren anticipating a budget battle 
launched a public attack on the gripen in august the army risks 
being phased out the general wrote in the newspaper svenska 
dagbladet and sweden will have an excellent air force well into 
the next century without the new plane 
at a tank training center in kristianstad the southern regional 
capital col roland appelqvists face turned grim when the gripen 
was mentioned and said his base was targeted for closure 
if the aircraft project had stayed within its budget there 
would have been money for the base he said 
sweden budgeted the gripen its largest industrial project at 
866 billion when work began in 1982 but cost overruns total 
116 billion so far and it is 18 months behind schedule the 
second prototype has made several test flights but the first 
crashed after six flights 
the air force has ordered 30 planes and is expected to increase 
that to 140 by the end of the year money for the aircraft has been 
allocated in the longterm defense plan but the cost probably will 
rise to at least 80 million each from the original 65 million 
no outsiders are participating in the gripen project israel was 
building a similar plane the lavi a few years ago but gave up 
after the united states withdrew its backing because of mounting 
costs 
some of swedens largest companies are involved with the gripen 
including saab the ericsson telecommunications group and volvo 
aircraft engines 
saab officials say the civilian aircraft industry they have 
nurtured for a decade would die without the experience and spinoffs 
provided by the warplane gripen project 
parliament must decide by next year how to allocate defense 
money through 1996 gustafsson the supreme commander says 
increasing costs have had the effect over 20 years of nearly 
halving the number of operational defense units 
he said the military needs a grant of 410 million and annual 3 
percent budget increases through the 1990s to finance the gripen 
and current defense policies 
it is unlikely parliament will grant his request at a time when 
the soviet union perceived as the main threat to sweden is 
reducing military spending

its hard enough to separate reality from 
makebelieve on television on cbs murphy brown the line 
between fact and fiction is forever blurred 
reallife news broadcasters walk into the fictional fyi 
newsroom as themselves last season saw tv journalists connie 
chung kathleen sullivan and linda ellerbee in guest roles on the 
comedy series about a makebelieve television news magazine based 
in the nations capital 
besides cameos by news personalities the highly rated program 
also consistently draws its scripts from headline stories 
this season is no different 
the sept 18 premiere of murphy browns third season saw the 
cast and set of fyi undergo a total overhaul complete with 
toupees short skirts and a santa fe nightmare of new furniture 
all in the name of chatty userfriendly news and bigger ratings 
the next episode concerned the everintense liberal and feminist 
lead character murphy brown played by candice bergen doing an 
interview with a racist sexist comedian whom she despised guess 
who the comedian was modeled after 
the shows writers also are working on a script tackling the 
issue of what happens when news personalities say regrettable 
things a la andy rooneys now infamous remarks about gays and 
blacks 
people like to see issues from news and things that affect 
them personally said diane english the programs creator 
coexecutive producer and frequent writer the topicality of our 
shows is one of the favorite things about murphy brown 
last month the academy of television arts and sciences awarded 
the critically acclaimed show an emmy for best comedy series 
bergen also won her second outstanding lead comedy actress trophy 
for her acidtongued portrayal of a star tv journalist 
despite such heady honors english said the show will remain 
largely the same some subtle unexpected plot twists are being 
planned but she wouldnt divulge them 
we like to have surprises for our viewers english said 
and while murphy brown uses news for entertainment 
reallife journalism has decided to use murphy brown for news 
primetime live coanchor diane sawyer just finished a week 
on the set taping a segment on the making of murphy brown if 
sawyers schedule would have permitted english said the former 
60 minutes correspondent might have made an appearance on the 
comedy series while doing a news story about it 
in fact english said her show has extended several invitations 
to sawyer and all the 60 minutes guys including cbs evening 
news anchor dan rather a former 60 minutes guy and mike 
wallace 
rather is really not sure whether this is a good thing for him 
to do english said he has a great sense of humor and it would 
be great if people could see that 
cable talk show host larry kings involvement is being sought 
for an upcoming episode in which brown is taken hostage by 
environmentally conscious ecoterrorists english said shes 
trying to convince people that shes really been kidnapped and no 
one believes her because shes such a practical joker english 
said 
in captivity brown sees king on television and tries to call in 
on the talk shows viewer line 
english said she and husband joel shukovsky the shows other 
executive producer also are considering an episode about 
management survival trips at the suggestion of sawyer 
according to english sawyer said abc had sent her and 
primetime live coanchor sam donaldson into the wilderness to 
rough it for a few days a kind of management retreat that bigger 
corporations are increasingly employing 
english should just film sawyer and the notoriously pugnacious 
donaldson hanging out with mother nature now that would be 
entertainment 
although murphy brown is lauded by critics and has climbed 
steadily if sporadically in the ratings english and shukovsky 
were very close to leaving the show this year because of protracted 
contract battles with warner bros television 
the negotiations were very long and very tedious and very 
dismal at times english said we had even approved a press 
release that cbs was going to put out in april saying we would not 
be coming back to the show 
at the last minute the studio agreed to give the pair more 
money a higher ownership percentage in the program and the right 
to make other shows for other networks 
in return english and shukovsky signed on for 100 more 
episodes 
we made this show english said without us there was no 
murphy brown and we saw the network coming out way ahead of us 
im doing everything but catering the meals 
when it comes to monetary issues in the television business the 
line between reality and makebelieve is very clear 
 
elsewhere in television 
reason no 1289 to continue living if tshirts thermoses and 
pinball machines are not enough the animated simpsons show now 
has spun off into a board game called mystery of life

the third quarter in the stock market was a 
disaster for investors who had to sell almost every market average 
and category took a drubbing only oil gas and gold stocks were 
major exceptions 
the dow jones industrial average the standard amp poors 
500stock index and stock mutual funds lost 15 percent of their 
value but averages for smaller stocks fared worse the 
overthecounter composite index plunged 25 percent 
those who tend to invest in certain categories of stocks might 
have done much worse among new york stock exchange listings 
apparels lost 32 percent textiles 31 percent electronics 29 
percent and automotives 27 percent 
some smallcompany shares lost more than half their value during 
the three months of july august and september it wasnt very 
unusual to see overthecounter stocks with oneday declines of 25 
percent in a single day 
in some instances professional pickers did as poorly as 
amateurs many stock mutual funds lost more than 30 percent of 
their value during the three months that is they performed worse 
than dartthrowers 
the statistical evidence is indeed a picture of disaster but as 
chinese philosophers inspirational teachers evangelists and some 
smart investors try to explain disaster may also spell 
opportunity 
stock prices have now declined to the point where 
aboveaverage longterm investment returns can once again be 
expected says wright investors a large portfolio management and 
advisory company that stresses the long term 
for old investors who were forced to sell the bad news is bad 
indeed but for new investors the bad news is good news a 
twoforone promotion a discount sale the like of which no 
marketing executive ever imagined 
it doesnt come without risk of course because the stock 
market could fall even lower before the bear market ends and the 
sad fact is that the eventual rise in the market is likely to be 
slower than its earlier fall 
nevertheless this is the type of market in which patient 
investors who stress fundamental values and maintain longterm 
perspectives make lots of money it has been demonstrated again and 
again but forgotten as often 
the long term is stressed for example by investment clubs that 
make up a large percentage of membership in the national 
association of investment clubs the ups and downs of the economy 
dont matter to them they go right on buying 
as a result they automatically exploit economic dips and stock 
market declines when the market is high they might have to pay 
10 a share but when it falls they might get two shares for what 
used to be the price of one 
the assumption they make of course is that the general 
tendency of the us economy is to expand and the general 
direction of stocks which reflect that economy is to rise they 
buy and wait and profit 
some do anyway in spite of the professions of optimism and 
patience many individuals and investment clubs lose faith when the 
market falls they fail to perceive opportunity naic records show 
many clubs dissolve 
it isnt easy to see beauty in the debris of a bull market or 
view it as a twoforone sale they might buy toothpaste that way 
but not stocks

stan barbu is 3 and runs on his knees 
because the parents who abandoned him will not let surgeons fix his 
twisted legs the 50 other children in the orphanage are blind 
retarded or maimed 
they are the dregs of tens of thousands of abandoned or orphaned 
children who owe their plight to nicolae ceausescus obsession with 
population growth 
ten months after the commuist dictator was overthrown and 
executed no one knows just how many children languish in romanias 
78 orphanages and in dozens of hospitals the government says there 
may be 60000 in a total population of 23 million but other 
estimates range up to 100000 
what to do with them has yet to be decided some foreigners 
believe adoption is part of the answer 
stan is pale and fairhaired with a broad grin and bright eyes 
that make his crippling infirmities difficult to believe 
his fingers and toes are grown together and his legs bend inward 
in arcs so severe that he must walk and run on his knees he 
delights in showing visitors what he can do 
although stans parents abandoned him two years ago romanian 
law gives them the right to say whether he should have surgery 
they have refused and theres nothing we can do but watch him 
suffer unless the law is changed one of his nurses said 
ceausescu put to death last christmas day did not permit 
contraception and abortion was illegal with few exceptions women 
were required to have regular medical examinations to determine 
whether they were pregnant 
couples were encouraged to have at least four children each but 
ceausescus economic policies made it difficult to afford more than 
one 
parents abandoned tens of thousands of children to state 
institutions dr emil tomescu deputy health minister estimates 
no more than 3 percent of the children in orphanages actually are 
orphans 
of the approximately 800 romanian children diagnosed this year 
as having aids most are abandoned doctors said the fatal disease 
was spread among them through transfusions of infected blood given 
before romania had bloodscreening equipment 
tomescu said he expected legalized abortion new family planning 
centers and an improved economy to help ease the problem of 
abandoned children and orphans 
dr marghareta creteanu director of stans ward at the st 
catherine home for children in bucharest said the institution had 
admitted only 120 children since january about half the number of 
the same period in 1989 
barry child of orphanages trust a british organization that 
aids romania said his organization plans to buy some houses and 
put two to four children in each along with subsidized house 
parents helped by british volunteers 
this way fewer would have to live in orphanages and fewer 
might go to orphanages where he said conditions are absolutely 
terrible 
child said the most serious problem in orphanages was 
understaffing so we first want to provide groups to teach 
the romanian staff wat to do to take good care of the children 
liz brown team leader of four young scottish nurses working as 
orphanages trust volunteers said a head nurse wont just jump 
in and help as we would in other countries and this 
exacerbates the problem 
the deputy health minister tomescu said the government 
recognized the problem and had decided to increase the nursechild 
ratio from 1 to 23 to 1 nurse for each 10 children 
mariana gheorghiu a nurse at the bucharest home said the new 
policy had not yet taken affect and things havent really changed 
much despite the efforts of some dedicated people who came here to 
help 
we have more milk and meat but there is a grave crisis in 
terms of personnel too many kids too few nurses she said 
as she spoke ms gheorghiu changed the diaper of gabriela who 
was 9 months old and dying of pneumonia 
st catherines is known as one of the best childrens homes in 
romania conditions there are poorer than in the west but far 
better than at other romanian orphanages 
david livianu director of the american center for romanian 
adoptable children said adoption is their only way out of a 
lifetime of struggle and indignity 
he took the photographs of 16 children with him to the united 
states in august and said adoptive parents awaited them in the 
united states livianu recently established an adoption center and 
his organization also has offices in the health ministry 
it can cost people up to 15000 to come here stay in romania 
for months and pay middlemen and lawyers en route to adopting a 
child he said we want to encourage people to instead 
make donations which can be used to buy muchneeded biomedical 
equipment such as incubators 
adoption was simplified in august by repeal of a law that 
required presidential approval of all adoptions under the new law 
adoptions are handled by local courts and need only the approval of 
childcare specialists and the childs parents if they are alive 
dan koch 36 the first american to adopt under the new law 
said he encountered very little bureaucratic delay or 
corruption 
i believe it would have taken longer and been more complicated 
back home said koch who works for the delaware state 
insurance commission 
he returned to his wife kathleen with 3yearold ioan now 
named john nicholas

two thousand americans on a hillside 
sang amazing grace and it seemed for a moment like a folk fest 
of the 1960s 
but syria is just over the mountain the valley is only a few 
thousand yards from lebanon and in israel each day brings a new 
threat from saddam hussein protests by palestinians a tax 
increase or other bad news 
israelis from the united states have come to horshat tal in the 
shadow of mount hermon for 15 years to sing of adventure jewish 
independence religious freedom and hopes for a better world 
organizer menachem vinegrad said americans and other 
englishspeaking immigrants started the jacobs ladder festival 
because they were liberals interested in changing the world and 
missed folk and protest songs from home 
a few thousand american jews arrived in the first years after 
independence in 1948 then victory in the 1967 middle east war 
brought a surge of jewish pride and a rush of immigrants 
about 65000 americans now live in israel one of the highest 
population ratios of us expatriates in a foreign country they 
also have one of the highest dropout rates 35 percent 
among the reasons cited by americans who return home are low 
salaries high taxes the military draft and government 
bureaucracy 
one who stayed is yoav peck who in the late 1960s became 
disillusioned with the power of the american establishment and 
failures in the antiwar movement 
instead of fighting against some encrusted social injustices 
and everything i saw in america i got to be a positive part of 
building a nation in its adolescent years said peck director of 
the association of americans and canadians in israel 
he said friends in america who were part of the 1960s protest 
movement at the university of californias berkeley campus now seek 
meaning for their lives in the 1990s 
in his own case peck said he realizes every day that i have 
a lifelong berkeley in israel 
americans have gained recognition in nearly every walk of 
israeli life from golda meir who grew up in milwaukee and became 
prime minister to weatherman bob ulinski from new jersey who 
enchants morning radio listeners with his heavily accented hebrew 
most male american immigrants do reqired army service and 
reserve duty more than 150 have been killed defending the jewish 
state 
israelis from the united states cut across israels political 
spectrum from meir kahane founder of the jewish defense league on 
the extreme right to the peace now movement which favors israeli 
concessions to the arabs 
they are among jewish settlers in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip who argue that those areas are israels by biblical 
right 
unlike israelis who sought refuge from persecution most 
american jews have come as willing volunteers they always have 
been free to return to the united states 
i wasnt a refugee said steve lebowitz of laurelton ny 
the only thing i was running away from in the us was the rat 
race 
lebowitz 38 is israels football commissioner presiding over 
11 amateur touchfootball teams 
israel is a smaller society he said i really feel that 
in israel you can have an impact 
sara chark said she was called antisemitic names while growing 
up in lafayette la a predominantly roman catholic area she has 
three children and moved to israel seven years ago 
here i can go into the street and my neighbor is jewish and i 
know he may hate me because my kids make too much noise or 
something else she said but if there is trouble i know he is 
my brother and will help me 
in 1983 rabbi shlomo riskin of new york arrived with 40 members 
of his synagogue to live in efrat a west bank settlement four 
miles from bethlehem 
in america were at best a footnote to jewish history he 
said in israel we have the possibility of becoming chapter 
headings 
riskin said he views those who came to israel as heroes 
putting the lives of their children and grandchildren on the line 
for the cause of jewish independence 
hebrew is a major challenge for immigrants but the poor grammar 
and heavy accent of joe criden an american who arrived 40 years 
ago has helped make a hit of his television show about car 
maintenance 
we continue being americans said marc leventhal a lawyer 
leventhal from new haven conn is a member of the democratic 
national committee representing americans living abroad he said 
americans in israel have the highest absentee voting rate 
i think most of us discover the meaning of patriotism only 
after we immigrate to israel peck said the real sense of 
belonging and common destiny with a country for many of us is only 
born here 
lenny ravich a founder of the jacobs ladder festival came to 
israel from birmingham ala one habit he gave up was celebrating 
american holidays he said but now he brings hot dogs and relish 
to israeli independence day celebrations 
while we sing israeli songs ill close my eyes and eat a hot 
dog he said that for me is the fourth of july 
david krizelman arrived soon after graduation from the 
university of michigan in 1967 
if you could tell me i could walk around america for a half 
hour during christmas season or go to a college football game on a 
saturday in autumn id find that absolutely wonderful he said 
but i dont miss it enough to look for an excuse to go back

he arrived in time for the tidal wave of great 
society activism championed social concerns during the 
pennypinching reagan era and leaves as he came fighting for civil 
rights 
rep augustus hawkins 83 chairman of the house education and 
labor committee is a black man who never played racial politics a 
liberal who inspires affection among conservatives a courtly 
gentleman who rarely gives up or gives in 
the diminutive softspoken democrat is retiring this year after 
28 years in congress representing watts the los angeles 
neighborhood notorious for the riots that tore it apart in the 
1960s 
in the brave new capitol hill world of sound bites cynicism and 
big money the void left by hawkins departpre may not be 
immediately obvious but there will be one ask any education 
labor or civil rights lobbyist the senior republican on his 
committee even rep tom downey who bested him in a recent dispute 
over how to channel childcare money to states and parents 
this institution is going to miss him terribly said downey 
dny 
he has been a relentless pursuer of social justice said 
michael edwards chief lobbyist for the national education 
association he has very deeply held principles and a great sense 
of mission and yet he was always able to bring people together 
hawkins basic philosophy that government must help its less 
fortunate citizens hasnt changed much since he was elected to 
the california assembly in 1934 
i truly believe every person in our country is entitled to 
equal opportunities if we give them those opportunities it will 
help everybody else thats good ordinary common sense he said 
in an interview last week 
the son of a britishborn adventurer who moved his family to the 
united states after exploring africa hawkins won his house seat in 
1962 he was the first black member from a western state and one 
of the first things he did was sponsor the equal employment section 
of the landmark 1964 civil rights act 
it was an early triumph in a congressional career that has 
spanned eras of plenty and parsimony pendulum swings in political 
thought and the inevitable mixture of achievements and 
disappointments 
chief among the latter was the 1978 humphreyhawkins full 
employment bill which put forth an admirable goal but lost a 
federal job guarantee before passage its been an outright 
failure in terms of implementation hawkins said bluntly no 
ones taken it seriously beginning with the carter 
administration 
the widely supported 1988 welfare reform law with its 
requirement that some recipients take jobs was another setback 
from hawkins perspective workfare is a punitive approach to 
forcing people off the rolls he declared on the floor 
it was an unusually harsh stand for a man who despite his 
enduring new deal concerns generally prefers compromise to 
confrontation 
hawkins grasp of political reality was put to the test in 1984 
when he became committee chairman amid rampant conservatism and a 
scarcity of domestic resources for the most part he adapted well 
building coalitions and inching ahead where possible 
if you only have a potato the only thing you can make is 
potato soup you cant make stew said bob mcglotten chief 
lobbyist for the aflcio under severe circumstances gus has 
done a tremendous job to make sure the educational systems in our 
society dont fall apart 
the kind of money hawkins wanted to spend on education and 
programs for disadvantaged children wasnt available but he 
settled for modest gains and was rewarded with nearunanimous 
passage of many major education bills 
there was far more contention in the labor area including 
protracted battles over raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing 
unpaid family leaves to workers but civility was always the order 
of the day 
we dont have any animosity we have differences said fred 
krebs manager of the us chamber of commerces labor and human 
resources department 
the same civility characterized hawkins relations with 
republicans on the committee who recently threw him a retirement 
party among his gifts was a homemade gavel to crack crabs and a 
gag picture of downey with a forged inscription that said i 
really enjoyed working closely with you 
im very saddened that he is leaving said rep bill 
goodling rpa the senior republican on hawkins committee he 
is one of the finest gentlemen ive ever met 
the two men had a close partnership with the chairman often 
testing his ideas on goodling and molding them to attract broader 
support 
if he doesnt agree with what im trying to do i try to find 
out why i know i will get the same disagreements from others 
hawkins said if i can make modifications well get something 
done if you are really interested in results why not be 
cooperative 
hawkins so lightskinned he is often thought to be white has 
never chaired the congressional black caucus and prefers to cast 
issues in economic rather than racial terms 
he has promoted education health care and nutrition for the 
needy and been instrumental in securing passage of many civil 
rights laws that opened up opportunities for minorities and others 
ironically as he leaves congress hawkins is once again trying 
to restore some of the protections he first fought for in 1964 
bush is threatening to veto this years kennedyhawkins civil 
rights bill although hawkins said he amended it 22 times to try to 
please the administration 
in some ways were back where we were hawkins said it is 
discouraging but not to the point where were giving up you have 
this ebb and flow in american politics you win a few and you 
lose a few by and large you try to be incremental in making 
advances 
when hawkins retires he wont vanish onto the chesapeake bay in 
his beloved fishing boat instead he intends to speak volunteer 
and organize on behalf of job corps head start and other programs 
he fostered in congress you dont have to be in elective office 
to make a difference hawkins said theres lots of things to 
do and in between ill do a little fishing

archaeologists say the tombs of a 
mysterious city have yielded the first example of the use on 
children of an ancient art carving or engraving teeth as a sign of 
beauty 
evidence of the engraving was discovered on the teeth of a young 
boys skeleton found in the ruins of montezumas balcony whose 
civilization was far more advanced than any previously thought to 
exist in the region 
montezumas balcony is 310 miles north of mexico city outside 
ciudad victoria capital of northeastern tamaulipas state its name 
is derived from that of moctezuma the aztec king 
tamaulipas which spent more than 53000 on the project plans 
to open the site to the public this year 
two canyons and a mountain surround the remote 12acre city it 
is reached by a steep rocky road that veers two miles off the main 
highway to 86 huge slabs of stone named the grand stairway 
only from the top of the stairway can the remains of more than 
100 circular structures be seen each up to 50 feet in diameter 
built from stacked and fitted rocks 
more than 100 skeletons were found in basements along with 
ceramic fragments foodgrinding utensils pipes necklaces 
arrowheads knives and small figurines 
the remains of the boy no older than 5 showed evidence of the 
carving called dental mutilation in his two upper incisors and 
one lower incisor 
this is a very rare find said jesus narez director of the 
montezumas balcony restoration project until now we have never 
detected dental mutilations in a person this young 
in primitive cultures dental mutilation is believed to be 
practiced only on adults it still is done by some brazilian 
indonesian and african communities 
we think it hurts a lot but peyote which was commonly 
used in those times was probably used to put the child to sleep or 
dull the pain narez said 
several other things make montezumas balcony unique said 
narez curatorinvestigator of the architectural and cultural 
collections of northern mexico at the national museum of 
anthropology and history in mexico city 
he said two groups of people lived there the grassiles thin 
and fine featured and the robustus bigboned and heavy 
archaeologists chose the names 
at least for now we think they lived there together but 
radiocarbon testing is being done to determine if they were there 
at the same time or if one group followed the other narez said 
according to narez the citys 3000 people probably lived 
between the years 600 and 1400 the elite occupied in the 
structures and were buried in their basements and the others lived 
in wooden huts he said 
references to montezumas balcony appeared in a researchers 
report in the mid1800s and there was another report in the 1940s 
work on the site began in 1988 and was completed in august 
although their culture was higher than others in the area the 
montezumas balcony residents were not as advanced as the 
teotihuacans zapotecs or mayas of southern mexico who built 
pyramids and cities in the same period 
northern tribes like the huastecas the warriorlike chichimecas 
led more primitive simpler lives than the people of montezumas 
balcony narez said 
we never thought wed find these types of buildings so far 
north he said adding that huge pieces of rock used to build the 
montezumas balcony structures were moved with the aid of planks 
and rope 
a tribal group with limited organization would not have had 
sufficient social structure to construct these buildings he 
said they must have had chiefs priests workers and so on 
he said the site probably was chosen because only the side with 
the grand staircase would have to be guarded 
circular structures are typical of huastecas domelike huts of 
palm and wood built over basements were believed to lesson the 
impact of hurricanes and cyclones 
montezumas balcony may have been part of a commercial corridor 
narez said because artifacts like pipes and necklaces show 
influences of tribes from farther north like the kaddo adena 
apaches and mississippians 
he said how its people became extinct had not been determined 
we can only guess at this point he said climate changes 
may have made it hard to get enough to eat there may have been 
frequent fighting with the chichimecas there may have been 
illness

harold pinter the most influential playwright of 
his generation approaches his 60th birthday as an angry artist who 
hasnt written a fulllength play in 12 years 
to celebrate his birthday on oct 10 pinter is being remembered 
with a flurry of revivals and the delayed publication of a 
decadesold novel but there also is a sense among admirers that he 
has momentarily lost or squandered his gifts 
the man who turned the conversational pause into an emotional 
minefield is now known as much for his volatility as for his 
creative talent 
angry old man read the headline of a sept 16 cover story 
in britains sunday correspondent magazine focusing on his personal 
belligerence not his literary output 
in the late 1950s and throughout the next decades pinter 
codified a style steeped in verbal evasion and violence menace 
both spoken and not its effect was felt in the united states in 
the plays of sam shepard and david mamet and throughout british 
literature which suddenly had a new adjective pinteresque 
such plays as the birthday party and the homecoming 
examined the sour even horrifying underside of domestic rituals 
their workingclass milieu reflects pinters early life as the son 
of a jewish tailor from londons east end he began his career in 
the provinces as an actor 
in old times and betrayal he took a literary scalpel to 
highly charged erotic triangles 
betrayal written in 1978 was his last fulllength play 
reflecting on his career right now colleagues wonder whether hes 
capable of another one 
maybe hes said all he wanted to say says actress eileen 
atkins who starred in pinters brief play mountain language 
two years ago 
he hasnt got a play to write alas sir peter hall his 
longtime director says 
but he has many works worth reviving 
this month hall began rehearsals for a 25thanniversary 
production of the homecoming which he previously directed in 
london and on broadway and filmed in 1973 the play originally 
starred pinters first wife actress vivien merchant who died in 
1982 two years after their divorce 
his first major play 1958s the birthday party is on 
national tour and arrives in london on nov 20 
betrayal comes around again next year opening jan 22 
1991 at north londons almeida theater rehearsals start in april 
for a west end revival of the caretaker which pinter himself 
will direct 
all of which reminds admirers how a onceprolific output has 
dried up in the 1980s pinters only stage plays have been 
oneacts a kind of alaska 1982 one for the road 1984 
and the 20minute mountain language 1988 
even his new novel the dwarfs published oct 1 
resuscitates a work first begun and then abandoned more than 30 
years ago 
ive been very busy doing a lot of other things pinter said 
in a radio interview last month for the british broadcasting corp 
i havent any plans to write a play at the moment 
these days its pinters politics not his plays that make 
headlines 
yanquis go home the writer argued in britains independent 
on sunday newspaper in may the piece was a broadside against 
american policy in latin america 
two years earlier pinter and his second wife lady antonia 
fraser formed the 20th july group a forum for antitory opinion 
designed to oppose the policies of conservative prime minister 
margaret thatcher 
i strongly feel its my job as a citizen of this country to 
keep an eye on these things he sad in the bbc interview 
when not distinguishing himself with his political 
outspokenness pinter raises eyebrows with his choice of projects 
a former actor he has turned more and more to directing shows 
that scarcely seem worth his time in 1986 he directed faye 
dunaway in circe and bravo by american writer donald freed to 
mixed reviews 
in may he staged an american satire jane stanton hitchcocks 
vanilla on the west end the play received harsh reviews and 
closed seven weeks later 
screenwriting also keeps him occupied having written such 1960s 
classics as the servant accident and the gobetween 
he began the last decade adapting john fowles the french 
lieutenants woman 
he wrote two recent movies the handmaids tale released 
last spring and the imminent the comfort of strangers based 
on the ian mcewan novel 
pinter told the bbc that it was absolute nonsense however 
to assume his playwriting days were finished 
theres nothing id love more he said im 60 any minute 
and ive got plenty left in me i think

ok video kids fill in the blank 
heres the story 
of a man named 
if you answered brady get in line for the unlikeliest hit 
on chicagos theater scene the real live brady bunch 
the show is a live wordforword reenactment of an episode 
from the early 1970s television series the brady bunch the 
alladult cast plays it straight from the dopey singalong theme 
song to little cindys irritating lisp 
the show has become so popular since beginning its tuesday night 
run in early june that the 110seat annoyance theater added a 
second weekly performance in midaugust the cramped theater in a 
funky north side neighborhood charges 7 a ticket 
if the real live bradys is art and not even the actors 
agree on that point it may be the first case of art imitating tv 
sitcom life a kind of life so far removed from the real thing that 
its well laughable 
a concept this loopy could only have been hatched by people with 
genuine affection for the bradys sisters faith and jill soloway 
who jointly produce and direct the shows for the metraform theater 
company 
we pay tribute to the bradys we dont disrespect them jill 
said 
like the young professionals who fill the theater the soloways 
are in their mid20s and grew up watching the brady bunch which 
stayed on television from 196974 and ran as an hourlong series 
in 1977 before hitting the rerun trail 
we were all really jealous of the bradys jill said a 
sentiment also expressed by several spectators at a recent 
performance 
brady envy its not hard to understand 
in their suburban digs the bradys resided in a universe far 
removed from the social and political turmoil of their times 
teenager greg brady never worried he might be drafted and sent to 
vietnam no brady ever wondered if nixon was a crook 
nor were the brady children ever stressed by the dynamics of 
their mixandmatch family a widower and his new wife her three 
daughters his three sons and alice their oldmaid housekeeper 
brady family crises involved such mundane aggravations as dads 
misplaced architectural plans and middle daughter jan sneaking a 
peek at eldest daughter marcias diary 
and as selfstyled brady historian max merlin a northwestern 
university film student observed their problems always worked 
out in 23 minutes 
actress eve plumb who played jan in the series experienced the 
brady revival firsthand when the soloway sisters flew her in from 
los angeles to guest star in one of their shows during the summer 
she played a bit part choosing not to reprise her role as 
pubescent jan at age 32 
it was a totally bizarre experience plumb said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles where she is a rotating cast 
member of the groundlings an improvisational troupe 
she said she doesnt understand the bradys enduring appeal but 
thinks the chicago show is sort of a hoot 
brady bunch creator sherwood schwartz who also gave us 
gilligans island suggested the lure of the bradys is mostly 
nostalgia 
its something people have as a reference point in their 
youth and they hold fond memories of those shows he said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles 
but chicago actress jane lynch who plays mother carol in the 
real live bradys holds that nostalgia is only part of the shows 
draw 
she said the other half the element that transforms the real 
live bradys from camp into art is the realization by audience 
members that the bradys uncomplicated lives were nothing like what 
life turned out to be 
a teacher once told me the purpose of art is to enlighten and 
inform lynch said this informs us as to what we bought into 
as children and enlightens us that it was crap

the violence of goodfellas and other current 
mob movies hasnt rattled those who crusade against rap and heavy 
metal but in the early 1930s police and concerned citizens agreed 
something had to be done about the too live crew of gangster 
films 
the new york patrolmans benefit association passed a resolution 
calling for a ban on films that glorify the lives of gangsters 
gunmen and racketeers the better films committee of montclair 
nj blamed the death of a 12yearold boy on a gangster movie the 
murderer had seen 
the main culprits were little caesar and the public 
enemy no matter that stars edward g robinson and james cagney 
got theirs in the end who could possibly root for the coppers when 
the bad guys were played by better actors with better wardrobes 
hollywood tried cagney insisted he was sick of carrying guns 
and beating up women movies should be entertaining not 
bloodbaths and when scarface the shame of the nation was 
released in 1932 a grim warning was placed at the beginning of the 
film 
this picture is an indictment of gang rule in america and of 
the callous indifference of the government to this increasing 
menace to our safety and our liberty what are you going to do 
about it 
but director howard hawks undermined the message the thugs 
stole the show none of the speechmaking by the films police 
commissioner was as effective as watching george raft coolly clip 
paper dolls or paul muni gun down fellow mobster boris karloff at a 
bowling alley a bullet knocking down the 10th pin 
being a gangster was better than being president of the united 
states ray liotta boasts as gangster henry hill in the current 
goodfellas munis tony camonte felt the same way as he stared 
outside his apartment at a neon sign that read the world is 
yours 
gangsters really werent that different from the old hollywood 
bosses they talked tough wore fancy clothes cut milliondollar 
deals they grew up poor and had little education but made it to 
the top through hard work ruthlessness and a strong belief in free 
enterprise 
death was inevitable taxes were not 
because they ennoble energy and because they are low 
born cocky and selfsufficient they demonstrate what one can 
accomplish against all the odds outside the traditions film 
critic neil gabler wrote in an empire of their own his book 
about hollywood 
current mob movies include millers crossing starring 
gabriel byrne as an irish mobster with conflicting loyalties 
state of grace another story about irish mobsters this one 
set in new yorks hells kitchen and starring sean penn gary 
oldman and ed harris and martin scorseses goodfellas 
the highly publicized the godfather part iii again 
directed by francis ford coppola is due in november the 
godfather released in 1972 won the academy award for best 
picture and the godfather part ii did the same two years later 
no one can really identify the first gangster film but dw 
griffiths muskateers of pig alley released in 1912 contained 
some of the classic elements a young couple trapped in a war 
between rival gangs a saloon a dance hall crooked cops and 
gunmen with nervous hands 
the gangsters and the making of crooks released during 
the next few years included such devices as a policeman working 
undercover a major part of the 1949 classic white heat and a 
pool hall where crooks and aspiring crooks gathered 
by the late 1920s all a hollywood producer had to do was pick 
up the newspaper to get inspiration torn from todays 
headlines was how one publicity department described the gangster 
films scarface for instance has a plot similar to the 
notorious st valentines day massacre 
al capone nicknamed scarface was feuding for control of 
chicagos bootlegging operations on the morning of feb 14 1929 
four men two dressed as police officers raided rival george 
bugsmorans garage headquarters they lined up the men against 
a wall feigning a routine frisk but instead shattered their bodies 
with bullets 
more and more is the realization growing that pictures can and 
do play an allimportant part in the cultural and educational 
development of the world said jack warner the studio chief at 
warner bros which produced most of the gangster films 
i do not mean we should strive for socalled intellectual 
films but we should strive for pictures that provide something 
more than a mere idle hour or two of entertainment 
this was tabloid moviemaking 90 minutes or less of screaming 
headlines random violence and sex as gentle as a grapefruit in the 
kisser asked how camonte muni got the scar on his face an 
associate snapped in a war with a blonde in a brooklyn 
speakeasy 
darryl zanuck the young production chief at warners was the 
mastermind behind many of the best gangster films including 
little caesar and doorway to hell of cagneys character in 
the public enemy he boasted every other underworld picture 
has had a thug with a little bit of good in him he reforms before 
the fadeout this guy is no good at all itll go big 
warners churned out product like a machine gun spitting 
bullets films were often completed in less than three weeks with 
directors rushing from set to set and writers at times working on 
10 projects at the same time cagney once made six pictures in a 
span of 40 weeks 
some of hollywoods biggest stars began as tough guys and 
molls 
spencer tracy appeared in a series of gangster films notably 
quick millions when he was under contract to fox in the early 
1930s at mgm clark gable was a gangster in several films edging 
just slightly toward the right side of the law as he became more 
famous 
jean harlow had a supporting role in the public enemy bette 
davis appeared opposite tracy in 20000 years in sing sing and 
cagney in jimmy the gent and barbara stanwyck was no angel as 
the star of baby face 
but by 1933 the first run of gangster films was soon over in 
1933 the repeal of prohibition ended the bootlegging wars and the 
following year the hays offices production code called for the 
violence to be toned down and demanded a stop to all the passions 
that stimulate the baser emotions 
gangsters remained on the screen but soon the best films were 
often parodies a slight case of murder reflections on aging 
high sierra or chronicles of a time the roaring 
twenties when silver tongues and deadly bullets gave smalltime 
hustlers the chance to be big shots 
out of this mix of energy suspicion gloom iconoclasm and 
liberalism came not only a distinctive kind of film but also a 
distinctive vision of america particularly urban america 
gabler wrote 
it was a world where ones only hope and only meaning 
lay not in higher morals not in love not in family not in 
sacrifice but in action leavened by a sense of honor 
camonte with a reassuring pat to his coat pocket put it 
another way 
in this business theres only one law you gotta follow to 
keep out of trouble

although david h souter isnt their kind of 
supreme court justice some influential senate democrats are trying 
to make him a benchmark advising president bush that theyll fight 
any future nominee who is markedly more conservative 
the advice accompanied overwhelming senate consent to souter 
who takes his supreme court seat on tuesday democrats said they 
couldnt expect a more moderate choice from bush but wouldnt 
accept one with more restrictive constitutional views 
they may not have a lot of choice as republicans were quick to 
note bush won the right to nominate judges by winning the white 
house in 1988 
one republican said it was all an opening salvo in the next 
round over the supreme court bush will likely appoint more than 
one justice certainly if he wins a second term in 1992 
therein lies the problem for democrats trying to keep the court 
from turning more sharply to the right it already has turned 
since seven of the nine justices were nominated by republican 
presidents 
that pendulum swings reflects justice harry a blackmun a 
republican appointee but an ally of the dwindling liberal bloc on 
issues like abortion and affirmative action the agenda by which 
the spectrum now is defined he is one of two justices over 80 and 
he sees a swing to the right as a change that will last for 
generations 
it will stay that way now for 40 or 50 years im sure he 
said in an interview earlier this year before the retirement of 
justice william j brennan jr the man souter succeeds 
souter was approved 90 to 9 last tuesday the opposition votes 
came from liberal democrats who fear that he will tip the court 
toward reversal of its 1973 decision legalizing abortion but 
theirs was no more than a protest vote because bush never would 
name a justice who would satisfy liberals on that point 
in souter they got a nominee with no clear statements or prior 
rulings on the issue so nobody knows how hed rule he said he has 
no agenda on abortion and would listen to the arguments before 
making up his mind on any ruling 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel who ran the souter hearings 
and voted for confirmation said that if bush were to nominate 
someone opposed to abortion rights the odds on confirmation would 
drop to even at best 
but biden also said that if the democratic senate were to reject 
nominees who werent committed to abortion rights there would be 
an impasse and an eightman court for as long as the president is 
president 
he obviously has no intention of submitting and will never 
submit a nominee who adheres to my very different point of view on 
this matter said biden who supports abortion i know that and 
we all know that 
biden said that bush should not read the wrong message into the 
overwhelming vote for souter the vote doesnt guarantee easy 
confirmation for future nominees he said adding hardliners who 
believe that the constitution is meant to be read very narrowly 
would not be acceptable 
thats easier said than enforced even with a democratic 
majority in the senate 
when the senate voted 58 to 42 to reject robert h bork three 
years ago it was dealing with a highprofile political target a 
man with sharp confrontational conservative positions and the 
vote followed a month of campaigning complete with television 
commercials by a liberal coalition opposed to bork 
but there was not a single senate vote against the confirmation 
of president ronald reagans other three court nominees all 
conservatives all approved unanimously 
with biden and other democrats arguing that souter is as far 
right as bush should dare go sen orrin hatch rutah protested 
what he said appears to be in large part a thinlyveiled 
extraordinary unfortunate and in my view unconvincing effort to 
set the parameters on future nominees 
sen strom thurmond rsc said a president has the right to 
his choice unless opponents of confirmation can prove a nominee 
unfit 
the democrats dont buy that at least when republicans hold 
the white house 
sen edward m kennedy dmass who opposed souter because of 
his philosophy argued the opposite case 23 years ago when 
president lyndon b johnson named thurgood marshall to the court 
kennedy said then that the senate should consider the background 
temperament qualifications and integrity not whether the views of 
a supreme court nominee coincide with their own 
thurmond was one of the 11 senators who voted against marshalls 
confirmation in 1967 
inconsistency is bipartisan

when robin d was in her late 20s fighting 
heroin addiction gateway rehabilitation center allowed smoking 
she kicked heroin but she couldnt kick cigarettes 
last summer robin died of emphysema she was 43 
that just pushed me over the brink gateways cofounder and 
medical director dr abraham twerski said 
her death strengthened his determination to help alcoholics and 
drug users stop smoking cigarettes which he noted kill more 
americans than all other drugs combined 
so last october the 139bed center 20 miles northwest of 
pittsburgh repainted its yellowed walls and banned smoking by 
patients and staff but after effectively treating drug and alcohol 
abusers for 18 years the ban lasted just eight months 
it was easy to write a policy it was hard to make it work 
neil capretto director of treatment said 
at first gateway treated nicotine like any other moodaltering 
substance you use youre kicked out sharon eakes director 
of therapy programs said 
patients whose last names are abbreviated to protect their 
privacy argued and pleaded alcoholic joe m begged through tears 
to be admitted to gateways relapse program and be allowed to 
smoke and ms eakes had to turn him away 
fuming patients demanded the right to smoke during one 
community meeting one patient threatened to call in the american 
civil liberties union ms eakes said 
leeann unitas patient evaluator remembered the feeling among 
patients as not right now i cant do everything at the same 
time 
gateway held its ground and many patients held theirs smoking 
on the sly under the threat of dismissal and they lapsed into 
addictive behaviors 
family and friends smuggled in tobacco 
people drove up to the center at odd hours dropped off 
packages and sped away 
a black market developed in which a single cigarette sold for 
3 to 5 
nicotine products were hidden in toilets ceilings radios and 
even body cavities 
patients went awol to walk to the corner gas station to buy 
cigarettes they were sneaking out at night climbing out of 
windows capretto said 
the risks were great for some gateway is the last chance to 
salvage a relationship with a spouse fed up with drug abuse or to 
keep a job where the boss has warned to dry out or move on 
knowing what was at stake and seeing toughness fail 
administrators softened and allowed illicit smokers two warnings 
before cutting them loose but the change just created an extra 
level of bureaucracy with lists of patients warned once and twice 
the smoking and dismissals coninued 
the policy grated on staff members too employees who quit 
smoking felt the same pressure and frustration as the patients 
among the workers were recovering drug users who didnt appreciate 
being treated like addicts again 
it was as if they were being told their recovery didnt 
count ms eakes said 
employees smoked at home then felt guilty enforcing gateways 
rule against patients sympathetic staffers pretended not to see 
patients smoking ms eakes said 
for her the last straw came when a convict ordered by the court 
to lose his addiction was kicked out of gateway he had been caught 
walking down the road to k mart for cigarettes she said 
the man went back to jail for smoking 
by may the dropout rate had tripled and the nonprofit 
treatment center was losing money more importantly values were at 
stake the quality that gateway tries hardest to instill in 
patients fighting addictive behavior honesty was being 
undermined 
today gateway holds to a tenuous compromise created in part 
after officials learned at a convention last spring that other 
smokefree clinics allowed smoking in restricted areas 
patients are not permitted to smoke during lectures or group 
therapy which take up most of their time but they may smoke in 
their leisure time in a designated area outdoors 
thats going to hurt a lot of people said darryl s a coal 
miner who managed to kick alcohol and cigarettes in a fourweek 
program at gateway 
every few days i think about it he said you do 
something for so long you pick a cup of coffee up well a 
cigarette goes with it 
but the urge passes in 30 or 40 seconds he said now proudly 
nicotine and alcoholfree he spends more time with his family and 
rides a bicycle nearly every day 
terry s 49 hung in and also kicked nicotine and alcohol at 
gateway but the tobacco lure proved too strong for terry an 
accounting manager in west virginia with his own office and plenty 
of opportunity to puff his usual 30 cigarettes a day 
today im smoking he said i dont know if its the 
pressure or the stress i would truly like to quit 
it could take years but twerski hopes to try again to establish 
a truly smokefree clinic 
were looking as to what happened its all very recent weve 
got to do our homework he said i still hope to go for the 
full loaf

doctors have long felt justified urging americans 
to lower their cholesterol even though many of them probably wont 
benefit cutting fat out of the diet certainly cannot hurt anyone 
or can it 
evidence is mounting that people who lower their cholesterol do 
indeed reduce their risk of dying from heart disease but a new 
report concludes that is completely offset by a striking increase 
in another way of death 
for reasons no one can explain when people reduce their 
cholesterol they seem to become more likely to die from accidents 
suicides murders and other violent tragedies 
the questions about adverse effects of cholesterol reduction 
are not at all answered said dr matthew f muldoon who 
directed the study that causes a lot of problems for the 
strategy that you give cholesterol reduction to everybody because 
it doesnt do any harm that cant be said with much confidence 
could it be that by at least one measure lowering cholesterol 
does as much harm as good 
the discovery is so difficult to understand that experts are 
cautioning people against suddenly going back to wolfing down slabs 
of roast beef and gobs of ice cream stick to the lowfat regimen 
they urge until they sort out whats happening 
its an interesting and disturbing phenomenon said dr john 
larosa dean for research at george washington university medical 
center expressing concern is appropriate but not making policy 
changes based on this 
health policy rarely changes as a result of a single study and 
in this case muldoon and a few other skeptics are up against the 
inertia of public belief in the evils of cholesterol as well as the 
interests of a corps of influential heart specialists who want to 
change americans way of eating 
hints that lower cholesterol is linked with some forms of cancer 
and strokes have not cooled anticholesterol zeal neither have 
niggling doubts about whether old people women and children need 
to worry about their cholesterol 
the chief vehicle for promoting the mainstream view is the 
governments 5yearold national cholesterol education program its 
goal is to persuade people to get their cholesterol checked eat 
less saturated fat and lower their average cholesterol level by 10 
percent 
it is a very prudent public health policy said dr james 
cleeman the programs coordinator this study does not shake my 
confidence in the wisdom of that approach 
nonetheless the latest research increases doubts for some 
the finding that there is no clear benefit in total mortality 
is of concern said dr paul meier a tatistician at the 
university of chicago its cause for being more circumspect in 
insisting that everybody has got to get his cholesterol down 
lowering cholesterol reduces the risk of heart attacks since 
heart attacks kill 500000 americans a year many assume that lower 
cholesterol also helps people live longer but proof is skimpy 
several studies that have delved into the health effects of 
cholesterol reduction have been too small or too short to yield 
definite conclusions 
so muldoon a university of pittsburgh researcher decided to 
combine results of several studies to see if a statistically 
meaningful picture emerges 
his report published recently in the british medical journal 
joined the statistics of six comparison studies conducted on a 
total of 24847 healthy men these people either reduced their 
cholesterol levels an average of 10 percent or carried on without 
change 
muldoon calculates that for every 100000 people who cut their 
cholesterol there are 28 fewer deaths each year from heart 
disease but there are also 29 more deaths from suicides homicides 
and accidents 
thus as many lives are lost as are saved 
it hasnt been a large enough increase to cause a national cry 
of alarm but anybody carefully analyzing the facts has to be 
concerned about it said dr thomas james president of the 
medical branch of the university of texas at galveston 
one of the most puzzling aspects of this discovery is that there 
is no obvious scientific explanation muldoon raises three 
possibilities 
cholesterol is an important ingredient of the bodys cells 
perhaps lowering the bodys supply changes brain chemistry and 
behavior and this somehow makes people more reckless or 
aggressive 
people find it chronically frustrating to give up the food 
they like and this also makes them more apt to die tragically 
the cholesterollowering drugs tested in the studies tasted 
awful and caused intestinal problems there may be a susceptible 
group of folks where this pushes them over the edge muldoon 
said 
actually the studys findings are no surprise to people who 
have followed the major cholesterol experiments of the 1980s 
the first strong evidence that lowering cholesterol cuts the 
risk of heart disease came in 1984 when researchers finished the 
lipid research clinics coronary primary prevention trial 
men who took cholesterollowering drugs in this experiment 
reduced their heart disease rate by 19 percent but they didnt 
live longer while they experienced eight fewer coronary deaths 
than a comparison group they suffered seven more violent deaths 
at the time researchers dismissed the increase in violent deaths 
as a statistical fluke 
there was no obvious connection among these unfortunate people 
one was murdered others committed suicide some died in car 
accidents including ones in which they were not even behind the 
wheel 
however three years later the helsinki heart study found 
something similar 11 violent deaths in those with lower 
cholesterol four in the comparison group 
in all researchers have conducted six studies to test the 
effects of lowering cholesterol alone on otherwise healthy people 
when muldoon combined their results he found the chance of dying 
from suicide or violence nearly doubled after cholesterol 
reduction 
muldoon said other lines of research also have suggested links 
between behavioral problems and cholesterol unusually low 
cholesterol levels have been seen in criminals murderers and 
people with aggressive conduct disorders or poor selfcontrol 
a study by dr jr kaplan of bowman gray school of medicine 
looked at the effects f cholesterol on monkeys he found that 
animals fed a lowfat diet like the one recommended by the american 
heart association to lower their cholesterol committed 50 percent 
more aggressive acts than did those eating fat levels closer to the 
typical american diet 
even if muldoons theory is correct backers of the war on 
cholesterol argue that too much is made of death by warding off 
heart attacks cholesterol reduction saves money reduces misery 
and helps people lead healthier lives 
dr william castelli director of the framingham heart study 
said muldoon is trying to make the public believe that all that 
happens to you is death well its the least that happens to you 
when you have your heart attack youre not going to die he 
said youre going to be alive and chronically ill for the rest 
of your life we can prevent that

public enemy no 1 a communist plot 
nervepoison 
in the 1950s opponents of fluoridation marshaled rhetoric and 
research to fight what they called the poisoning of public water 
supplies some doctors linked fluoride to indigestion deafness 
and skin and mental diseases 
today fluoride is mainstream toothpaste tubes blare it 
bottled drinks and mouth rinses contain it and doctors recommend 
it sixtyone percent of americans live in communities with 
fluoridated public water 
but the debate is far from over 
take jody morgenegg who gathered signatures and handed out 
fliers seeking to stop the scotia village board from putting 
fluoride in the water system 
its carcinogenic she said we feel its not appropriate 
to adulterate the water with it 
or jim palmer one of several board trustees who voted to 
fluoridate village water earlier this year its going to protect 
the children in the years their teeth are really forming 
the board won and scotia has been fluoridating its water since 
march 
most major american health organizations including the us 
public health service the american dental association and the 
american medical association have endorsed fluoridation and cite 
hundreds of studies that show fluoride reduces dental caries most 
health organizations recommend one part per million when 
fluoridating drinking water 
its a safe and effective means of preventing tooth decay 
said darrell sanders fluoridation engineer with the federal 
centers for disease control 
but a vocal minority condemns fluoride as an industrial waste 
product that not only mottles teeth but kills thousands of people 
every year 
if youre drinking fluoridated water for 20 30 years youre 
probably increasing your cancer risks by 5 to 15 percent john 
yiamouyiannis a biochemist in delaware ohio said 
this year debate over fluoride rose a notch with the release of 
a study by the national toxicology program showing that some male 
rats given high doses of fluoride in water suffered higher rates of 
bone cancer than rats and mice on lower doses 
the author of the study dr john bucher said the results 
provided only equivocal evidence that fluoride is linked to 
cancer 
scientists first linked the mottling of teeth to fluoride early 
this century in parts of the southwest they found the condition 
often called colorado brown stain or texas teeth and known 
today as fluorosis in places with high natural levels of fluoride 
in drinking water fluoride a compound of the element fluorine is 
found in rocks and soil and in at least trace amounts in natural 
water supplies 
later research among children including pilot studies in 
newburgh ny and grand rapids mich in the 1940s showed that 
controlled amounts of fluoride in water sharply reduced tooth 
decay 
at first scientists were unclear why today fluoride is 
believed to reduce the solubility of enamel in acid and can 
remineralize enamel that has suffered decay 
since then fluoridation has spread 
the pennsylvania legislature is considering a bill that would 
require most water companies in the state to fluoridate at least 
eight other states have passed similar bills said dr h william 
gross chairman of partners for better oral health a coalition of 
groups backing the pennsylvania bill 
the reduction in dental caries in the decades since fluoride was 
introduced is substantial the rate of tooth decay has declined by 
as much as 75 percent to 80 percent since the 1940s according to a 
1988 study by the national institute for dental research 
but opponents of fluoridation attribute the decline to better 
infant nutrition and dental hygiene and contend most of the 
studies linking fluoride to tooth decay reduction are biased 
instead they say fluoride is a lethal byproduct of the 
phosphate industry 
dr albert burgstahler a professor at the university of kansas 
said he has treated people for fluoridation poisoning chronic 
fatigue headaches and gastrointestinal problems 
when patients switch to nonfluoridated water they found that 
their symptoms cleared up burgstahler said 
its the nonspecific syndrome said stephen corbin a 
dental public health specialist with the cdc none of that stuff 
has been attributed to fluoridation exposure

vegetarian students considering colleges have to 
look at more than just the course catalog 
at some schools they could be end up surviving on salad bars and 
peanut butter while at others entire dining rooms are devoted to 
vegetarian food 
food service directors are really working hard in meeting each 
segment of the student populations expectations said clark 
dehaven of the national association of college and university food 
service in east lansing mich 
vegetarian eating has grown slowly but steadily over the last 
decade in colleges dehaven said but vegetarian times magazine 
said it could find no public high schools that have developed 
vegetarian menus 
an estimated 8 million to 9 million americans are vegetarians 
the marriott corp which provides food for about 400 colleges 
offers at least one vegetarian entree at lunch and dinner in 
addition to salad bars and yogurts spokeswoman kathy boyle said 
the company had about a dozen vegetarian recipes in its menu 
rotation 15 years ago and now has about 50 including carrot loaf 
with pea sauce curried vegetables with beans and sunflower seeds 
and vegetable quiche she said 
i think its a matter of taking the time and investing the 
time in the students and developing a program said paul 
tuennerman director of dining services for morrison custom 
management which provides the food at swarthmore college in 
pennsylvania 
a year and a half ago i thought a vegetarian entree was rice 
with cheese on it he said 
then tuennerman began meeting with vegetarian students reading 
books and testing recipes now the school serves such dishes as 
tofu oriental salad carrot loaf eggplant con queso and moroccan 
stew with yams raisins carrots and other vegetables 
there are two vegetarian choices at every meal one of them 
vegan meaning no animal products of any kind lactoovo 
vegttarians eat no flesh but do eat eggs and dairy products 
at oberlin colleges lactoovo veggie dining hall there 
also is a vegan option for lunches and every other dinner said 
dietitian rebecca stotter 
about 20 percent of oberlins 2200 students eat vegetarian and 
theres usually a waiting list for the dining hall she said 
were finding more students are wanting strict vegan entrees 
health reasons possibly ethical reasons too stotter said it 
seems to me that its increasing i do think more colleges are 
offering vegetarian options 
yale university has served vegetarian food since the early 
1970s but only started offering a vegan menu in the spring of 
1989 said karen dougherty executive dietitian for the division of 
dining halls 
we have noticed that students are eating down the food 
chain dougherty said they are eating less beef and more 
chicken and fish and the vegetarian students are eating more vegan 
dishes 
but at some places there may not be much more than rabbit 
food i think a lot of places right now are like that said 
lige weill of the vegetarian awareness network a washingtonbased 
nonprofit organization that disseminates information about 
vegetarianism 
cindy meyers a sophomore at the university of kentucky at 
lexington is collecting signatures on a petition in an effort to 
get more vegetarian food in the cafeterias at her school 
last year she said id eat the same things every day salad 
potatoes that sort of thing but she said she is finding less 
variety in the cafeteria she frequents this year 
its not only that there arent many choices like vegetarian 
lasagne but its also green beans cooked in bacon or that sort of 
thing that you dont know about she said

after a strenuous workout you can feel proud 
and not just because you survived exercise some researchers 
say might improve your selfesteem although they say you cant 
bank on it 
all i have is anecdotal information and it appears those who 
persist in exercise say yeah it enhances selfesteem said 
wynn f updyke associate dean of health physical education and 
recreation at indiana university in bloomington 
updyke is setting up a study to check the relationship between 
exercise and selfesteem he and his colleagues intend to give 
physical and psychological tests to about 800 students from fourth 
grade on for at least three years they want to study changes over 
time so they can search for possible cause and effect 
the researchers plan to test the idea that confidence in a 
students physical abilities generalizes into confidence about 
himself and they want to see if improved exercise performance 
generalizes into better grades 
previous research generally has reported that people who 
exercise tend to have higher selfesteem said robert j sonstroem 
a professor of physical education at the university of rhode 
island 
however it hasnt been proved if exercise causes a change 
and assuming it does how important exercise is compared with 
other causes he said 
although sonstroem believes exercise might raise a persons 
opinion of his body which could lead to higher overall 
selfesteem others are less certain 
i think that question is still out said don hellison a 
professor of physical education at california state university at 
chico do we think about ourselves in a holistic way or in terms 
of roles and abilities 
selfesteem about physical appearance fitness and competence in 
sports might correlate with each other without generalizing into an 
overall feeling said hellison who is working with updyke to plan 
the study 
another issue is that selfesteem seems to have a lot of 
behavioral roots making it difficult to find a measurement system 
that can tease the roots apart updyke said in physical education 
for instance its never just exercise its always sports or 
some other sort of skillful activity he said 
the fitness tests to be used in the study will try to reduce the 
skill component by including such standard laboratory measures as 
stationary bicycle riding updyke said 
if the results are positive they may indicate something else 
about selfesteem that trying and succeeding is good for your 
emotional health updyke said if thats the case then programs to 
improve selfesteem through exercise might empower disadvantaged 
students to take charge of their lives in other areas the research 
outline said 
for that matter sonstroem said the amount of exercise you do 
may be less important than how you feel about your accomplishments 
in doing it 
nothing succeeds like success with selfesteem he said

rural hospitals that dont adopt some 
of the strategies of their bigcity rivals have little hope of 
fiscal recovery a federal health expert said 
rural hospitals need to develop more aggressive marketing 
strategies using radio and television at times as well as 
aggressive community campaigns said jeffrey human executive 
director of the office of rural health policy for the us 
department of health and human services 
hospitals need to be promoted within their communities said 
human and citizens need to know that if they dont support their 
hospitals theyll lose them and the access to health care they can 
afford 
human said one in 10 rural hospitals closed in the last decade 
six hundred of the remaining 2500 are in dire fiscal condition he 
said at a state rural health conference last month 
the consequences of the closure of a rural hospital to local 
residents are almost always more significant than the closure of 
one of many urban hospitals said human 
contributing to the failing health of rural hospitals he said 
are 
rural hospitals are paid 25 percent less than urban hospitals 
when reimbursed by medicare for comparable procedures 
falling admissions caused in part by physicians referring 
patients to urban hospitals 
a large percentage of rural patients unable to pay hospital 
bills 
shortage of doctors nurses and other professionals

the remains of a 700yearold fish trap 
may shed some light on the history of the tlingit indians in 
southeastern alaska 
a fisherman found the trap along an eroding bank of montana 
creek last year 
a curved and fragile section of the basket trap is being kept in 
a plastic tub filled with water at the alaska state museum because 
it is too delicate to expose to air which would reduce it to dust 
root lashings on the trap disappeared before workers eyes when 
exposed to the air said steve henkriskon museum collections 
curator 
the surging creek a tributary of the mendenhall river 
apparently covered the trap with mud and silt hundreds of years 
ago the mud cut off oxygen helping to preserve the trap 
henrikson said 
after collaborating with several agencies and organizations 
henrikson and archaeologist wally olson removed onethird of the 
trap from the water in may the rest remains buried under a 
protective layer of mud 
recent carbon testing dated the cylindrical trap to sometime 
between 1270 and 1410 more than 300 years before russian explorer 
vitus bering came to alaska 
the techniques tlingits used to build the traps have been lost 
said steve langdon an anthropologist at the university of alaska 
anchorage 
jon erlandson an anthropology professor at the university of 
oregon said the trap has the potential to tell anthropologists how 
the devices were constructed erlandson and his wife 
anthropologist madonna moss formerly worked at the university of 
alaska fairbanks and have seen the trap at the museum 
he said the trap is clearly a tlingit artifact likely from the 
auke tlingit indians 
the montana creek trap also may help settle a debate about when 
the tlingits settled in southeastern alaska some historians 
contend they were relative newcomers settling in the area as 
recently as 300 years ago 
but some anthropologists believe tlingits may have settled in 
the region as long as 3000 years ago

for an already weakened us economy 
greenspans views were considered crucial to chances for success 
by the bush administration which hopes the fed will support the

is britain europes economic miracle of the 
1980s in a recession 
it depends whom you ask 
prime minister margaret thatcher says no she criticizes 
voices of gloom for exaggerating shortterm economic 
difficulties and insists interest rates will stay high until the 
106 percent inflation rate is tamed 
but many business people and economists say yes britains 
largest employers group the confederation of british industry is 
calling for a cut in 15 percent interest rates to to ensure that 
the recession is not any deeper than it needs to be 
britains economy is in a recession and there is now room for 
a gradual easing in interest rates said david kern chief 
economist of national westminster bank 
britons have enjoyed eight years of sustained economic growth 
which was thought to have ended a cycle of high inflation and high 
interest rates now the country is suffering what many economists 
call the same old symptoms and is putting in the worst performance 
of the major industrialized countries 
the generally accepted definition of a recession is two 
consecutive quarters of negative or zero economic growth one of 
the difficulties however is pinpointing when a recession has 
begun 
mrs thatcher addressing the welsh confederation of british 
industry last week complained that newspapers already have 
proclaimed the beginning of a world recession a return to 
stagflation and an end to the united kingdom economic miracle 
she said every new statistic including the latest monthly 
survey by the confederation of british industry is interpreted as 
heralding the onset of a major economic downturn 
the confederation survey showed confidence in britains 
manufacturing had hit the lowest point in eight years and provided 
clear evidence the economy had moved into recession 
business risks talking itself into a completely unjustified 
mood of doom and gloom a kind of artificial psychological 
trough deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe said last week 
chancellor of the exchequer john major said the word recession 
implies a slump as deep as the great depression 
we are not in those sorts of circumstances he said we 
have a significant but necessary slowdown at the moment 
but karl otto poehl president of germanys bundesbank or 
central bank disagrees the uk is already in a recession he 
said last week 
kern of national westminister bank said the recession signals 
include a rise of 20000 in the number of jobless in august up 
from 13000 in july and a dun amp bradstreet corp report of a 35 
percent increase in business failures in the first nine months of 
1990 to the highest number in a decade 
he predicts economic growth will fall 08 percent in the third 
quarter and 1 percent in the fourth 
the economists offered one consolation that the setback wont 
be as bad as last time around during the last recession which 
began in the first quarter of 1980 economic contraction lasted 
five straight quarters 
it bears absolutely no comparison with 19801981 which was 
more painful said kevin darlington an economist at the london 
investment firm ubs phillips and drew 
if interest rates come down britains economy could recover 
next year the economists say

the millions of americans who sock away money in 
mutual funds didnt escape the pain and suffering on wall street 
during the past three months 
in addition to taking a toll on the blue chips of the dow jones 
industrial average the quarter that ended sunday belted funds 
across the board the persian gulf and the weakening economy were 
to blame 
there were very few places to hide in the third quarter 
said michael lipper whose company lipper analytical securities 
corp released its quarterly performance report on nearly 1800 
mutual funds wednesday 
lipper groups the funds into 27 categories based on the type of 
investments they make such as growth stocks or corporate bonds 
twothirds of these groups performed as poorly as they did in past 
recessions 
and the worst may be yet to come 
if we look at our measures of prior down markets compared with 
the present there may be more to go lipper said in an 
interview 
mutual funds are a popular way for individuals to invest in the 
stock bond and money markets by pooling the money of many 
investors mutual funds can buy a wider variety of securities than 
could a single investor limiting the risk should any of the 
investments go bad 
lippers figures were for funds that invest in stocks and 
taxable bonds they did not include money market mutual funds a 
popular investment alternative to savings accounts or funds that 
invest in taxexempt government bonds 
among the funds in the ranking those that invest in stocks 
fared the worst during the third quarter declining an average of 
155 percent that compares with a gain of 59 percent in the 
second quarter 
by comparison the 30stock dow jones average had a negative 
return of about 14 percent during the quarter assuming dividends 
were reinvested while standard amp poors 500 stock index another 
popular gauge of the stock market lost 137 percent lipper said 
a decline in stock funds also was not surprising given the 
unusually strong performance of these funds in the 1980s lipper 
said the topranked fund in the 10 years ended sept 30 fidelity 
investments magellan fund grew 6227 percent which he called 
unsustainably high 
the iraqi standoff also took a toll on many bond funds during 
the quarter since bond prices are extremely sensitive to the 
inflation caused by higher oil prices funds that invest in 
longterm taxable bonds declined 08 percent on average during the 
quarter compared with a gain of 32 percent in the second quarter 
the only groups of funds that grew were socalled world income 
funds which invest primarily in corporate bonds worldwide and 
gold funds which buy stock of gold mining companies as well as 
gold bullion and coins both were up about about 4 percent 
however individual funds in other groupings also rose 
including funds that invest in energy companies that benefitted 
from the oil price runup lipper said 
among the losers were funds that invest in science and 
technology companies financial services environmental companies 
and small businesses he said 
so what should an investor do 
david mclaughlin a financial adviser with chase investment 
counsel in charlottseville va said that depends on the objective 
of the investment 
if its for retirement it may be safe to stay in stock funds 
since the longterm trend of the stock market is up despite 
periodic slumps these investors should look for funds that have a 
good record in bear markets he said 
but for shorterterm investments consider short and 
mediumterm government securities mclaughlin said 
signs of a looming economic downturn were evident at the end of 
the second quarter lipper said when half of the lipper fund 
groups were performing as they did in previous recessions now 
with twothirds of them performing this way there is no doubt 
about the state of the economy he said 
but theres some shortterm positive news for fund investors he 
said 
were down far enough that we can have a rally in this fourth 
quarter as some investors sense the fund prices are cheap enough 
to make them attractive he said 
during the third quarter the topperforming fund was dreyfus 
capital value fund up nearly 13 percent in total return for the 
year ended sept 30 the top gainer was equity strategies a small 
fund that invests in bankrupt companies and is closed to new 
investors 
the worst performer for the quarter and the year ended sept 30 
was the prudent speculator leveraged fund which plummeted almost 
47 percent for the quarter and 51 percent for the year the fund 
borrows money to make its investors money go further increasing 
its risk in a down market lipper said 
for the past 10 years the worstperforming fund was the 44 wall 
street fund which dropped almost 83 percent in return lipper 
called it a stockpicking fund that has had a checkered 
career

a proposal to give 111 billion in new tax 
breaks to small corporations is being criticized as opening the 
door for wealthy investors to duck their share of federal taxes 
the bush administration is pushing the new incentives as a 
substitute for the capital gains tax cut that congressional leaders 
refused to accept some of those leaders are suspicious of the 
substitute which actually includes a small capital gains 
reduction 
the proposal is attached to the 500 billion fiveyear 
deficitreduction agreement that president bush and congressional 
leaders reached this week 
the tax break proposal has very serious flaws sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee said 
wednesday i think it will lead to a substantial increase in tax 
shelters and great abuse 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee also has reservations if the proposals are 
growth incentives he thinks they promise only to help tax shelters 
grow an aide said 
public outrage about tax sheltering was a major factor in the 
sweeping income tax overhaul in 1986 before then many wealthy 
individuals and profitable corporations were able to cut their 
taxes to almost zero by making investments many with no chance of 
success that offered huge upfront deductions 
a chamber of commerce official said the new provisions could be 
drawn tightly enough to avoid reviving such tax shelters 
bush said the plan would provide powerful new incentives for 
productive investment in the kinds of companies that account for 
much of americas job growth 
the key part would allow a person to deduct 25 percent of the 
first 50000 invested in a year in a small corporation such a 
corporation would be defined as one with nonborrowed capital of 
50 million or less 
critics said the definition is so broad it could cover some 
giant companies so heavily in debt that stockholder equity falls 
below the 50 million threshold 
others noted the possibility a big company could split into 
smaller divisions in an effort to attract investors looking for tax 
breaks 
its an outrage and probably stands a shot at being knocked 
out of the budget package said robert mcintyre director of 
citizens for tax justice a laborfinanced group we dont see 
the need to encourage people to invest their money in ways that 
dont make sense for them in the absence of a tax incentive 
the special deduction and several other smallcorporation 
incentives were written into the budget agreement at the 
administrations insistence that occurred after congressional 
leaders refused to accept bushs proposal to cut the capital gains 
tax on grounds that nearly 80 percent of the benefit would go to 
those with incomes over 100000 a year 
capital gains the profits from the sale of investments are 
fully taxed at the same rates as other income 
one of the proposed incentives is a new capital gains tax cut 
albeit a narrow one it would allow an investor in a small 
corporation to avoid tax on up to half the price for which the 
stock was sold as long as it was held at least five years 
steve entin an analyst with the conservative institute for 
research into economics of taxation who wants a broad capital 
gains cut said the incentive package is so narrowly drawn that it 
would benefit only a handful of welltodo people who could 
afford to sink a substantial portion of their money into risky 
small companies 
ordinary investors have to diversify to reduce risks entin 
said and there is little in the package for them

the four transactions prosecutors have chosen to 
prove that michael milken made a career of lawbreaking have one 
thing in common they all involve taking advantage of clients 
legal experts said that theme contrasts starkly with the defense 
portrait of the junk bond financier now and in the past as a man 
who made a few mistakes trying to better serve his customers 
in picking its silver bullets for a minitrial on allegations 
milken has not been formally charged with or pleaded guilty to he 
government wants to challenge a posture that milkens crimes were 
aberrant 
us district judge kimba wood ordered the unusual proceeding so 
she could better understand milken and devise an appropriate 
sentence 
three of the transactions involve some form of trading on 
nonpublic information available to milken about a client behavior 
now viewed as a sinister and deliberate breach and not a technical 
regulatory violation 
three of the allegations involve dealings with ivan f boesky 
the disgraced stock speculator who spent time in prison and gave 
the government the lions share of its dirt on milken 
contrary to his efforts to characterize the crimes he 
committed as petty milkens crimes were neither technical or 
victimless the government said in its lengthy presentencing 
memorandum 
the justice department claims against milken will be aired at 
the special hearing scheduled to begin oct 11 after wood on 
wednesday pushed back the start date by two days they were 
included in the governments memorandum designed to persuade wood 
to sentence milken to a long prison term 
milken former head of drexel burnham lambert incs highyield 
bond department faces a maximum 28 years in prison on six felonies 
to which he pleaded guilty in april after a nearly fouryear 
investigation 
the transactions to be taken up at the court hearing involve 
allegations of insider trading and other violations in trading 
securities of caesars world inc mgmua entertainment inc and 
storer communications inc and manipulation of wickes cos stock 
in court papers milkens attorneys said their client did 
nothing wrong in the transactions prosecutors plan to call up to 
14 witnesses to bolster their claims including boesky and several 
former drexel employees 
after milkens guilty plea his chief lawyer arthur liman 
noted that the six counts didnt involve insider trading and most 
of them were instances in which michael went too far in helping 
clients 
now the government is using legal precedent to offer the 
unproven claims at sentencing as evidence of years of wrongdoing 
judge wood asked prosecutors to limit their presentation to under 
five of about 35 unproven crimes 
the common denominator to the cases is the government is 
able to allege a breach of milkens and drexels duty to their 
client john c coffee jr a columbia university law professor 
who has followed the case closely said wednesday 
they tend to line up not as overzealousness on behalf of the 
client but predatory behavior against a client he said 
for instance the government claims milken illegally used 
information from his role advising turner broadcasting system about 
its 1985 acquisition of mgmua in a stock trading scheme with 
boesky that netted more than 3 million 
by buying large amounts of mgmua stock when the deal looked 
good the government alleges milken made handsome profits and 
generated a false sense of the deals viability when the deal 
appeared to sour milken and boesky stopped buying according to 
the governments presentencing memo milkens attorneys say the 
charges arent supported by the timing and prices of boeskys stock 
purchases 
in the storer transaction the government claims milken and 
boesky took advantage of a 1985 bidding war over the drexel client 
to buy and sell the companys stock making more than 1 million in 
profits milkens lawyers say the governments facts are wrong and 
milken did nothing illegal 
court papers also allege milken bribed money managers into 
buying risky storer securities by selling other storer securities 
at below market value the government alleges thatcash proceeds 
from the storer transactions surpassed 325 million with milken 
and another unidentified individual personally making 172 million 
in 1988 
the caesars transaction alleges milken in 1983 bought more than 
3 million in securities of the company after meeting with caesars 
executives to discuss restructuring its debt drexel managed the 
restructuring 
the defense memo said the government had offered a distorted 
picture of events in all the transactions and in some instances 
omitted evidence it has that would undermine the claims against 
milken

proposed 1985 acquisition of mgmua by turner broadcasting system 
inc which was receiving financial advice from drexel and milken 
boesky allegedly bought and sold mgmua securities at milkens 
direction and later split more than 3 million in profits 
the government says the trading enhanced the likelihood of the 
deals success by creating artificial demand for mgmua stock and 
that milken misappropriated information from turner to generate 
illegal trading profits 
milkens attorneys say the charges arent supported by the 
timing and prices of boeskys stock purchases

the government claims milken used nonpublic information to buy 
more than 3 million in caesars bonds in 1983 prior to 
announcement of debt restructuring managed by drexel the 
government says the bonds were bought by drexel and sold two days 
later to milkens personal retirement account 
the government says the idea for a debtforstock swap was 
broached at a june 29 1983 meeting among milken other drexel 
executives and caesars representatives the government claims 
caesars officials favored the idea and committed to it july 1 the 
defense maintains that didnt happen for a week 
the bond purchases by drexel were dated june 30 and in turn were 
sold to milken a day later 
milkens lawyers said the securities and exchange commission in 
1985 investigated the trading and found no wrongdoing they said 
caesars had not decided on a restructuring when drexel made the 
purchases

prosecutors allege boesky bought storer securities in july 1985 
after milken tipped him about a proposed leveraged buyout by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which hired drexel to secure 
financing prosecutors claim more than 1 million in trading 
profits were credited to drexel in january 1986 
according to court papers milken allegedly bribed money 
managers to buy risky storer securities by selling other securities 
of the florida cable television company at below market value they 
allege milken also misappropriated warrants that would allow a 
purchase of 25 percent of the company to private partnerships in 
which he had an interest 
the government alleges that cash proceeds from the storer 
transactions surpassed 325 million with milken and another 
unidentified individual personally making 172 million in 1988 
milkens lawyers say the claims are based both on 
misunderstandings and misstatement of the facts and the law they 
say kkr gave drexel discretion to sell warrants and that money 
managers have denied the alleged kickback arrangement

the government claims milken asked boesky to buy a large block 
of shares of wickes a california building products business to 
push up its stock price and make it qualify for a special and 
costly dividend 
wickes hired drexel in 1985 to raise money via a series of 
securities offerings including two promising a high fixed dividend 
of 250 per share the company did not have to redeem the shares 
for three years unless its stock closed above 612 for 20 out of 
30 consecutive trading days 
the government alleges milken pushed his traders to find buyers 
of wickes stock to drive up the price when the stock reached the 
level on 19 of 28 days in spring 1986 milken allegedly had boesky 
buy 19 million shares late in a trading day pushing it above the 
required level that helped wickes avoid having to pay the 
expensive dividend for the full three years

despite expecting weak sales for the rest of 
this year and into next executives running federated department 
stores inc and allied stores corp are planning for the retailers 
to emerge from bankruptcy in 1991 
the sister retailers owned by financially distressed campeau 
corp on wednesday unveiled a business plan for the years through 
1996 that includes store closings but no outright sales of entire 
department store chains 
allen i questrom chairman and chief executive of allied and 
federated said the plan is the foundation on which to build a 
proposal to get out of bankruptcy proceedings 
he said allied and federated are making a push to get out of 
bankruptcy as quickly as possible because the longer the process 
drags on the costlier it will become 
neither questrom nor james m zimmerman president and chief 
operating officer of allied and federated would provide specific 
information on what the reorganization proposal would contain 
they refused to state how much money would be offered to 
creditors who collectively are owed around 77 billion most of 
the debt was amassed when canadas campeau bought allied and 
federated with borrowed money in the 1980s 
the judge supervising the bankruptcy in a cincinnati court last 
month gave federated stores inc the holding company for allied 
and federated until feb 28 to submit its reorganization plan 
companies operating under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
act are allotted time in which they have the exclusive right to 
come up with their own plans federated has been granted two 
extensions 
the executives said the reorganization plan which must be 
approved by creditors and us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr 
would not propose chopping off any allied or federated divisions 
among the nine chains they run are such wellknown retailers as 
bloomingdales bon marche burdines jordan marsh lazurus and 
richs 
the business plan presented wednesday projects operating 
earnings of allied and federated will more than double over the 
next six years 
operating profits which represent earnings before interest 
taxes depreciation and amortization are forecast to grow to 113 
billion in 1996 from an estimated 486 million this year 
the plan forecasts sales will rise to 989 billion in 1996 from 
722 billion in 1990 
questrom said the plan contains seven key elements that will be 
implemented throughout all allied and federated chains 
its not a plan that gets us to the moon its one thats 
realistic he said 
it focuses on basic merchandising matters and realigns various 
retail functions such as buying to make them more centralized an 
emphasis will be placed on keeping inventory fresh and improving 
the retailers abilities to respond quickly to changing consumer 
tastes 
it also envisions capital expenditures of 1 billion for 
remodeling and maintenance some 16 new stores plus some 
replacements are slated to be opened 
an unspecified number of store closings are contemplated 
zimmerman said stores that are failing to generate sufficient cash 
flow will be shut down but he declined to say which of allieds 
and federateds 250 stores are likely to go out of operation 
zimmerman and questrom said they believed pruning poor 
performers would provide a better return to creditors than trying 
to sell off whole divisions 
questrom who was recruited after allied and federated filed the 
bankruptcy petition jan 15 claimed progress will be slow in 
turning around the retailers in the near future the business plan 
assumes that the country will be in a virtual recession from about 
now through three quarters of next year 
he said allied and federated wont engage in drastic discounting 
this year to boost sales as they have ben accused of doing in the 
last christmas season 
he said the retailers havent bought too much merchandise so 
they wont be stuck with excessive inventories if business is as 
bad as some forecasters say it will be inventories at the end of 
august were about 330 million below the level of a year ago he 
said

goldman sachs amp co said wednesday it has 
formed a large fund to invest in debtladen companies becoming one 
of the first prominent wall street brokerages to see opportunity in 
the excesses of the 1980s 
the venerable firm said that since april it has raised 683 
million for the fund from major us and foreign pension funds 
international banks university endowments insurance companies and 
individuals 
in addition the firm contributed 100 million of its own 
capital and will serve as general partner of the fund called the 
water street corp recovery fund i lp 
the funds strategy of targeting troubled firms marks a big 
departure from the goals of multimillion dollar funds of the 1980s 
which sought takeover targets or took companies private in highly 
leveraged deals 
other smaller investment concerns have seen potential rewards in 
getting distressed companies back on their feet but goldmans 
entry into the business signaled an interest on a much larger 
scale 
mikael salovaara head of goldmans leveraged finance group and 
supervisor of the funds daily activities anticipates annual 
returns of between 25 percent and 35 percent for investors who 
contributed a minimum 5 million to participate 
in taking large positions in financially troubled companies the 
fund will work as an active partner with managements whenever 
possible to help them restructure financially goldman said in a 
statement 
in the past four months salovaara said the fund has invested a 
total of 250 million in 10 companies most of which are fortune 
1000 concerns salovaara refused to identify them 
the restructuring we anticipate taking place will see a 
company shrink the amount of outstanding debt through 
bankruptcy if it comes to that and allow it to have a strengthened 
balance sheet salovaara said 
in the aggressive takeover days of the 1980s investment firms 
and partnerships raised millions to establish funds that invested 
in acquisitions and leveraged buyouts 
since then however the stock and junkbond markets have been 
battered and the economy has weakened forcing companies burdened 
with heavy debt loads into bankruptcy or restructurings 
coniston partners one of the most prominent takeover alliances 
of the 1980s said in june that it would disband a 700 million 
investment pool because of the continued shrinkage of the mergers 
and acquisitions market both suitable takeover targets and 
adequate financing had become scarce 
in its heyday conistons biggest targets included gillette co 
allegis corp and tw services inc coniston also agreed to 
participate in the employeeled buyout of united airlines 
salovaara said buying into trouble companies is clearly an 
area people need to look at we have a lot of companies with way 
too much debt on their balance sheets and unless that situation is 
changed outside of bankruptcy court it will end up being changed 
inside bankrutpcy court

former federal reserve chairman paul volcker 
denies that the high interest rates he encouraged in the early 
1980s spawned the problems of the savings and loan industry later 
in the decade 
volcker appearing wednesday before the house banking committee 
said the industrys illadvised excursion into risky investments 
not the highest interest rates since the civil war proved its 
downfall 
the industry could have survived that episode of high 
interest rates and the great bulk of it did he said 
as head of the nations central bank from 1979 to 1987 volcker 
quelled the doubledigit inflation of the 1970s by drastically 
slowing the economy with interest rates topping 20 percent 
it was very painful but i dont think it was the fundamental 
cause of what was happening in the late 1980s he said at the 
second of a series of hearing exploring the roots of the sampl mess 
banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas who once 
sought to impeach volcker for his monetary policy agreed that 
interest rates werent the fundamental cause but he said they were 
a contributor 
volcker primarily blamed the losses on the expansion of sampls 
into investments outside their traditional role of mortgage lending 
and serving family financial needs and on the inability of 
inexperienced sampl examiners to monitor the new business 
the whole atmosphere during those years was not conducive to 
strict supervision and strict regulation it was not in the air 
so to speak he said 
volcker was particularly critical of sampls direct investment in 
commercial real estate projects as partowners rather than as 
lenders 
that is the single area thats bankrupted more savings and 
loans than any other area he said 
i thought that was a bad idea to start with i think that 
events have clearly demonstrated that it was even more catastrophic 
than i thought volcker said it is just an area that 
inherently is rife with conflicts of interest and temptations for 
selfdealing 
former thrift regulator edwin j gray who appeared with 
volcker blamed former treasury secretary donald t regan and other 
reagan administration officials for his inability to hire and keep 
the competent examiners needed to oversee sampl expansions 
regan who appeared before the panel monday characterized gray 
as an absentee regulator who as chairman of the federal home loan 
bank board from 1983 to 1987 served as a front man for the 
industry 
gray denied the charges 
regan simply never lifted a finger to help us in any 
material way to avert the thrift crisis he said 
gray said regan and the office of management and budget opposed 
his efforts to hire the examiners needed to monitor the activities 
of thrifts in states with liberal laws and denounced the system of 
stateregulated but federally insured thrifts 
the only reason why we ever had a dual federalstate thrift 
system was that this enabled state politicians to get political 
contributions he said 
gray also said regan a former chairman of merrill lynch 
opposed his effort to clamp down on brokered deposits such 
highinterestrate deposits placed by money brokers are blamed for 
fueling the explosive growth of risktaking sampls merrill lynch was 
the leader in that business 
the us treasury department headed by donald regan lined up 
with the money brokers against the federal deposit insurance 
agencies he opposed the deposit insurance agencies brokered 
funds regulation gray said

prices fell on the tokyo stock exchange but the 
pace of trading eased after two days of feverish activity the 
dollar fell against the yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 57120 points or 256 
percent to close at 2227819 points the average shed nearly 50 
points in heavy trading on wednesday after a record surge the 
previous day 
trading was a thin 320 shares or about half of wednesdays 
volume 
many players stayed away to avoid the effects of arbitrage 
trading by major securities houses said amy yip manager of sales 
for baring seucrities 
today was a relatively quiet and stable cash market 
although it drifted down on very very thin activity she 
said 
the markets are waiting to see the employment report from the 
united states said yoshiro inoue an analyst for nomura 
securities the september employment report is due out in 
washington on friday 
other influences included a decline on wall street overnight and 
higher oil prices 
higher oil prices alone will not hurt the economy greatly over 
the short term said tsutomu toichi research coordinator and chief 
economist for the independent institute of energy economics what 
would really hurt is higher prices over the long term or worse 
disruption of supply 
the key is how long the high prices continue for one year 
two years three years if the high prices continue for four years 
then the japanese economy can cope toichi said but the world 
economy will be so severely damaged and that will have an impact 
on the economy 
some analysts saw the market turning up but only temporarily 
we expect to see the market fall below mondays low sometime 
in the first quarter of next year said pelham smithers of 
shearson lehman hutton asia ltd on monday the nikkei index fell 
as low as 19781 points 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 13590 yen down 075 
yen from wednesday 
traders said the dollar slid in reaction to comments by us 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan indicating that us 
interest rates might fall 
greenspan said wednesday that the proposed us budget would 
almost certainly depress interest rates 
he told a congressional committee that failure to approve the 
budgets 500 billion deficitreduction package would be a grave 
mistake with serious consequences for an already weakened us 
economy 
in bond dealings the yield of the benchmark 10year government 
bond fell to 8290 percent by 3 pm down from 8310 percent on 
wednesday the price rose to 8240 yen up from 8232 yen on

farm commodity exports are expected to decline 
a bit in the fiscal year that began this week mainly because of 
hefty grain supplies throughout much of the world 
the agriculture department says another reason although not a 
large factor is the historic joining of the two germanys on 
wednesday which will mean a slip in corn exports east germany 
typically bought about 500000 metric tons annually 
but with unification the new germany becomes part of the 
european community said stephen macdonald of the departments 
economic research service suddenly it becomes too expensive to 
import us corn 
their price goes up and that price is protected by the ec 
tariff macdonald said commenting on a report in the october 
issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
normally west germany has not been a significant us corn 
market he said some has been imported but mostly for industrial 
uses 
the main reason for a weakening of us farm export prospects is 
large foreign supplies of wheat rice and corn in both the 
importing and exporting countries 
in some measure the outlook for 199091 could reflect what 
happened in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 although usda 
analysts say its too early to make flat predictions 
also they say there are many variables relating to the mideast 
crisis energy costs and global finances 
but in 198990 us agricultural exports probably reached 1485 
million metric tons worth 40 billion both slightly more than the 
year before the report said 
export volume likely rose about 2 million tons in 198990 
as larger corn and soybean exports offset lower wheat exports 
the report said during the first 10 months of fiscal 1990 corn 
exports rose 8 million tons soybeans rose 25 million and wheat 
exports fell 7 million 
the drop in us wheat exports was attributed to larger 
prospective crops in several major importing countries including 
the soviet union and china rising supplies among competitors 
especially canada and the anticipation of foreign buyers that 
prices would decline in the future 
total us agricultural exports to china dropped more than 40 
percent last fiscal year mostly because of the decline in wheat 
shipments 
in the first nine months of the fiscal year the report said 
chinas wheat imports from all sources fell nearly 10 percent and 
the us market share dropped to about 25 percent from 50 percent 
meanwhile australia and canada increased their share of the 
chinese market 
wheat exports to egypt also have weakened the report said this 
has been due mostly to egypts difficulty with pastdue payments 
for us credit extended in earlier years 
egypts imports of us vegetable oil tallow and poultry meat 
also are down although sales of shortstaple cotton were up 
sharply as egypt continued to increase its exports of textiles and 
longstaple cotton 
the us ban on trade with iraq and the un general trade 
embargo helped lower fiscal 1990 us agricultural exports to iraq 
by 200 million from a year earlier the report said wheat and 
soybean meal likely accounted for most of the decline sunflower 
oil exports also were down 
 
washington ap imagine a joint expedition of us and soviet 
union bug hunters hacking their way through the amazon jungle 
looking for a natural enemy of the colorado potato beetle 
thats a bit farfetched but not by much the agriculture 
department says the expedition to the hinterlands of brazil bgan 
this week including three entomologists from the departments 
agricultural research service and one from the soviet union 
robert fw schroder said in a report released by the agency 
that the colorado potato beetle is the single most important pest 
of potatoes in both countries the pest also eats tomatoes and 
eggplants 
although the beetle itself is not a resident of brazil there 
are 200 closely related species and the scientists will be looking 
for enemies of those relatives seeking some that would also attack 
the potato beetle 
schroder said the team will use sweep nets to collect live 
potential beetle enemies along roadsides into the bush and 
forested areas wherever our guide takes us 
other scientists include michael m athanas who works with 
schroder at the agencys research center in beltsville md and 
benjamin w puttler who recently retired from the agencys 
laboratory in columbia mo 
the soviet scientist is ivan kriak of the all union institute 
for biological methods of plant protection in kishinev moldavia 
 
washington ap the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought an additional 150000 metric tons of us soybean 
meal under a longterm grain agreement between the two countries 
officials said wednesday that private exporters sold the meal 
for delivery through dec 31 the current agreement including a 
threemonth extension will expire at that time and a new fiveyear 
pact will take over 
the new sales were made by unidentified private exporting 
companies which are required to report large sales to the 
department no selling prices or further details were released 
under the current grain agreement the soviet union bought more 
than 137 million tons of soybean meal during the fiscal year that 
ended sept 30 along with 342000 tons of soybeans 
grain purchases during the year totaled 203 million tons 
including nearly 165 million tons of corn and 38 million tons of 
wheat

when dave backus graduated from 
watervliet high school in 1978 there was never any question what 
hed do next 
like many of his classmates he went to work in the towns 
80yearold paper mill following his father and grandfather as 
well as his mother and aunt and uncles 
now the future is anything but clear watervliet paper co the 
biggest employer in this southwestern michigan town of 1867 has 
been idle since june when its parent company filed for bankruptcy 
protection 
the mills employees are among hundreds of thousands of factory 
workers left jobless in recent months as the nations unemployment 
rate worsens michigan has the worst unemployment among top 
industrial states 
backus 31 sits at home most days now collecting his last few 
unemployment checks and awaiting word on whether anyone wants to 
buy the mill and rehire its 250 workers 
he wonders if hell have to leave his hometown to find work 
after all weve been through i dont even want to go back 
but i will he says in his living room over the noise of an 
andy griffith show rerun the paper mill is all we know 
some mill workers have moved away others have taken the few 
fulltime jobs available in the area most are reluctant to leave 
while the mills fate remains uncertain 
they say no other business in the rural area can come close to 
matching the 10 an hour they earned at the mill and they worry 
things are little better elsewhere 
michigan leads the nations 11 largest industrial states in 
unemployment with a seasonally adjusted 79 percent jobless rate 
for august watervliet is in berrien county which has a 72 
percent jobless rate 
the national jobless rate in august was 56 percent a twoyear 
high the labor department will release september unemployment 
figures friday 
since march 1989 the number of factory jobs nationally has 
fallen by more than 450000 
nick khouri an economist for the michigan senate fiscal agency 
predicts the states jobless rate will be 85 percent a year from 
now 
with the increase in the price of oil continuing to drain the 
economy were going to see even more of an economic slowdown in 
the next six to 12 months khouri said 
the closure forced mayor robert flaherty who relies on the mill 
for 35 percent of the municipal tax base to eliminate the position 
of police chief there will be more cuts if the mill doesnt reopen 
soon 
watervliet went through the same kind of emergency two years ago 
when the mills previous owner closed the mill 
in march 1989 residents rejoiced when kalamazoobased kapaco 
group inc bought the mill and rehired every worker 
kapaco had it running at full speed again within a few months 
churning out 140 tons a day of coated paper used for playing cards 
product labels and catalogs 
they told us we were making the greatest paper in the world 
says idle worker joe crady sipping iced tea at the counter of 
jasmines family restaurant where his wife works as a waitress 
i still dont understand what happened 
adding to the pain of joblessness is a dispute over health 
insurance kapaco allegedly continued payroll deductions after 
canceling its insurance program 
kapaco chairman richard jones declined to comment on the matter 
saying it would be worked out in us bankruptcy court in 
kalamazoo 
merchants say theyve been only mildly affected by the shutdown 
so far but they worry about a bleak holiday season and an even 
darker future 
i dont know how long ill be able to last says ac bolin 
who owns a furniture store on main street nobody heres making 
enough to even be thinking about buying furniture 
if the mill doesnt reopen hope centers on the citys 
smalltown charm surrounding fruit farms and scenic paw paw lake 
which keep it popular among vacationers from chicago 
officials also are trying to attract new industries playing up 
the towns easy access to interstate 94 which links detroit and 
chicago

a government report that finds no fault with 
last years temporary ban on fruit from chile is riddled with 
holes and replete with inaccuracies sen jesse helms rnc 
contends 
the report by the general accounting office the investigative 
arm of congress looked into the finding last year of two grapes 
from chile tainted with cyanide and the subsequent fiveday 
suspension of all fruit imports from chile 
a draft copy of the gao study circulated among news media on 
wednesday and helms says it should not be released in final form 
until the agency resolves several serious contradictions and 
unsupported assertions 
it is riddled with holes and replete with inaccuracies it 
simply does not measure up to the usual standards of the gao 
helms said in a letter to comptroller general charles a bowsher 
who heads the office 
gao has failed to present any analysis which would explain how 
fda was able to find only two contaminated grapes among millions 
before it then issued a false alarm banning chilean fruit and 
forcing its destruction in retail and wholesale outlets helms 
said this failure to provide any explanation for the miracle 
find alone invalidates the entire report 
the gao concluded after extensively evaluating fdas 
laboratory testing procedures that there was no merit to charges 
from chile that the tests were botched and fruit samples 
mishandled chilean growers say they lost 333 million by the 
fiveday import suspension 
we found that fdas discovery of cyanide in chilean grapes was 
based on generally accepted tests that were conducted properly 
the gao told helms who had requested the investigation based on 
its finding fda acted within its legal authority to suspend 
imports of chilean fruit 
a washington law firm that represents the chilean exporters 
association raised points similar to helms in a lengthy response 
and said the report is riddled with errors omissions and blind 
faith acceptance of fda excuses for inexcusable procedures and 
decisions 
the statement by the firm of lepon mccarthy jutkowitz amp 
holzworth said the associations own experiments proved that it 
was virtually impossble to inject and retain significant amounts 
of cyanide in grapes it wondered too about the incredible 
claim that fda found two and only two grapes that had been injected 
with cyanide out of 90000 pallets en route to the united states 
after looking at only 12 pallets 
on march 2 1989 an anonymous caller told the us embassy in 
chile that he had poisoned fruit destined for the us and japan to 
draw attention to the poor living conditions of chilean workers 
neither the type of fruit nor the ship on which it was being sent 
was identified 
the fda increased its inspections of chilean fruit and on march 
12 after checking 1200 crates of grapes from one ship arriving 
in philadelphia found two grapes laced with cyanide it issued 
its ban the following day 
two more warnings were telephoned to the embassy but no more 
contaminated fruit was found 
the gao said it had not investigated the 333 million loss claim 
by the chilean exporters association 
the agency said it used four outside consultants to evaluate the 
adequacy of fdas testing and sample protection methods and to 
assess the reliability of fdas findings 
but helms said the report is filled with conjecture leaves 
major scientific deficiencies unaddressed and does not consider 
whether fdas apparently lax security measures were adequate to 
prevent adulteration of the sample after it was taken into 
custody

the final push by united airlines employees to 
secure loans for a 38 billion buyout of parent ual corp is 
yielding encouraging results says a source close to the deal 
but the outcome of the effort isnt expected to be known until 
tonight the deadline imposed by the unionled group for bankers to 
say whether they will finance the bid to create the nations 
largest employeeowned company 
the informal feedback weve gotten has been good and somewhat 
encouraging the source said wednesday but there is a big 
difference between informal feedback and commitments 
uals board has given the employee group until next tuesday to 
present a fully financed buyout package 
the buyout group led by uniteds unionized pilots machinists 
and flight attendants originally sought to secure commitments for 
a 2 billion loan by wednesday they extended the deadline for one 
day after four lead banks tentatively agreed to kick in a total of 
14 billion the source said 
the four bankers trust new york corp manufacturers hanover 
corp security pacific corp and first chicago corp had until 
the close of business thursday to receive commitments from about 20 
other banks to complete the financing said the source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the source said the other banks would not necessarily have to 
pledge 600 million by thursday but would have to commit enough to 
ensure a successful syndication the lead banks have not 
defined that amount 
it would be the judgment of each of the four banks whether the 
syndication has been successful and whether amounts they are 
prepared to provide have been committed the source said 
financing commitments received after thursday would be welcomed 
the source said 
employee group spokeswoman martha cid would not comment the 
buyout effort which has been alive in one form or another for 
nearly four years 
uals stock slipped 25 cents to 11175 wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange ending three straight days of strong gains 
that had boosted its value by more than 21 a share 
the employees are trying to put together a package that would 
pay ual shareholders about 175 a share 150 in cash and 25 in 
securities the source said that would be lower than the 
201pershare 44 billion bid that the board initially accepted 
in april 
the package would leave 15 percent of uals stock in the 
publics hands according to the source the april offer did not 
include any public ownership of ual

a confidential pentagon analysis of the 
mcdonnell douglas corps c17 cargo jet program shows a cost 
overrun of up to 500 million a newspaper reported today 
a company official acknowledged the overrun but disputed the 
figure 
unidentified defense officials told the los angeles times they 
expect the overrun to cause serious financial and political trouble 
for the aerospace company 
the real concern now is that this thing could blow up 
politically a pentagon source was quoted as saying 
mcdonnell douglas vice president michael birch confirmed 
wednesday the company likely will overstep its 49 billion budget 
for developing the c17 but not by 500 million 
we know it is going to be high but not that high birch 
said 
until last week the company was projecting that c17 
development would run 300 million below budget 
the c17 is being developed and produced in long beach at 
mcdonnells douglas aircraft co subsidiary which employs 40000 
people 
last week the pentagon said it stopped paying mcdonnell for 
work on the cargo jet after questioning the contractors project 
cost estimates the pentagon has withheld 300 million so far 
but birch said mcdonnell douglas is certain it will profit from 
the c17 
we feel confident that we can make money on the c17 birch 
said we are not going to do anything that hurts the longterm 
health of the corporation 
even with the cost overrun birch said mcdonnell will not incur 
losses on the c17 program until the combined ceilings of three 
different contracts are exceeded 
the contracts include the 49 billion development contract and 
two production contracts totaling 657 billion air force 
spokesman capt george sillia said 
birch said mcdonnell will borrow if necessary to overcome 
current problems with the c17 
we still have adequate capacity to borrow he said we 
still have hundreds of millions of dollars before we would exceed 
our debt coverage 
mcdonnell is 29 billion in debt in a new credit agreement 
reached with bankers earlier this year mcdonnell can run debt up 
to 37 billion

a south american oil pipeline built over a major 
earthquake fault line is responsible for more spilled oil than 
gushed from the exxon valdez an environmental group charged 
the natural resources defense council said oil development by 
texaco inc and other companies was destroying ecuadors 32 million 
acres of tropical rain forest 
it demanded that texaco establish a 50 million fund for 
emergency cleanups and implement environmental controls to prevent 
further contamination of the rain forests 
the company bears at a minimum a moral responsibility to make 
appropriate reparations the group said in a report on results of 
its 18month onsite investigation 
a texaco spokesman dave dixon said the company did not receive 
a copy of the report and therefore could not comment on specific 
charges but he said in all its operations texacos policy is 
to operate in accordance with the highest standards of 
environmental conservation 
the report was released wednesday at a press conference attended 
by robert f kennedy jr an attorney for the group who went to 
ecuador in july with its investigative team 
he said contamination from spilled oil and poisonous wastes from 
hundreds of oil wells was some of the worst he has seen 
children have pus coming out of their eyes from bathing in 
streams animals are dead adults have rashes covering their 
bodies kennedy said 
the government of ecuador has recorded about 30 major oil spills 
from the transecuadorian pipeline between 1972 and october 1989 
with an estimated loss of 168 million gallons of oil the council 
said the pipeline was then operated by texaco it said 
the exxon valdez oil tanker spilled about 108 million gallons 
of oil into prince william sound in alaska in march 1989 
the environmental group said that besides spills more than 4 
million gallons of untreated toxic wastes are discharged daily into 
unlined pits and ultimately seep into streams and aquifers 
the pipeline is particularly vulnerable to spills because it 
crosses a major andean fault in march 1987 earthquakes caused 59 
million gallons of oil to spew into the coca river 
cleanup efforts are primitive at best the group reported 
kennedy said he saw residents of the cuyabeno wildlife reserve 
using their bare hands to scoop oil into plastic bags during a 
cleanup the bags were buried in open pits 
at an oil well near the shuara community he saw a man walk into 
a pit filled with toxic wastes from oil production hauling out logs 
and sticks to clean it up 
he was submerged in oil you could only see the whites of his 
eyes kennedy said 
besides its charges against texaco the environmental group 
urged conoco a subsidiary of du pont co to cancel plans to drill 
oil in the region saying it would risk irreparable injury to the 
indigenous huaorani people 
ed davies president and general manager of conoco ecuador said 
in a telephone interview from quito ecuador that the company was 
working closely with the huaorani who number only 1580 to ensure 
oil development does not harm them 
environmental problems in ecuadors tropical rain forests result 
from an outdated mindset about oil drilling he said 
they really are 20yearold developments that the entire oil 
industry recognizes must change and conoco is committed to doing 
development in a responsible manner davies said

almost half of the business executives contacted 
in a survey say they cant stand phone conversations where the 
other party is on a speaker phone pointing out another 
technological innovation thats causing friction along with its 
benefits 
like the mushrooming of fax machines the proliferation of 
speaker phones in recent years as standard office equipment 
apparently has caused a backlash 
executives today are increasingly inundated with more 
efficient but less personal means of communication such as a fax 
that anybody can read or a telephone conversation via speaker phone 
that any passerby can overhear said robert half founder of 
accountemps the temporaryworker agency that sponsored the survey 
the main concern cited by those surveyed who oppose speaker 
phones was the potential lack of privacy accountemps said 
the next most frequent complaint was the sound quality of 
speaker phone conversations which often seem to resemble a 
conversation in an echo chamber 
another sore point was the belief that speaker phone calls are 
impersonal or patronizing 
the survey conducted by a market research firm involved 
questions posed to 200 executives at the nations 1000 largest

the european community said thursday it 
would be willing to trim costly export subsidies for farmers 
although it still refused to embrace the sharp cuts demanded by the 
united states 
the communitys executive body unveiled its latest agriculture 
position in international trade talks that have been stalled by a 
bitter dispute between the 12nation trading bloc and the united 
states over farm payments 
ray macsharry the communitys top agriculture official said in 
a statement that the proposal strikes a careful balance between 
the needs of european farmers and the desire for a successful 
conclusion to the uruguay round of trade talks 
the fouryear negotiations which are scheduled to end in 
december are aimed at overhauling the world trading system they 
are designed to reduce barriers to trade in 15 areas including 
agriculture textiles and other manufactured goods and services 
such as banking and investment 
community officials have been fighting to protect their export 
subsidies which are designed to help local products find buyers on 
the world market they contend getting rid of the program would 
mean higher farm prices in europe and cost millions of jobs 
but the united states objects to the program as giving an unfair 
advantage to farmers overseas 
the communitys new proposal would cut farm payments by 30 
percent for such products as cereals rice sugar and livestock to 
1996 a 10 percent reduction is proposed for fruits vegetables and 
tobacco 
in return it wants to raise protective measures for such 
commodities as oilseeds 
the community also said it will not give new export subsidies 
for commodities not covered now 
moreover it said it is willing to translate these changes into 
numbers and then reevaluate this quantification 
the us mission to the european community had no immediate 
reaction to the proposal 
the ec statement appeared to signal the communitys willingness 
to bargain for reductions in export subsidies although not to the 
level the united states has been pushing for 
us trade representative carla hills has said the united states 
intends to propose a 10year plan for reductions of up to 70 
percent in domestic farm supports and import duties and even 
greater reductions in export subsidies 
the united states backed off a previous demand that export 
subsidies be eliminated but it still wants the community to widen 
its markets to foreign farm goods and slash farm payments that 
encourage overproduction 
the final offer must be approved next week by the member 
nations farm and trade ministers

when things started looking bleak for 
bloomingdales corporate parent last autumn a manhattan movie 
theater near the famous department store proclaimed on its marquee 
good luck bloomies 
now a photograph of that message hangs on the wall outside the 
seventh floor board room at the bloomingdales headquarters it 
reminds executives of the goodwill that has accompanied the 
retailer since it entered bankruptcy proceedings in january 
to customers nothing seems much different but changes lie 
ahead at bloomingdales and the other eight chains of us 
department stores entangled in bankruptcy litigation by the sins of 
their parent campeau corp 
although hurt by the current spending slump and sure to suffer 
if the looming recession bears down on the economy the retailers 
probably will pull through bankruptcy although not necessarily 
intact 
executives running campeaus us retail arms allied stores 
corp and federated department stores inc are so sure of a 
successful conclusion to bankruptcy reorganization that they are 
planning on it 
allen i questrom chairman and chief executive of allied and 
federated joined by james m zimmerman president and chief 
operating officer presented a longterm business plan this past 
week that assumes the retailers will emerge in 1991 
questrom told a new york news briefing the allied and federated 
case could be one of the more successful bankruptcy reorganizations 
ever in retailing 
i think its a testimony to the strength of our organizations 
that they have survived this he said 
history might judge questrom and his colleagues as overly 
optimistic 
in fairness to them they acknowledged there are legal 
complications to unravel before the retailers are ready to operate 
without constraints a tax conflict must be resolved with the 
internal revenue service and junk bondholders threatening to sue 
allied must be placated 
howard davidowitz chairman of davidowitz amp associates inc a 
new yorkbased retail consulting firm said presentation of the 
upbeat business plan marked a preliminary skirmish in what will be 
a long negotiating battle between the forces of federated and 
allied and their creditors who are collectively owed around 77 
billion 
the debt was heaped on the retailers when the canadian real 
estate developer campeau bought them in the 1980s 
the retailers are posturing now trying to persuade creditors 
how valuable their department stores are that way creditors might 
think they are getting a good deal if theyre offered stakes in 
allied and federated davidowitz said 
campeaus us holding company federated stores inc is 
developing a reorganization plan in it federated will make 
compensation offers to creditors the offers to the banks 
suppliers and holders of junk bonds likely will be far less than 
100 cents on the dollar possibly a combination of cash and 
interests in a reorganized company 
federated so far has obtained two extensions in the time in 
which it has the exclusive right to write its own plan last month 
a federal bankruptcy judge in cincinnati delayed the deadline to 
feb 28 from sept 12 
companies operating under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
act almost always need longer exclusivity periods than judges 
initially allot 
allied and federated which together operate 250 stores in 27 
states and employ about 100000 people wanted the deadline pushed 
past christmas so they could tote up their take from the years 
biggest sales season before proposing how their holdings might be 
divvied up 
it might not make much difference though because the retail 
industrys holiday will be mediocre at best the allied and 
federated business plan for the years through 1996 expects 
recessionary conditions to prevail from now through next years 
third quarter 
the allied and federated chains with some exceptions have had 
unimpressive sales so far in 1990 revenue slipped to 311 billion 
in the first half of this year from 32 billion a year earlier 
monthly statements submitted to bankruptcy court show they continue 
to bleed money 
questrom and zimmerman stressed at the briefing that the 
reorganization plan would not propose selling entire divisions of 
allied or federated instead they will close individual stores 
that fail to produce enough cash 
after questrom was recruited to run the retailers while they 
reorganized the proposed sale of bloomingdales was scrapped 
apparently even the crown jewel in federateds collection couldnt 
attract high enough bids 
regardless outsiders doubt federated and allied can be 
preserved in their present forms whole chains could go their 
separate ways as pieces of the campeau empire are carved up to pay 
creditors claims 
tortuous negotiations are in store with creditors fighting for 
what they think they should get davidowitz said asset sales will 
be the answer as impatient creditors seek to get as much money as 
possible as soon as possible with todays weak economy creditors 
will be less willing to accept equity stakes and bet on getting 
better returns sometime in the future 
how else are they going to get cash without selling assets 
davidowitz said theyre going to have to have billions in cash 
theyre just going to have to sell divisions 
i think theyre definitely going to emerge from bankruptcy but 
youre not going to recognize them he said they will emerge 
four or five years from today as a much smaller company even the 
divisions they keep will have fewer stores 
experts say average shoppers dont know and dont care that 
allied and federated are in a serious financial predicament 
bloomingdales has tried to preserve its pizazz and still 
conducts retailing as theater complete with splashy promotions and 
celebritystudded galas since last autumn the retailer has thrown 
about 10 chainwide events including one this september saluting 
spain and promoting spanish merchandise 
i dont see that the retail operations from a consumers 
point of view have any changes it seems to me to be business as 
usual said diann valentini who shops with an extra critical eye 
because of her job at the fashion institute of technology in new 
york 
valentini assistant chairwoman of fits fashion 
buyingmerchandising department said popular suppliers still are 
prominent at bloomingdales the chain continues to carry trendy 
merchandise and has been able to ride the crest of fashion waves 
its difficult to endure the scrutiny of a bankruptcy court 
judge and creditors but allied and federated have handled it well 
said lewis s rosenbloom an attorney with the chicago law firm 
winston amp strawn 
rosenbloom who represents unsecured creditors in the federated 
case said the situation is unusual for a retailing bankruptcy 
because the problems that drove the department stores into 
bankruptcy werent related to merchandising 
the retailers have benefitted from the goodwill of suppliers and 
financial backers 
in my experience what we have seen thus far in terms of the 
level of support is quite extraordinary rosenbloom said the 
vendor support has been substantial

retailer woolworth corp thursday said its 
september sales picked up from the prior months pace thanks to 
robust business in germany 
harold e sells woolworths chairman and chief executive said 
demand in the newly united germany will help compensate for a 
sluggish retailing environment at home 
today as the north american economy appears to be temporarily 
slowing we see germany picking up the pace enough to offset 
possible shortfalls elsewhere sells said 
in remarks at a retail industry conference sells reaffirmed 
woolworths intention to expand its presence in germany and open 
new stores in what had been east germany east and west germany 
united formally on oct 3 
the german subsidiary of woolworth plans to open one or two new 
outlets by the end of this year in the former east germany the 
retailer is looking at six to eight sites for potential stores to 
be opened there in 1991 sells said 
he said woolworth is proceeding at a cautious pace until the 
stability of the market can be assessed but he added that he 
believes the area of former east germany could support upwards of 
50 to 60 woolworth stores 
woolworth has done business in germany since the 1920s 
currently it operates 426 stores there including 292 general 
merchandise stores and 134 specialty stores 
sells said woolworths geographic diversity reduces the 
potential impact of unfavorable political or economic developments 
in any single market 
woolworth which operates numerous specialty chain such as foot 
locker in addition to the woolworth variety stores does business 
in canada europe and australia besides the united states it has 
its world headquarters in new york

percent in the eight weeks ended sept 29 from a year earlier that 
followed a 132 percent sales gain for the four weeks through sept 
1 
sells said woolworths september revenue was well ahead of the 
august pace largely because of the continued sharp gains in 
germany he didnt provide specific figures 
woolworth along with most of the nations other big retailers 
is scheduled to release its results for the five weeks ending oct 
6 next thursday

a japanese company is trying to make a futuristic 
dream come true by opening an international video telephone service 
for the public 
six japanese women and a child sitting in the fffice of videocom 
international corp squealed with delight this week as they 
listened to and watched friends and relatives in singapore 
their friends spoke from a telephone office equipped with a 
similar terminal which looks like a small television with a 
builtin camera 
service between tokyo and los angeles is expected to start this 
week with new york and london to follow 
it was fun great said izumi sueda 36 who with a friend 
talked in tokyo with two friends in singapore 
but would they buy one most consumers around the world be 
skeptical analysts say 
there certainly will be individuals who are eager to see their 
relatives but i dont really think it will catch on said david 
benda head of research and a specialist in electronics for 
barclays de zoete wedd securities in japan 
american telephone amp telegraph co developed a videophone in the 
1950s but the company let it drop by the wayside in terms of 
marketing and product development said john murray senior 
technical support manager at atampts tokyo office 
atampt studies showed business people missed the personal contact 
of meetings people would still rather jump on the plane and rack 
up those frequentflier miles theres something about getting out 
of the office he said 
nippon telegraph amp telephone corp japans largest 
telecommunications company lists only 25 videophone customers 
among its 50 million customers about 200 customers use telephones 
that provide a series of still color pictures of speakers and 
listeners while 150000 use similar machines that provide black 
and white pictures ntt says 
analysts list a few reasons why videocoms service may also be 
limited in the immediate future 
one is cost a videophone costs more than 2200 compared to 
73 to 365 for an ordinary telephone ntt says 
meanwhile a 15minute call from japan to the united states 
costs 40 and from japan to singapore 49 
videocom which is 36 percentowned by kokusai denshin denwa 
co japans main international telecommunications company offers 
an international video conference service at roughly 10 times the 
price of a videophone call but with much clearer video pictures 
another problem is inconvenience at least two machines are 
needed for a video call moreover they need to be the same type 
because machines produced by different companies often cannot 
communicate said toshio satoh videocoms president 
for that reason videocoms service in singapore is limited to a 
single singapore telecom office and in los angeles to the office of 
a private company equal access corp 
the service operates only between 8 am and 8 pm local time 
in japan 
despite the drawbacks videocom hopes that several changes will 
help win customers 
one is the growing use of digital telecommunications lines 
which send information using digital instead of analog signals 
digital signals used by videocom are clearer than analog and can 
carry more information 
such digital technology will force us to take a second look 
at videophones atampts murray said 
fiber optic cables which will become increasingly common in the 
future can transmit even more information resulting in clearer 
pictures at lower cost images on videocoms equipment 
manufactured by mitsubishi corp using kdd technology now are 
fuzzy and slightly jerky 
also the international telegraph and telephone consultative 
committee is expected this year to set standards for videophones 
that should encourage manufacturers in the united states europe 
and japan to make machines that can communicate with each other he 
said 
if people are accustomed to the video telephone then in the 
near future there will be an opportunity to promote or market our 
equipment to them satoh said 
more demand will bring lower prices within one or two years 
he said

the government confirmed thursday it ordered amoco 
uk to improve work supervision on a north sea gas platform or 
face criminal prosecution 
the sept 17 action by the department of energy followed an 
inspection on the amoco alpha platform in the leman field off the 
norfolk coast the department said 
the disclosure that an improvement notice had been served on 
amoco was made thursday by roger lyons assistant general secretary 
of the technical workers union 
the union claims the platform doesnt have enough supervisors 
and that workers are being required to work up to 18 hours a day 
a spokesman for amoco wasnt immediately available for comment 
amoco alpha is at the hub of the leman gas system which produces 
about 10 percent of britains gas supplies 
the notice said amoco was failing to provide a proper system of 
work and proper supervision for contractors and gave the company 
until nov 30 to make improvements

new england telephone and new york telephone 
have agreed to pay 14 million to the us treasury and a 355 
million rebate to longdistance customers to resolve allegations 
they overcharged customers through a subsidiary the federal 
communications commission said thursday 
the fcc in february said it intended to fine the two companies 
14 million a record amount over apparent violations of fcc 
rules governing transactions between regulated telephone companies 
and unregulated affiliates 
the fcc had ordered the companies to return 355 million to 
customers because of alleged overcharges to nyt and net by materiel 
enterprises co an unregulated nynex purchasing subsidiary 
the 14 million payment announced thursday is a voluntary 
contribution and not a fine the fcc said under whats known as a 
consent decree nynex admitted no guilt and the fcc said it had 
made no findings of wrongdoing and was ending its enforcement 
action 
nynex agreed to the 355 million rebate to be made within 30 
days and would take other accounting steps to resolve allegations 
of excess profits on plant and equipment purchased from the 
materiel enterprises subsidiary 
local phone rates will not be affected 
we hope this puts to rest any questions concerning nynexs 
desire to comply with all fcc regulations and policies in 
transactions among affiliate companies nynex chairman william c 
ferguson said in a statement 
the agreement ends one of several pending federal or state 
actions against nynex one of the seven regional bell holding 
companies created in 1984 from the old bell system 
nynex also has been the focus of investigations that new york 
telephone suppliers helped pay for bawdy parties and prostitutes at 
annual conventions of company employees in florida from 1984 to 
1988 nynex has denied that any ratepayer funds were involved in 
the conventions 
in may the justice department filed a onecount criminal 
indictment alleging nynex violated the information services 
restrictions on the regional bell companies nynex denied 
wrongdoing 
on wednesday new york state utility regulators authorized a 
study into whether nynex should be forced to divest new york 
telephone 
the fcc in february had said materiel enterprises apparently 
overcharged nyt and net by 1185 million from 1984 to 1988 of 
that the fcc said 355 million was passed through to 
longdistance customers 
long distance companies such as atampt mci and us sprint pay 
access charges to nynex and other regional bells and those 
charges are figured into longdistance prices 
toby webb nynexs vice president for government affairs said 
thursday he could not estimate how much the 355 million rebate 
would affect longdistance prices for new york and new england 
phone customers 
webb said nynex had agreed to the latest consent decree in order 
to avoid a potentially long court battle over accounting and 
purchasing procedures that no longer were in effect materiel 
enterprises was merged into new york telephone and new england 
telephone earlier this year thus making materiel a fully regulated 
company under fcc rules 
the agreement is preferable to engaging in prolonged 
litigation over past events and practices which have been 
changed webb said it is time to focus fully on meeting the 
needs of our customers

a shipment of donated cigarettes was 
inadvertently sent to us troops in the middle east in violation 
of a defense department policy of discouraging the use of tobacco 
the pentagon said thursday 
a unit did mistakenly ship four or five pallets of donated 
cigarettes not being aware of the directive against such a 
practice pentagon spokesman pete williams said 
he said the unit was reminded of the directive and no further 
shipments were sent he did not identify the unit 
tobacco products are not an acceptable gift for distribution 
to service personnel the spokesman said 
he said department regulations prohibit the military services 
from distributing or transporting free tobacco products for the 
troops 
cigarettes can be purchased at post exchanges in the persian 
gulf region as elsewhere williams said 
department of defense policy is that smoking is one of the 
leading preventable causes of disease and death among military 
personnel he said the department discourages the use of 
tobacco products and encourages those who use tobacco to quit 
in response to a question williams said he did not know how 
many packages of cigarettes were on the pallets nor did he say who 
had donated the cigarettes 
i think they have been consumed he said 
earlier this week philip morris usa said it had donated 2 
million cigarettes to us troops in response to letters from the 
soldiers that followed a sept 25 announcement that brown amp 
williamson tobacco corp planned to send an undisclosed number of 
smokes to the troops 
the announcements drew strong criticism from antismoking 
groups who attacked the tobacco industry for what they called a 
ploy to subvert defense department policy and hook a new generation 
of smokers

forget those dour economic forecasts for a couple 
days business leaders are trying to put a bright face on 
massachusetts by giving residents a small bargain for buying stock 
in the states companies 
the effort was dubbed take stock in massachusetts business 
it opened with the start of trading thursday on the boston stock 
exchange and the window will close at the end of fridays session 
for the two days the stock exchange agreed to waive transaction 
fees for brokerage firms that in turn waived commissions for 
residents who buy stock in companies headquartered in 
massachusetts 
its an opportunity for the people of massachusetts to be 
partners in their own economic future said gerald scott 
organizer of the program who launched the sesion by ringing an 
oldfashioned school bell 
lately the states economic future has looked grim 
unemployment has risen sharply as the oncepowerful computer 
financial and construction sectors have suffered heavy beatings 
but the organizers of the stock program insisted that all is not 
bad in massachusetts some companies are performing well 
larry vale a spokesman for keane inc a bostonbased software 
company pointed to his firm as an example vale who participated 
in thursdays opening said keanes net earnings grew by 24 percent 
last year 
in this gloom and doom mentality people tend to forget that 
below the surface there are good companies he said 
even some companies that have been battered recently can be good 
stock buys investment analysts said ed sullivan representing 
dean witter reynolds inc mentioned digital equipment corp and 
bank of boston corp as two highprofile companies that have been 
hurt recently but should perform well in the long run 
for investors who think they have found a good buy they will 
avoid paying commissions that range from about 1 percent to 3 
percent that means a person buying 5000 worth of stock will save 
anywhere from 50 to 150 
people taking advantage of the program must buy at least 1000 
worth of stock but no more than 25000 
organizers cautioned that investors shouldnt buy stock simply 
because they can save a small amount of money on commissions 
instead the main reason is to make a longterm investment 
similarly scott said he didnt expect a tidal wave of instate 
investments during the twoday program but he said it should make 
massachusetts residents more interested in and aware of the 
different companies based in the state

the dollar dropped against all major foreign 
currencies thursday amid selling on the widespread assumption that 
us interest rates will fall in the near future 
gold prices eased in us trading after climbing on precious 
metals markets abroad 
the heaviest dollar selling in the united states occurred when 
activity began domestic foreign exchange dealers took their cue 
from europe where the dollar earlier had touched a new postwar low 
against the german mark 
john mccarthy chief dealer at the amsterdam rotterdam banks 
office in new york said the strong dollar sales subsided as the 
session progressed but the dollar still closed lower than the day 
before 
dealers were given an incentive to dump dollars by federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspans comments to a congressional 
committee on wednesday 
speaking in support of the fiscal 1991 budget proposal 
greenspan indicated the central bank would pursue a more generous 
credit policy if congress enacts the compromise on cutting the 
federal deficit 
a looser fed policy would lead to lower us interest rates 
which would tend to curb dollar demand by making returns on 
dollardenominated investments less rewarding than foreign 
alternatives 
the report due friday on the september employment situation is 
expected to reconfirm the economys weakness and possibly weigh 
down the dollar further a downturn in the economy in itself could 
cause interest rates to fall even if the fed doesnt give them a 
nudge 
in europe the dollar hit a low for the postworld war ii era of 
15310 against the mark in early afternoon trading breaking the 
previous postwar low of 15385 reached on aug 27 it traded at

a powerful threeday surge in pork belly futures prices peaked 
thursday on the chicago mercantile exchange as buying interest 
sparked by a surprising government hogsandpigs report exhausted 
itself 
frozen pork bellies for delivery in february closed above 
wednesdays closing price but below the days high of 649 cents a 
pound which represented a gain of nearly 12 percent since friday 
on other commodity markets livestock futures were mixed energy 
futures were mixed precious metals retreated and grains and 
soybeans were mixed 
pork bellies settled 65 cent lower to 25 cent higher with 
february up 25 cent at 6445 cents a pound 
pork bellies had risen the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a 
pound monday tuesday and wednesday in reaction to fridays 
quarterly hogsandpigs inventory 
the agriculture department report included an estimate of the 
number of pigs born during the summer that was 2 percent lower than 
in 1989 most market analysts had expected summer farrowings to be 
unchanged or even a little higher than a year earlier 
the unexpectedly low number means the number of hogs available 
for slaughter in the first quarter of 1991 when those piglets 
mature also will be below the yearago level said charles levitt 
senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
he said most observers had expected the slaughter rate to level 
off or begin to rise in the first quarter 
what we did not expect was that the decline in slaughters from 
a year earlier would be extended into next year which means its 
going to be at least next spring before we get increases in the hog 
slaughter compared to the year previous levitt said 
the market also was supported recently by indications that 
frozen belly supplies are virtually depleted he said 
phil stanley a livestock consultant for dec futures inc said 
the relative weakness thursday in the belly market also reflected 
profittaking by traders who had taken bullish positions ahead of 
the report 
in livestock trading on the merc live cattle futures settled 
08 cent to 33 cent lower with october at 7975 cents a pound 
feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 20 cent higher with october

the czechoslovak government 
facing a winter of higher oil costs and dwindling soviet supplies 
imposed higher oil and gasoline prices thursday and appealed to 
moscow for help 
measures taken by a crisis team of government officials 
announced in a tv address by economics minister vladimir dlouhy 
are aimed at stemming a near panic about potential fuel shortages 
the state ctk news agency said 
to make it simple the main problem is that oil is much more 
expensive now dlouhy said on national television 
the soviet union for years the main oil supplier in east bloc 
countries is unable to fulfill its quotas at the same time it 
will begin demanding scarce convertible currency for its oil 
beginning jan 1 
many of the countries have lost supplies of iraqi oil because of 
their support for the un sanctions against saddam hussein and 
their fragile economies are facing much higher prices on the world 
market 
elsewhere poland announced it would import oil from iran to 
make up for dwindling soviet supplies and losses caused by the gulf 
crisis 
dlouhy estimated czechoslovakias loss because of the gulf 
crisis at about 14 billion 
beginning midnight friday czechoslovak consumers will be 
allowed to buy only about six gallons of gasoline in october at the 
official price of about 3 a gallon additional gasoline will cost 
about 25 percent more 
motor and heating oil will be increased from about 224 dollars 
to 3 a gallon 
new limits for november will be announced later ctk said 
premier marian calfa appealed for urgent talks with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzkov on 
faltering soviet oil supplies 
soviet supplies began falling in the first half of the year and 
the shortfall led to a panic in july that forced the government to 
drive up the price by 50 percent ctk said 
ctk quoted finance minister vaclav klaus as saying that he could 
not rule out more changes in wholesale prices by the end of the 
year

the federal judge overseeing the drexel burnham 
lambert group inc bankruptcy withdrew from the case thursday 
because he is considering a job at a law firm that has represented 
a drexel creditor 
us bankruptcy judge howard c buschman iii said he was 
stepping down from the bench after seven years to return to 
betterpaying private practice 
attorneys for drexel and creditors said the departure would 
delay proceedings while his replacement becomes familiar with the 
largest collapse of a financial firm in wall street history 
us bankruptcy judge frank conrad who sits in rutland vt 
was named to take over the drexel proceedings attorneys said 
conrad has indicated he will spend about two weeks per month in new 
york on the case 
buschman 46 was appointed to a 14year term in 1983 but said 
he had regretfully concluded that the financial needs of my 
family will not permit me to continue to serve out the remainder of 
the term to which i was appointed 
the judge said he was under consideration for a job at an 
unidentified law firm that has represented a creditor in the drexel 
case but not filed any pleadings or argued in court before him 
buschman said that he was not required to disqualify himself 
from the case and he was reluctant to burden another judge with the 
case but in an excess of caution i think it appropriate to 
request that these cases be reassigned 
the judge also had presided over the chapter 11 proceedings of 
thomson mckinnon securities inc 
buschman won praise from attorneys in the sevenmonthold drexel 
case for his preparation attention to detail and ability to 
control often contentious proceedings 
im sorry were losing him alan miller an attorney for 
drexel said this has been a difficult case and i think hes 
done a job of keeping it under control 
attorneys said they expected delays in the case while judge 
conrad digests the background of the bankruptcy proceedings to 
date you cant read a case and a file you also have to 
understand some of the dynamics that go into a decision he said 
its a very complicated bankruptcy case with a number of 
interrelationships said barry dichter who represents a large 
drexel creditor it will take a new judge some time to understand 
the complexities 
drexel filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors in 
february in the aftermath of a junk bond market collapse and a 
failure to recover from its guilty plea to federal securities 
violations 
drexel still is liquidating its large securities portfolio and 
drawing up along with creditors a reorganization plan

ford motor co on thursday gave the united auto 
workers union a comprehensive proposal for a new national labor 
contract that according to one company official mirrors the 
contract reached with general motors corp 
the union which ratified a threeyear agreement with gm late 
last month has insisted that the uawgm agreement serve as a model 
for contracts with ford and chrysler corp 
except for one provision on overtime pay ford isnt expected to 
have trouble agreeing to a contract similar to gms 
i think probably ford has fallen in line with that said the 
company official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the uaw agreements with the big three cover more than 450000 
active workers about 300000 at gm about 100000 at ford and 
about 60000 at chrysler 
the gmuaw agreement raises base wages by 3 percent in the first 
year and includes lumpsum increases equal to 3 percent of base 
wages in the second and third years costofliving protection on 
wages would be maintained and retirees will receive more money 
it guarantees income for employees laid off for more than 36 
weeks during the life of the agreement and makes no changes in 
healthcare provisions 
the pattern agreement also contains a new provision boosting the 
penalty for excessive overtime worked in a week ford has been 
using overtime much more liberally than the two other us 
automakers and the union has suggested it be curtailed and the 
company hire more workers 
neither company nor union officials would talk about specific 
provisions of the proposal offered thursday they issued a joint 
statement saying only that the proposal was delivered and that the 
union was studying it 
a union official who also requested anonymity said studying 
the document and holding some meetings of bargaining subcommittees 
would take negotiators into thursday night 
on tuesday uaw president owen bieber said he expected 
negotiations with ford could be completed by the end of the week 
company vice president peter pestillo said that was possible 
after a contract is ratified by ford workers the union will 
turn to chrysler where it faces an uncertain reception the no 3 
automaker has said it may not be able to afford a contract similar 
to the other autoworkers but the union is expected to push for 
the model agreement

american computer and semiconductor 
makers feuding for years over a computer chip trade agreement with 
japan announced a new trade plan thursday that could bring lower 
prices to consumers 
the proposed pact which industry leaders said received an 
encouraging response from bush administration officials would end 
price controls on imported memory chips and remove an irritant in 
usjapanese relations 
the proposal for a new 5year agreement to succeed the 1986 
usjapan semiconductor trade agreement set to expire next july 
31 marks the first time chipmakers and computer makers have joined 
to achieve the same trade policy 
us chipmakers pushed for the 1986 agreement to stop japanese 
companies from dumping unfairly priced memory chips in the 
united states but us computer makers complained the agreement 
kept prices high for a key component of their products 
if the new pact is adopted it could bring down the cost of 
memory devices and be a bonanza for consumers and computer makers 
analysts said 
top executives of both industries represented by the 
semiconductor industry association a trade group and the computer 
systems policy project worked for months on the new proposal 
the computer group founded last year includes the chief 
executives of international business machines corp 
hewlettpackard co apple computer inc sun microsystems inc 
tandem computers inc compaq computer corp and five other 
companies 
wilfred corrigan chief executive officer of lsi logic corp and 
chairman of the semiconductor group said in washington that the 
proposal is based on the premise that open markets and the 
availability of semiconductors at reasonable prices will promote 
the health of the us electronics industry foster better 
relations between the us and japan and allow market forces to 
function freely 
rod canion chief executive officer of compaq and vice chairman 
of the computer group said it is important that both groups speak 
with a united voice on issues of hightech trade 
industry analysts praised the two sides for putting aside their 
differences 
the fact that they can speak with one voice to congress and 
the administration is very significant said marc elliot of 
dataquest inc in san jose i think youll see a lot more 
cooperation out of the bush administration because of that 
instead of using fair market values to determine the prices 
at which japanese chips are sold in the united states the proposal 
calls for fast track investigations by the commerce department 
of dumping allegations 
anything that takes away from the fair market value and that 
level of accountability is going to be favorably looked on by the 
japanese elliot said they consider themselves to be honorable 
people who dont need to be treated like children i think thats 
what this trade policy did i think it will ease some of the 
animosity that has existed 
the proposal acknowledges the success of the current trade 
agreement and lawsuits in getting japanese companies to stop 
dumping and urges less government involvement it calls for a halt 
in an investigation into dumping of memory chips called drams 
this proposal is very promising in that it focuses on the real 
issue which is access to the japanese market said michael 
murphy editor of the california technology stock letter 
the proposal seeks to boost the us share of overall 
semiconductor sales in japan to 20 percent by the end of 1992 and 
calls for review of further targets in 1993 
when the original trade agreement was signed the us had 
about 10 percent of the japanese semiconductor market and they 
had about 10 percent of our market murphy said now we have 
about 11 percent of their market and they have about 17 percent of 
ours so the original agreement actually caused the problem in my 
view 
one of the problems he said is that about 20 percent of us 
chip production is for military devices that the japanese dont 
need and about 40 percent of japans demand is for cheap chips for 
consumer products which us chip companies arent interested in 
making 
so by the time you exclude military and consumer chips you 
wind up with a relatively small area in which we make chips that 
they use he said 
the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry he 
said would be the us companies that make standard 
microprocessors such as texas instruments inc lsi logic and 
chips amp technologies inc

pipeline companies that allegedly 
profited illegally from higher natural gas prices in the early 
1980s agreed thursday to a 432 million settlement in an antitrust 
suit brought by utilities 
consumers should get 100 percent of the settlement after legal 
costs probably in the form of credits on their bills and lower 
rates according to the attorneys general of missouri and kansas 
the settlement also includes a guarantee of natural gas for the 
next 20 years at what is expected to be lower than market rates 
said attorneys general william webster of missouri and bob stephan 
of kansas in announcing the settlement 
agreeing to the settlement were amoco production co oxy usa 
inc and williams natural gas co 
amoco and oxy had settled a week ago but details of the 
agreement were not released because of a gag order issued by us 
district judge earl oconnor 
the case against williams then went to trial the parties 
negotiated until 4 am thursday cleaned up details later in the 
morning and oconnor dismissed the case late in the morning 
none of the defendants admitted liability in the settlement 
oxy said in a statement released late thursday its share of the 
settlement comes to 245 million amoco and williams would not 
disclose the amounts they agreed to pay 
irrespective of ones feelings regarding the merit of our 
position you reach a point where it makes more sense to put the 
issue behind you and turn your attention to the business at hand 
this is such a time said joseph h williams chairman and chief 
executive officer of tulsa oklabased williams 
details of the plan must be approved by the missouri public 
service commission and the kansas corporation commission 
the case was taken to court starting in 1984 by utilities and 
the states the suits which alleged antitrust violations from 1979 
to 1984 were then consolidated

oil prices eased back thursday reflecting what 
trading professionals called a temporary respite from the wild 
swinging on the futures market 
theres a definite feel of being in the eye of a hurricane 
said peter beutel an oil analyst with pegasus econometric group 
inc in hoboken nj 
light sweet crude oil fell 39 cents to 3693 per barrel on the 
new york mercantile exchange for november delivery contracts 
unleaded wholesale gasoline fell 228 cents to 9086 cents a 
gallon on november contracts while wholesale home heating oil rose 
51 cent to 9992 cents a gallon for november contracts 
later contract months were lower for crude mostly lower for 
gasoline and higher for heating oil 
the lackluster trading followed drops in crude prices totaling 
more than 5 per barrel early in the week and a rally of more than 
3 per barrel on wednesday 
traders said they were taking things easy through thursdays 
session while waiting to see what iraq might say during a scheduled 
evening address to the united nations that was eventually canceled 
because of a nose bleed suffered by the iraqi ambassador 
were really not going anywhere right now said ed kevelson 
a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
the iraqi un ambassador abdul amir alandari had been 
expected to respond to president bushs suggestion monday that an 
unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait could lead to 
opportunities toward a broad middle east peace settlement 
traders had said a more conciliatory stance from iraq could send 
prices even lower while more saberrattling could push them back 
up 
oils sharp decline early in the week seemed to strip away the 
war premium that had elevated crde futures to new heights as 
speculators bet that hostilities in the gulf could lead to supply 
shortages thursdays trading failed to sustain the rally from 
wednesday making buyers reluctant to get into the uncertain 
market 
natural gas fell 17 cents to 1898 per 1000 cubic feet on 
november contracts with most other contracts closing higher

thirteen american airlines customers are 
seeking more than 45 million in two lawsuits alleging the company 
reneged on an agreement to honor its obligations under the 
frequentflyer program 
the lawsuits filed tuesday in champaign county circuit court 
both accuse american of breach of contract fraud and violating 
federal racketeering law 
tom stack a spokesman in chicago for dallasbased american 
said thursday the company had not seen the lawsuits and could not 
comment on them 
american has responded to the flyers complaints previously that 
they had violated the rules of the program called aadvantage 
by transferring and selling mileage credits 
one lawsuit comprising 49 counts on behalf of eight frequent 
flyers says american has failed to honor a settlement it reached 
with the flyers after they filed a series of consumer fraud 
complaints with the illinois attorney general in 1988 
in the settlement american said it would let the flyers and 
others use the credits they had earned under the frequent flyer 
program according to the lawsuit 
the lawsuit seeks 650000 in actual damages and 10 million in 
punitive damages punitive damages could be tripled under the 
federal racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations act also 
called rico said the plaintiffs attorney jeffrey frederick 
the second lawsuit comprising 32 counts on behalf of five 
plaintiffs alleges that american failed to honor tickts earned by 
frequent flyers who were not part of the settlement agreement 
frederick said thursday 
that lawsuit seeks 100000 in actual damages and 5 million in 
punitive damages 
theres got to be some changes in all these programs because 
no one really knows whats going on and the airlines are changing 
the rules at their own whim said frederick 
he said the lawsuits were filed in champaign for the convenience 
for many of the plaintiffs who live nearby and for himself 
american forced a newlywed couple to cancel their honeymoon 
plans by refusing to honor their frequent flyer credit on reserved 
flights to new york and on the concorde to london the second 
lawsuit alleged frederick said reservations had been confirmed the 
day before 
he said customers also typically were allowed to fly to a 
distant destination such as hawaii on frequent flyer credit 
only to have the airline refuse to honor their returntrip tickets 
the customers then were forced to pay full fare to get home 
frederick said 
like many other airlines american has been the target of 
previous lawsuits on behalf of angry frequent flyers who claimed 
the airlines were failing to live up to their promises 
one of the lawsuits a 2yearold class action on behalf of 9 
million american airlines customers is pending in illinois 
appellate court said gilbert gordon an attorney for the 
plaintiffs in chicago
