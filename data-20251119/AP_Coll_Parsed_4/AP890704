at budapests deli station a cluster of 
old people many in wellcut clothes grown shabby with wear 
welcomes the train from vienna each morning 
they clutch signs written in german offering rooms for rent 
as pensioners surviving on as little as 60 a month they need 
cash from tourists who will pay perhaps even in coveted hard 
currency for a bed 
a warsaw housewife maria knows a retired professor who lives on 
a monthly pension of less than 25 
she has to sell everything she has in order to live says 
maria who asked that her last name not be used clothes 
ceramics everything 
the pensioners are some of the millions of people failed by 40 
years of stalinism in eastern europe 
after world war ii many on a continent ruined by fascism looked 
to socialism for peace and prosperity soviet communism seemed full 
of promise jobs free education and health care and equality in 
societies where a small caste of rich had long dominated the 
numerous poor 
communism forced heavy industry on traditionally agrarian areas 
while the bourgeois capitalists who could have managed the new 
factories were stripped of their property and jailed or deported in 
the purges of the 1950s 
shoddy buildings sprouted in the name of progress or in place of 
historic cities bombed in world war ii a drab sameness descended on 
half a continent 
today there is unparalleled pollution outmoded factories 
struggling agriculture and a 10year wait for a car or drafty 
tworoom apartment 
beginning in the mid1960s when moscow granted some leeway 
eastern europes economists tried to right wrongs but 
czechoslovakia the worlds 10th wealthiest nation before world war 
ii had its attempts crushed in a 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
hungary and poland were more fortunate by the early 1970s 
partial economic reforms praised by the western bankers who helped 
finance them seemed to put both en route to modernity and consumer 
plenty 
almost two decades later the poles hungarians and westerners to 
whom the two nations owe a total 54 billion know they were wrong to 
expect miracles from economies that were managed by corrupt 
inefficent systems dominated by one party 
now that moscow is permitting the political change it once 
forbade the economic decay and falling living standards in hungary 
and poland are two motors for reform 
politicians eager to satisfy their citizens craving for western 
consumer goods are permitting more travel and private imports of 
videos and other wonders they cannot produce or afford to buy for 
precious hard currency 
a key factor in the delay is the political difficulty of going 
back on four decades of promises that the state will care for its 
citizens 
east bloc workers whose universal maxim is that we pretend to 
work and they pretend to pay us are generally disgusted with 
communism but hardly enthusiastic about the austerity and 
doubledigit inflation reform has brought 
real repairs for the easts economic plight will involve deep 
changes and take much longer than a year training course at the 
usfunded management school in budapest 
poland and hungary are ahead of their east bloc allies in 
permitting foreign ownership of domestic companies and forging 
hundreds of joint ventures with the west 
in april hungary became the first east bloc country to allow a 
stateowned enterprise the relatively successful tungsram light 
bulb company to be bought by westerners an austrian consortium 
eagerly pursuing all possible sources of capital hungary broke 
east bloc convention and forged diplomatic ties with south korea 
samsung corp is setting up its first hungarian factory to 
manufacture 300000 color televisions a year 
both poland and hungary also have small private banks hungary 
even has a fledgling stock exchange 
but the people who manage them suave sophisticates who learned 
their craft in new york or london know how long it will be before 
their enterprises resemble either 
ten years perhaps shrugged the young manager of a new 
austrohungarian banking venture

the cia laughed and british intelligence wouldnt 
comment but with or without help from the pros the spa town of 
cheltenham is set to blow the cover on the spy business 
playing on its fame as the home to the governments top secret 
intelligencegathering headquarters the town of 86000 people in 
southwest england plans to open the only museum of espionage outside 
havana tourism officer peter rollins said tuesday 
the tourism department needs only the ok from the town council 
and if all goes well the espionage center will open next year 
offering exhibits on spies through the ages and the state of the 
profession today rollins said in an interview 
weve got a lovely town but not a lot to do if its raining 
said rollins of the town where the fashionable once flocked to take 
mineral waters i thought what would be appropriate for the town 
but unique as well 
when people were asked what they associated with cheltenham a 
heck of a lot of people said oh yes thats where gchq is based 
so we thought well why not an espionage center 
gchq government communications headquarters is natos 
european center for electronic eavesdropping the secretive spy 
center was sounded out and gave a cautious nod to the plan said 
rollins 
weve kept them in contact from the very beginning he said 
their answer is that they had no comment either way but as long 
as it didnt endanger security they had no objection 
a ministry of defense spokesman said mi5 and mi6 the domestic 
and foreign espionage agencies could not comment officially they 
dont exist so they cant comment he said requesting anonymity 
response from the cia was more jovial said rollins 
the cia had a great laugh when they were told they thought it 
was a great idea said rollins quoting from a local newspaper 
that had called the us intelligence agency for comment 
he added the cia was the only agency that had heard of anything 
at all resembling such a museum and that was in havana said 
rollins 
during the april visit of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to havana reporters were taken on a tour of the museum of state 
security which displayed the scorched tail of a small plane 
plastic explosives and other artifacts of what cubans billed as 
their struggle against the cia and dissident cubans accused of 
trying to kill or overthrow fidel castro 
rollins said planners of the cheltenham museum havent sought the 
cooperation of intelligence agencies too strenuously although they 
would love the benefit of their experience 
but he said he wanted to make clear that the last thing we want 
to do is poke fun at or belittle what they do 
the museum will cost 12 million a joint venture with a private 
company it will be housed in a threestory reconverted arts center 
so far the towns leisure committee and tourism officials have 
given unanimous support and rollins is confident the town council 
will approve it 
exhibits will tell the tales of famous spies explore the 
popularity of spy novels and recreate a classroom where spies learn 
their craft officials hope for 100000 visitors the first year 
if you think about it theres a lot to it said rollins 
its one of the oldest professions going its a worldwide 
affair

laurence legere has watched nato develop 
from a fledgling alliance dominated by the united states into one 
that reflects western europes increasing preoccupation with its own 
interests and destiny 
legere 70 is ending a career that took him to normandy in world 
war ii the white house during the cuban missile crisis and to 
europe as the defense departments top civilian outside washington 
his last job defense adviser to the us mission to nato since 
1974 has given him a close look at his countrys european allies 
i really have the feeling of a time of great change 
legere said in a recent interview at north atlantic treaty 
organization headquarters in brussels it will be fascinating to 
watch 
he is retiring to north carolina after 15 years of advising 
american defense secretaries on sensitive security issues 
reflecting on his experiences he said 
the europeans are thinking differently the people coming to 
power now didnt experience world war ii and are less reliant 
on the united states 
when we were the real leaders of the alliance damn near 
anything we said went legere said they were good at 
calibrating how serious the united states was about something 
when a new president was elected europeans wondered what was 
jimmy carter going to do what was this cowboy reagan going to be 
like he said but there was less of that in may during president 
bushs first summit of the 16nation alliance 
they dont feel as dependent on where an administration is 
going to go he said they are beginning to feel more european 
about all this 
much of western europes new closeness stems from the plan of the 
12nation european economic community to form a single market in 
late 1992 ending the many trade barriers that now exist 
the idea of europe is very much on the move legere said 
relations with the soviet union once eyed suspiciously in 
western europe also have changed since mikhail s gorbachev gained 
control of the kremlin in 1985 
youve got people who dont consider the soviet union the evil 
empire or evil incarnate legere said but recommended caution in 
case gorbachev doesnt last 
even with reduced tension in europe legere feels there is room 
for the defensive alliance linking the united states and canada with 
their european allies 
the question is what kind of a place and doing what he said 
my own view is that nato will continue to play a vital role in 
military defense and defense questions its just the only place 
that it can be done 
he does not believe europe will become strong enough to replace 
the united states as a global power 
we are still the superpower he said even an ideally and 
perfectly united europe which wont happen would not be in the 
league with us and the soviet union 
legere spiced his remembrances with tales of naive american 
politicians crossing the atlantic to offer their views on defense 
matters 
years ago he said one such told soviet arms negotiators moscow 
and washington avoid complicated bargaining and just pull out a 
large number of forces from europe 
you dont say these kinds of things in that sort of company and 
i can remember the russians being really nonplussed by it legere 
said 
he was born on jan 2 1919 in fitchburg mass attended west 
point at age 17 and retired from the army as a colonel in 1966 
on dday june 6 1944 legere was wounded after parachuting 
behind utah beach in france which interfered with his plans he was 
carrying a dress uniform and two bottles of scotch because i was 
convinced we were going to be in paris in about two weeks and i 
didnt want to be caught short 
his career included several stints as a white house adviser 
in october 1962 it was his responsibility to awaken president 
john f kennedy with important developments a long rambling cable 
arrived from soviet leader nikita khrushchev during the night 
i read that thing a dozen times all night long and i did 
nothing legere said ill never know whether i did the right 
thing or not 
next day the national security council began debating what to 
do and was still at it in the evening 
this could be the last night of my life and a lot of other 
peoples legere said he added with a laugh that he went to a 
nearby hotel and got smashed

to his adopted country and winthrop paul rockefeller a 
greatgrandson of standard oil founder john d rockefeller put on 
an arkansas fireworks display that drew 100000 
seven chinese students at the university of tulsa in oklahoma

for asylum said graduate student guohua zheng 25 
in boston the ancient and honorable artillery company of 
massachusetts observed the holiday by honoring the fallen 
prodemocracy protesters in beijings tiananmen square 
about 200000 people turned out for the annual boston pops 
concert at the hatch shell on the esplanade at night the music was 
capped with a fireworks display 
new york city celebrated with a spectacular 30minute nighttime 
fireworks display that included a liberty bell space rocket and 
star formations and america written across the sky 
earlier about 2 million people packed the beach and boardwalk at 
coney island to watch an air show featuring f16 jet maneuvers and 
green berets parachuting from helicopters said show chairman milton 
berger 
in seattle about 500 people representing 51 countries became 
americans as hundreds of others including two congressmen welcomed 
them on a rare sunny fourth of july in seattle 
they werent so lucky in the nations capital where it rained on 
the estimated 20000 people who turned out for the annual fourth of 
july parade 
everybody was smiling and being more congenial because we had 
the bad weather as a common denominator said john shaw who came 
to washington from augusta maine 
however at the annual fireworks at the washington monument that 
followed two people were shot and wounded and several others 
suffered minor injuries when they were reportedly trampled police 
said 
about 400000 people turned out for the fireworks police said 
at the arkansas site where the fireworks display was held 
rockefeller son of the states late governor said theres more to 
the celebration hes sponsored for the last 10 years than money 
i love it he said to see the kids and the older folks 
the people who fought to keep this country free its just a 
humdinger of a fourth of july 
thousands of flags were given away in milwaukee and chicago and 
aging hippies at a counterculture gathering in nevada displayed the 
stars and stripes and a week after the supreme court ruled that 
burning the flag in protest is protected by the constitution 
american legion posts retired old flags by burning them 
its the proper way to burn any tattered torn flag that needs 
to be destroyed said john comer as legionnaires in manchester 
mass destroyed 50 old flags in a ceremony that traditionally 
includes prayers 
in newport news va vice president dan quayle defended the bush 
administrations proposal to ban flag burning 
around the world old glory is recognized and revered as the 
symbol of freedom too many americans have laid down their lives in 
the defense of freedom to treat this symbol lightly quayle said 
at a ceremony to honor the uss newport news the navys newest 
submarine 
just outside miami cuban immigrant and exporter eduardo martinez 
again threw open his hacienda mardenpaz to tens of thousands as 
visitors examined scaleddown versions of the white house and the 
statue of liberty bands played a mixture of latin music country 
and rock 
i do this as a tribute to america because we are very grateful 
to this country he said 
solidarity leader walesa was hailed for his personal triumph 
of hope in poland as his wife accepted philadelphias first liberty 
medal and a 100000 cash award on his behalf in a ceremony outside 
independence hall 
the timing of this philadelphia liberty medal award coincides 
with a particular moment in poland said danuta walesa speaking 
for her husband our many years of struggle for the right to our 
own nation is entering into its decisive phase 
she referred to tuesdays events in warsaw where for the first 
time since the late 1940s an opposition group was installed in a 
soviet bloc legislature a total of 259 solidarity deputies and 
senators took their seats in the national assembly next to members 
of a communist coalition 
the mood was more outrage than solidarity in boston where more 
than 3000 abortion rights activists protested mondays supreme 
court ruling on a missouri abortion case 
how ironic that the supreme court is poised to take away a 
cherished right when the nation is commemorating our extraordinary 
tradition of individual liberty said pam nourse director of mass 
choice 
in milwaukee about 18 volunteers were cheered by passersby as 
they placed some 1500 flags along the streets people were 
honking their horns giving me the peace sign and giving me thumbs 
up said marietta redding i love apple pie grandmas and the 
flag 
in chicago businessman ted kamberos played flag elf for the 
third year planting 1000 american flags along the streets with 
help from a dozen friends there are so few people in america who 
would consider burning a flag theyve given this gentleman a stage 
and i think theyre making a lot of hoopla about nothing the 
41yearold greek immigrant said of the supreme court decision that 
upheld a protesters right to burn the flag 
american flags fluttered at the 18th annual rainbow family of 
living light reunion of more than 5000 people in nevadas humboldt 
national forest this independence day means a lot to me because 
it means freedom from power from authority said linda edwards

an american legion post that raised 68000 for a 
sculpture honoring women who served in the nations military during 
wartime finds itself with a statue and no place to put it 
the plan had been to set up the halfton statue in veterans 
memorial plaza part of a city park that legion post 272 maintains 
under agreement with the parks department 
the legionnaires thought they had clear sailing from the 
department when they made arrangements with sculptor eileen barry 
but the city art commission which has the final say on whether a 
sculpture or other art may be displayed on city property recently 
rejected the 8foot bronze of a women in fatigues and combat boots 
calling it not strong enough artistically 
jerry klein treasurer of post 272 in the queens borough said he 
had never heard of the commission when the project got started in 
1986 
we thought we would have to work just with the parks 
department at some point in the project after the contract had 
been signed thats when we heard there was an art commission 
klein said 
parks commissioner henry stern said his department always informs 
donors that arts commission approval is required nobody would 
tell them to make a statue without first getting it approved in 
the design stage stern said 
mrs barry said she was shocked by the commissions opinion of 
the statue which is nearly complete 
anyone who sees this has nothing but comment that shes strong 
shes powerful mrs barry said 
despite the denial of a permanent site for the statue the parks 
department has said it may stand temporarily at a city site across 
the street from the rockaway park art commission approval is 
unnecessary for display of less than a year 
it just gives us some breathing room said klein we still 
have to get a permanent site

move over paris tokyo will join you in the ranks 
of cities with eightdigit phone numbers 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp said tuesday that the change 
from sevendigit phone numbers in tokyo will take place jan 1 
1991 subscribers will add a 3 at the beginning of their sevendigit 
numbers 
the national telephone utility said a shortage of exchange 
numbers began showing up in 1981 as demand increased for facsimile 
and microcomputer communications on top of demand for regular 
telephone lines 
some eightdigit phone numbers were given to pocket pagers in 
1987 and in 1988 some new subscribers for regular phones received 
eightdigit numbers ntt said but by early 1991 the shortage will 
be acute 
unlike in france which has had eightdigit local phone numbers 
throughout the country for several years the change in japan will 
affect only phone numbers in tokyo a city of 12 million people

firefighters racing rising 
temperatures tuesday contained a blaze that leveled 13 homes 
damaged eight others charred 1500 acres of brush and did 43 
million damage in an exclusive hillside neighborhood 
we should get control of it pretty soon joe silva of the los 
angeles county fire department said after the fire was declared 
contained at 520 pm 
cool humid night air slowed the blaze after it ravaged the 
neighborhood monday and about half of the roughly 1000 
firefighters were allowed to go home silva said 
but temperatures soared as high as 109 degrees and winds were up 
to 12 mph 
and in the san bernardino national forest a new blaze burned 
150 acres in santa ana canyon about 70 miles east of los angeles 
about 200 firefighters were dispatched and six fireretardant 
dropping planes and three helicopters attacked the blaze said 
bureau of land management dispatcher allyn harrington 
elsewhere fire crews battled forest and brush fires in mostly 
remote areas of colorado utah wyoming and new mexico where a 
large fire threatened an endangered species of trout 
police allowed residents back into the turnbull canyon area 20 
miles east of downtown los angeles early tuesday to survey the 
damage in the neighborhood where homes are valued at 300000 to 
more than 1 million 
we realize how important it was for people to go back in and 
check some were going crazy said capt garry oversby 
thirteen homes were destroyed and eight sustained major damage 
silva said damage to property and land was estimated at at least 4 
million 
four people were arrested for looting late monday silva said 
i cannot believe they would want to take more from people who 
already have lost almost everything he said 
don younger said he had been visiting friends monday when he saw 
a plume of black smoke from his neighborhood when he tried to drive 
home fire officials would not allow him through so he drove to a 
hill where he could watch 
i saw the firefighters down on their bellies saving my home i 
wish i could hug them all he said the blaze destroyed a small 
structure behind his home containing about 20000 worth of amateur 
radio equipment 
younger said his house which he valued at 250000 sustained 
some 12000 in fire damage in 1968 
two houses down jim ahrens swept up ashes and charred wood 
inside an addition to his home that was to have been an exercise 
room he also lost a bathroom it could have been a lot worse 
he said 
about 300 evacuees registered at a shelter at a high school 
mostly to let relatives know they were safe then spent the night 
with friends or family said robert crompton disaster services 
chairman of the american red cross 
the fire was believed to have been caused by people fire 
inspector john lenihan said it began in a brushy area and spread 
quickly to homes 
there was no reason for anyone to have been there he said of 
the area where the fire started 
in southwestern new mexico a winddriven fire had charred about 
5000 acres near diamond peak in the gila national forest forest 
service spokesman ken palmrose said crews had to use hand tools on 
the fire line in steep terrain straddling the continental divide at 
9000 feet 
nearly 850 people six air tankers and seven helicopters fought 
the fire which was started by lightning friday and spread by 30 mph 
wind 
the fire threatened the gila trout which are listed as an 
endangered species a us forest service spokesman said 
some people might not understand how fish can be threatened by 
fire but these are creeks with very little water said ken 
palmrose the fish might be in little pools or in an area with 
very little stream flow 
biologists planned to use nets to catch as many gila trout as 
possible and bring them to a hatchery 
several fires in colorado had been contained or controlled but 
the box canyon fire south of dinosaur national monument grew to 
1800 acres tuesday and entered the skull creek wilderness study 
area 
firefighters also battled extreme heat and low humidity to 
suppress fires in eastern and southern utah while a new blaze 
charred more than 1000 acres in the uintah basin forcing 
evacuation of all campgrounds in the area 
in wyoming a fire that scorched 400 acres in the bridgerteton 
national forest was expected to burn up to 1000 acres before crews 
could extinguish it said us forest service spokesman fred 
kingwill 
the fire is the first significant blaze in the forest so far this

new us ambassador john d negroponte says 
there is no basis to fears expressed in mexico that his appointment 
is a sign of intentions by washington to intervene in mexicos 
internal affairs 
those fears are completely without foundation negroponte 
said monday replying to a question from a mexican journalist after 
presenting his credentials to president carlos salinas de gortari at 
the national palace 
many mexican commentators speculated on the meaning of 
negropontes appointment noting that he was ambassador to honduras 
during the buildup of the nicaraguan contra rebel movement there 
because of a history of conflicts starting with the mexican war 
in 1846 mexicans are highly sensitive to any hint of us 
interventionism 
it is not my intention to bring about intervention of any 
sort negroponte said i want to promote good relations between 
the two nations 
speaking in spanish negroponte noted in a statement that he was 
a 28year career diplomat and said there was no relationship more 
important than the relationship between mexico and the united 
states 
he said he was anxious to build on the spirit of houston 
where salinas and president bush met last november before either 
had taken office 
in a brief question and answer session after the ceremony 
negroponte praised the salinas administrations effort to fight drug 
trafficking 
the united states is very satisfied with the collaboration that 
has developed between our two governments negroponte said 
asked what he thought of mexicos policies in central america 
negroponte said the main issues between the two nations are 
bilateral 
naturally our governments will sometimes exchange points of 
view on other themes but always on the basis of mutual respect 
negroponte said using a phrase mutual respect that is a 
keynote for politicians here when they discuss relations with the 
united states 
under the administration of president miguel de la madrid mexico 
opposed us policy in central america particularly its support of 
the contra rebels who fought the leftist sandinista government in 
nicaragua 
but in may when tensions rose between the united states and the 
panama over what washington called a fraudulent election and over 
gen manuel antonio noriegas role in the government mexico 
temporarily withdrew its envoy to panama an almost unprecedented 
display of support for a us position 
negropontes role in the contra buildup figured during the 
confirmation process in the us senate following his nomination by 
bush but he was confirmed easily 
the 50yearold diplomat served as ambassador to honduras from 
1981 to 1985 then served in the white house as part of the national 
security staff

lawyers for oliver north say imprisoning the 
former presidential aide would only encourage highlevel government 
officials to evade responsibility for legally risky activity 
responding to the prosecutions call for a prison term for north 
defense lawyers said in court papers monday that a sentence of 
imprisonment would be cruel and unjust 
such a sentence would be deeply and fundamentally unfair the 
defense said in the presentence memo filed in us district court 
the 45yearold former national security council aide is 
scheduled to be sentenced wednesday for three felony convictions 
arising from his involvement in the irancontra affair 
he faces up to 10 years in prison and 750000 in fines for 
aiding and abetting the obstruction of a congressional inquiry into 
the affair destroying or altering government documents and 
illegally accepting the installation of a security fence outside his 
home by arms dealer richard secord 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh has asked us district 
judge gerhard gesell to send the retired marine lieutenant colonel 
to prison arguing that north defied congress and lied at his trial 
to win acquittal of other charges 
but defense lawyers led by brendan v sullivan jr said the 
prosecutions request demonstrates that it will stop at nothing in 
its effort to crush oliver north 
the prosecution does not offer evidence to support these 
charges it plainly assumes that if it throws enough mud some will 
stick the defense said repeating an argument made during the 
eightweek trial norths lawyers said he was mostly charged with 
activities that were authorized by his superiors 
a prison sentence for lt col north would not deter high 
government officials from using their subordinates to carry out 
actions that are legally or politically risky the defense brief 
said 
it would not escape notice of such officials if oliver north 
were to go to prison while others remain in government in positions 
of power or return to privatesector sinecures the defense said 
those who created this situation have walked away from it 
the defense said quoting from a letter to the court by noel koch a 
former deputy assistant secretary of defense 
imprisoning north koch wrote will only reassure those who use 
young men like him that they can do it with impunity 
north has suffered enough punishment with his dismissal from the 
white house staff and the threat of the loss of his marine corps 
pension as well as unrelenting and often hostile press scrutiny 
for 2 years the defense said 
if the court feels that further punishment is warranted the 
defense said it should take the form of probation conditioned on 
community service 
in a related action irancontra prosecutors opposed a request by 
joseph fernandez to subpoena former president reagan to testify at 
fernandezs trial on charges of lying about his role in helping arm 
the nicaraguan contra rebels 
walshs office said testimony by reagan about his support for the 
contras was irrelevant to charges that fernandez lied when 
questioned by a presidential commission and his cia superiors about 
his efforts to set up an airstrip in costa rica for the contra 
resupply network 
fernandez former cia station chief in costa rica is scheduled 
to stand trial july 24 in federal court in alexandria va

president bush is not living up to his promise 
to be the education president thus far says the national education 
associations new leader 
he seems to be floundering keith geiger said monday after he 
was elected president of the 2millionmember teacher union we 
simply dont see where he wants to take the country in education 
right now we have nothing to debate because theyre not saying 
anything were very frustrated 
geiger who has been vice president of the union for six years 
had few good things to say about one of the only education 
initiatives the president has pushed allowing parents to choose 
which public school their children will attend 
the nea representative assembly was debating the choice issue 
today at its annual convention the 8500 delegates were considering 
several proposals ranging from outright opposition to qualified 
opposition to the idea of letting parents choose their childrens 
public schools 
geiger said he favored a policy that would oppose choice but 
allow flexibility for magnet schools alternative schools and other 
option programs 
we are not going to be very supportive of most existing 
choice programs the presidentelect said because they do not pay 
for student transportation and tend to shortchange the schools left 
behind only one plan in seattle gives money to the school 
abandoned by the student so it can improve he said 
we need to raise the level of the education thats going on in 
all buildings not just a few buildings and let some kids escape 
geiger said 
what does the nea want from bush full funding of proven federal 
education programs that serve disadvantaged handicapped and 
vocational students a major presidential speech outlining bushs 
education goals and a presidential proposal designed to attract 
young students to the teaching profession geiger said 
the former math and science teacher takes office at the end of 
the summer he said he will keep the huge union the countrys 
largest and among its most politically powerful on the path set by 
outgoing president mary futrell 
she is widely credited with bringing teachers into the mainstream 
of the education reform movement through teacher leadership 
training dropout prevention and literacy programs as well as a 
relatively flexible attitude on issues such as teacher certification 
and merit pay 
you will not see a big aboutface in this organization 
geiger said but he said he will push some of his own ideas 
including efforts to enact collective bargaining laws in two to four 
states the nea identifies as ripe for such action 
i dont believe any employee in any school district in america 
today should be working without being under a collective bargaining 
agreement geiger said 
about 17 states do not have collective bargaining laws he said 
he cited georgia as one possible site of nea activity an aide said 
new mexico may also be a target 
geiger 48 of livonia mich won the nea presidency with 4870 
votes to 3600 for executive committee member john wilson of 
raleigh nc 
a veteran contract negotiator and former president of his state 
education association geiger presented himself as tough but 
flexible 
wilson a special education teacher with a fiery style pitched 
himself as the activist candidate and made impassioned attacks on 
merit pay and educational bureaucrats in his campaign literature 
and speeches

proposed restrictions on abortion are waiting 
in the wings in many states now that the supreme court has approved 
such limits say activists on both sides of the issue 
mondays decision did not impose immediate restrictions in any 
state other than missouri the state affected by the case 
but dawn johnsen legal counsel of the national abortion rights 
action league said over 250 abortionrelated bills were introduced 
in various states in 1988 and 1989 
all but a handful of states had some activity she said i 
expect that the courts decision will encourage state legislatures 
to introduce numerous restrictions on abortions 
douglas johnson legislative director of the national right to 
life committee said he thought the quickest impact may come from 
courts that have enjoined laws in various states 
now those lower courts will review some of those injunctions 
he said 
he called the decision an invitation by the court to the states 
to begin to restore protection to unborn children and johnson 
added im sure that a number of legislatures will accept the 
invitation 
most state legislatures are not in session at this time of year 
he noted and there is time to analyze the decision and enact new 
laws 
the telephones are ringing off the hook said sue roselle 
executive director of womens health services inc of pittsburgh a 
nonprofit clinic that performs about 7000 abortions per year 
women are saying i want my abortion now before they change 
the law she said 
eve paul vice president for legal affairs for planned parenthood 
federation of america said the decision is just opening it up for 
endless battles in the legislatures and the courts 
we expect many states to enact laws that restrict abortion 
rights in a variety of ways she said we expect to be in court 
challenging many of those i think they will start off with 
provisions that are similar to the missouri law 
ms paul said too that womens rights groups will indicate to 
legislators that abortion will be a key election issue next year 
people women in particular are not very conscious of the role 
that state legislatures played in their lives she said this 
opens the way for a lot more public concern as to who is my state 
legislator and what is his position on abortion 
in the past decade about 15 million legal abortions have been 
performed each year 
in louisiana attorney general william guste said the decision 
might warrant reconsideration of a law declared unconstitutional in 
1982 that requires ultrasound testing of a fetus prior to any 
abortion but he declined to speculate what the legislature might do 
some state legislators are predicting there wont be much action 
in their states as a result of the rulings 
i would anticipate a lot of sound and fury but no substantive 
action by the legislature next year said washington state house 
speaker joe king after all washington voters approved of 
abortion and the spending of state money to pay for abortion 
and in new york state with the most liberal laws in the country 
chances are thought slim that the laws will be tightened womens 
groups will be mobilized to hold the line said shirley gordon 
executive director of family planning advocates of new york state

appropriate limitations on abortion 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo what today did was made women 
wards of the state were the only ones in the whole western 
civilized world with this ruling

to limit their right to privacy 
sen edward kennedy dmass by cutting back on roe vs wade 
the court has seriously undermined the constitutions protection of 
women in our society 
sen gordon humphrey rnh the ruling is the first big step

victory for unborn children and will likely result in the saving of

travel

most of the fireworks being set off to 
celebrate american freedom this week were shipped from china before 
that countrys bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators a 
fireworks expert says 
the chinese have targeted the us fireworks market since 
relations improved during the nixon administration and now dominate 
the market said john a conkling a maryland chemist who heads the 
american pyrotechnics association 
conkling who operates a seasonal fireworks hotline in 
washington said shipments from china had either arrived or were 
aboard vessels by the time the disturbances began that led to last 
months bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators hundreds 
perhaps thousands of people were killed 
i think the fact that for the past 15 years weve celebrated 
independence day with fireworks coming from a communist country 
means there has been an irony quite a while he said it is 
heightened by the incidents this year 
most fireworks used by americans come from overseas more than 
half from china he said adding that the question concerning 
possible trade sanctions would be whom do you punish 
in 1987 the latest year for which he had full statistics 50 
million pounds of fireworks came to the united states directly from 
china and more than 10 million pounds came from china by way of hong 
kong distributors that left just 6 million pounds exported to the 
united states by the rest of the world including such former 
fireworksmaking giants as taiwan and macao 
most of the fireworks are of the backyard variety firecrackers 
roman candles skyrockets and not the kind seen at public displays 
commerce department figures show chinese shipments of 
explosives and pyrotechnics have risen steadily since 1983 when 
they were valued at 334 million to 512 million in 1987 
the chinese who made fire lances with a mixture of 
saltpeter sulfur and charcoal as early as the 12th century now 
tailor their products for americans 
for instance the chinese began making sparklers because 
americans wanted them 
many of the fireworks on display at roadside stands still have 
distinct oriental imagery pagodas blossoms and butterflies 
a 13 package put together by a new jersey company is called the 
miss liberty assortment a few of the pieces in it are chinese 
including one with unintended timeliness a tiny chinesemade paper 
tank moves on the ground and emits flaming pellets 
for years controversy over the chinese imports has involved 
safety rather than questions of politics or human rights in china 
last year the consumer product safety commission and the customs 
service seized so many chinese fireworks for bad labels short fuses 
or gunpowder overloads that the industry had to shut down for a time 
conkling was among a group of american experts who toured the 
chinese fireworks provinces last year to work with the makers on 
safety standards

the supreme courts latest ruling on religious 
displays on government property is a mixed blessing say religious 
groups and advocates of strict separation of church and state 
sholom d comay president of the american jewish committee 
said there is simply no religious need for the display of sacred 
symbols of any faith in or at government buildings there is ample 
private space available 
we see this decision as a mixed bag said robert boston a 
spokesman for americans united for separation of church and state 
for the first time the court has stated clearly that religious 
displays standing alone at government buildings are 
unconstitutional he said on the other hand the court has said 
they could be constitutional if surrounded by secular symbols we 
see that as a negative development 
the court ended its current term monday by forbidding christmas 
nativity scenes and other religious displays on government property 
if they convey an endorsement of religion 
the ruling while important was overshadowed by a longawaited 
decision in which the court expanded state power to regulate 
abortions 
the court stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion but agreed to hear three other abortion cases from 
minnesota illinois and ohio when the justices take the bench 
again in october 
in other actions the court 
accepted its firstever right to die case and agreed to 
decide whether a missouri family may order removal of a lifesupport 
system from a woman in an irreversible vegetative condition 
agreed to review a 1984 federal law requiring that student 
religious groups be given the same access as other extracurricular 
clubs to public high school facilities the justices will decide 
whether a bible study group must be allowed to meet at an omaha 
neb high school after class hours 
in the religiousdisplay case the justices voted 54 that a 
christmas nativity scene standing alone inside the allegheny county 
courthouse in pittsburgh violated the constitutionally required 
separation of church and state 
by a separate 63 vote the court allowed a hanukkah menorah one 
block away on the front steps of pittsburghs citycounty building 
the menorah a ninebranched candelabra used during the jewish 
holiday hanukkah was surrounded by a much taller christmas tree and 
a sign saluting freedom 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said the 
nativity scene or creche carrying signs hailing jesus as the son 
of god gave the impression the county was endorsing christian 
principles 
government may celebrate christmas in some manner and form but 
not in a way that endorses christian doctrine he said here 
allegheny county has transgressed this line 
he said the setting for the menorah by contrast had clear 
secular overtones 
justice anthony m kennedy participating in his first 
churchstate case since joining the court in 1988 voted to permit 
the nativity scene as well as the menorah 
kennedy said the court in barring government sponsorship of the 
creche showed an unjustified hostility toward religion a 
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents 
thank god for the supreme court said charles saul a 
pittsburgh attorney representing a jewish group that owned the 
menorah the court is saying that when you put a menorah and a 
christmas tree and these kinds of things together that all faiths 
are welcome 
mondays ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the 
court upheld the constitutionality of a citysponsored creche in 
pawtucket ri that display included various secular symbols 
including santa claus and his reindeer 
ironically blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion in the pawtucket 
case 
but he said monday the latest ruling could clear up some of the 
confusion engendered by the earlier decision 
he said these are the guiding principles the governments use 
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of 
endorsing religious beliefs and the effect of the governments use 
of religious symbolism depends upon its context 
the american civil liberties union and others went to court 
seeking removal of both the pittsburgh creche and the menorah

state lawmakers say abortion restrictions approved by the us 
supreme court will turn the nations legislatures into war zones 
antiabortion legislators across the country said they will use 
mondays ruling as a plan of attack to limit the availability of 
legal abortions in their states proponents of legal abortion 
pledged a staunch defense 
there are two irreconcilable positions that are very strongly 
held said rhode island rep arthur m read ii a democrat in the 
new round of debates he said i would expect warfare 
many lawmakers will have to hold their fire for the moment most 
state legislatures are in summer recess and their leaders generally 
were cool to calls for special sessions to take up the abortion 
issue 
i think we ought to take the summer and seriously consider 
this said illinois gov james r thompson illinois might set a 
model for the nation by engaging in reasoned discussion and 
hearings 
other minds were made up in maine gov john r mckernan jr 
said he would fight any effort to restrict abortion in michigan 
republican state sen jack welborn said he already has drafted a law 
based on the new restrictions 
and in louisiana state rep alphonse jackson a democrat 
sounded as if the prochoice fight already were lost 
what are the poor people going to do he asked poor women 
will have no right to determine what is to be done with their 
bodies 
jackson reflected concerns that the ruling by permitting states 
to further restrict public expenditures for abortions would 
primarily hurt the poor others shared that view 
ive never been for unfettered abortions but laws that 
restrict poor people and black people from getting abortions that 
affluent people can get ive always been opposed to said new 
jersey gov thomas h kean 
legislators in new jersey where republican kean is leaving 
office this year said the issue could play a prominent role in the 
gubernatorial election lawmakers elsewhere also expected no chance 
to hide 
people are going to be put on the line now said connecticut 
house speaker richard j balducci a democrat theyre going to 
have to say hey im for it or im against it 
in its ruling the court said states may bar any public employee 
from assisting in abortions not neccessary to save the mothers 
life and may forbid use of any public hospital or facility in such 
abortions 
it also authorized a prohibition on public spending for 
encouraging or counseling women to have abortions that are not 
needed to save their lives and said states may require doctors to 
determine when possible whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old can 
live outside the womb 
while the ruling left a womans basic right to abortion intact 
we can go a lot further in restricting abortions said 
pennsylvania rep stephen freind a republican and a leading 
abortion foe in his state 
the righttolife philosophy has been on the defensive since 
roe vs wade the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion said montana 
sen tom rasmussen a republican this gives us greater impetus to 
go on the offensive 
its going to be the same old fight but more intense said 
kansas sen ben vidricksen a republican in fact its going to 
be a bloody battle in the legislature 
until legislatures act current state laws remain in effect 
noted attorney sarah weddington who successfully argued roe vs 
wade tomorrow its going to be the same as today she said 
but what we are going to see is a tremendous surge of legislative 
activity 
the outcome of that activity is unclear in many states montanas 
sen rasmussen gave new restrictions only a 5050 chance there 
the state attorney general in idaho predicted tougher abortion 
laws will be enacted there lawmakers in wyoming made the same 
prediction there does appear to be a righttolife majority in 
the legislature said republican sen charles scott i suspect 
there will be a move to do whatever the supreme court will allow 
in iowa i doubt that we will be passing any restrictions 
said democratic house speaker don avenson a candidate for governor 
we will be very cautious about even thinking of restricting 
womens reproductive rights but the opposite view was expressed 
by alabama republican rep greg beers an abortion opponent 
not only will alabama introduce bills that will bring alabama 
into a more conservative mode with regards to abortion he said 
i believe youll see every state in america introducing 
legislation like this

novelist mario vargas llosa has stepped back 
into the race for president after putting to rest internal squabbles 
within his centerright coalition 
the acclaimed 53yearold writer reversed himself monday after 
shocking perus political circles by withdrawing his candidacy june 
21 and leaving for europe 
at the time he criticized the mediocre and petty motives of 
some members of the coalition that nominated him he said they were 
putting their own parochial interests above those of the nation 
peru is beset by economic chaos and a growing leftist insurgency 
public opinion polls show vargas llosa with 44 percent of voter 
support more than double the figure for his principal rival 
alfonso barrantes a marxist and former mayor of lima 
speaking at a news conference broadcast from madrid spain 
vargas llosa said monday that the democratic front the centerright 
coalition that nominated him on june 4 had resolved its internal 
dispute over municipal elections 
analysts said vargas llosas handling of the issue strengthened 
his leadership role within the alliance and demonstrated his 
political skill and determination to be more than a figurehead for 
oldline leaders 
the two major coalition parties the popular action party of 
former president fernando belaunde terry and the popular christian 
party had threatened to run their own candidates in november 
municipal elections 
last week the parties agreed to vargas llosas demand that the 
coalition rather than individual parties would put forward 
candidates he said this was necessary to keep the democratic front 
united for next years presidential election 
in his letter of resignation he said that even if the coalition 
were to win the presidency the disputes would leave the new 
government too weak to confront the leftist insurgency or resolve 
perus economic ills 
the governments nineyear struggle against maoist shining path 
guerrillas has claimed more than 15000 lives meanwhile inflation 
has reached an annual rate of nearly 6000 percent 
in his monday news conference broadcast on peruvian tv and radio 
vargas llosa said the differences that led him to resign no 
longer existed 
he said the parties have reached an agreement that seems very 
reasonable to me and i think also to most of the public 
vargas llosa said he planned to return to lima this week to 
resume his campaign 
the election is planned for march but an exact date has not been 
set the winner is to take office on july 28 
for months opponents of vargas llosa have hinted that the writer 
did not have the political strength for a presidential campaign but 
analysts said monday that his firmness on municipal elections showed 
he is far tougher than even his coalition allies realized 
vargas llosa was catapulted into the political arena after 
organizing a huge demonstration against populist president alan 
garcias plan to nationalize banks he said the takeover attempt 
represented a totalitarian threat to the peruvian economy 
he found himself transformed overnight into a new political 
leader and conservatives saw in him a man who could return them to 
power

a decade later dick and janes spot has become a work of art 
festooned with 1600 bicycle reflectors 20000 bottle caps and a 
6foot hand that once belonged to a fortune teller the home of 
artists dick elliott and jane orleman is their largest art work 
art over the years was a very serious thing and we feel this is 
a more fun point of view said jane 47 we dont try to 
represent the angst of the world we try to alleviate it 
located on a quiet street in this university town of 11000 
residents dick and janes spot which doubles as their residence 
has been surprising and delighting passersby since 1979 
a combination roadside attraction and fullsize playhouse the 
spot is an everchanging work with sunlight reflecting different 
colors from each reflector and more than 100 silver bicycle wheels 
whirling in the wind the bottle caps rust and the garden changes 
through the seasons 
the couple recently received a 2500 grant from art matters 
inc a new york city foundation to install lights in the yard so 
darkness can no longer obscure the sights 
they bought the 100yearold frame house for 18000 when it was 
a decrepit wreck in 1978 and shortly after received a pair of pink 
flamingos from janes mother 
they soon began adding things over the years about 30 artists 
have contributed carvings sculpture and other pieces the 100 
separate works include carved heads a sculpture using a huge fish 
net and a brick fountain in the shape of a heart known as the heart 
of washington that is a pun on ellensburgs location in the center

face and flashcubes for eyeballs dick said

wooden fence the major works are in the front and back yards and 
can be viewed from the sidewalk

installed at the university of washington this fall and they just 
received a fellowship from the bellevue art museum 
im the only person i know of using reflectors as a painting

finding a factory to produce the reflectors 
jane also is a painter although generally with actual paint 
she also has created several of the sculptures in the yard 
the orlemans married 18 years have no intention of selling the

missouris antiabortion law wont 
have a dramatic impact on the availability of abortions in the 
state but both sides say the supreme courts decision upholding the 
law has farreaching potential 
i think it will not only save the unborn child but also save 
the women who were being exploited thats been the bottom line 
goal said lou defeo of the missouri catholic conference who 
helped write the 1986 missouri law 
but defeo acknowledged if a woman really wants an abortion in 
missouri she can get it 
on monday the us supreme court upheld key provisions of the 
missouri law that prohibits public hospitals from performing 
abortions and bans the use of tax dollars for counseling or 
encouraging women about abortion it also requires doctors to test 
for the viability of a fetus after 20 weeks 
the immediate impact will not be all that substantial said 
state attorney general william webster who argued the case before 
the court 
he noted that most abortions in missouri are performed in private 
clinics not public ones affected by the ruling 
state health officials said that of the 17382 abortions 
performed in missouri last year only 90 were performed in public 
hospitals 
i think the real significance is not short term but long 
term webster said predicting that states will pass a second 
generation of laws that regulate abortions 
supporters of abortion rights called the ruling a devastating 
setback that will prompt further efforts to outlaw abortions they 
said the impact on missouri will fall hardest on poor women 
mary bryant a planned parenthood lobbyist who fought the law 
said she expected an avalanche of restrictive legislation 
introduced in missouri and other states 
bryant said the laws requirement for viability testing is cruel 
because most women who have abortions after the first trimester are 
poor and young during the first few months some dont know what is 
happening to them she said 
but defeo said the missouri law will stop second trimester 
abortions for women and by doctors who had been hedging on the 
truth and performing an abortion on a viable child as if it werent 
a viable child 
gov john ashcroft a staunch antiabortionist said he would 
appoint a task force to study how the state could further restrict 
abortions 
asked if he would appoint any prochoice advocates ashcroft 
said it would not be appropriate to have groups that recommend 
abortion on the panel 
webster said two public hospitals will have to stop performing 
abortions truman medical center in kansas city and the university 
of missouri hospital and clinics in columbia 
dr james mongan executive director of the 360bed truman 
medical center said the hospital will stop performing abortions 
which are paid for by the patient abortions in missouri have not 
been financed with public money since the mid1970s 
officials at university of missouri said their doctors also will 
stop performing abortions 
the executive director of reproductive heath services the 
private st louis clinic that challenged the law said her clinic 
will continue to provide all choices to women regardless of their 
ability to pay 
this is a tragedy that will affect mostly lowincome 
women said bj isaacsonjones i am filled with grief rage 
and bitter disappointment 
the cost of abortions for lowincome women at the private clinic 
is determined on a sliding scale the standard fee for 
firsttrimester abortions is 260 
judith widdicombe founder of the clinic called the decision an 
outrage 
theres a movement in this country that will not tolerate this 
it will become our vietnam of the 1990s she said 
their goal is no abortions widdicombe said next will come 
birth control

the bush administration should create a weapons

conflicts of interest in purchasing weapons a study suggests 
the study was released monday by ralph naders center for study 
of responsive law 
the study cited varying reasons for the pentagons weapons 
problems including overreliance on new technologies insufficient 
testing inadequate competition and a revolving door between the 
pentagon procurement system and private defense contractors 
it also blamed members of congress for judging new weapons 
projects on the potential economic payoff for their own state or

mr magoo and breezy spirit behind the shipwrecked millionaire 
of gilligans island has died at age 76 
backus whose career in radio film and television spanned more 
than half a century died monday from pneumonia he had suffered 
from parkinsons disease for many years 
the actor who played the fabulously wealthy thurston howell iii 
on televisions gilligans island also was featured in dozens of 
motion pictures 
one of his most memorable roles was that of james deans 
ineffectual father in rebel without a cause it took a character 
actor with presence to don an apron and wheedle dean about his 
adolescent traumas 
backus kept his sense of humor despite his ill health in recent 
years according to alan hale who played the burly skipper of the 
minnow on gilligans island 
he certainly still had that wonderful sense of humor hale 
said you could see it in his eyes 
backus had been undergoing treatment for pneumonia since june 13

i used to do benefits and id come home with whatever symptoms 
went with the disease i was benefiting backus quipped in an

when they told me i had parkinsons i read a magazine article 
on it and overnight i had every symptom known to man i became an 
authority on it

his most outstanding qualities according to members of the cast of 
the popular 1960s television series about seven stranded castaways 
shipwrecked with nothing to do but dream up ridiculous rescue 
schemes 
he was always up said bob denver who played gilligan the

said that while shooting the pilot for gilligans island in 
hawaii backus would often come down from his room in the morning 
without his glasses 
hed say hello to everyone but he didnt know who you were 
hale recalled he really was mr magoo he really couldnt see 
that well 
he was a unique talent said sherwood schwartz creator and 
producer of gilligans island 
i created that thurston howell character with him in mind 
because i dont know anybody else who could play that character the 
way jim did 
on the series still popular in syndication backus character 
was adapted from his hubet updyke the worlds richest man on the 
alan young radio show of the 1940s

the repairrelated delays that caused 
hundreds of wouldbe passengers to cancel trips on two orion air 
flights cast unfavorable light on an airline that has come under 
fire in recent years 
on sunday 167 passengers in manchester england got refunds 
when they refused to travel to florida on an orion jumbo jet delayed 
for two days by three mechanical problems said roy edwards manager 
of the manchester airport the incident came four days after 53 
british tourists refused to reboard a hawaiibound orion jet after 
it was forced to land in edmonton alberta on a repair stop 
an orion employee reached at the raleigh headquarters monday said 
robert bushman president and chief executive officer was 
unavailable for comment other officials did not return the phone 
call 
orion was involved in a 1988 lawsuit for training nonunion 
pilots in anticipation of a strike at eastern airlines and the 
federal aviation administration fined the airline for 2000 safety 
violations 
eastern was then embroiled in a dispute with its machinists over 
the airlines demand for a 50 million cut in annual labor costs 
orion then the largest operator of jet aircraft for the small 
package industry asked the faa for permission to become a passenger 
carrier to fly some eastern planes in the event of a strike 
eastern and orion entered into a 50 millionayear contract 
calling for orion to hire 400 flight attendants 300 pilots and 100 
mechanics to cover about 10 percent of easterns fleet 
the pact came at a good time for orion which was then phasing 
out a 32 millionayear contract to fly and maintain planes for 
united parcel service of america inc ups which had provided about 
half of orions business decided to fly and maintain its own 
aircraft 
as orion sought faa approval for passenger service an faa 
inspection report said the airline had more than 2000 safety 
infractions from its cargo operation 
the agency listed a shortage of required training records 
inadequate auditing of maintenance facilities poor documentation on 
the qualifications of check pilots who decide on the performance 
of line pilots and incomplete flight operations manuals 
orion officials during congressional hearings said many of the 
concerns stemmed from a misunderstanding about orions methods of 
record keeping and that all of the concerns had been resolved 
in march 1988 the air line pilots association sucessfully sued 
to prevent orion from operating flights for eastern saying such 
subcontracting would violate the unions contract with eastern 
the next month the faa proposed 636200 in fines against orion 
for violations uncovered during inspections of the airline orion 
paid the penalty and officials said all the violations had been 
corrected 
eastern announced in may 1988 that it had canceled its contract 
with orion the cancellation cost eastern about 55 million under a 
provision of the orion contract

the attorney who argued the case that 
legalized abortions and the jane roe she represented said they 
were crushed by the supreme courts abortion decision but pledged to 
fight for the right to choose 
the attorney who opposed them saw mondays ruling upholding 
missouri regulations limiting abortion rights as a sign that roe vs 
wade would be overturned 
attorney sarah weddington who represented jane roe said she had 
expected the high court to only whittle away at its 1973 roe vs 
wade decision that legalized abortions 
i did not expect what they did and that was to chop away at 
that decision said ms weddington 44 
ive invested 20 years of my life in this and now have been 
handed a major defeat 
her former client norma mccorvey a dallas cleaning woman who 
took the pseudonym jane roe in the landmark case said she was angry 
about the high courts ruling 
we will keep fighting so that no woman will ever be maimed or 
killed by an unsafe illegal abortion she told reporters in los 
angeles 
this is a critical time for all prochoice and profamily women 
and men she said we must link arm and arm to protect and 
uphold the right to safe and legal abortion 
nevertheless mccorvey added to the supreme court of the 
united states thank you for not reversing roe vs wade 
jay floyd who as an assistant state attorney general faced ms 
weddington in the supreme court 17 years ago said he was pleased by 
the missouri ruling 
i think ultimately they are going to overrule roe vs wade or 
chip away to where it has no meaning said floyd who has been in 
private practice in the central texas town of llano for the past 10 
years 
floyds old boss at the attorney generals office robert 
flowers agreed 
it appears this decision is sort of a prelude to putting some 
further restrictions on abortion rights said flowers who argued 
the states case before the supreme court in 1972 when the justices 
had oral arguments repeated before issuing roe vs wade 
ms weddington said the issue rests with young adults but she 
pledged to continue to speak out she said abortion supporters must 
lobby their state legislatures 
if people dont really say no were not going to have this 
if they dont lobby their own state legislatures abortion will 
become illegal ms weddington told reporters at texas womans 
university where she is an adjunct professor 
earlier monday mccorvey 41 appeared on the cable news network 
show sonya live in la and said she took mondays ruling very 
personally 
it saddens my heart very deeply to know that poor women are 
once again going to be out there going to backstreet abortions and 
possibly be mutilated and not have the right to choose she said 
in 1969 mccorvey unmarried unemployed and pregnant asked her 
family doctor for an abortion which was illegal in texas her 
doctor refused and she didnt like what she saw at an illegal 
abortion clinic spurring the lawsuit 
by the time the supreme court ruled mccorvey had given birth to 
a daughter and had given the child up for adoption in 1971 she had 
another child whom she also gave up for adoption

industry 
meanwhile the greek tanker that spilled 420000 gallons of 
heating oil off rhode island on june 23 arrived monday evening at a 
new york shipyard for repairs 
aerial inspections showed no oil leaking from the world prodigy 
as it traveled from rhode island to the new york shipyard corp the 
coast guard said 
the crabbing ban covers most of the area affected by a oil spill 
june 24 when the uruguayan tanker presidente rivera ran aground 
just below the state line near claymont dumping 306684 gallons of 
heating oil into the river 
the ban was expected to last about three weeks said roger lucio 
spokesman for the department of natural resources and environmental

a fifth victim has died of injuries suffered in a 
fire at a 10story office building that an investigator warned seven 
years ago was a firetrap 
fire officials said monday their investigation of last weeks 
blaze continues to point to an electrical worker who apparently 
triggered an explosion while changing a fuse the electrician died 
in the blast 
office worker eudora rodgers 48 died monday at piedmont 
hospital she and three other office workers who died succumbed to 
smoke inhalation during the fire more than 30 people were injured 
mona watkins a fellow office employee said ms rodgers had 
guided her to a window before collapsing 
as we were getting close i felt her hand fall away we 
couldnt see each other the smoke was too thick ms watkins said 
acting fire chief tom perrin said a fire inspector examined the 
peachtree 25th building in july 1982 and concluded that a fire could 
be disastrous in the structure which was built in 1962 and had no 
sprinklers 
when he conducted his investigation some years back he felt 
like it was a fire trap perrin said the investigator now a fire 
company lieutenant suggested changes perrin said 
four lives could have been saved if there had been sprinklers 
in there perrin said before ms rodgers died 
the building was renovated in july 1982 but it wasnt known if 
fire code changes were made said deputy chief ad bell sprinkler 
systems have been required in new buildings over eight stories tall 
since 1974 
were still looking at how much renovation was conducted at 
that time and that would determine what type of codes would have to 
be abided by bell said 
perrin said the lieutenant reminded him of the 1982 inspection 
some hours after the fire at the midtown office building the 
lieutenant has since left on vacation and will be questioned further 
when he returns perrin said 
american management co of torrance calif which manages the 
peachtree 25th building referred reporters to a representative in

randall dale adams is suing the producer of the 
thin blue line the movie that helped win his release from 
prison after 12 years and exoneration from a murder conviction 
producer errol morris said he is hurt and upset by the 
lawsuit in which adams is seeking to gain film rights to his life 
story 
district judge felix salazar on monday postponed a hearing on the 
suit because the defendants filed a motion to move the proceedings 
to federal court 
the suit contends that morris lost his rights to adams life 
story in december 1988 when he failed to exercise a twoyear option 
purchased from adams for 10 in december 1986 
an appeals court overturned adams conviction after he served 12 
years in prison following his conviction in the shooting death of 
dallas policeman robert wood adams was freed from prison in march 
and dallas county prosecutors declined to try him again 
i worked very very hard for a number of years to see that 
justice was done in this case and to see that randall adams walked 
out of prison morris said 
the producer said his profits from the film which was not widely 
distributed were nil he said he is still paying off debts from 
the movie 
the simple thing is that when i met randall adams nobody cared 
about the case no one wanted to investigate it no one wanted to 
write about it morris said 
adams 40 is not seeking royalties said his lawyer randy 
schaffer 
he said adams wants a declaration that he owns the right to his 
own life story that would enable him to pursue offers schaffer 
estimated in the neighborhood of six figures 
they think they bought adams lock stock and barrel for 10 
and thats unconscionable schaffer said he is grateful but 
what is he supposed to do hes got offers to do a book and a 
movie 
schaffer said morris has claimed he did exercise the option to 
purchase adams story and has resold the rights to mirimax 
production co also a defendant 
adams reportedly was en route from his home in ohio to houston 
and could not be reached for comment

an unabridged edition of chinas 16thcentury 
pornographic classic the golden lotus has been published after 
being banned for 40 years by the communist government 
the official xinhua news agency reported today that 8000 copies 
of the bawdy tale about a philandering merchant and his six wives 
were printed but said they would be distributed only to professors 
of chinese language and golden lotus researchers 
the report did not say if more printings were planned 
the book was printed from a master copy of the work stored in the 
beijing university library the news agency said it said the book 
contains 200 pictures but did not describe them 
an abridged version of the book was published two years ago but 
censors cut out more than 10000 words on the sexual perambulations 
of the merchant jing xiwen even so more than 10000 copies were 
immediately sold out 
the communist government banned the novel in 1949 because of its 
explicit sexual descriptions 
besides being a tale of sex that far outdoes most modern erotica 
the golden lotus is chinas earliest novel describing the lives 
of ordinary people in believable terms 
it also is the first novel to focus on female characters and the 
first book to be written in the vernacular

telecom australia said today that it 
had accidentally included dozens of unlisted numbers in the 1989 
melbourne phone book it said the error could endanger some 
subscribers 
an unknown number of such numbers and the addresses of those 
subscribers were included in the directory telecom white pages 
manager kevin brennan said 
he expressed concern for people who following marriage breakups 
and domestic troubles did not want their numbers and addresses 
published 
telecom will consider offering certain individuals security 
protection if their cases warrant it he said 
we knew there was a problem in april but printing had already 
begun and we had no way of identifying those affected brennan 
said the mistake occured when information was transferred from an 
old data base 
the publication of the phone numbers can be easily rectified by 
simply giving subscribers a new number but unfortunately the 
release of addresses is a problem 
victorian state police association spokesman brian harding said 
the matter was of great concern to his members 
we take violent exception to it and will be complaining 
vociferously people performing public duties and in particular 
the police are vulnerable to people with vindictive dispositions

suspected communist rebels today 
killed the police chief of the philippines major financial center 
in an escalation of street violence sweeping the capital area 
police said 
col herminio taylo 54 police chief of makati had just 
finished jogging and was buying fruit in a public market when two 
assassins opened fire with 45caliber pistols police said he died 
an hour later in a hospital 
police sgt lydio zeta quoted witnesses as saying the gunmen 
shouted we are npas referring to the rebel new peoples army 
and warned bystanders not to interfere they fled in a commandeered 
passenger jeep after taking taylos pistol zeta said 
makati a twin city of manila with a population of about 440000 
is the countrys major banking and financial center and is also the 
home of numerous foreign embassies 
taylo was the 10th soldier or policeman slain in the manila area 
in the last two weeks the military says communist rebels have 
killed up to 65 soldiers and police in the capital region since 
january 
the new peoples army also claimed responsibility for the april 
21 assassination of us army col james nick rowe who was 
slain on his way to work at the joint us military assistance group 
headquarters in suburban quezon city 
taylo was slain one day after brig gen alexander aguirre 
capital region commander announced formation of a special task 
force to track down rebel assassins in the capital 
president corazon aquino deplored the latest killing but said 
public officials must learn to live with the threat of 
assassination she said the government had provided bodyguards to 
cabinet members who have requested them or who have received death 
threats 
it is really very unfortunate and i do sympathize with the 
family of col taylo said mrs aquino whose husband benigno was 
slain in a political assassination in 1983 and i hope that this 
perhaps could be a reminder to all our people in the military and 
police that they should take necessary precautions to ward off these 
assasination attempts 
national security adviser rafael ileto said the killing of taylo 
showed that every soldier and policeman was a potential target of 
assassination 
this is war and somebody is bound to get hurt in the process 
ileto said im sure all the major unit commanders are doing their 
best not only to protect their men but to counter such acts 
despite the escalating violence mrs aquino said she still plans 
to go ahead with a visit to western europe this month 
mrs aquino leaves saturday for an official visit to west 
germany she will also visit france and belgium before departing 
brussels for home on july 15

the dollar continued its fall against the japanese 
yen today while the tokyo stock exchanges main index edged down 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues lost 4604 
points or 014 percent closing at 3319038 
yoshio shimoyama a dealer at nikko securities said japanese 
investors were reluctant to buy shares amid political uncertainties 
over the july 23 election for the upper house of parliament 
although the nikkei fell certain issues were bought as the 
yens appreciation reassured investors he said trading was 
also more active than yesterday 
first section volume was estimated at 550 million shares up from 
mondays 300 million electrical issues attracted buyers 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 14095 yen down 155 
yen from mondays 14250yen close it opened at 14128 yen and 
fluctuated between 14045 yen and 14150 yen the dollar now has 
fallen 300 yen in two trading days 
the dollar was being sold on a number of markets partly due to 
expectations that the united states might ease its monetary policy 
said yoshitsugu hanada a trader with mitsui bank in tokyo 
but the dollarselling drive was weaker today than the one that 
forced the currency rate to fall from 15130 yen a couple of weeks 
ago he said 
the dollar closed at 15130 yen on june 15 but fell 625 yen the 
next day 
hanada said dollarselling for profittaking and reported 
intervention by the bank of japan also helped push the dollar down 
today although investors were avoiding major moves while the new 
york market was closed for the independence day holiday 
the central bank does not comment on its foreign exchange market 
activities 
japanese investors sold the dollar to reduce their 
dollarholding positions because they had bought too much before the 
tokyo metropolitan assembly election hanada said 
investors had been buying dollars out of pessimism over the 
governing liberal democratic partys prospects in sundays voting 
he said 
in the election for 128 seats in the tokyo metropolitan assembly 
the ldp kept only 43 seats a loss of 20 while the japan socialist 
partys strength rose from 12 to 29 seats 
the election was taken as an indicator of how voting would go in 
the july upper house election

the supreme court ruling on abortion sparked angry confrontations 
between prochoice and antiabortion forces across the country and 
one rights activist predicted the issue would become our vietnam 
of the 1990s 
some opponents of mondays decision burned american flags in 
protest a right confirmed by the high court in a ruling last week 
an angry afterwork crowd swelled a prochoice rally of more 
than 2000 outside san franciscos federal building after a 
candlelight vigil about 200 protesters broke off from the larger 
group and marched down van ness avenue to the mission district 
knocking over garbage cans and newspapers stands 
outside the historic mission dolores they were surrounded by 
about 50 riot police one arrest was reported 
lindsay comy of san franciscos womens choice clinic offered to 
teach women to perform safe abortions if the operation is outlawed 
in california 
we will not allow technology to be denied us she said 
in st louis judith widdecombe founder of the clinic involved 
in the 54 court decision said the ruling would not be tolerated by 
women 
it will become our vietnam of the 1990s she said 
flags were burned at protests in chicago and other cities 
im doing this because i want to show how angry i am said 
ela thier as she held a match above a lighter fluidsoaked flag in 
rochester ny i believe that the supreme court has violated my 
basic human rights 
it is amazing to me that we can burn the flag but yet we dont 
have control over our bodies said elyce helford who took part in 
a flagburning at a rally of 300 prochoice advocates in iowa city 
iowa 
mondays ruling upheld key provisions of the missouri law that 
prohibits public hospitals from performing abortions and bans the 
use of tax dollars for counseling or encouraging women about 
abortion it also requires doctors to test for the viability of a 
fetus after 20 weeks 
attorney sarah weddington who represented jane roe in the 1973 
decision that legalized abortions saw the ruling as a sign that roe 
vs wade would be overturned 
ive invested 20 years of my life in this and now have been 
handed a major defeat she said 
about 40 antiabortion demonstrators prayed and picketed outside 
a womens clinic in philadelphia as they claimed victory in the 
supreme court ruling a lone abortionrights advocate kathryn 
grumman faced the protesters with an american flag a coat hanger 
and a cross on a neckchain

provide the philippines with 658 million in economic assistance in 
fiscal 1990 
the convening of the meeting symbolizes a significant expansion 
in the sharing of responsibility for the philippines wellbeing 
previously the united states accounted for the bulk of foreign 
aid to the its former colony but japan is now the largest donor 
baker said that despite significant economic growth in recent 
years in the philippines enormous problems of poverty and 
development persist problems that challenge us all to this very 
special effort 
average incomes are still well below their 1981 levels he said 
the political upheavals of the mid1980s which drove out the 
government of ferdinand marcos devastated the filipino economy 
in addition the government of president corazon aquino is 
battling a 20yearold communist insurgency 
the theory behind the new initiative is that the philippines will 
be able to achieve its economic potential only through a coordinated 
effort in which outside capital economic reform and an improved 
private investment climate all have key roles 
baker arrived in tokyo at a time of renewed political crisis in 
japan brought on by electoral setbacks suffered by the governing 
liberal democrats and allegations that prime minister sosuke uno has 
kept several paid mistresses 
en route here baker declined comment on unos problems saying 
the united states must studiously avoid involvement in japans 
internal political affairs 
baker and uno were to have dinner tonight 
after a daylong stay in tokyo baker heads for brunei where he 
is to meet with colleagues from the sixnation association of 
southeast asian nations 
the talks are to focus on ways to promote an accord among rival 
factions in cambodia once the vietnamese complete the scheduled 
withdrawal of their forces in september

the official writers union has voted to reinstate 
alexander solzhenitsyn the dissident chronicler of stalinist terror 
who was expelled from the soviet union in 1974 a newspaper said 
today 
literaturnaya gazeta the weekly newspaper of the union of soviet 
writers said that the groups 26member secretariat voted to revoke 
what it called his wrongful 1969 expulsion

socialist democracy the writers union also urged the government 
to restore his citizenship literaturnaya gazeta said 
the 168word article which appeared midway down the front page 
did not say when the union took its action 
the restoration follows the report in april that the leading 
soviet literary journal novy mir will publish excerpts of 
solzhenitsyns major work the gulag archipelago by years end 
the work chronicles life in soviet labor camps mostly under 
dictator josef stalin solzhenitzyn was freed from the camps after 
stalins death in 1953 
the works of solzhenitsyn who won the nobel prize for literature 
in 1970 have not been published in his homeland since novy mir 
carried his short novel one day in the life of ivan denisovich 
in november 1962 during a cultural thaw under nikita s khrushchev 
the thaw ended shortly thereafter and solzhenitsyns works were 
banned 
although soviet literary officials have authorized publication of 
part of gulag it is not clear whether they will clear portions 
of the book blaming the founder of soviet state vladimir lenin for 
initiating terror in the soviet union 
solzhenitsyn lives with his family in seclusion in cavendish vt

mikhail s gorbachev beset at home by ethnic strife 
and economic woes today began an official visit to france that one 
top aide hinted could be the occasion for another dramatic kremlin 
disarmament proposal 
you know that mr gorbachev never comes emptyhanded vadim 
zagladin a member of the soviet communist partys policymaking 
central committee told reporters on the eve of the soviet 
presidents arrival in paris 
the 58yearold gorbachev and his wife raisa left their special 
ilyushin62 jetliner at paris orly airport with broad smiles on 
their faces they were greeted by socialist president francois 
mitterrand and his wife danielle 
everyone in france is interested in you personally and in your 
actions mitterrand told gorbachev and his wife who was dressed 
in a stylish green suit and black blouse 
both leaders said they would seek to deepen frenchsoviet 
relations during gorbachevs stay the soviet people highly value 
our ties of friendship and cooperation gorbachev told mitterrand 
the mitterrands were to play host to the gorbachevs at an 
official luncheon held at the elysee the french presidential 
palace and then the two heads of state were to begin about 15 hours 
of talks 
during his threeday visit his second to france as soviet 
leader gorbachev is also to meet with premier michel rocard and the 
secretary general of the french communist party georges marchais 
he will also preside over the signing of 21 bilateral accords on 
topics ranging from cooperation in space to creation of a 
sovietbased joint venture to build highdefinition television sets 
both gorbachevs also planned to greet parisians at the place de 
la bastille a square in eastern paris where 200 years ago this 
month a mob stormed a royal prison liberated the inmates and 
massacred the warden 
that assault on july 14 1789 is celebrated as the debut of the 
french revolution marxistleninist doctrine considers the french 
revolution as an event in the history of world class struggle on a 
par with the 1917 bolshevik revolution that brought the communists 
to power in russia 
gorbachev has often used his foreign trips to announce unilateral 
soviet disarmament measures or kremlin arms reduction proposals 
on his first visit to france in october 1985 he called for both 
superpowers to slash their nuclear arsenals by 50 percent an idea 
currently being negotiated by americans and soviets in geneva 
at the time gorbachev invited france and britain to begin direct 
discussions with the soviets on their nuclear forces 
mitterrand refused and the french have since said the united 
states and soviet union must cut their far larger nuclear arsenals 
before the french contemplate reductions in their nuclear force 
gorbachev who has proposed a negotiated end to all nuclear arms 
by the year 2000 is now ready to heed that reasoning but he still 
seeks frances commitment to eventual nuclear weapons cuts soviet 
official andrei grachev said monday 
grachev deputy chief of the soviet communist party central 
committees international department told the french radio network 
franceinter in an interview 
mr gorbachev can accept the french argument according to which 
france awaits serious reductions by the superpowers to begin its 
involvement in the disarmament process while expecting france to 
finally join us 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement said pointedly monday 
that the overarmed powers must first disarm and then we can 
talk 
neither the french nor the soviets expect the popular fervor for 
the soviet leader in france that he encountered on his last trip to 
a western country west germany on june 1215 
french moscowwatcher michel tatu wrote in the daily le monde 
that the french for one thing are much more pessimistic about the 
chances for success of gorbachevs ambitious reform campaign 
gorbachev flew to france with soviet food supplies at their most 
meager in recent memory and with discontent rising over the lack of 
visible results from his drive for perestroika or economic and 
social restructuring 
explosions of ethnic strife also have occurred most recently in 
the central asian republics of kazakhstan and uzbekistan 
on saturday gorbachev made a nationally televised appeal for 
calm 
he is to travel to strasbourg in northeastern france on thursday 
the final day of his visit to address the council of europe an 
assembly of 23 western european democracies founded to promote 
european cooperation 
gorbachev is then to fly to bucharest romania for the annual 
summit of the warsaw pact the sovietled military alliance in 
eastern europe

former hungarian leader janos kadar was 
in critical condition after he was hospitalized with pneumonia as 
well as breathing and circulatory problems a radio report said 
today 
communist party chairman rezso nyers and general secretary karoly 
grosz visited him in the hospital today radio kossuth reported 
the brief report said kadars condition had turned critical but 
gave no details party spokesman emil kimmel said a medical report 
would be issued later today 
kadar 77 was stripped of all his party posts in may after he 
was reported gravely ill 
he was named honorary chairman of the ruling hungarian socialist 
workers party in may 1988 after grosz replaced him as party leader 
kadar held that post for 32 years 
since losing the party leadership kadar has seen his political 
legacy increasingly questioned 
after guiding hungary to relative prosperity and tolerance by the 
1970s he was seen as an obstacle to political and economic reform 
in the 1980s 
he has not been seen in public since april when participants at 
a communist central committee meeting said he gave a long rambling 
speech 
in recent interviews kadar was quoted as saying the fate of imre 
nagy and other leaders of the 1956 hungarian revolt was his 
personal tragedy 
kadar came to power after soviet troops and tanks crushed the 
uprising and nagy and his associates were executed on charges of 
high treason in 1958 after a stalinist show trial 
nagy and other uprising leaders were honored as national martyrs 
at a reburial ceremony june 16 after what amounted to a political 
rehabilitation of nagy and a reevaluation of the uprising

the man accused of killing prime 
minister olof palme refused to answer further questions in court 
today charging that prosecutors were unfairly trying to convict him 
it does not matter what questions you ask so i will not answer 
your questions said christer pettersson a 42yearold swede 
pettersson has denied killing palme a fourterm prime minister 
who was assassinated on feb 28 1986 
looking pale and tired pettersson interrupted when prosecutor 
anders helin was about to start questioning him for a second time 
pettersson testified on the opening day of the trial in stockholm 
district court on june 5 
you have done everything to cast doubt on witnesses supporting 
my case imagine if you had carried out such careful investigations 
with the other witnesses pettersson said 
he was apparently referring to tough crossexamination monday of 
a defense witness who supported his alibi that he was in a train 
station 18 miles away at the time of the shooting 
the court cannot force a defendant to testify 
palmes widow lisbeth has identified pettersson as the man she 
saw rush away after her husband was shot while the couple walked 
home from a downtown movie 
earlier today defense attorney arne liljeros tried to discredit 
mrs palmes testimony by questioning stig engstrom one of the 
first bystanders to rush up to the dying palme 
engstrom an insurance company employee said mrs palme appeared 
confused and disoriented but i was able to talk to her 
the prosecutors also showed a fiveminute videotape of police 
surveillance of pettersson before his arrest in december it showed 
him walking with a limp matching mrs palmes initial account of 
the man she saw escaping 
mrs palme has said she never saw pettersson holding a gun 
the prosecutors have built their case around her identification 
and other witnesses who said they saw pettersson nearby the murder 
weapon has not been found and no clear motive has been established 
pettersson has a history of violent crime and drug abuse 
final arguments were scheduled to start thursday

the united church of christ wraps up its 
17th general synod today having elected a new president and chosen a 
new home 
the 18 millionmember church voted to move its headquarters to 
cleveland from new york city to get closer to its membership base 
it also elected the rev paul h sherry of chicago over the rev 
yvonne delk of union city nj 
sherry said his goal is to maintain the denominations 
theological integrity 
we are a church we are not a political party or social service 
organization he said 
nonetheless the 700plus delegates were to end the sixday synod 
today with votes on measures including a statement criticizing 
treatment of the poor in the united states 
on monday the ucc considered one of the most liberal of the 
mainline denominations resolved by acclamation to deplore mondays 
us supreme court ruling that restricted the right to an abortion 
historically the united church of christ has stood for womens 
rights particularly freedom of choice in abortion said rev 
avery post the retiring president 
the vote to move caused a rift between those who wanted to get 
closer to the uccs membership base and those who feared diminishing 
the 32yearold denominations role in the ecumenical community 
largely based in new york 
delegates voted 448294 for the move which supporters said would 
free more of its money for missions by saving millions of dollars in 
rent and other costs 
presbyterian and lutheran denominations also have left new york 
city in the past two years 
delk if elected would have become the first woman and first 
black to lead a major us denomination the election was the first 
contest for a ucc executive post in 20 years the vote tally was not 
disclosed 
the ucc president has no doctrinal power over the denominations 
members but the position is widely viewed as an important 
theological platform 
the denomination was formed in the 1957 merger of the 
congregational christian churches and the evangelical and reformed 
church in cleveland

druse militiamen lifted a 16week land 
siege of lebanons christianheld region today after syrian gunners 
and lebanese christian forces traded rocket and artillery fire that 
killed one person 
syrian troops fired a barrage of howitzers early today in 
maintaining its sea blockade of the christian enclave a local 
newspaper reported syria is tightening that blockade 
lifting the land siege appears to be a guarded response to an 
iraqi offer sunday to halt arms shipments to the christians if syria 
stops besieging them iraq syrias main arab rival is the main 
backer of gen michel aoun who leads the christian cabinet 
beirut international airport which moslem leaders said would 
reopen at noon was not ready to receive aircraft repair crews 
worked on runways and terminals damaged by shellfire and rockets 
police said one person was killed and five were wounded in 
shelling that stopped 35 minutes before beiruts museum crossing and 
the madfoun gateway linking the christian region with 
syrianpoliced north lebanon reopened around midday 
hundreds of pedestrians and motorists flooded the museum crossing 
after moslem troops lifted containers and knocked down earthmounds 
blocking the gateway at the green line dividing beirut into moslem 
and christian sectors 
many travelers some carrying food and other supplies cried for 
joy as moslem units of the lebanese army ushered them across to 
christian east beirut 
they didnt take away the vegetables this is the first time in 
more than three months they allow me to carry vegetables to east 
beirut cried one woman her eyes brimming with tears 
troops frisked pedestrians and searched cars for weapons 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the moslem cabinet in 
the dual government said lifting the land siege and reopening the 
airport are a basic step toward resolving the crisis 
there was no comment on todays developments from aoun 
he met with the ambassadors of the united states france and 
britain to complain about the sea blockade and was to meet the 
chinese and soviet envoys later today 
more than 1 million christians were trapped by the blockade and 
siege by police count 397 people have been killed and 1538 
wounded since march 8 when druse fighters retaliated against aouns 
blockading of illegal ports run by them and other syrianbacked 
moslem militias 
syrian troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate backed the druse militiamen of warlord walid jumblatt and 
joined the battle to ensure the blockade 
aoun has pledged to oust the syrian troops from lebanon but he 
has only about 20000 fighters while syria deploys 40000 troops in 
the country and can call on allied militias that command another 
40000 fighters 
the prestigious daily newspaper annahar today said syria has 
tightened its sea blockade it said a gunboat on monday intercepted 
a ship carrying passengers and cargo from south lebanon to the 
northern port of jounieh 
a syrian officer boarded the ship and searched it for weapons 
when he found only food supplies and passengers the officer warned 
the vessels egyptian captain not to use the route again the

a thousand firefighters today 
battled a blaze roaring through canyons dotted with expensive homes 
the flames jumped from the brush to rooftops burning 29 houses and 
forcing out 500 people 
the firefighters summoned from throughout southern california 
worked into a sweltering independence day to control the 1500acre 
fire as it edged toward ridgetop homes in the turnbull canyon area 
20 miles from downtown los angeles 
fires also burned monday in eastern utah near dinosaur national 
monument in northwestern colorado and in new mexico where a 
2500acre blaze near diamond peak in the gila national forest raged 
out of control 
the california fire began in an uninhabited remote brushy area 
and spread quickly to areas with homes valued at 300000 to more 
than 1 million 
firefighters hoped to surround the blaze by late today said los 
angeles county fire department inspector ken sotro ten homes were 
destroyed and 19 sustained major damage and three firefighters 
suffered minor injuries he said 
high humidity and relatively cool weather overnight helped 
firefighters gain ground sotro said but the fourth of july 
forecast for possibly high winds and temperatures over 100 degrees 
worried firefighters after dawn 
the fire was believed to have been caused by people fire 
inspector john lenihan said 
every little canyon is a finger of fire he said adding that 
the terrain made the fire extremely difficult to surround 
about 500 people arrived at los altos high school which was 
converted into an evacuation center most signed in to let 
authorities know they escaped unharmed and then moved on to stay 
with friends or at nearby motels 
some evacuees said the fire forced them out of their homes so 
quickly they had to leave their possessions behind 
they gave me five seconds i got nothing said joan campbell 
sharon and dick hartman waited out the blaze near the fire 
command post sitting beside a van loaded with four caged birds two 
dogs and household items what we grabbed were animals and 
heirlooms said mrs hartman 
the fire jumped through steep brushfilled canyons between the 
ridgetop homes lenihan said 
a black plume of smoke several thousand feet high could be seen 
for at least 20 miles neighborhood streets were abandoned and 
several residents turned on lawn sprinklers before fleeing the few 
roads to the area were closed 
in utah crews worked to close lines around brush fires caused by 
lightning the fires scorched more than 635 acres in two uintah 
basin forests and a third blaze broke out monday in the upper 
reaches of uinta canyon 20 miles north of roosevelt 
the largest of several fires in colorado the box canyon fire in 
the northwest corner of the state had spread by monday to 1520 
acres of federal bureau of land management property south of 
dinosaur national monument 
the fire was sparked by lightning thursday and was declared near 
containment at 190 acres early sunday but it erupted again and 
reached 720 acres because of extremely dry conditions and rough 
terrain 
fire danger was high across the state monday 
its so dry one firecracker will be enough said kris 
damsgaard of the us forest service 
a 2500acre blaze near diamond peak in the gila national forest 
in new mexico burned out of control firefighters managed to get a 
2840acre fire southwest of roswell under control monday 
nearly 550 firefighters along with five air tankers and eight 
helicopters battled the divide fire which straddles the 
continental divide at the 9000foot level of diamond peak 
it is burning out of control said us forest service 
spokesman ron henderson but if the winds lay down we can get a 
hold of it within the next couple days thats our biggest enemy

solidarity supporters claim 161 seats in the 460member sejm and 
98 seats in a new 100member senate that was to meet later today 
electing a speaker was the first order of business and 
sociologist mikolaj kozakiewicz of the peasant party met opposition 
although no other candidates ran he was elected by 293 to 81 with 
60 absentions 
i will perform this function not bow before the mighty 
rulers ideologies or institutions kozakiewicz told the chamber 
three vice marshals were elected from the communist party the 
democratic party and the opposition 
kozakiewicz recommended the chamber discuss a new government once 
it elects a president the president names a prime minister who 
forms a government 
solidarity deputy jacek kuron harshly criticized the government 
of prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski saying its chaotic 
policy caused only social unrest 
there is an intense political struggle over who will be elected 
in two days when the sejm and senate meet together 
jaruzelski said friday he did not want the post and instead 
recommended interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak but jaruzelski 
was believed to be reconsidering this week at the urging of some 
party members 
the key issue appeared to be whether jaruzelski would survive a 
vote in the national assembly where the communist coalition holds 
300 of 560 seats 
solidarity lawmakers have said they will vote against him and it 
is uncertain how many votes jaruzelski can count on within his own 
coalition 
he acknowledged last week that he remains unpopular for imposing 
martial law and crushing solidarity the east blocs first 
independent labor movement in december 1981 the group was 
relegalized earlier this year 
a leading opposition theorist proposed monday that solidarity 
support a communist candidate for president in exchange for a union 
candidate taking the prime ministers office and forming the next 
government 
the proposal by adam michnik a historian and essayist in the 
oppositions election gazette drew no immediate response from 
authorities 
the presidential election is timed to take place before president 
bush arrives in poland on sunday for a threeday visit 
after bush leaves the legislators must choose a prime minister 
and appoint the government to deal with skyrocketing inflation and 
severe consumer shortages 
the polish legislature has not had such an opposition presence 
since 1947 when the commmunists consolidated power through 
intimidation forcing opposition leader stanislaw mikolayczyk into 
exile 
the new political arrangement stems from an agreement in april 
between communist authorities and the solidarityled opposition 
that pact allowed the lifting of the sevenyear ban on 
solidarity provided for the countrys freest elections of the 
postwar period and restored the senate and presidency

the fight over abortion called our vietnam 
of the 1990s by one partisan returns to 50 state legislatures 
with new intensity sparked by the latest supreme court ruling 
but the high courts role in the deeply divisive legal and 
political struggle is far from over 
ending its 198889 term monday the court cut back sharply on 
womens constitutional right to abortion but it stopped short of 
letting states outlaw most abortions 
the justices also said that sometime in 1990 they will decide 
three new disputes a move that could lead them to scrap the 
courts 1973 decision in roe vs wade legalizing abortion 
that would let states regulate abortion more stringently or even 
outlaw it 
i think clearly the supreme court seems to be authorizing the 
states to apply restrictive language and legislation to the 
decision and i think were going to see some states become quite 
restrictive house speaker thomas s foley dwash said today on 
cbs this morning 
i think the debate will heat up rather dramatically if both 
sides attempt to reach legislative decisions on the state level 
he said 
this decision indicates that roes days are numbered said 
randall terry of the antiabortion group operation rescue 
kate michelman of the national abortion rights action league 
said womens lives hang by a thread and the justices handed 
politicians a pair of scissors 
activists for both sides pledged renewed efforts to lobby state 
legislators and make abortion the major issue in state and local 
elections 
every person who stands for election in this country is going 
to have to answer said molly yard president of the national 
organization for women 
douglas johnson of the national right to life committee called 
the decision an invitation to the states to begin to restore 
protection to unborn children he added im sure that a number 
of legislatures will accept the invitation 
judith widdicombe founder of the missouri abortion clinic 
involved in the high court ruling said this is the beginning of 
a war it will become our vietnam of the 1990s 
in its closestwatched case of the decade the court gave states 
greater power to make abortions harder to get 
the justices by 54 votes restored key provisions of a missouri 
abortion law allowing it and all other states to ban any public 
employee from helping perform an abortion and to ban abortions in 
all public hospitals even when patients are willing to pay for them 
the court also ruled states may require doctors to determine 
through various tests whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is 
viable or capable of surviving outside the womb missouri and 
many states make it a crime to abort a viable fetus but the 1973 
decision had drawn the viability line at 24 weeks 
it appears now that a clearcut court majority chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices byron r white anthony m 
kennedy antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor believe roe vs 
wade was wrongly decided 
if not for oconnors reluctance for procedural reasons the 1973 
landmark essentially would have been swept away in the missouri case 
oconnor the courts only woman will cast the key vote in next 
terms abortion showdown when the court could for the first time in 
over 200 years take away a constitutional right it had created 
if so the word will come in a case from illinois ohio or 
minnesota the court agreed to study all three after returning from 
its threemonth summer recess on the first monday in october 
the illinois case stems from that states unsuccessful attempt to 
enforce extensive regulations on abortion clinics 
a federal trial judge and the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
said the illinois regulations would have forced abortion clinics to 
become the functional equivalent of small hospitals for no valid 
purpose 
the invalidated ohio abortion law generally required doctors to 
notify a parent of young unmarried girls before performing 
abortions 
lower courts said the law impermissibly interfered with some 
girls constitutional right to seek an abortion 
the law would have required any doctor asked to perform an 
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girls 
parents or perhaps some other family member at least 24 hours before 
the operation 
young girls could seek to bypass parental notification by seeking 
the permission of a state judge to have an abortion 
the minnesota law requires some girls to tell both parents at 
least 48 hours before having an abortion it was upheld by a federal 
appeals court but enforcement was stayed pending review by the 
nations highest court 
the 1981 law requires unmarried girls under 18 and still living 
with a parent to provide written notice to both parents if 
possible before obtaining an abortion 
the law also imposed a 48hour waiting period and made doctors 
who perform abortions criminally liable for violations

us diplomats today marked independence day 
behind the iron bars of their embassy compound singing america 
the beautiful and holding a flag ceremony while chinese guards 
with automatic weapons patrolled outside 
chinese security officials said today they had arrested a 
taiwanese journalist and charged him with sheltering one of the 
nations mostwanted student leaders of the recently crushed 
prodemocracy movement 
two protest leaders who escaped today announced the establishment 
of an organization to carry on their fight for a freer china 
student leader wuer kaixi and intellectual yan jiaqi made their 
comments in a statement seen in hong kong and paris 
in the british colony of hong kong which reverts to chinese rule 
in 1997 thousands of residents protested the crackdown and 
britains refusal to offer refuge to hong kongs 57 million people 
premier li peng who ordered the crackdown was portrayed on

in beijing both the us and australian embassies were being 
watched carefully by chinese soldiers chinas leading dissident 
fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian are being sheltered at the 
american embassy 
the australian embassy has denied rumors that a student who 
helped lead the prodemocracy protests is hiding there 
foreign embassies in beijing always are guarded by chinese 
police but those around the us and australian embassies carried 
automatic weapons and were reinforced by extra uniformed and 
plainclothes officers 
during past july 4 celebrations large receptions were held at 
the us embassy and chinese officials were invited today only 
embassy staff were invited to the brief flag ceremony diplomats 
gathered to sing america the beautiful 
several dozen chinese bicycling past the embassy paused to watch 
but the guards with guns pointed moved them along

monday that chinese soldiers intentionally fired on diplomats 
apartments june 7 during a purported search for a sniper

said several apartments were hit with bullets 
chinese police say they had come under fire from snipers and were 
firing in selfdefense the official xinhua news agency called the 
us allegation a lie

a freer society official chinese reports say about 300 people died 
in the june 34 crackdown including many soldiers and police

and helping and hiding him 
guan ping director of the ministrys foreign affairs office met 
today with two other taiwanese reporters and announced the charges 
one of the two antonio jiang said he refused to let them see huang 
the charges stemmed from huangs reported meeting sunday with 
student leader wang dan who is one of the most wanted fugitives in 
china huang was arrested monday 
jiang said guan refused to say where wang was police and city 
officials have said they dont know if wang is under arrest 
wuer and yan the two students who escaped china are believed 
hiding in paris french television today showed a videotape of them

president bush spending a private 
independence day with his family received a call from indian prime 
minister rajiv gandhi this morning wishing him a happy holiday the 
white house said 
gandhi told him the fourth of july is an important day for all 
democracies and said the us founding fathers had a great impact on 
the indian constitution according to a news release issued by 
bushs staff at the vacationing white house in maine 
the president and mrs bush pitched in to clean up debris from 
the massive fireworks display over their home monday night the 
white house said 
bush planned to spend most of the day at the family compound at 
walkers point playing tennis and boating he also was reviewing 
briefing materials for his upcoming trip to europe said press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
the president is preparing for his visit to poland by staking out 
a position likely to go over well there a call for the soviet 
union to withdraw its troops from the east bloc nation 
bush who leaves sunday for a stop in poland on his way to the 
european economic summit said the soviets should pull out of poland 
and take an historic opportunity to help end the postwar division 
in europe 
on another matter the white house said bush called turkish 
premier turgut ozal monday to express his concern about the 
maltreatment and forced expulsion of the turkish ethnic minorities 
from bulgaria 
the statement gave no further details of the presidents 
conversation with ozal whose office announced the phone call monday 
since he will be traveling next week bush on monday called king 
hassan of morocco to express his regards on the kings 60th 
birthday which falls during that time 
bush told the king the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
admiral william crowe will represent the united states at the 
kings birthday celebrations crowe announced on sunday that he will 
resign from the military in september and bush told reporters he 
wished crowe had decided to stay on as chairman 
the white house staff released a text monday of bushs interview 
with a group of polish reporters in which bush made the proposal on 
soviet troops the interview on friday marked the first time he has 
called for a total pullout 
the news came on a day when bush also issued a statement 
applauding the supreme courts decision opening the door to more 
restrictions on abortions 
bush said he welcomed the courts move to let states tackle the 
issue of how they want to limit abortion the court appears to 
have begun to restore to the people the ability to protect the 
unborn he said 
he called further for the reversal of the 1973 roe vs wade 
decision that legalized abortion a ruling the court stopped short 
of overturning monday 
bush was on the golf course monday when his staff released the 
statement and he told reporters with him he had very strong 
feelings on the subject 
bushs chief of staff john sununu told reporters bush still 
backs a constitutional amendment against abortion and that he will 
focus his attention on that rather than getting involved in state 
legislative fights over abortion where he might be seen as meddling 
in state affairs 
later monday night bush got an early start on independence day 
festivities by hosting a lavish fireworks show for neighbors with 
the explosions cascading over his family compound at walkers point 
bush had some 200 family and friends at the complex for the show 
which the white house said was funded by an anonymous donor 
bush told the polish reporters he hopes to deliver his promised 
economic incentives to poland as a reward for its recent steps 
toward democracy but he said we need to know that youre going 
to be able to not only continue existing reforms but expand on 
reforms so that the economic system that works will be given a 
chance to work unfettered 
soviet troop withdrawal would be a good move he said because 
there is no danger at all of an invasion of poland from the 
west and thus no need for large conventional forces 
very candidly i would like to see soviet troops out 
bush said

meter readers have been in the doghouse 
since pet owners discovered the utility keeps a list of homes with 
hostile hounds 
to help employees avoid dog bites the green bay water utility 
has kept track of dangerous yards for almost 40 years two months 
ago the city began using the list to notify homes their dogs had to 
be licensed 
some people who received the letters accused the utilitys three 
meter readers of spying 
utility office manager keith mueller said someone telephoned and 
demanded whats next are you going to watch to make sure i 
control my noxious weeds 
another caller declared youre dead meat 
someone mailed a water payment in an envelope addressed dog 
catchers inc 
about 200 of the people who got letters replied they did not own 
dogs 
mueller said that when the mayors office requested the list the 
utility was not immediately aware why the list is programmed into 
handheld computers that meter readers consult before venturing onto 
a property 
use of the list has paid off since notices were mailed at the 
end of april license fees received by the city this year went from 
less than 5400 to more than 19500 
mueller said the complaints have tailed off and he hopes it 
stays that way 
no pun intended but let a sleeping dog lie he said

a citys attempt to regulate the location of 
newsracks selling a nonobscene sex newspaper was struck down by a 
state appeals court 
the court rejected the city of alamedas argument that the 
spectator was entitled to no more legal protection than adult 
theaters or bookstores which can be kept away from residential 
areas and schools through zoning ordinances 
newsracks are not the same as adult bookstores and theaters 
justice donald king said in the 30 opinion monday 
there are no flashing lights or gaudy displays there is no 
steady stream of lingering customers the product is not intended to 
be consumed at the site of its purchase king wrote 
the judge said the citys restrictions were based solely on the 
content of the spectator which has not been found obscene and is 
thus protected by the first amendment 
they dared the courts to obliterate the first amendment and 
lost the gamble said amitai schwartz a lawyer for the tabloid 
chuck corica mayor of the city of 76000 said the city council 
may appeal 
there are very many mothers in alameda concerned about this 
he said we are not attempting to skirt the first amendment not 
saying you cant purchase the spectator just want to make it 
difficult for small children to get hold of it 
alamedas ordinance which was never enforced banned sales of 
sexually oriented material in newsracks within 500 feet of 
residential areas 
upholding a lower court the appeals court said zoning 
restrictions on sexoriented bookstores and theaters are based on 
the harm to the neighborhood 
neither prior cases independent studies nor common sense have 
yet demonstrated that adult newsracks downgrade neighborhoods

nearly 4000 jews left the soviet union in june a 
new rise in emigration that makes the exodus in the first six months 
of 1989 bigger than that in all of 1988 a resettlement agency said 
tuesday 
this year 20162 soviet jews have been allowed to leave the 
country the intergovernmental committee for migration said 
compared with a 1988 total of 20082 the highest outflow since 
1980 
in june 3965 emigres arrived in vienna the secondhighest 
total this year after april of these 89 decided to go to israel 
said committee spokeswoman regina boucault 
only 613 emigrants 3 percent of the total have chosen to 
resettle in israel this year she said most are going to the united 
states 
emigration has soared to twice last years rate a move seen 
partly as a soviet effort to improve ties with israel 
about 300000 soviet jews have emigrated since the resettlement 
program began in 1971 the largest official exodus 51328 was 
recorded in 1979 before the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
chilled eastwest relations 
between 1971 and 1978 more than three quarters of all emigrants 
settled in israel in the past three years the share fell to about 
one quarter before taking a new plunge last year when israel faced 
mounting economic problems and a palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories

charles haughey couldnt win power 
outright in an election and now he cant swallow the prospect of 
sharing it with another party 
so ireland has been without a new government for nearly a week 
and the solution may hinge on a widely shared aversion to yet 
another election 
therell be an election over my dead body says terry leyden 
a lawmaker of haugheys fianna fail party 
haughey was forced to resign last week after failing to win 
reelection by parliament as taoiseach or prime minister 
that left him with two choices call another election or form a 
coalition with another party he rejected both 
the dail or parliament has given him until thursday to produce 
a government instead of overtures of compromise however public 
positions have hardened 
a frontpage cartoon in the irish times on tuesday showed haughey 
preparing to march under defiant banners no surrender and no 
to power sharing 
those as every irish citizen knows are the slogans of northern 
irelands hardline protestants who have no love for haughey or his 
irish republic 
you cannot go on as if an election had never been held and 
ignoring the reality nobody won the election jim kemmy the only 
democratic socialist in the dail told haughey on monday 
in the june 15 election fianna fails strength in the dail fell 
from 80 to 77 seats 
fine gael gained four seats for a total of 55 but its coalition 
partners the progressive democrats fell from 14 to six 
we recognize there is a totally changed situation said 
haughey 
nonetheless he has sought to recreate the preelection 
situation when fianna fail ruled as a minority government with 
support from fine gael and the progressive democrats 
the old partners however demand new terms it was clear to 
anybody with any political sense that a new approach was needed 
said alan dukes fine gaels leader 
dukes offered haughey a 5050 share of cabinet seats in a 
coalition desmond omalley leader of the progressive democrats 
offered his partys six votes exactly the number needed in 
return for cabinet seats 
coalitions dont work haughey said 
although his party won only 44 percent of the popular vote and a 
like proportion of the seats haughey claimed a mandate on the 
grounds that fianna fail got the most votes 
we are fulfilling the democratic wish of the people in seeking 
to form a minority fianna fail government haughey said sunday 
resistance to a coalition runs deep in fianna fail which 
conceives of itself more as a popular movement than a political 
party 
noel dempsey a fianna fail deputy from meath said his 
constituents disliked coalitions and theyre prepared to go to the 
country on the issue 
since forming its first government in 1932 fianna fail has 
dominated irish politics always winning between 42 to 52 percent of 
the vote 
the rivalry between fianna fail and fine gael is old as the civil 
war that their founders fought on opposing sides in 192223 
strains between fianna fail and the progressive democrats 
however are recent and personal omalley was involved in two 
attempts to remove haughey as fianna fail leader and was finally 
expelled from fianna fail in 1985 which makes it doubly irksome for 
haughey to have him at his cabinet table 
we are not in the business of recrimination of settling old 
scores of forcing others to eat their words or political humble 
pie omalley said in the dail monday 
paul mcnulty a fianna fail adviser said a coalition wouldnt 
work because the progressive democrats are a yuppie party while 
fianna fail has its roots firmly planted in the lessprivileged 
sector of irish society 
the democrats he added lacked fianna fails commitment hardly 
mentioned in the election campaign to uniting the irish republic 
and britishruled northern ireland 
although it came second in the election fine gael conceivably 
could form a coalition with the progressive democrats and two 
leftist labor party and workers party but the left isnt dealing 
fianna fail fine gael and the progressive democrats won 138 of 
the dails 166 seats and workers party chairman proinsias de rossa 
said it is up to them to sit down and implement that mandate

liberal members of congress concede there is 
little support on capitol hill for legislation to roll back the new 
supreme court decision on abortion 
but they suggest the restrictions the court said states could 
impose will in time spark such a strong public outcry that congress 
will enact bills counteracting the ruling 
jubilant conservatives meanwhile promised to press ahead with 
efforts to further restrict abortions 
ruling in a missouri case the court said monday that states may 
refuse to allow tax dollars and public facilities to be used for 
abortions and may require doctors to determine through various tests 
whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is capable of surviving 
outside the womb 
in that decision the divided court chipped away at the 
constitutional right to an abortion a right it had spelled out in 
the landmark roe vs wade case in 1973 and it scheduled three more 
abortion cases for its fall term 
now we have to start the battle to keep that chipping process 
from taking place rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the 
energy and commerce health subcommittee said of liberal lawmakers 
next steps 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights said he believed 
support in both houses of congress to overturn the court ruling was 
lacking but he predicted the decision would energize the 
public and consequently lawmakers 
i predict well have a majority in both the house and senate 
for either a statute or constitutional amendment in a relatively 
short time he said this is going to be a real national 
battleground 
but he conceded that could take months or even years 
congress has been moving in the other direction in recent years 
in the face of politically active abortion opponents approving 
restrictions on the use of federal money for abortions 
however edwards predicted congressional support for defending 
abortion would swell gradually as women run into roadblocks to 
ending pregnancies 
rep henry hyde rill one of congress most stalwart abortion 
foes said he believed the courts ruling would make battles on 
capitol hill even more vigorous abortion supporters eyeing the 
supreme courts ruling would realize their only option is to pass 
legislation he said 
were in for a revived and renewed struggle over this issue for 
some time he said 
another antiabortion activist rep christopher smith rnj 
said mondays ruling had led him to explore whether the court was 
opening up avenues for new legislative restrictions 
he said he and his allies are considering bills to bar federal 
assistance to private groups that perform abortions or abortion 
counseling and to severely limit the legality of the procedure in 
washington dc and the us territories where congress has 
direct legislative power 
on the other side rep patricia schroeder dcolo said she 
would soon introduce legislation to increase federal research into 
contraceptives in part to use it to gauge support among her 
colleagues for abortion public support she agreed would be 
crucial 
youre not going to have the votes until members start hearing 
from the other side she said

secretary of state james a baker iii told an 
international gathering tuesday that nations must pledge increased 
aid to the philippines to ensure the fragile young democracy 
survives 
the philippines foreign secretary raul manglapus said it was 
appropriate that the opening of the threeday session coincided with 
the united states independence day and he called it a conclave 
of democracy 
delegates from more than a dozen countries and seven 
international organizations are meeting to discuss the philippines 
multilateral aid initiative a plan aimed at protecting the key 
southeast asian country 
the purpose of the meeting baker said is much more than 
strengthening economic reform in one country it is to express in 
tangible ways our commitment to the success of democracy and 
freedom 
democracy in the philippines remains fragile and under 
attack he told delegates 
president bush has asked congress for an additional 200 million 
in annual aid to help reach a goal of 10 billion in the next five 
years for the philippines where the united states has six military 
bases 
the delegates praised economic and social reforms started since 
corazon aquino became president of the philippines in 1986 after the 
ouster of ferdinand marcos but they also heard of the difficulties 
the country faces 
almost half of the philippine people live under the 
governmentset poverty line the foreign debt is 28 billion and 
communist rebels have been fighting for 20 years to topple the

following are excerpts from editorials on mondays us supreme 
court ruling on abortion 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the us supreme court has delivered another fuzzy 54 ruling on 
abortion which according to justice harry blackmun sets the stage 
for further attacks on the right to privacy affirmed in roe vs wade 
in 1973 
the immediate effect of the new ruling falls short of 
repealing a womans right to early term abortions but the decision 
shows where the courts majority stands here is a selfdescribed 
conservative majority calling for more state interference in a 
matter of the utmost privacy the question of whether to reproduce 
in short the ruling denies abortion to those who can least 
afford the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy 
monday july 3 a bad day for individual freedom

to hear activists on both sides tell it yesterday marked the 
beginning of the end of legal abortion in america such hype seemed 
to flow naturally from a supreme court decision that was deemed 
momentous before a single justice set word to paper but truth be 
told the court only marginally restricted a womans right to an 
abortion and gave no clear indication that it was ready to go 
further in the next session 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the supreme court monday acted properly in reaffirming the right 
of a woman to choose an abortion the united states cannot afford to 
head down the path to back alley abortions that pose a severe threat 
to the lives of women 
unfortunately the decision also has opened the door to 
legislative meddling that could impede women from exercising that 
right 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the united states supreme court has left standing the right of 
women to an abortion but what a pyrrhic victory for women it is and 
what a defeat for justice under law for the american system of 
jurisprudence the courts longawaited review of the roe vs wade 
abortion decision ended in the worst of all possible ways 
by encouraging states to find ways to restrict abortions the 
court took a giant step along the course it began this decade which 
is to turn abortion from a right into a privilege of the welltodo 
the limitations always are barriers to pregnant children and poor 
women the most vulnerable and they clearly will soon have little 
choice to bearing unwanted babies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
making abortion illegal reduces the number of abortions yes but 
it also drives abortions under ground it does not stop them 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the absence of public subsidies will probably limit the 
availability of abortion to some women in some places and to that 
extent the court will regret the social consequences of its 
decision 
but the abortion debate will not be settled in the streets those 
who harass and intimidate women at a painful moment in their lives 
gain no sympathy for their cause and those who believe that the 
court has declared war against women fail to comprehend this 
difficult complex problem the right to abortion remains intact 
the means to abortion are under review 
</TEXT>

probably the worst ill this wind will blow is the prospect of 
divisive ugly political warfare in state capitals many states now 
have or will adopt missouritype laws or worse most we fear will 
then be upheld by the supreme court we can foresee roe v wade 
chipped away bit by bit till only a shell or a shadow remains if 
that 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the state certainly any civilized humane state must have an 
interest in protecting potential human life when that interest is 
nonexistent a state and a people are soon barren of ethical and 
moral values 
this country has traveled some distance on that road already a 
survey of medical geneticists taken earlier this year showed that a 
full 20 percent of them approved of abortion based solely on the sex 
of the unborn child 
when medical professionals begin to countenance the taking of 
life even potential life simply because it is not the right 
gender then something is terribly wrong and there are millions and 
millions of americans who believe that the wrong took root 16 years 
ago 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the us supreme court has set the stage for the worst scenario 
possible in the battle over the rights of mothers and fetuses 
and it has acted in total disregard of the fact that abortions 
will continue to be performed with or without legal sanction and 
without the health safeguards that were imposed on physicians under 
the historic 1973 roe vs wade ruling establishing a womans 
constitutional right to an abortion 
under mondays ruling choice still exists it will be up to 
enlightened states and legislatures to preserve it 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its ruling in the missouri case depicted by both sides of the 
debate as a start in dismantling roe is really a return to the 
courts original version 
that is a healthy step most americans to judge from the polls 
arent willing to make abortion illegal but they are troubled at 
seeing the matter put beyond the reach of social control this time 
the court reflected the nations ambivalence it left roe intact 
ignoring demands that it return to the pre1973 status quo but it 
sanctioned a few restrictions 
for the time being and perhaps beyond the court finds that on 
abortion it is most comfortable alongside most americans 
somewhere in the middle 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the court says states can erect an obstacle course between a 
constitutional right and the ability to exercise that right it says 
states can do that by codifying religious tenets into law this 
is not a theocracy despite the best efforts of jerry falwell jimmy 
swaggart donald wildmon and the like

less like a sculptor than a vandal the us supreme court has 
begun remodeling americas abortion laws its first chisel marks are 
subtler than most spectators anticipated but even a cursory 
reading of justice william rehnquists majority opinion reveals the 
likely shape of things to come 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we would prefer to judge the supreme court by what it actually 
has done in the case of webster vs reproductive health services 
and to a considerable extent the court has been faithful to the 
reasoning of roe vs wade

policymakers at the federal reserve will 
continue easing credit in an effort to keep a sluggish economy from 
sliding into recession many analysts believe that should translate 
into good news for borrowers 
costs of a variety of loans including mortgage rates and home 
equity loans all are expected to head lower through the rest of the 
summer private economists say 
the federal open market committee composed of members of the 
federal reserve board in washington and five of the 12 regional fed 
bank presidents will meet wednesday and thursday for an important 
midyear review of where monetary policy is going 
the central bank through its control of interest rates and the 
nations money supply has a powerful influence over the course of 
the economy it strives to provide enough credit to keep the economy 
expanding while guarding against supplying so much money that 
inflation is rekindled 
in march 1988 the federal reserve began a credittightening 
effort which drove interest rates up by 3 full percentage points 
depressing the housing market and sales of such bigticket items as 
autos 
but last month in a major policy shift the central bank sent a 
key interest rate the federal funds rate down by 025 percentage 
point to around 95 percent 
this rate which is the interest that banks charge each other to 
make overnight loans is considered the best earlywarning signal of 
fed intentions the central bank influences the rate through daily 
decisions on how much money it will make available to the banking 
system 
in advance of wednesdays closeddoor meeting many private 
economists suggested the fomc will decide to push the funds rate 
down by another onefourth percentage point 
i expect an easing move because i believe that the fed is a 
little scared about the recent weak economic data and the 
possibility we could be heading for a recession said lawrence 
chimerine senior economic adviser for the wefa group an economic 
consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
the central bank has been struggling to keep alive the record 
peacetime economic recovery now in its seventh year by engineering 
a softlanding for the economy under that scenario growth 
would slow enough this year to dampen inflationary pressures but not 
so much that the country was plunged into a recession 
whether the central bank can realize its hopes is an open 
question at the current time last weeks big drop in the stock 
market was blamed on growing fears that the country is headed for a 
downturn later this year 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers noted that a variety of business barometers 
including factory orders are pointing to significant weakness 
the economy is slowing more rapidly than expected and underlies 
the need for the fed to act promptly to ease monetary policy he 
said failure to act soon may turn the soft landing into a 
recession 
but david wyss senior economist at drimcgraw hill of lexington 
mass said he believed the central bank would be able to keep 
inflation under control without throwing the economy into a slump 
we think interest rates are coming down fast enough that this 
will be a soft landing wyss said 
mortgage rates are already falling and wyss predicted 30year 
mortgages would dip to around 95 percent by september 
other economists forecast a further onehalf percentage point 
drop in banks prime lending rate in august 
robert dederick executive vice president for northern trust co 
of chicago said chairman alan greenspan and the other federal 
reserve officials have no choice but to pursue their current gradual 
easing strategy given pressure from the bush administration and 
congress to keep the economy out of a recession 
you dont have a public mandate at present to suffer the pain 
to make sure that inflation is under control he said inflation 
is always a threat when you start easing credit but if you wait 
until inflation isnt a threat you have waited right into a 
recession

syrianallied moslem forces reopened 
gateways linking the christian enclave with the rest of lebanon on 
tuesday but syrian gunners bombarded christian ports to maintain 
the sea blockade 
police said one person was killed and five wounded in predawn 
shelling duels across beiruts dividing green line bringing the 
toll to 397 people killed and 1538 wounded in the 16week 
confrontation between gen michel aouns mainly christian lebanese 
army troops and syrian soldiers 
syrian gunners stopped their shelling 35 minutes before moslem 
forces lifted the land siege 
thousands of civilians flooded the three crossings in beirut 
north lebanon and the mountains east of the capital after they 
reopened to traffic after almost four months 
this is the first time in more than three months they allow me 
to carry vegetables to east beirut said a woman at museum 
gateway her eyes brimming with tears 
moslem soldiers searched cars and frisked pedestrians for weapons 
the syrianbacked moslem army command of maj gen sami khatib a 
dissident lebanese army officer said private cars will be allowed 
to cross into the 310squaremile christian enclave for 13 hours 
during the day 
trucks carrying food and other commodities will be allowed to 
cross at night the statement said it did not elaborate 
a source at aouns command said the reopening was an 
encouraging sign 
well wait to see if they allow supplies to cross overnight 
the source said on condition of anonymity 
the enclave home to about 1 million christians has been under 
siege by syrian and allied forces since march 14 
shiite moslem militia chieftain nabih berri syrias closest ally 
in lebanon announced monday the land siege would be lifted as a 
goodwill gesture 
it appears to be a guarded response to an iraqi offer sunday to 
stop supplying arms to aoun if syria withdraws from lebanon iraq 
and syria are rivals for influence in the arab world 
berri said beirut airport also would be reopened tuesday 
but the airport police commander lt col ahmed abu zaki said 
this was delayed for technical reasons workers on tuesday were 
repairing the airport closed march 12 after shells exploded on its 
runway 
salim salam general manager of middle east airlines said the 
state airline is prepared to resume flights to beirut airport in 48 
hours lebanons is the only airline that uses the airport 
aoun did not comment on tuesdays reopening decided after a 
weekend meeting in damascus of five syrianbacked moslem militia 
leaders with syrian foreign minister farouk sharaa 
acting prime minister salim hoss aouns rival and head of the 
moslem cabinet said the move was a basic step toward resolving 
the crisis 
aoun had separate meetings with ambassadors of the united states 
britain france and the soviet union to complain about the sea 
blockade tuesday the christian voice of lebanon radio said 
it said aoun also sent cables to un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar and arab league secretarygeneral chedli klibi 
about the interception by syrian naval vessels of commercial ships 
in lebanese territorial waters 
the independent daily annahar reported tuesday that syria has 
tightened the blockade

doctors and lawyers role models with a 
special kind of status should impose strict antidrug standards 
on their elite professions says william j bennett the federal 
coordinator of drugcontrol policy 
if youre serious about this thing you dont just go battering 
down doors in the inner cities bennett said in an interview to 
those who have been given much much is expected 
these are people who make a lot of money who exercise a lot of 
influence in society he said theyre role models doctors and 
lawyers they have a special kind of status one stands for health 
one stands for lawfulness theres no good excuse here 
bennett who has met in the past with heads of sports 
organizations and with hollywood leaders said he spoke recently 
with american bar association president robert raven and the 
american medical associations chief executive officer dr james h 
sammons 
i said the same thing to the head of the aba that i said to the 
sports people you must have standards of behavior and discipline 
in regard to drugs that are as least as onerous and as serious as 
the policies that we see in serious junior high schools and high 
schools which is one strike youre in trouble and two strikes 
youre out bennett said 
how can you as officers of the court of the law not hold to 
these kinds of standards bennett said he told raven 
bennett said he gave sammons a similar speech if youre 
doctors and youre taking illegal drugs youre being a lousy 
example 
both the aba and the ama voluntary organizations without power 
to discipline members by lifting credentials have programs to help 
impaired professionals however neither raven nor sammons indicated 
he would advocate bennetts twostrikesyoureout policy 
instead they espoused treatment for drug abusers and indicated 
that people with such problems might shy away from seeking help if 
they thought strict records were being kept 
a key consideration in deciding whether intervention is called 
for said raven is whether a client is being neglected or 
mishandled by a lawyer with a drug problem 
in many states now they have procedures where they can move in 
and protect the client and thats very important he said in 
the old days it just sort of drifted clients got neglected 
at the same time raven said you have to be a little sensitive 
to what might happen to the clients if you get too heavyhanded 
the extent of drug abuse among professionals is unclear surveys 
by the national institute on drug abuse check whether respondents 
are employed but not what jobs they have 
dr douglas talbott who has a drug treatment facility in 
atlanta says the addiction rate for all people for all 
substances including alcohol is about 10 percent while the rate 
for health professionals is 17 percent to 19 percent few of those 
are addicted solely to alcohol he said 
talbott who said his center has treated more physicians than any 
other facility said his experience with other professions is less 
extensive but he estimated that addiction rates are greater than 
the average in such professions as lawyers and judges professional 
athletes people in the entertainment world people in the media and 
people in the armed services 
however a survey by the lawyers assistance program in the state 
of washington in 1987 found that while 18 percent of the lawyers 
there had alcohol abuse or dependency problems only 3 percent had 
such problems with drugs 
dr bryant galusha of the fort worthbased federation of state 
medical boards said at least 35 percent of the disciplinary actions 
reported are related directly or peripherally to controlled 
substances with the vast majority involving a doctors personal 
drug abuse 
in 1986 galusha said the federation was notified of a total of 
2302 disciplinary actions against physicians nationwide of those 
458 resulted in license revocations 528 suspensions and 335 
probations he said 
bennett said he would like law firms and hospitals to conduct 
drug testing if officials there think abuse problems might exist 
were going to advocate drugtesting anywhere when we get to 
the strategy bennett said referring to the congressionally 
mandated national drugcontrol strategy that he must produce by 
early september i cant mandate it but i can sure say its a 
good idea

a group of americans held a fourth 
of july picnic on a riverbank in north korea on tuesday sipping 
japanese beer singing a woody guthrie tune and reading the 
declaration of independence 
our country was founded by a revolution said james badger a 
boston musician and member of the young communists league we 
think its important to celebrate independence day i feel very 
patriotic 
badger led the group of about 50 young americans in a lusty 
rendition of the folk song this land is your land others who 
gathered along the shaded poton river read the declaration of 
independence drank japanese beer ate crackers and watermelon and 
played volleyball against some youths from portugal 
the americans are in the isolated and rigidly communist nation 
for the world festival of youth and students a political conclave 
of 15000 mostly leftist young people from 180 countries 
the american group about 90 in all is making a rare visit to a 
country that has no diplomatic relations with washington and 
constantly vilifies the united states for its role in the 195053 
korean war and its military presence in rival south korea 
you have to come to grips with the fact that this country was 
leveled by us bombs said christine kelly a leader of the 
student action union at rutgers university 
she said she carried the american flag into the stadium during 
opening ceremonies saturday adding i want to be proud of the 
united states 
but she said she wept when she met a delegate from nicaragua 
who had been crippled by american bullets in the war against the 
usbacked contra resistance forces it is painful 
jim cullen from the student association of the state university 
of new york in albany said the fourth of july was an idea of what 
we can be the celebration no matter how small or modest is a 
vision of a better america he said 
michele goodwin student government leader at the university of 
wisconsin disagreed saying independence day was a time when blacks 
get to look at how doublehanded and hypocritical american 
society is 
miss goodwin who is black said america will never have 
independence until hunger poverty and sexism are eliminated 
she said she had come to the party to analyze all of this 
others said their discussions with soviet cuban and third world 
youths and their exposure to the highly disciplined north korean 
society which is so diffferent from their own had given them new 
perspectives on the united states 
a lot of us are thinking more of our own country and what it 
stands for said lisa bratton of the southern christian leadership 
conference in atlanta 
victor buines 25 an immigrant from honduras living in new york 
said he was determined to work for change from within the united 
states 
buines a representative from the national catholic student 
coalition who is waiting to receive his us citizenship said he 
went to fourth of july picnic to welcome my new country im 
adopting as my fatherland

stateowned national network each week and the 10500 london subway 
workers are preparing for a long and costly fight 
jimmy knapp the gruff glaswegian who leads the national union of 
railwaymen says the railmen will keep it up until christmas if 
necessary 
and he warns that banning strikes in essential services should 
sound alarm bells ringing in every home in this country concerned 
with democracy 
the transportation workers are spearheading a resurgence of union 
militancy after a decade of defeats falling membership and laws 
curbing the unions oncesweeping powers to call strikes 
mrs thatcher swept to power in may 1979 on a wave of antiunion 
sentiment after a winter of public service strikes left garbage 
piled in streets and the dead unburied 
this year strikes have regularly shut passport offices and the 
bbc on tuesday a oneday strike closed all but emergency local 
government services 
rail drivers are expected to ban overtime soon adding to 
commuter misery with hundreds of train cancelations and a dock 
strike also looms 
most of the strikes began over pay but there are political 
overtones and both sides seem to sense a watershed is coming 
arthur scargill a marxist who led his national union of 
mineworkers to defeat in a yearlong strike against colliery 
closures in 198485 hailed the strikes as massive resistance to 
thatchers policies 
it is time we took a conscious and responsible decision to defy 
unjust and oppressive laws he told a union rally 
the railway workers want a 10 percent pay increase management 
wants to impose a 7 percent raise which is less than inflation 
inflation has almost doubled in a year to 83 percent partly 
because wage settlements are averaging 93 percent 
management is under attack for trying to break the strikes 
through the courts and for seeking to break up the national 
bargaining system by negotiating separately with worker groups 
ending collective bargaining would weaken union power as a 
prelude to the governments longterm aim of selling stateowned 
british rail to private enterprise 
the rail union is a not a militant one but theyre incensed by 
what has happened said murray hughes deputy editor of the 
railways gazette an independent publication 
railworkers are now among the lowest paid industrial workers with 
average earnings including overtime of 457 a week for drivers and 
316 for the rest they want a 10 percent raise 
the pressure is coming from workers who see their standards of 
living and conditions under threat at a time of rising inflation 
said norman willis general secretary of the 9 millionmember 
national labor federation the trades union congress 
with more than 3 million people using the railway or subway to 
get to work strike days are commuter nightmares people walk jog 
sit trapped in traffic jams or queue up for a handful of privately 
run buses 
the employers confederation of british industry says 75 percent 
of commuters are battling in often hours late but the costs in 
lost business and staff time run into millions of dollars 
legislation banning strikes in essential services is expected to 
reach parliament this fall mrs thatchers supporters reject the 
argument that it is undemocratic saying arrangements barring such 
strikes already exist in france and west germany 
graham mather director of the institute of economic affairs a 
rightwing thinktank says it should have been done years ago 
it would have been easier to change the law when nothing was 
happening he said in an interview but now it has to be done 
against the clock

a former court clerk and a onetime top aide of 
the late mayor harold washington were convicted of accepting 80000 
from an fbi informant posing as a businessman trying to buy his way 
into city contracts 
a federal jury deliberated about 16 hours over four days before 
returning the verdict monday against the last two defendants caught 
in the fbis operation incubator probe into corruption at city hall 
twnetyfour other public officials already were convicted in the 
investigation in chicago and new york city 
morgan finley 63 who served as chief administrator of the cook 
county court until november was convicted on charges of 
racketeering conspiracy attempted extortion and interstate travel 
to aid a racketeering scheme 
clarence mcclain 47 who served the late mayor briefly but 
remained a close friend after leaving washingtons administration 
was convicted on charges of racketeering conspiracy attempted 
extortion interstate travel to aid a racketeering scheme tax fraud 
and mail fraud 
the message here is that people who get paid off have to pay 
the price said assistant us attorney michael shepard one of 
three federal prosecutors in the case 
finley was acquitted on three of the nine counts against him in 
the original indictment mcclain was acquitted on five of 16 counts 
against him 
us district judge ilana rovner set sentencing for july 25 
finley faces a maximum of 105 years in prison and 15 million in 
fines mcclain faces a maximum of 145 years and 25 million 
we gave it our best shot said mcclains attorney phil 
parenti adding that no decision had been made yet on whether to 
appeal 
but finleys attorney louis garippo said his client would 
appeal citing pretrial rulings limiting exploration of the 
motives of fbi informant michael raymond 
raymond a convicted swindler was the central figure in the 
undercover investigation operation incubator netted 16 convictions 
in chicago and spawned a probe in new york city that led to 10 
convictions including that of stanley m friedman democratic 
chairman of the bronx 
friedman and four codefendants were found guilty in a scheme to 
get a 227 million parking violations bureau contract for handheld 
computers through a pattern of racketeering he was sentenced to 12 
years in prison 
raymond became an informant after being arrested in july 1984 in 
tennessee on weapons charges he agreed to pose in chicago as a 
businessman trying to bribe his way into lucrative city contracts 
for collecting overdue parking fines and water bills 
he often wined and dined politicians in a posh lakefront 
apartment as fbi agents taped the proceedings from next door 
when the investigation was disclosed in december 1985 some of 
the politicians and allies of washington contended it was an attempt 
to embarrass his administration 
many others criticized the governments use of an unsavory 
character like raymond as an informant 
but prosecutor ira raphaelson defended the use of raymond as a 
method of getting behind the closed door where most public 
corruption takes place 
we did not use him as a witness he added we used him as a 
microphone

breathing and circulatory problems 
he was visited tuesday by party chairman reszo nyers and party 
general secretary karoly grosz 
hospital sources said kadars wife maria was constantly at her 
husbands bedside 
hungarian radio gave no details of kadars condition other 
staterun media ran only the same terse report 
kadar was stripped of his last communist party posts in may after 
he was reported gravely ill 
the party leader for 32 years kadar had been named honorary 
party chairman in may 1988 when grosz became general secretary in 
the past year kadars political legacy has come increasingly into 
question 
after guiding hungary to relative prosperity and tolerance by the 
1970s he was seen as an obstacle to political and economic reform 
in the 1980s 
he has not been seen in public since april when participants at 
a communist central committee meeting said he gave a long rambling 
speech 
in recent interviews kadar was quoted as saying the fate of imre 
nagy and other leaders of the 1956 hungarian revolt was his 
personal tragedy

uprising and nagy and his associates were executed on charges of 
high treason in 1958 after a stalinist show trial 
nagy and other uprising leaders were honored as national martyrs 
at a ceremony june 16 after what amounted to a political 
rehabilitation of nagy and a reevaluation of the uprising

a former housing and urban development 
official says hud secretary samuel r pierce jr ordered his staff 
to override objections and approve a north carolina apartment 
project promoted by a former law partner it was reported 
pierce who served under president reagan told congress on may 
25 that he took no such actions 
former federal housing commissioner shirley mcvay wiseman said 
pierce played a major role in the rent subsidy program now under 
investigation for alleged influence peddling by wellconnected gop 
figures the los angeles times reported today 
records in durham nc show that louis kitchin one of former 
president reagans key operatives in the south received 40000 in 
consulting fees for an 11 million project for converting a former 
hosiery mill into hudsubsidized apartments for the elderly 
charles b markham the republican mayor of durham in 1985 and a 
highranking official in the hud under president nixon was one of 
the projects chief backers markham had been one of pierces law 
partners in new york during the 1960s unidentified sources told the 
times 
on monday the wall street journal also reported that pierce took 
extraordinary steps on behalf of the project the newspaper said 
that there is no indication markham had any financial interest in 
the project 
the longstalled project was given a big boost after pierce 
intervened with a multimilliondollar series of hud grants and 
subsidies the times said city officials in durham said the project 
has helped revitalize a poor area 
it had drawn opposition within hud from critics who complained 
that the project would cost the agency too much and that toxic waste 
had been buried nearby 
in congressional testimony on may 25 pierce said he told hud 
officials to give careful consideration to housing 
rehabilitation proposals by such republicans as former interior 
secretary james g watt but pierce insisted he left the final 
decision on such projects up to ms dean and two other top officials 
however ms wiseman said she resigned from the hud shortly after 
refusing to obey orders from pierce and his executive assistant 
deborah gore dean to approve funding for the project 
i was directed to sign it twice by deborah dean and by the 
secretary said ms wiseman who is now a lexington ky 
developer and president of the national association of home 
builders the secretary called and ordered me to sign it and i 
said that i couldnt do that 
ms dean refused through her lawyer joseph e digenova to 
discuss the durham project 
an unidentified confidant of ms deans told the times that ms 
dean said she told ms wiseman to sign the waivers for the project 
but insisted she was following orders from pierce 
the waivers were eventually signed by ms wisemans successor 
janet hale now associate director of the white house budget office 
she refused on monday to discuss the case 
pierce did not respond to requests from the times to discuss the 
durham project 
a telephone call to ms wisemans home today went unanswered 
the wall street journal said that huds inspector general acting 
on an anonymous tip began investigating the project before final 
funding was approved and found no substantiation of charges of undue 
influence 
meanwhile a senior government official in washington said 
nursing homes will probably be next among federal housing 
programs that have been targeted for sharp cutbacks in the 
investigation of mismanagement at hud 
the department is reviewing an inspector generals audit of the 
retirement service program and hud secretary jack kemp could make 
decisions about the program as early as next week the hud official 
said monday 
the retirement service program helps provide financing for 
nursing homes and other housing for the elderly 
todays new york times said hud is considering overhaul or 
termination of the program in the wake of an inspector generals 
audit that found half of the 24 projects examined in the midwest 
were in default or financially troubled 
kemp has acted to suspend or terminate other department programs 
in the wake of highly critical audits by the inspector general 
nursing homes will probably be next said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the newspaper also said the problems would leave the government 
liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in mortgages on troubled 
housing for the elderly the official gave no estimate of possible 
losses 
last week kemp canceled a mortgage insurance program after an 
audit found 25 of 58 projects financed through the program had 
defaulted the department estimated the outstanding debts would cost 
the government 90 million 
other federal housing programs including subsidies for 
rehabilitation of housing for those with low and moderate incomes a 
coinsurance program and a program in which at least one private 
escrow agent who handled sales of foreclosed property has admitted 
stealing more than 5 million are under investigation by congress 
and the justice department for mismanagement political 
influencepeddling and other abuses

all in all leona helmsleys first week in court 
was not a good one she was heckled she cried and her money and 
her exacting standards as queen of a hotel empire made her an easy 
target for ridicule in the press 
it was reported that the billionaire slipped off her left pump 
during jury selection that she paid 157 for a tuna fish sandwich 
and that she ate from a plastic plate in the courthouse cafeteria 
in ads featuring mrs helmsley as the uncompromising queen of 
the helmsley hotels she vows never to use plastic eating utensils 
jury selection for her federal tax evasion trial is expected to 
be completed wednesday morning after which assistant us attorney 
james devita will outline his case against mrs helmsley and two 
former aides 
mrs helmsley whose 69th birthday was tuesday is accused of 
billing 4 million in personal expenses to the 5 billion hotel and 
real estate empire she heads with her husband harry 
most of the money was spent to renovate their greenwich conn 
mansion prosecutors say 
she also is charged with shaking down contractors who did 
business with the helmsley organization 
potential jurors were asked to reveal their income what they 
think about rich people and whether they believe the hotel queen is 
an ogre 
helmsley 80 who was indicted in 1988 with his wife was removed 
from the trial after being ruled mentally incompetent because of a 
series of strokes 
during lunch in the courthouse last week she was heckled by a 
man who apparently had had too much to drink 
you rich people you all ought to go to jail youre guilty 
yelled the man he was escorted out by security officers and she 
resumed her lunch 
later in the week mrs helmsley was overcome by emotion when her 
lawyer gerald feffer asked that she be tried apart from frank 
turco a former senior officer for helmsley hotels 
as feffer charged that turco had robbed her blind mrs 
helmsley had tears streaming down her face she wiped them away with 
her hands until a judges clerk brought her a handful of tissues 
us district judge john walker jr a cousin of president bush 
denied the request for separate trials 
feffer has said an essential part of mrs helmsleys defense will 
be that turco was involved in embezzlement and extortion without her 
knowledge

will be charged with espionage in connection with the trip last year 
south korea forbids unauthorized trips to the communist nation 
and says contact between the countries must be through official 
channels 
the visit by suh has been of special concern to authorities 
because he is a national legislator and because he and officials in 
pyongyang kept the trip secret for 10 months

national security laws and miss im sukyong you are brave and 
wonderful as they battled police at seouls yonsei university 
the clash lasted more than an hour before students were dispersed by 
police firing tear gas

studies went to pyongyang for the 13th world festival of youth and 
students which ends saturday

it had drafted an interkorea student communique that calls for a 
drastic reduction of military forces in north and south korea 
and the gradual withdrawal of us troops and nuclear weapons from 
the peninsula

650000 in south korea an additional 43000 us troops are 
stationed in south korea under a mutual defense pact 
radical students a small but vocal minority say the us troops 
hinder reunification

passport and money for her trip and whether there is any connection 
with her trip and that of suh or the rev moon ikhwan who is on 
trial for an unauthorized trip to north korea in april

china must take a whole series of actions to 
restore confidence among hong kong residents after its brutal 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement britains foreign secretary 
said tuesday 
i dont begin to say that theres any single action that any 
chinese leader could take that could wipe the slate clean or 
anything like that sir geoffrey howe declared its going to be 
a long business 
he urged the united states and other nations not to impose 
further economic sanctions on china howe said that would seriously 
damage the colony which britain has agreed to return to china in 
1997 
howe commented at the end of a threeday visit during which he 
was criticized for britains refusal to grant the right of residence 
in britain to the colonys 57 million people 
about 6000 citizens marched through downtown hong kong to mark 
one month since the army assault the night of june 34 on tienanmen 
square which was occupied by student demonstrators they shouted 
down with communism down with the communist party 
li peng the chinese premier who ordered the crackdown was 
portrayed on posters as dracula and howe as a bumbling panda 
howe stood by the 1984 agreement under which britain agreed to 
return the colony and china promised continued capitalism and a 
high degree of autonomy in hong kong under a one country two 
systems policy 
on tuesday the foreign secretary said there was a huge gap of 
broken confidence to be overcome 
trust can be restored he said only by a whole series of 
actions rather than words from beijing howe said hong kong 
residents will watch closely how china treats its own people and 
drafts a constitution for the territory 
the depth of the confidence crisis was indicated by a poll 
released tuesday in which 54 percent of 1000 residents questioned 
expressed pessimism about the future 
results of the poll by survey research hong kong conducted in 
the last week of june indicated slightly more than half the people 
may emigrate the figure rose to nearly twothirds for professionals 
and executives 
howe said without giving details that britain would allow a 
select group of hong kong residents to emigrate to britain speed 
democratic reform and seek international support for the territorys 
people 
he said other countries could help the colony which has 
extensive economic links with china by not imposing further 
economic sanctions 
hong kong would be gravely damaged if the united states still 
yet other countries were to engage in economic sanctions he said 
the foreign secretary said he was certain the most secure way of 
being able to reestablish contact of a sensible kind with a 
sensible leadership in beijing was to retain the prospect of 
economic relations with each other

president ranasinghe premadasa on 
tuesday accused unspecified foreign intelligence agencies of 
whipping up disturbances to try to subjugate sri lanka 
they hire people from inside the administration and work 
insidiously through them to wreck the administration premadasa 
told a rally at mahiyangana 70 miles northeast of colombo 
in the past when a country wanted to conquer another it waged a 
war but today when a country wants to tame suppress or enslave 
another country it resorts to different methods he said 
according to a text released by the government 
premadasa did not identify the foreign agencies but appeared to 
be referring to his countrys northwestern neighbor india 
you know what happened in the north and east of sri lanka from 
where did our people get that help to attack our own people he 
asked 
sri lanka had accused india of aiding and training rebels of the 
tamil minority who have been fighting for six years for an 
independent nation at least 9000 people have been killed in the 
rebellion mostly dominant sinhalese 
india has denied the charges and in 1987 sponsored a peace accord 
aimed at giving tamils local autonomy 
under the plan india deployed peacekeeping troops to supervise a 
rebel surrender but the soldiers soon became involved in a 
guerrilla war with the dominant liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
who reneged on the accord 
premadasa began peace talks with the tamil tigers in may and 
asked india to withdraw its estimated 45000 troops by july 29 the 
second anniversary of the accord 
but india rejected the request saying a hasty withdrawal could 
lead to even greater ethnic violence the refusal has angered the 
sri lankan government and opposition parties 
samuel bandaranaike president of the sri lanka patriotic united 
progressive front suggested colombo break diplomatic ties with new 
delhi 
if india is not respecting the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of sri lanka then our front will be compelled to agitate 
to sever diplomatic relations immediately he said in an interview 
bandaranaikes powerful coalition is believed to be close to the 
peoples liberation front an extremist sinhalese group bitterly 
opposed to the indian troop presence 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi said he is willing to 
negotiate a timetable for a troop withdrawal with sri lankan 
officials 
sinhalese extremists killed seven policemen tuesday in three 
separate attacks in the south of this island nation a police 
official said the government blames the militants for at least 
3500 killings in two years 
the extremists in 1987 launched a violent campaign against the 
government which they accuse of making too many concessions to the 
tamils who comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
tamils say they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who 
comprise 75 percent of the population

the governing liberal democrats jolted by a major 
loss in tokyo city elections begin a new campaign wednesday for 
national balloting that could further whittle away at their 
political domination 
plagued by sex and influencepeddling scandals and public anger 
over a new sales tax and relaxed import laws the party tuesday 
tried to win rural support by opposing a cut in the price paid to 
farmers for their rice 
the 255 percent cut had been recommended by the governments 
rice price council 
sundays vote for the tokyo city legislature was considered a 
barometer of how well the liberal democratic party will fare in july 
23 elections for 126 of the 252 seats in the upper house of the 
diet or parliament 
the liberal democratic party has held a majority in the upper 
house since the party was founded in 1955 it holds 139 of the 
seats including 66 of those at stake the socialists who routed 
the liberal democrats in the tokyo vote have said they will end 
that majority 
no doubt about it they will lose their majority said 
political analyst asao yamaguchi if the ldp holds even 45 of its 
66 seats then that will be a big win for them 
the socialist party holds 22 of the seats at stake while the 
clean government party has 12 and the communists eight minor 
parties and independents hold the rest 
on sunday the liberal democrats won just 43 of the 128 seats in 
the tokyo metropolitan assembly down from their previous 63 the 
socialists tripled their strength from 12 to 36 seats following a 
campaign that focused on the scandals facing the past and present 
prime minister the sales tax and other national issues 
shortly after prime minister sousuke uno took office last month 
reports appeared that he had kept paid mistresses he denied doing 
anything immoral 
uno replaced naboru takeshita who resigned to take 
responsibility for the socalled recruit scandal in which the 
recruit co publishing conglomerate allegedly traded political 
donations and bargainpriced unlisted stock for political favors 
while takeshita was in office parliament passed the 3 percent 
tax 
uno blamed the tax for his partys defeat in tokyo where he did 
not join the campaign after the sex scandals surfaced the tokyo 
liberal democrats asked him to stay away 
on tuesday the masscirculation newspaper mainichi shimbun 
quoted sources close to takeshita as saying uno should announce 
his resignation wednesday even if he stays in office until after 
the upper house elections 
earlier representatives of several party factions including two 
former prime ministers were reported to have agreed that uno should 
resign for the good of the party 
ryutaro hashimoto the liberal democratic partys 
secretarygeneral described the outcome in tokyo as a total 
defeat and said we must study it and use it as a lesson as we 
prepare for the national elections 
the party holds a comfortable majority in the more powerful lower 
house where elections do not have to be held before next year 
but socialist party leader takako doi said monday she hoped to 
put an end to the liberal democratic majority in the upper house 
yamaguchi predicted the liberal democrats will suffer in rural 
districts that have just one representative because of farmers 
anger over changes allowing more food products to be imported those 
districts alone he said could cost the party 10 seats

more saving by americans and others is a key to 
international prosperity the world bank said tuesday in its annual 
review of economic development 
the world bank is the largest source of aid for third world 
countries lending over 21 billion in the past 12 months 
the fundamental problem is a shortage of world saving said 
stanley fischer one of the banks vice presidents and its chief 
economist 
we focus very much in economics on the us budget deficit but 
thats only one aspect of the shortage of world saving he said 
because americans do not save enough to meet the borrowing needs 
of both government and business the government has to borrow from 
the savings of other countries to deal with the budget deficit and 
government demand for money helps keep interest rates high 
fischer went on to say that countries all over the world need to 
encourage saving 
the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd 
finds that of 19 major countries citizens of britain finland the 
netherlands norway and sweden saved less by percentage than 
american households did last year japanese west germans french 
swiss belgians spaniards and italians saved a lot more 
reducing interest rates may be the most important thing that rich 
countries can do for the third world fischer said 
fischer was presenting the world banks 1989 world development 
report 
millard f long the american who led the team that prepared it 
compared the situation in the third world with the savings and loan 
crisis in this country 
we found institution after institution which we can say were 
technically insolvent much as our savings and loans are in the 
united states he said 
the measures needed in those countries are very similar to the 
solution here said you have to decide how to allocate those 
losses and in most cases we see that its not the deposit holder 
being asked to pay losses but the taxpayer as in the united states 
a better system of controls has to be installed to make sure that 
the mistakes of the past are avoided 
the report found 1988 a good year for highincome countries 
steady growth of production and low inflation for the sixth year in 
a row it said the conditions were favorable for expansion in the 
third world too in large part because of the stability and 
expansion in the wealthier countries 
but the third world had an uneven year countries on the eastern 
rim of the pacific did well but in africa and latin america 
hundreds of millions of people have seen economic decline and 
regression rather than growth and development the report said 
in some countries in latin america real income is less than 
it was a decade ago in some african countries it was less than it 
was 20 years ago

a fire killed six children left alone at 
home early tuesday and investigators said the deaths might have 
been prevented had there been batteries in a smoke detector 
apparently issued by the fire department 
the six cousins two 9yearolds three 10yearolds and a 
14yearold were found dead in three bedrooms and in the kitchen 
officials said 
its hard to say if they tried to get out said fire capt 
mike brown 
the blaze broke out in a front room about 330 am at the 
twostory frame house and the home was engulfed in flames when 
firefighters arrived officials said 
the cause of the fire was under investigation 
chuck randall a district manager at louisville gas amp electric 
co said the electricity had been disconnected for an undetermined 
amount of time before the fire neighbors said the family had been 
using candles for light 
maj dayle fortney chief arson investigator said a smoke 
detector without batteries was found on a mantle inside the home and 
looked like the type given out by the fire department as part of a 
firesafety program four years ago 
its been my experience that if people have smoke detectors in 
their house they do what they are supposed to and people get out 
he said 
brown said the department provided a smoke detector at that 
residence in 1985 and also checked an existing detector 
the identities of the children were not immediately released 
in my opinion they were probably dead of smoke inhalation 
before they burned fortney said 
fortney said one parent apparently a woman who lived at the 
home arrived shortly after the fire began 
she was in shock running up and down the street screaming 
he said 
a neighbor teresa smith 31 said the mother rarely left her two 
children alone the four other children were cousins who visited 
frequently she said

a priest who set up an unauthorized church for 
black parishioners has been suspended by the roman catholic 
archbishop of washington a church spokeswoman said today but the 
priest said he would continue to hold unauthorized services 
cardinal james a hickey suspended the rev george a stallings 
jr after the priest celebrated an unsanctioned worship ceremony at 
the district of columbias law school chapel last sunday said 
spokeswoman eileen marks 
stallings who was notified of hickeys decision by registered 
letter on monday is forbidden to preach celebrate mass or any of 
the catholic churchs sacraments including baptism weddings and 
holy communion marks said 
the cardinal was leaving channels open for any possible dialogue 
with stallings despite the suspension she said hickeys letter 
said the decision was made in part to help stallings turn away from 
a course of action that the cardinal said was destructive 
the letter called the service stallings performed at his newly 
created imani temple last sunday a public act of disobedience 
and said the establishment of the separate group was a step 
towards separating yourself from the unity of the catholic church 
marks said 
but stallings responded today the cardinal has failed to deal 
with racism in the catholic church and hasnt responded to issues i 
have brought to his attention 
in an interview with radio station whurfm at the private 
predominantly black howard university in washington stallings said 
he will hold services every sunday at the imani temple now located 
at suitland high school in suitland md 
the suspension only affects my duties with the roman catholic 
church he said 
stallings had said earlier that he created the new congregation 
because the roman catholic church is not responsive to the cultural 
and spiritual needs of black parishioners

traditional catholic prayers and liturgy along with elements

officials since announcing his separate parish last month said 
sunday the church cant throw me out and even if they do throw 
me out i have my own opinion they have theirs 
efforts to reach stallings by telephone for comment were 
unsuccessful 
church officials said they oppose stallings methods but not his 
efforts to respond to the black community 
this situation has more to do with the needs and expectations 
of father stallings than with broader questions about the adequacy 
of catholic ministry within the black community hickey said 
as catholics we look to the bishop for overall guidance on 
when to establish a new parish said the rev william lori 
secretary to hickey we cant have a priest setting up a new 
parish and saying hey we have a better product over here

the soviet writers union has voted to reinstate 
alexander solzhenitsyn the chronicler of stalinist terror who was 
kicked out of the organization in 1969 and exiled five years later 
a newspaper reported tuesday 
solzhenitsyns rehabilitation will continue within a few days 
when novy mir the unions main journal releases its july issue 
containing the lecture he wrote after winning the nobel prize for 
literature in 1970 an editor at the journal said 
solzhenitsyn was barred from traveling to sweden to deliver the 
lecture and it has not been published in the soviet union 
next month novy mir will publish three chapters of 
solzhenitsyns monumental history of the soviet labor camp system 
the gulag archipelago said vadim borisov the editor who 
prepared the text for publication another literary journal in 
estonia also is planning to publish parts of the book 
despite the gradual rehabilitation of solzhenitsyn the soviet 
government which forcibly exiled him to the west in 1974 has yet 
to restore his citizenship the writers union urged the government 
to take that step according to literaturnaya gazeta the weekly 
newspaper of the union 
the exile lives with his family in seclusion in cavendish vt 
literaturnaya gazeta reported tuesday the 26member secretariat 
of the writers union had voted to revoke its wrongful expulsion 
of solzhenitsyn on dec 5 1969 
two members of the ruling politburo vadim a medvedev and 
alexandra p biryukova have opposed publication of solzhenitsyns 
works and it was not clear when he might be fully exonerated 
the gulag archipelago chronicles life in soviet labor camps 
solzhenitsyn was freed from the camps after josef stalins death in 
1953 
a literary journal in the baltic republic of estonia also is 
publishing three chapters of the gulag archipelago in its sixth 
issue to appear shortly said an editor of the journal in tallinn 
the journal looming has a circulation of 32000 and is 
publishing the excerpts in estonian a language little spoken 
outside the tiny republic 
the complete version of the book is being translated into 
estonian and is expected to be published by eestiraanat publishers 
said the looming editor she said the publication was authorized by 
solzhenitsyn himself and was not cleared by any soviet authorities 
borisov an editor in the prose section of novy mir said the 
gulag archipelago excerpts slated for publication in that journal 
had not been censored by soviet authorities although he 
acknowledged that discussion over which parts to use had been going 
on for several years 
we dont have to go to anyone before we publish but the 
journal has to be taken to glavlit for approval he said glavlit 
the state agency which makes sure that state secrets are not 
published formerly played a much more agressive censorship role 
borisov said material selected for publication included portions 
on vladimir lenin the founder of the soviet state western editions 
of the gulag archipelago say that lenin started official 
terrorism in the soviet union still a controversial contention in 
this country 
borisov said that novy mir would publish about one third of the 
whole book he said that solzhenitsyn had refused to accept any 
payment from novy mir for the publication 
the article in literaturnaya gazeta did not mention when the 
writers union took its action although union sources said the 
decision was made at a meeting friday 
the works of solzhenitsyn have not been published in his homeland 
since novy mir carried his short novel one day in the life of ivan 
denisovich in november 1962 during the cultural thaw under nikita 
s khrushchev the thaw ended shortly thereafter and solzhenitsyns 
works were banned

the man accused of killing prime 
minister olof palme refused to answer questions in court tuesday 
ending testimony in the murder trial 
it doesnt matter what i respond to your questions so i will 
not answer your questions defendant christer pettersson told the 
prosecutor 
pettersson 42 repeated his denial that he killed palme the 
socialist who dominated swedish politics for more than a decade 
palme was shot feb 28 1986 while walking home from a movie in 
downtown stockholm with his wife lisbeth 
the court cannot force a defendant to testify so it adjourned 
until thursday 
then chief prosecutor anders helin will sum up the case against 
pettersson which relies heavily on the evidence of mrs palme 
court officials said they will hear the defense summary monday 
then retire to decide on a verdict expected before the end of the 
month 
mrs palme identified pettersson as the man she saw just after 
her husband fell to the street with a fatal bullet wound though she 
said she did not see him holding a gun 
pettersson who has served a jail sentence for manslaughter and 
is a known alcohol and drug abuser also was seen in the area by 
other witnesses who testified earlier in the monthlong trial 
on tuesday the defense called an insurance company employee to 
testify that mrs palme appeared distraught and shocked immediately 
after the shooting implying her identification of pettersson was 
unreliable 
stig engstrom one of the first to rush over to palme appeared 
to contradict mrs palmes claim that she was collected enough to 
remember seeing pettersson who she said was standing about five 
yards away 
engstrom said mrs palme was confused and disoriented 
pettersson who was arrested dec 14 after a threeyear manhunt 
interrupted helin when the prosecutor was about to question him for 
the first time since the trial opened june 5 
he denounced helins attempt to discredit defense witness algot 
asell who backed petterssons alibi that he was at a train station 
17 miles outside stockholm at the time of the shooting 
i only have one witness on my side whom you have done 
everything to cast doubt on he said imagine if you did an 
investigation of every witness the way you did of the witness who 
speaks in my favor 
algot said he saw pettersson at the station around the time of 
the shooting but he was unclear about the timing of his own 
movements helin called algots estranged daughter to testify her 
fathers word was not to be trusted 
as exhibits the prosecutor has introduced a booklet and letter 
found in petterssons home and described as containing antipalme 
remarks 
the letter was written to a friend on trial who was denied 
permission to change his defense lawyer pettersson said in the 
letter thats the way it goes in palmes government 
the prosecution has tried to show pettersson had a deep hatred of 
all authority pettersson says he admired palme personally

a judge dismissed charges against two cousins 
accused of killing five wild horses because the indictment didnt 
specify which five horses the men allegedly shot 
us district judge edward c reed jr ordered the charges 
against eugene thacker and ronald hage dropped monday before the 
case went to the jury 
the charges described seven carcasses found in 1987 about 50 
miles from battle mountain the horses were decomposed and bullets 
or bullet holes were found in only five carcasses 
it would be easy to argue that somewhere in the seven horses 
were the five horses they are charged with killing as a matter of 
fair play i think the defendants the court and the jury have a 
right to know which horses the judge said 
reeds dismissal left the door open to the filing of more 
specific charges against the men assistant us attorney will 
mattly said he may do so 
thacker 27 a cowboy from imlay and hage 23 a miner from 
winnemucca were indicted in january after bureau of land management 
agents found the carcasses of more than 500 wild horses scattered 
over a wide area of federal land in northcentral nevada some 350 
miles northeast of reno 
many of the animals had been shot although others may have died 
of natural causes officials said some of the animals may have been 
dead for years wild horses roam the west under federal protection 
federal officials have never offered a motive for the killings of 
wild horses but theories have included resentment about wild horses 
competing with livestock for grass and the possibility that the 
animals were targets of opportunity like signs that get shot up 
along rural roads 
the blm is continuing its investigation of the slayings which 
are believed to have occurred in the summer of 1987 
the men were charged with misdemeanor violations of the federal 
wild and free roaming horse and burro act the charges carried up to 
six months in jail and 1000 fine each 
there are an estimated 26000 wild horses in nevada where the 
federal government owns most of the land

world war ii veteran john grillo spent 
the fourth of july as he does every other day in the company of 
hundreds of american flags 
grillo 78 collects and sells all kinds of flags from the 
business he runs out of his home but it was old glory he reveled in 
tuesday 
my goodness i think i have about 200 or 300 more than that 
if you count the grosses and grosses of 4by6inch and 6by9inch 
flags said grillo 
in honor of the holiday he hung 24 flags in front of his home 
two in his garden and another across the street 
as they ride by theyll see it said grillo although he 
conceded that not too many people were driving through his quiet 
section of mount vernon just north of new york city over the 
holiday 
grillo who did clerical work with the 8th air force in england 
during world war ii sells flags to clubs municipalities and 
ordinary citizens offering veterans an extragood deal 
although business picks up over the fourth he generally has a 
hard time making ends meet 
in the us there must be 15 or 20 major manufacturers and a 
fewer small ones they dont gross in sales what a toy or doll 
company would said grillo 
but it doesnt make me bitter he added this is a work of 
love 
the flag is our signature he said its everything we came 
from blood sweat and tears it reminds us of mother and dad and 
our ancestors its a beacon that lights the night darkness has 
never put it out its wholesome and good and clean its us 
when he thinks about the supreme court allowing the desecration 
of the flag he gets so mad he can barely get out the words 
they should send these characters on their way and have them 
blow their noses he says although its not clear whether he 
means flagburners or the supreme court justices

crashed into a house near the frenchbelgian border killing an 
18yearold man inside 
officials of the north atlantic treaty organization said us 
f15s intercepted the mig23 soon after it entered nato airspace and 
accompanied it until it crashed they said the soviet plane was not 
armed 
the soviet news agency tass said the plane went astray after the 
pilot ejected because of equipment failure during a training 
flight over poland it said the pilot survived 
tass said the soviet defense ministry was contacting 
governments of the countries whose airspace was crossed by the 
plane the nations were west germany the netherlands and belgium 
in brussels foreign minister mark eyskens summoned the soviet 
ambassador to his office for further explanations a spokesman for 
eyskens said 
at the defense department in washington air force maj mike 
stepp said the nato air defense system picked up the mig before it 
ever crossed into nato airspace and the f15s were scrambled 
and intercepted the aircraft 
when the american pilots caught the soviet plane they saw it 
had no canopy and no pilot he said 
west german government sources said in bonn that soviet officials 
apparently gave nato no warning that the plane was approaching and 
one questioned why warsaw pact defenses did not try to shoot it down 
we would like to know whether the soviets knew an aircraft was 
about to go west and why they never made any attempt to bring it 
down in their airspace he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the plane flew over some of western europes most densely 
populated areas and went down only miles from a cluster of urban 
areas along the border 
gaston bourlet of the belgian defense ministry said the mig 
crashed at 1037 am 437 am edt into a house near wevelgem 50 
miles west of brussels killing the young man 
firefighters fought the flames for more than an hour 
military officials in west germany the netherlands and belgium 
said the mig23 arrived over west germany at 942 am and there was 
no response to radio requests for identification the us air force 
f15s scrambled from soesterberg air force base in the central 
netherlands and caught the intruder over northern west germany 
after crossing into northern holland at 40000 feet the soviet 
fighter veered southward lost speed and altitude and crashed 55 
minutes after it was detected on nato radar screens they said 
lt col michael r gannon a spokesman at supreme headquarters 
allied powers europe near casteau belgium said nato officials had 
hoped the mig would head out over the north sea where the f15s 
could shoot it down safely 
another official at the headquarters said privately the decision 
was made not to attack over land because when it is shot in the 
air at high altitude you dont know where it is going 
mig23s can fly at supersonic speeds and within the warsaw pact 
are used only by the soviet and east german air forces the 
aircraft known in the west by its nato code name flogger was first 
shown in public at a moscow air show july 9 1967 
twelve versions of the mig23 have been produced

said in a statement from hiding tuesday that they had formed a 
coalition to reignite the fight for a freer china 
student leader wuer kaixi and top intellectual dissident yan 
jiaqi said the new organization would unite forces advocating 
political change in china 
the movement for democracy has flooded its banks like the 
yellow river they said it is unstoppable 
despite the unprecedented white terror the chinese student 
movement and the movement for democracy are still alive at present 
china is shrouded in silence but that just means that a new and 
bigger storm is brewing 
the associated press obtained a copy of the statement from hong 
kong activists who helped smuggle the two dissidents out of china 
last month a videotape of wuer reading the statement and yan 
adding brief comments was shown on television in hong kong and 
france where the two are believed hiding 
they said donations would fund what they referred to as a 
united committee for democratic movements and they called on 
people who love freedom around the world to provide support 
students in china and chinese living in foreign countries have 
established dozens of organizations to promote democracy causing 
internal splits in the movement activists have said they hope yan 
and wuer can put an end to these feuds 
the 1989 democracy movements is the most glorious page in 
chinese modern history the statement said the ideals of the 
movement have shown the world that chinese democracy will never 
die 
we refuse to adopt terrorist methods under any conditions 
the statement said adding that chinese revolutionary leader mao 
tsetungs adage that political power grows out of the barrel of a 
gun cannot lead china to true freedom liberty and democracy 
the dissidents proposed that the citizens killed during the june 
34 military crackdown in beijings tiananmen square be awarded the 
nobel peace prize one student leader chai ling of beijing normal 
university has already been nominated by two members of the 
norweigian parliament her whereabouts is unknown 
the statement called on all chinese to set aside sept 12 100 
days from the crackdown as a day of remembrance for those who died 
it also set june 4 as a day of national mourning for china 
wuer and yan led two prodemocracy organizations one for 
students and the other for intellectuals chinese authorities 
declared both organizations illegal and the two are among chinas 
most wanted fugitives 
the two men said they met with other dissidents from june 27 to 
monday to discuss the new organization they did not say where the 
meetings took place 
the meeting unanimously decided that the june 4 massacre is not 
the end of the 1989 chinese democratic movement but rather it is the 
beginning of a new consciousness of democracy in china they said 
the pair predicted the quick downfall of senior leader deng 
xiaoping premier li peng and president yang shangkun the group of 
hardliners who ordered the crackdown 
it wont take too long for a larger student movement and 
movement for democracy to once again arise in china they said 
a reactionary regime that can only be maintained by tanks and 
machine guns certainly will be smashed by this storm 
they said the assault on tiananmen square was not just a crime 
against chinas students and people but also a challenge against 
the basic principles of life and all humanity

premier li peng said tuesday that china achieved 
great victories in quelling prodemocracy protests and 
officials blamed ousted communist party chief zhao ziyang for 
letting corruption get out of hand 
fighting corruption was a major demand of the studentled 
protesters whom zhao supported thus the government has blamed 
zhao not only for supporting the movement but also for indirectly 
creating it by fostering the corruption that it attacked

us embassy where dissident fang lizhi is being protected while 
chinese police with automatic weapons patrolled outside the compound

bumbling panda 
the moderate zhao who opposed lis hardline approach to the 
protests was accused at a legislative meeting of fostering 
corruption by maintaining it was inevitable 
as zhao advocated the view the party relaxed its control on 
corruption which went rampant as a result yang ligong of the 
standing committee of the national peoples congress was quoted as 
telling congressional leaders 
zhao who was a rival of li was stripped of all his posts last 
month and accused by hardliners of trying to split the party by 
supporting the students 
yang suggested that this fallacy of zhaos should be thoroughly 
criticized and its evil influences be eliminated while the party 
and government should genuinely fight against corruption in order to 
win the peoples confidence the official xinhua news agency said 
the agency quoted li as saying china has achieved great 
victories in putting down the counterrevolutionary rebellion and 
the situation in beijing and other parts of the country is stable 
china will certainly overcome the temporary difficulties at 
present and do a better job in all fields the hardliner told a 
delegation of indian diplomats

states and other nations to refrain from imposing further economic 
sanctions on china which he said would seriously damage the colony

hotel to pay the boca raton mans repair bill 35665 plus 3850

the judge found that the club recognized the potential for flying 
golf balls because it had built a fence along part of the course 
had the club extended the fence to the driving range the ball might 
have been stopped instead of hitting massirmans car while he was 
driving on the street next to the golf course the judge said 
what right have they got to hit me with a golf ball 
massirman a golfer with a handicap of 10 asked last month the

solidarity claimed the spoils of its 
election victories tuesday when 259 of its parliament deputies and 
senators took seats in the national assembly beside the communist 
party that once suppressed it 
it was the first time since the late 1940s that an opposition 
group was installed in a soviet bloc legislature 
there were two great moments in my life the august 1980 
agreements and today said union chief lech walesa who had a 
place of honor at the front of the parliament or sejm for the 
opening session sitting opposite him a few yards away was communist 
leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
at the opening of the senate five hours later walesa and 
jaruzelski sat sidebyside at the front of the chamber and seemed 
to joke with one another 
jaruzelski banned solidarity in 1981 and held walesa prisoner for 
11 months along with thousands of other solidarity activists 
including many of the new senators and deputies the union was 
restored to legal status in april 
tuesday also saw the formal resignation of the government of 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski criticized for its economic 
performance that included soaring inflation and market shortages 
and behindthescene maneuverings over who will become president in 
a legislative vote not expected before thursday some solidarity 
sources suggested the vote could be later 
the president is empowered to name a prime minister to form a new 
government a process expected to take place after the visit of 
president bush next week 
theoretically rakowski could again be appointed prime minister 
in a televised talk tuesday night he defended his cabinets 
performance since it was installed nine months ago and asked the 
public to help the economy by working harder at their jobs 
the hopes of some poles have given way to disappointment he 
said i understand this although i dont accept it 
in the 460member sejm 161 solidarity members joined 299 
communist coalition members in taking a revised oath of office that 
no longer contains a reference to polands socialist development 
the sejm had been divided 65 percent to 35 percent between the 
coalition and solidarity as a result of a government and oppposition 
agreement reached in april 
in the senate which was freely elected in parliamentary voting 
june 4 and june 18 solidarity senators claimed 98 of 100 seats one 
seat was won by a procommunist businessman and one was vacant due 
to the death of a solidarity senatorelect 
sociologist mikolaj kozakiewicz of the communistallied peasant 
party was voted speaker of the sejm law professor andrzej 
stelmachowski a solidarity adviser close to walesa was chosen 
senate leader 
we are starting the term of the sejm which may pass into 
history as a great one it can fulfill the expectations of our 
society said zbigniew rudnicki the senior sejm member who 
presided until the election of kozakiewicz 
one is obliged to state the truth in this solemn moment that 
the breakthrough we are experiencing is to a major extent the 
work of the solidarity said 81yearold stanislaw stomma the 
eldest senator who opened the first meeting of a polish senate 
since before world war ii the old senate was dissolved in the 
communist takeover 
in the sejm communist and solidarity deputies cooperated in 
electing three deputy speakers one from the liberal wing of the 
communist party one from the communistallied democratic party and 
one from solidarity itself 
sejm deputy adam michnik the first opposition member to speak in 
either chamber asked the peasant party to nominate a candidate for 
speaker besides kozakiewicz so that our first election in our 
sejm could be an election and not just a vote again 
the peasant party declined and kozakiewicz won easily he 
promised i want to be speaker for the whole sejm and not any of 
its parts 
with rakowski and his cabinet staring emotionlessly from the 
gallery above kozakiewicz announced the prime minister had filed 
the governments resignation as tradition requires at the start of 
a new legislative term 
solidarity deputy jacek kuron a twodecade opposition veteran 
who spent nine years in prison for dissident activities criticized 
the governments performance saying its chaotic policy caused 
only social unrest 
deputy prime minister ireneusz sekula a communist deputy 
responded with a defense of price increases that drew protests from 
two more solidarity deputies before the session ended rakowski 
left his gallery seat and the building followed by most of his 
ministers 
the swearingin took place against the backdrop of an intense 
political struggle over who will be elected president by the 
lawmakers when the sejm and senate meet together as the national 
assembly 
jaruzelski said friday he did not want the post and recommended 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak but jaruzelski was believed 
to be reconsidering at the urging of some party members 
i havent taken a decision yet in the proper time 
jaruzelski said tuesday 
the key issue appeared to be whether jaruzelski would survive a 
vote in the national assembly where the communist coalition has a 
300259 majority solidarity lawmakers so far have said they would 
vote against him it was uncertain how many votes jaruzelski could 
count on 
state media continued to discuss jaruzelski as the strongest 
candidate for president and barely mentioned kiszczak there also 
were rumors of a deal with solidarity that could see solidarity 
given the prime ministers post in exchange for joining in the 
election of jaruzelski as president 
in the new parliament the ruling communist polish united workers 
party confronts the unprecedented situation of technically being a 
minority no longer able to dictate decisions to its two allied 
parties the peasant party and the democratic party 
the communists hold 173 of the sejms 460 seats with the 
increasingly restive peasants and democrats having 76 and 27 seats 
respectively and progovernment catholic groups the rest in the 
299member communist coalition 
the sejm is the main lawmaking chamber the senate will supervise 
its activities and have the right to veto any sejm acts the 
president will control the army and foreign relations

the londonbased international planned parenthood 
federation said tuesday the us supreme courts decision on 
abortions will harm women around the world but the vatican said it 
did not go far enough 
when america sneezes the rest of the world catches 
pneumonia said dr halfdan mahler secretarygeneral of the 
federation which has member groups in 128 countries 
he said the courts monday ruling was out of step with recent 
international trends which have tended to recognize new grounds of 
justification for abortion 
the court while not reversing its 1973 roe vs wade decision 
legalizing abortion in a 54 ruling made it possible for state 
governments to impose restraints and withhold funding for abortions 
in a statement mahler said the ruling was bound to worsen the 
plight of the millions of women around the world who annually die or 
are permanently impaired from unwanted pregnancies or from illegal 
abortions 
the federation estimates that 30 million to 55 million induced 
abortions occur worldwide annually and perhaps half are performed 
by unskilled people mainly in the developing world mostly in 
settings where abortion is legally restricted 
but the vatican newspaper said tuesday the decision did not go 
far enough because it did not outlaw abortion 
the problem of the suppression of conceived life remains 
headlined losservatore romano in a commentary on mondays ruling 
the article pointed to the importance and value of the 
ruling saying the decision rectified the 1973 ruling that a 
womans decision to have an abortion during the first three months 
of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor 
in canada justice minister doug lewis said the us supreme 
court ruling mirrors what has quietly happened in canada 
if anything this decision highlights what i have felt has been 
a shift in the focus in canada that hasnt really been noticed 
yet lewis said i think in canada we are seeing a shift in the 
importance of the issue from the federal level to the provincial 
level 
in an editorial the times of london said yesterdays supreme 
court decision has ensured that the most divisive issue in us 
politics will also be the most dominant 
in future most educated middleclass women will be able to 
command an abortion just as they do now by paying for private 
treatment by moving from restrictive states to free ones or both 
the poor and the uneducated will find it harder perhaps 
impossible

the supreme soviet voted vladimir m kamentsev down 
tuesday in his second try for approval as director of foreign 
economic policy even though the rules were made easier after his 
first rejection last week 
kamentsev 61 was criticized for thoughtlessly permitting the 
sale of raw materials and other national assets said tass the 
official news agency he has been chairman of the foreign economic 
commission for 2 years 
tass said the vote was 200 votes for kamentsev 172 against and 
47 abstentions short of the majority necessary for approval 
since the supreme soviet convened june 26 replacing the old 
rubberstamp parliament of the same name members have questioned 
most cabinet nominees and criticized many 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov withdrew the names of seven nominees 
after unfavorable committee hearings 
ryzhkov told the supreme soviet on tuesday he would offer another 
candidate but said he still thought highly of kamentsev tass 
reported 
by the rules in effect friday for the first vote kamentsev 
needed the support of a majority of all 542 members of the supreme 
soviet but got the votes of only 246 
the rules were changed this week so a nominee needs only a 
majority of the members voting but kamentsev still lost 
according to the tass report several deputies questioned his 
competence and his ability to make radical changes in foreign 
economic policy kamentsev has been criticized for problems in 
foreign trade during his tenure and tass said several deputies 
accused him of lacking a coherent program 
his commission was created in january 1987 as part of a 
reorganization of foreign trade agencies under president mikhail s 
gorbachevs economic reform program 
gorbachev has put increased emphasis on foreign trade in his 
efforts to reform an economy plagued by shortages and poor quality 
of consumer goods 
heated debate accompanied nikolai a pugins nomination to 
continue as minister of automotive and agricultural machine 
production but he was confirmed 
tass said legislators accused the ministry of failing to produce 
quality equipment for agriculture one of the weakest sectors of the 
soviet economy pugin proposed ending the monopoly of major plants 
producing agricultural machinery and expanding and updating 
production 
the supreme soviet approved incumbent konstantin katushev as 
minister of foreign economic relations with only 37 negative votes 
tass said and confirmed ivan s silayev as deputy premier for 
machine building apollon s systsov as aircraft industry minister 
and vitaly f konovalov as nuclear power minister

the army said tuesday that five arabs are 
charged with involvement in a plot to kill prime minister yitzhak 
shamir that reportedly is linked to yasser arafats mainstream plo 
faction fatah 
in the occupied lands tuesday israeli soldiers detained about 
200 suspected leaders of the palestinian uprising in a security 
sweep in the west bank and killed a 20yearold arab in the gaza 
strip the army said 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron meanwhile said the army has 
adopted new rules of opening fire allowing troops to shoot plastic 
bullets at masked palestinians the military command reported 
tuesdays shooting death brings to 540 the number of palestinians 
killed since the uprising against israeli occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip began in december 1987 twentythree israelis 
also have died 
arab doctors identified the slain man as wahel ismail hurt 
at least 19 palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with 
soldiers tuesday in the gaza strip arab hospital officials said 
the alleged assassination plot aimed at killing shamir last year 
during a campaign trip to the southern israeli town of rahat 
shortly before israels november election an army spokesman said 
it occurred before arafat announced in december that he renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
a military court in gaza last week charged four palestinians from 
the strip with witholding information about the plot weapons 
possession and having contacts with arafats outlawed fatah the 
spokesman said 
a fifth man ahmad abu madiran from rahat reportedly is charged 
with selling guns to the gazans he is charged separately and held 
in an israeli jail because he is an israeli citizen 
the army spokesman who is not identified under military rules 
said the plot seemed to be locally initiated 
but maariv daily newspaper quoted charge sheets in the case as 
alleging that gaza resident ahmad mediem masterminded the 
assassination plot in coordination with fatah representatives in 
jordan 
charge sheets say mediem asked fayez khur 26 of gaza to help 
him maariv said it said two defendants twin brothers fuazi and 
mohammed khur who are relatives of fayez khur heard mediem discuss 
the plot but did not report it to israeli authorities 
madiran the israeli citizen went to gaza at mediems request 
and sold two revolvers and ammunition clips and 30 bullets to fayez 
khur who delivered them to two unidentified fatah activists in 
gaza according to maariv 
the newspaper said the weapons were sold in january 1988 at 
least nine months before the alleged target date 
it did not say how the plot was uncovered and military spokesmen 
refused to discuss details 
maariv said the four gazans also are charged with killing two 
arabs suspected of collaborating with israeli security forces 
during predawn raids in the occupied west bank troops detained 
200 palestinians suspected of belonging to underground popular 
committees and strike forces the army command said 
soldiers raided at least seven west bank locations 
police said tuesday the motive for the stabbing death of israeli 
historian menachem stern in jerusalem two weeks ago apparently was 
palestinian nationalism they said they will soon release sketches 
of two arab youths suspected in the slaying 
palestinians participating in stonethrowing protests or 
underground activities often cover their faces with arab keffiyeh 
headdresses or makeshift masks 
on tuesday a military spokesman quoted shomron as telling a 
parliamentary committee it is permitted to detain masked people 
in gaza according to the procedure of arresting suspicious people 
under this procedure soldiers can fire if a suspect ignores 
repeated calls to stop first shooting in the air then at the 
legs then at the body 
israel tv quoted shomron as saying the new rules were designed to 
protect gazans threatened by the masked members of strike 
forces who physically attack laborers working in israel and seize 
their work permits 
leftwing legislators criticized the new regulations they 
smell of an illegal order and should be revoked said yossi 
sarid of the citizens rights movement others feared higher 
palestinian casualties saying many nonviolent palestinians wore 
masks as a nationalistic symbol 
today being masked means being fashionable said arye eliav 
of the leftleaning labor party everybody is masked today

a devout moslem who cut his daughters 
throat because she decided to become a jehovahs witness was 
convicted of murder tuesday and sentenced to life in prison 
a jury at birmingham crown court found abdul malik 56 guilty of 
murdering his 16yearold daughter pharbin last november in front 
of her mother and two younger sisters 
malik who came to britain from bangladesh in 1952 had pleaded 
innocent to murder defense lawyer michael wolkind seeking a 
manslaughter verdict claimed malik was provoked and blinded by his 
faith 
prosecutor james hunt said maliks standing in the community 
where he was on the committee of his mosque meant more to him than 
his daughters life what he undoubtedly did was to sacrifice her 
for his religion hunt declared 
the defendant said in the twoday trial that he intended only to 
frighten his daughter with the 12inch kitchen knife but his mind 
went out of control 
pharbin had left the family home because of arguments over the 
jehovahs witnesses and her jamaican boyfriend the jury was told 
but returned home the day before her death 
hazzava malik 15 testified that her mother pleaded with pharbin 
to recite a moslem prayer to her father when he brandished the 
knife but she refused and told him she would go to more jehovahs 
witnesses meetings 
he grabbed her by the hair and pushed her to the floor the 
sister said he pulled her hair back she had a lot of hair this

ecuadors ruling coalition formally split 
and the minister for industry resigned in a political crisis sparked 
by growing economic instability officials said tuesday 
the popular democracy party announced monday it was withdrawing 
its support from the government led by president rodrigo borja who 
took office in august 
the party had signed an alliance with borjas democratic left 
party when borja took office giving the ruling coalition a majority 
in congress 
i resigned according to the resolution of my party juan jose 
pons the minister for industry and commerce said tuesday a second 
popular democracy official juan pablo moncagatta president of the 
housing board also resigned 
vladimiro alvarez who was chosen to lead the popular democracy 
party in may had said the alliance with borjas government damaged 
the partys image ecuador an oilproducing opec member nation is 
confronting its first severe economic crisis in two decades 
inflation is at an annual rate of 84 percent 
alvarez said however his party will continue to support 
government legislation before congress the popular democracy party 
has seven congressmen while the democratic left has 30 meaning 
together they have a majority in the 71member legislative body 
petroleum financed an economic boom that propelled a nearfeudal 
society into the 20th century in just two decades created a 
prosperous middle class and eased social tensions but estimates are 
that by the turn of the century the oil that brought affluence to a 
poor nation will have run out 
but even before the oil runs out ecuador is experiencing hard 
times oil exports currently account for 50 percent of the nations 
income down from 75 percent in the early 1980s low world oil 
prices in 1986 and a major earthquake a year later that temporarily 
halted oil exports plunged the country into a financial crisis 
borja who began a fouryear term in august 1988 has attempted 
to resolve the economic problems by imposing unpopular austerity 
measures

acting like old political pros solidarity 
deputies heaped scorn on the governments economic performance on 
tuesday at the opening of the first parliament with independent 
opposition in 40 years 
the discussion came after the communist government formally 
submitted its resignation to the sejm or parliament which now 
counts 161 solidarity deputies among its 460 members following 
junes partially democratic elections 
in his first speech as a deputy solidarity veteran jacek kuron 
took on prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski who looked on from a 
balcony 
kuron toughened by nine years in jail for opposition activities 
told the chamber that solidarity deputies had been tracking 
government policy with deep concern 
he said the government refrained from increasing prices during 
the election campaign but let loose a huge array of price rises 
once communist authorities suffered a humiliating defeat and 
solidarity scored a triumph in the june vote 
poles commonly refer to their economy as a catastrophe consumers 
face an inflation rate of 100 percent price increases in the last 
two weeks raised the cost of sugar cigarettes alcohol gasoline 
refrigerators and washing machines 
the value of the dollar polands most valued currency 
fluctuated wildly last week due to uncertainty over further price 
rises the rate stabilized after the government announced a 
monthlong price and wage freeze as of july 1 
not resolved yet is whether solidarity will enter a government 
and take part of the responsiblity for seeking a way out of the 
economic crisis 
kuron attacked the government for announcing increases not agreed 
upon with trade unions and for failing to provide safeguards for 
people on pensions and fixed incomes such a chaotic policy caused 
only social unrest he said 
deputy prime minister ireneusz sekula defended government policy 
he said government expenditures were running ahead of revenue and so 
prices were raised on cigarettes and alcohol since the government 
earns tax revenue on those items 
solidarity deputy ryszard bugaj a specialist on economic 
affairs found sekulas explanation unacceptable 
another solidarity deputy ryszard brzuzy of belchatow where a 
large power plant was hit by a strike this year called on the 
government to present a detailed report on its activities before 
resigning 
the faltering economy is emerging as a major issue bad 
investments based on western credits have burdened poland with a 38 
billion foreign debt 
poles themselves keep at home billions of dollars more earned 
abroad or sent by relatives because they dont trust 
governmentrun banks 
solidarity and official economists agree that the task of the 
next government whether formed by solidarity or the communist 
coalition will be to build confidence among poles and foreign 
creditors 
solidarity has been actively pursuing foreign credits since june 
for specific investment projects as well as for buying consumer 
products and foodstuffs to satisfy consumer demand while reforms are 
being implemented

ministers of the new conservativecommunist 
governing coalition said tuesday the outgoing government took with 
it confidential files in a move that will hinder a promised cleanup 
of its scandals 
conservative tzannis tzannetakis who was sworn in on sunday as 
head of the coalition government said not a single file remained in 
former premier andreas papandreous office 
he said in a radio interview that one of papandreous advisers 
told him that when problems were solved we tore up the documents 
and therefore there are no documents we solved all problems 
the government of the conservative new democracy party and the 
communist coalition of the left and progress was formed after no 
party won an absolute majority in june 18 elections to the 
300member unicameral parliament 
the coalition government expected to last about three months 
said its aim is to cleanse the scandalridden government 
papandreous panhellenic socialist movement finished second in 
the elections and failed to win a third term in office with only 
125 parliamentary seats new democracy won 145 places and the 
coalition won 28 the remainder went to a small conservative party 
and an independent party 
a 200 million financial scandal allegedly involving ministers in 
papandreous government and 70yearold papandreous open affair 
with a woman half his age while he was married contributed to his 
downfall he has been hospitalized with a heart and kidney condition 
they took the state home with them the independent daily 
ethnos said in an editorial the theft of documents constitutes a 
crime against the state and concerns not only the people but 
parliament and the judiciary which will be assigned to the 
cleanup 
the rightwing daily eleftheros typos said it had confidential 
papers belonging to the commerce ministry it said the documents 
were found in a garbage can outside the home of former commerce 
minister yannos papantoniou 
new justice minster fotis kouvelis told reporters the cleanup 
would be hampered by the lack of documents 
the race for the cleanup has begun he said and the first 
great obstacle is the lack of files 
papapandreous administration broke longstanding tradition when 
outgoing ministers were not present to pass on their offices to 
successors 
the only socialist official who maintained the custom was former 
defense minister yannis haralambopoulos who said this particular 
ministry could not afford a power vacuum for a single moment 
also tuesday athanasios tsaldaris a veteran lawmaker and member 
of the conservative new democracy party was elected president of 
the parliament 
the 68yearold tsaldaris has been a member of parliament since 
1963 except for a sevenyear hiatus when a military dictatorship

the national education association on tuesday 
adopted a resolution condemning state and federally mandated 
choice programs permitting parents to choose their childrens 
public schools saying it damages quality education for all students 
but the union is not opposing such plans if adopted by local 
authorities on their own 
the huge teachers union in its first policy statement on the 
hot education issue said it opposes wide requirements for such 
programs and continues to support alternative programs in the 
public schools for specific purposes 
the nea also plans to establish criteria for evaluating choice 
plans according to a newbusiness item adopted monday 
officials have said nea supports magnet schools alternative 
schools and other options 
the resolution approved tuesday at the groups convention was 
more stringent than several proposals on the table but less 
restrictive than others in that it left a loophole for choice plans 
adopted by district officials 
choice plans enable parents to pick their childs school 
president bush has called the concept a cornerstone of education 
reform contending that competition will force all schools to 
improve 
however the nea and other groups say choice plans have the 
potential to weaken and resegregate the schools left behind 
particularly plans that dont provide student transportation and 
that reduce tax dollars to schools abandoned by students 
education undersecretary ted sanders said through spokesman tom 
lyon the vote was very disappointing all students deserve access 
to a quality education and choice will make that happen but 
apparently the nea doesnt even understand the concept 
the president and the secretary have called choice the 
cornerstone for rebuilding american education parents want choice 
students need it now sanders said 
in another development announced at the convention tuesday 
school districts in four states will experiment with close teacher 
involvement in fundamental changes 
one example in the learning laboratories program in memphis 
tenn innercity schools will be controlled by a council on which 
teachers will outnumber administrators 
in westerly ri a computer will link schools parents and 
local government 
the other projects are in chaska minn and marshalltown iowa 
the 8500 delegates at the neas representative assembly have 
been voting on policies and resolutions since convening on sunday 
among those approved the 2millionmember teacher union 
will request television stations and newspapers to put the names 
of states on their weather maps this was proposed by the montana 
delegation in the interests of geographic literacy 
will notify president bush of its disappointment that he did not 
accept an invitation to speak at its convention and will ask that he 
meet with the groups newly elected leaders to discuss the future 
of our nations children 
joined many other education groups in condemning channel one a 
tv news program with commercials that is designed for classroom use 
the group called it an attempt to gain control of students for 
commercial purposes in exchange for free equipment such as vcrs 
for schools 
will draft a blueprint for an aggressive 199091 campaign to win 
higher salaries for teachers the plan is to include tv spots 
dramatic press conferences and newspaper and magazine articles 
focusing on the dedication of public school employees and the need 
to reward them with professional pay 
the union contends that reforms made without teacher input are 
destined to fail the learning laboratories program is designed 
to promote sitebased decisionmaking with teachers as major players 
to qualify as learning labs nea affiliates in each of the 
participating districts have had to demonstrate that their local 
school board and superintendent are committed to districtwide 
change 
the initial learning lab experiments are expected to last at 
least five years each the nea has set aside 280000 for the 
project this year the money will go for technical support and 
5000 grants to each district the districts are in 
memphis which is closing innercity schools and reopening them 
as democratically controlled school communities each governed by a 
council of three teachers two administrators two parents and one 
local resident 
chaska minn which has created a review panel that gives 
grants to teachers for innovative approaches to learning including 
one experiment in which three teachers have been elected to be 
principals of their elementary schools while continuing to teach 
marshalltown iowa which is eliminating central office 
decisionmaking on instruction and designating teachers to create 
teacher teams responsible for decisions on key curriculum and 
resource issues 
westerly ri which is using computers to link schools to 
parents the town government and educational resources in the school 
district 
the union also passed a resolution saying that it is deeply 
concerned about boston universitys takeover of the chelsea 
mass school system and said state and local governments should 
provide the help needed to deal with systems like chelseas 
the union also approved a series of recommendations to the 
national board for professional teaching standards a panel which is 
developing standards for voluntary teacher certification 
among other things nea is demanding that the board not seek a 
link between certification and compensation and offer only one kind 
of certificate

flash floods forced hundreds of fourth of july campers out of the 
blue ridge mountains of north carolina and some had to be ferried 
across swollen streams by kayak after more than a week of heavy rain 
across the south 
hundreds more were still out of their homes elsewhere because of 
flooding caused by the remnants of tropical storm allison 
the death toll since allison sloshed ashore in texas a week rose 
to 13 one in north carolina five in mississippi four in texas 
and three in louisiana 
at least 700 louisiana homes have been flooded and some 500 
people remained flooded out of their homes in liberty county texas 
authorities said 
campers were evacuated from three steeply mountainous counties of 
western north carolina one woman drowned when her tent was washed 
away but her husband was rescued divers searched for the body and 
those of possible other victims 
several agencies and volunteers used kayaks to take campers 
across rapidly rising streams 
i think its the worst its been here since the flood of 
1940 said tom huskins jr general manager of grandfather 
mountain near linville and its still falling hard 
water from land harbor lake flowed over the top of an earthen 
dam raising fears of a dam break campgrounds below the dam were 
flooded and were evacuated 
state engineers said later in the day that the dam on the small 
lake appeared to be safe at least for the time being if the rain 
stops soon said jack hughes emergency management coordinator for 
avery county however while the rain slackened tuesday afternoon 
showers were expected to continue through wednesday hughes said 
emergency personnel were told to stay near their radios through the 
night 
the remnants of allison had dumped more than 15 inches of rain 
on the mountains since monday causing some mud slides the national 
weather service said up to 2 inches of rain were likely with up to 
4 inches in some areas 
most july fourth activities had been canceled in the mountains 
which were jammed with campers despite the weather 
in the nearby western tip of south carolina up to 10 inches of 
rain had fallen in 24 hours closing some roads 
the rain was caused by tropical air lingering over the tennessee 
valley area outside of the normal weather train making 
forecasting difficult said national weather service meteorologist 
tom thorpe in columbia sc he said his best guess was that it 
would stay in the area for least another day 
farther back along allisons disorganized track more rain fell 
tuesday on mississippi where some cotton and soybean crops have 
been ruined and two counties were declared disaster areas 
some lakes and streams continued to rise but residents forced 
from more than 200 homes over the weekend were able to return and 
begin cleaning up 
much of central louisiana remained under water after a week of 
thunderstorms northern and central louisiana got up to 25 inches of 
rain last week 
the water was still rising in places 
its still coming up 18 to 20 inches a day farmer richard 
daigre said of bayou rigolette the only outlet for a lake that was 
more than 12 feet above flood stage his recently planted fields 
were under water 
in texas lowlying areas along the trinity river remained under 
water tuesday the town of dayton lakes was was accessible by boat 
only 
in dallas about 12000 customers were still without electricity 
after a storm containing 90 mph wind knocked down utility poles

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who seeks a 
new revolution at home visited the site tuesday where a mob stormed 
the bastille 200 years ago in the uprising that swept away the 
french monarchy 
he began a threeday visit to france by joining president 
francois mitterrand for lunch a first round of talks and a 
demonstration of europes new highdefinition television 
gorbachev and his wife raisa then went to the place de la 
bastille where they shook hands with parisians and tourists at the 
scene of the assault on the infamous prison july 14 1789 
thousands of people crowded up to barricades placed around the 
spacious square many shouting gorby gorby as did crowds on 
his visit to west germany last month 
reporters surrounded the soviet leader at the steps of the new 
opera building to be inaugurated next week in the presence of 
president bush and other western leaders as a high point of 
celebrations marking the revolutions bicentennial 
unable to reach more than a few wellwishers the gorbachevs 
climbed back into their sovietmade zil limousine on the other side 
of the square however they climbed out again 
dr jeanpierre mach a parisian cancer researcher said he came 
to see gorbachev out of admiration 
no matter what happens he will be remembered by history as an 
exceptional man a man who has transformed hate to trust 
gorbachev has described his economic and social reform program 
called perestroika or restructuring as a revolution without the 
bullets 
in a dinner toast tuesday night gorbachev said the soviets 
feel like full participants in your festivities in part 
because perestroika also is a revolution 
he said europe had a chance to move beyond divisions that 
resulted from world war ii 
the postwar period is over today a way toward a stable peace 
is opening before us based not on a balance of forces but on a 
balance of real and correctly understood interests europe holds 
this chance in its hands 
mitterrand said problems remained to be solved before the soviet 
leaders idea of a common european home could be made real 
between the two halves of europe there are still many 
obstacles to clear away distrust to dissipate barriers to knock 
down before the inhabitants of the future home can feel at ease and 
confident there he said 
for the french revolutionaries in 1789 the bastille was both a 
hated symbol of oppression and a military garrison where they hoped 
to find guns and ammunition for defense against an expected attack 
by the troops of king louis xvi 
they found only seven prisoners and a small stock of weapons but 
the day went into history as the most memorable of the long and 
confused revolution 
marxistleninist doctrine sees the french revolution as a 
landmark in the international class struggle along with the 1917 
bolshevik revolution that overthrew the czar 
although gorbachev found a warm welcome at the bastille more 
than 100 people gathered at the paris stock exchange to demand that 
the soviet government redeem russian government bonds issued before 
the revlution 
at the soviet embassy about 2000 armenian emigres demanded a 
meeting with gorbachev to discuss the grievances of their countrymen 
back home 
the gorbachevs descended smiling from their ilyushin62 jetliner 
at orly airport where they were greeted by mitterrand and his wife 
danielle 
in their first discussions which lasted an hour the two men 
spoke of eastwest relations gorbachevs reforms and conflicts in 
the middle east mitterrand spokesman hubert vedrine told a joint 
news briefing 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet spokesman said they might issue 
a joint statement appealing for peace in lebanon and expressing 
support for arab league efforts to end the countrys long civil war 
he said the two countries were discussing an arrangement under 
which more natural gas would be sold to france with the proceeds 
used to buy french consumer goods to relieve chronic shortages in 
the soviet union 
after lunch mitterrand showed gorbachev the highdefinition tv 
system intended to compete with us and japanese versions 
highdefinition tv images are being broadcast as a demonstration 
from frances tdf1 satellite and mitterrand is eager to sell the 
soviets on the european system 
in a separate meeting foreign ministers roland dumas and eduard 
a shevardnadze signed agreements to fight drugs ease access to 
public archives prevent incidents at sea and promote youth exchange 
programs

nazi collaborator jean leguay charged with 
committing crimes against humanity has died in a paris hospital 
his lawyer said tuesday he was 79 
leguay died saturday after a yearlong battle with liver cancer 
his lawyer yves jaffre said 
leguay was a senior police official in the vichy government 
which collaborated with the nazis during their world war ii 
occupation of france he faced two charges for aiding in the 
deportation of french jews but neither came to trial 
in 1979 he was charged for his role in the july 1942 roundup of 
12884 jews including 4051 children who were gathered in a 
paris cycling stadium the velodrome dhiver and deported to nazi 
death camps 
the second set of charges filed in 1986 involved the 
deportation of 444 jews from paris in august 1942 
leguay was deputy police chief in the occupied zone at the time 
of the deportations 
when he was charged in 1979 leguay issued a statement saying he 
never had any concern from 1940 to 1944 other than protecting the 
french from their occupants he was detained briefly in that year 
then released pending trial 
serge klarsfeld the french lawyer who led the effort to bring 
criminal charges against leguay described him as a political 
police officer charged with negotiations with the germans 
klarsfeld accused leguay of persuading the germans to include jewish 
children as well as adults in the roundups 
lawyer jaffre said leguay did nothing but obey the orders of 
the interior secretary at the time that the investigation 
dragged on for 10 years clearly proved there was nothing in the 
dossier he said 
under french law there is no time limit on prosecutions for 
crimes against humanity

independence day lived up to its name for abe 
stolar who made an emotional return to his hometown for the first 
time since his family emigrated to the sovet union nearly 60 years 
ago 
i really cant find words the 77yearold stolar told a 
crowd of wellwishers and reporters as he stepped off a flight 
tuesday evening at ohare international airport 
stolar was traveling from israel where he emigrated earlier this 
year after a long fight to leave the soviet union 
he said he had longed to return to the city he and his family 
left for the soviet union when he was a teenager but feared it 
might never happen 
i was an alien there for all the 58 years i was there said 
the native chicagoan it was a crime they didnt let me out 
he plans to get reacquainted with the city of his birth and to 
tour the nation taking in some baseball junk food and other 
allamerican fare 
sen paul simon dill who helped secure stolars release from 
the soviet union was on hand for the welcome home he presented 
stolar and his sovietborn wife gita rozovskaya a bouquet of red 
roses an american flag and a tshirt reading chicago 
the senator called stolar a real hero a guy who has stood up 
for freedom 
it is fitting abe should return home to chicago on the fourth 
of july simon said 
stolar overwhelmed with emotion searched for words to express 
his feelings 
what can i say really he said i cant say anything but 
thank you thank you thank you 
stolar whose parents immigrated from russia in 1910 was raised 
on the northwest side but when he was 19 in 1931 the family 
returned to their homeland believing the bolshevik revolution had 
created a workers paradise 
it didnt turn out that way 
stolars father died in the stalinist purges and his mother and 
sister were sent to camps in siberia stolar was wounded by a german 
hand grenade and lost the sight in one eye 
he served in the red army during world war ii then worked as a 
translator and announcer for radio moscow but after nearly five 
decades in the soviet union stolar wanted out 
his exit proved more difficult than his entry 
promises that he could leave were repeatedly broken by soviet 
officials who refused to let the whole family leave the country 
after a 14year fight stolar finally won freedom in march he 
his wife son daughterinlaw and two grandchildren headed for 
israel where they now live 
we feel pampered by fate after all those disgusting wasted 
stupid years stolar wrote in a recent letter to simon as so 
many people have said before me what a pity it comes so late in 
life 
on visiting chicago he wrote it will be a look at the old 
town which will really be all new to me that few visitors though 
native born can enjoy 
his agenda includes a baseball game at wrigley field which looks 
pretty much the same except for the new lights that will allow him 
to catch wednesdays night game between the cubs and the san diego 
padres 
stolar dreamed of one day staying in the fancy 3000room 
stevens hotel a dream that will come true 
the hotel now the chicago hilton and towers has offered the 
stolars its 23rdfloor chicago suite despite recent refurbishing 
the grand ballroom and grand salon glittering with mirrors and gold 
leaf are virtually unchanged said assistant manager peter borup 
no special menu is planned during stolars weeklong stay hes 
a junkfood junkie who likes hamburgers and hot dogs borup said 
other stops on the stolars 12city us tour include anchorage 
alaska and miami theyll end the trip with an aug 13 visit to los 
angeles 
their visit was arranged and financed by chicago action for 
soviet jewry

interior minister wolfgang schaeuble 
said tuesday that membership in rightwing extremist groups climbed 
a dramatic 128 percent last year and continues to rise 
he also expressed concern about the increasingly popular 
ultrarightist republican party headed by former nazi ss soldier 
franz schoenhuber schaeuble said many republican pronouncements 
are similar to speech used by representatives of extremism 
schoenhuber says his party is not extremist but speaks out for 
german interests and supports constitutional law 
membership in organizations officially labeled rightwing 
extremist including neonazi groups climbed to 28300 last year 
from 25200 the year before schaeuble said those figures do not 
include the estimated 13000 republicans whose party has not been 
officially labeled rightwing extremist 
schaeuble said membership in rightwing extremist groups 
continues to grow in this nation of 61 million and may have already 
surpassed 30000 
the republicans concentrate on nationalist themes they advocate 
radical reductions in the number of asylumseekers allowed to stay 
in west germany and strict limits on foreign workers 
the party has made strong election showings in the past six 
months including winning its first seats in the european parliament 
schaeuble told reporters that state and federal officials will 
meet in september to examine whether the republicans should be 
labeled a rightwing extremist organization if that happened the 
party would be kept under surveillance by the verfassungschutz the 
countrys main domestic intelligence agency

united farm workers president cesar chavez 
told more than 5000 striking united mine workers and supporters who 
rallied on the fourth of july that their fight was just and people 
never lose a just fight 
chavez told the miners they faced economic tyranny from pittston 
coal group inc similar to the tyranny faced by american colonists 
under king george iii that led to the declaration of independence 
213 years ago 
the best place to spend the fourth of july is here because the 
struggle for freedom continues chavez speaking from a flatbed 
truck told the gathering in a muddy field in the heart of the 
southwest virginia coalfields 
we come from the battlefields of california to the battleground 
of these coalfields said chavez he urged strikers to continue 
employing nonviolent tactics of civil disobedience and asked the 
crowd to join his unions boycott of grapes 
your struggle is our struggle this is a just fight and people 
never lose a just fight he said 
during the rally umw vice president cecil roberts said the 
national labor relations board has declared the strike to be over 
unfair labor practices committed by pittston rather than over 
economic matters such as wages and benefits 
roberts said the ruling by the boards general counsel means 
striking miners will get their jobs back when a contract is 
eventually signed 
the determination brings additional pressure on pittston to 
resume contract negotiations roberts said talks broke off last 
month and pittston declared negotiations at an impasse 
pittston president michael odom said company officials will meet 
with nlrb representatives to review the allegations of unfair labor 
practices and may fight the ruling before an administrative law 
judge 
our position is that the board is in error odom said this 
is clearly an economic strike one over terms and conditions of the 
contract 
odom said the nlrb ruling will have no effect on negotiations 
the strike by 1900 umw members against pittston coal group 
operations in virginia west virginia and kentucky has spawned 
sympathy strikes that have idled some 37000 workers in several 
coalmining states 
at least a thousand of those wildcat strikers attended the rally 
dan emmons of booneville ind who walked off his job at a 
peabody coal co mine said earlier that all umw members have a 
stake in the strike against pittston which is trying to break away 
from an industrywide contract with the union and win concessions 
if we lose here its just going to be a chain reaction jumping 
from company to company he said 
these boys need help down here said emmons the main thing 
we can do is keep their morale up and let them know theyre not 
standing alone 
miners said the wildcat strikes which began june 12 and are 
officially unauthorized by the union would continue until a 
contract is signed 
theyll last until this is settled said larry heck of 
booneville also a peabody employee 
roger myers a umw executive board member for indiana said about 
125 cars each carrying three or four hoosier mine workers left 
southern indiana on sunday to attend the rally 
since the wildcat strikes began 2 weeks ago more than half of 
indianas 1750 striking coal workers have traveled to virginia in 
three separate caravans to show their support myers said 
those trips have made their resolve just that much stronger 
myers said 
they go down there and break bread so to speak with the 
strikers its just been unbelievable the way its buoyed everyones 
spirits he said 
every union man should be there said buster varney a strike 
captain for umw local 5737 in stone ky 
court orders have curtailed the unions strike activities around 
pittston mines and processing plants so the umw has turned to 
rallies as an outlet for the idled miners tuesdays rally was the 
third in the heart of the southwestern virginia coal fields in three 
weeks

britains ancient blasphemy laws will not be 
changed because it would be difficult and could damage relations 
among religious groups the home office minister john patten said in 
a letter to moslem leaders on tuesday 
patten also reiterated the governments lack of authority to ban 
salman rushdies novel the satanic verses which many moslems 
believe blasphemes islam he stressed the british authors right to 
freedom of expression 
patten urged the 1 million moslems and other ethnic groups to 
participate more fully in british society saying no room exists for 
separation or segregation 
moslems and others want the blasphemy law extended to reflect 
britains multicultural society the law covers only christianity 
specifically the church of england and has been used in courts only 
twice in the past 67 years 
the difficulties in redefining what should or should not be 
blasphemous would be immense patten wrote 
should protection be extended to all faiths including the very 
minor or very obscure should it extend only to faiths believing in 
one god or to major or mainstream faiths only i believe there is 
no equitable just or right answer to these questions 
patten said the government also feared a rush of litigation 
which would damage relations between faiths 
he said christians no longer rely on the law preferring to 
recognize that the strength of their own belief is the best armor 
against mockers and blasphemers 
patten acknowledged the continuing controversy over the satanic 
verses and said the government understands how much hurt and 
anxiety that book has caused and that insults particularly to 
a deeply held faith are not easily forgotten or forgiven 
rushdie born into a moslem family in india has been in hiding 
since feb 14 when irans late leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
ordered he be killed for blaspheming islam khomeini died on june 3 
but the death sentence remains 
moslems say his book blasphemes islam by associating the prophet 
mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting that the koran islams 
holy book was mohammeds invention not allahs own work 
kalim siddiqui director of the moslem institute said the 
government has learned nothing from the controversy 
there is no such thing as absolute freedom of expression or 
speech he said we enjoy our freedom within certain limits 
he said moslem leaders will meet to consider a response to 
pattens letter 
we cannot live in this country together with the satanic 
verses and salman rushdie he said they will have to go 
liaqat hussain general secretary of the council of mosques in 
bradford england said we will continue to protest and carry on 
our campaign within the framework of the law

the man whose murder conviction was thrown out 
after it was questioned in the movie the thin blue line is suing 
the producer of the documentary for rights to his life story 
randall dale adams lawsuit claims producer errol morris lost his 
rights to adams life story in december 1988 when he failed to 
exercise a twoyear option purchased from adams for 10 in december 
1986 
adams was convicted of murdering a dallas police officer and 
served 12 years in prison before an appeals court overturned the 
conviction the court acted after the movie was released and it 
became apparent that it was unlikely adams could have been the 
triggerman adams was freed from prison in march and prosecutors 
declined to retry him 
morris said he is hurt and upset that adams is suing him 
after all he went through to get him released 
i worked very very hard for a number of years to see that 
justice was done in this case and to see that randall adams walked 
out of prison morris said recently 
the producer said his profits from the film which was not widely 
distributed were nil and said he is still paying off debts from 
the movie 
the simple thing is that when i met randall adams nobody cared 
about the case no one wanted to investigate it no one wanted to 
write about it morris said 
adams attorney randy schaffer said adams 40 is not seeking 
royalties only a declaration that he owns the right to his own life 
story so he can pursue offers estimated in the neighborhood of six 
figures 
they think they bought adams lock stock and barrel for 10 
and thats unconscionable schaffer said he is grateful but 
what is he supposed to do hes got offers to do a book and a 
movie 
district judge felix salazar on monday postponed a hearing on the 
lawsuit filed two weeks ago because the defendants filed a motion to 
move the proceedings to federal court

oliver north who held the nation spellbound 
with his testimony on the irancontra affair two years ago stands 
before a judge wednesday who could put him behind bars for 10 years 
the special prosecutor in the irancontra affair has asked us 
district judge gerhard gesell to impose a prison term on the 
45yearold retired marine lieutenant colonel on the grounds that he 
lied and showed no remorse at his trial 
lawyers for the former national security aide who quarterbacked 
the sale of arms to iran in 1985 and diverted the profits to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels replied that it would be cruel and 
unjust to incarcerate north 
north was convicted on three felony counts and acquitted on nine 
others including a charge that he lied to congress something he 
admitted in testimony 
his convictions were for aiding the obstruction of congress 
through helping to construct a false chronology of the affair for 
destroying sensitive government documents and for accepting a 
13800 home security system from arms dealer richard v secord who 
is awaiting trial on irancontra charges 
defense attorney brendan v sullivan jr said in court papers 
earlier this week that the prosecutions request for imprisonment 
demonstrates that it will stop at nothing in its effort to crush 
oliver north and that sending him to prison would only encourage 
high government officials to let subordinates take the blame for 
legally or politically risky ventures 
during six days of testimony at the trial north said he acted at 
the direction of his superiors including thenpresident reagan 
since his conviction he has continued to appear on the lecture 
circuit reportedly being paid 25000 an appearance

that he hoped panamanians someday will not allow a dictator to 
tell them which rights they can or can not have 
i would hope that the sacrifices made by many people to obtain 
our freedoms in the united states serve as an example to latin 
americans i hope that some day they too have an opportunity to 
have the same basic freedoms we have said brig gen mark 
cisneros 
as a hispanic i want to see hispanics get the same rights we 
have those freedoms should be basic to every country because 
everybody aspires to the same freedoms that should not be demeaned

washington was interfering in panamas affairs when american troops 
recently held a drill at madden dam a panama canal installation 
he said the drill was part of an exercise i ordered to defend 
the canal under the terms of the cartertorrijos treaties we have 
the right to do it

the waterway since the atlantic and pacific oceans it links stand 
at different levels

the right to defend the canal until the year 2000 when ownership is

cisneros dismissed accusations by noriega that the united states 
intends to invade panama and avoid honoring the canal treaties

misinformation

maj gen alexander griyenko spoke at a news conference at which 
reporters were shown photographs of charred bodies destroyed and 
burned houses and smashed cars all done by extremists in that 
central asian republic the soviet news agency tass said 
griyenko said three soldiers sustained gunshot wounds and 161 
were injured he added that in all 511 interior ministry 
servicemen were wounded in unrest that hit various parts of the 
nation since february 
the general said nearly 10000 people were arrested in the unrest 
in the predominantly moslem uzbekistan republic 9092 for curfew 
violations and 700 for breaking the peace about 10000 guns were 
confiscated he said 
griyenko reported that 754 houses 28 state facilities and 275 
cars were burned or looted 
he said interior ministry troops fired only at specific 
extremists as they were trying to attack the soldiers and that 
the use of arms in all cases was absolutely justified as shown by 
an investigation conducted by the prosecutors office tass added 
the general is a member of the military council of the ministrys 
300000strong forces 
earlier reports put the number of fergana dead at about 100 the 
rioting arson and murders began in early may and continued into 
june pitting ethnic uzbeks against the meskhi turk minority which 
was forcibly resettled to the region from the southern georgia 
republic by dictator josef stalin in 1944 
authorities pledged last month to create 200000 jobs clean up 
polluting factories and grow more food in the region to stem the 
economic and environmental problems blamed for much of the unrest 
according to griyenko weapons were not used against people 
during other mass ethnic disturbances in nagornokarabakh sumgait 
georgia and kazakhstan 
griyenko said ministry troops are assigned to curb violations of 
public order if they are largescale pose a threat to life 
disorganize the work of enterprises and are directed at destroying 
state public or personal property 
the law allows these troops to use arms only as an extreme 
measure 
regarding riotcontrol gear griyenko said the soldiers 
equipment included bulletproof vests plastic and metal shields 
rubber truncheons all types of shortbarrel firearms water cannon 
and tear gas 
last year interior ministry forces used tear gas more than 1000 
times but there were no fatalities or cases of a longterm effect 
on health he said 
on april 9 20 people were killed when soviet troops attacked 
rioters in tbilisi georgia georgians said the troops used a potent 
form of tear gas

of leftwing wouldbe flagburners were met by 60 rightwing 
flagprotecting skinheads a small group of performance artists in 
chicago hung a large us flag between two trees doused it with 
charcoal starter and burned it 
elsewhere abortion rights activists burning an american flag in 
front of the federal building in minneapolis were attacked by three 
waiters from a nearby topless bar police said one waiter was 
arrested 
activist robert say mcintosh 45 of little rock said he 
would make a third attempt to burn the flag at the capitol on sunday 
to show that there is not justice for all in the united states 
his son robert mcintosh jr 27 said he managed to set a flag 
on fire in a capitol corridor but nobody saw it the younger 
mcintosh was among at least five people arrested by police after two 
shoving matches on the capitol steps 
the us supreme court ruled last month that flag burning is a 
constitutionally protected right of free speech 
the younger mcintosh also of little rock was injured when he 
and companions emerged from the building carrying a charred flag and 
tried to burn it in a metal trash barrel he received a bloody gash 
on the forehead and was taken in handcuffs to a little rock police 
car 
the younger mcintosh was charged with disorderly conduct and 
resisting arrest and was arranging 350 bond said pulaski county

freedom of speech is opening your mouth and talking not 
burning a flag another veteran said

but police took no action said assistant police chief william 
murray 
the flagburning demonstration in new york city was attended by 
about 15 chinese demonstrators who have been staging a hunger 
strike at the united nations to protest the crushing of 
prodemocracy activists in china 
chinese journalist justin yu noting the destruction of a statue 
of the goddess of democracy erected by prodemocracy protesters 
in beijings tiananmen square said the demonstrators tuesday 
didnt want another symbol of democracy the flag to be destroyed

monkees pop group and held a sign reading we are the daydream 
believers referring to a title of a monkees song

still have it said patrick cannon 28 
in minneapolis one man was arrested and several protesters 
suffered scrapes and bruises but no one was injured seriously said

mondays us supreme court decision giving states freedom to impose 
more restrictions on abortions

from the solid gold nightclub came across the street and attacked 
them scott said 
some protesters had first burned a cardboard replica of an 
american flag sheri smith of action for abortion rights one of the

most of the fireworks being set off to 
celebrate american freedom this week were shipped from china before 
that countrys bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators a 
fireworks expert says 
the chinese have targeted the us fireworks market since 
relations improved during the nixon administration and now dominate 
the market said john a conkling a maryland chemist who heads the 
american pyrotechnics association 
conkling who operates a seasonal fireworks hotline in 
washington said shipments from china had either arrived or were 
aboard vessels by the time the disturbances began that led to last 
months bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators hundreds 
perhaps thousands of people were killed 
i think the fact that for the past 15 years weve celebrated 
independence day with fireworks coming from a communist country 
means there has been an irony quite a while he said it is 
heightened by the incidents this year

president carlos salinas de gortari broke 
tradition at the beginning of his term he made no dramatic 
announcement about fighting corruption in mexicos government and 
business 
to the astonishment of cynics he took action instead jailing 
oil union leaders stockbrokers and dozens of drugrunning police on 
corruption charges 
but his message hasnt penetrated mexicos bureaucracy where a 
bribe still can be expected to renew a visa obtain a trade permit 
or connect a telephone line 
now theres confusion said one business analyst people 
believe salinas people are clean but theyre still dealing with 
some of the same middlelevel officials they dont know what to 
do 
for most public servants the opportunity to earn a decent wage 
comes once in a lifetime with no career civil service and no merit 
system guaranteeing promotions tens of thousands lose their jobs at 
each change of administration 
while padding slim government incomes is not unique to mexico 
under the authoritarian system that has governed the country since 
before the time of the spanish conquest corruption spread well 
beyond the economic arena 
it has hurt the nations pride tarnished elections and in some 
instances claimed lives an internal government study estimated that 
federal highway police bribes cost the economy 3 million a day 
the authoritarian nature of government lends itself to 
corruption said samuel del villar an adviser to former president 
miguel de la madrid and political scientist at the colegio de 
mexico without accountability to the people officials enjoy the 
discretional authority to impose bribes and arbitrary fees 
salinas inaugurated dec 1 inherited a monumental task from de 
la madrid who took office in 1982 amid growing perception that 
corruption fed by the sudden wealth to be had in the oilboom 
years was out of control and had infected the private sector 
to get the commerce department to authorize a price increase 
for a product used to mean leaving an envelope behind said the 
business analyst who spoke only on condition of anonymity youd 
take up a collection from other businesses before you went 
de la madrid decreed a law prepared by del villar and a team of 
legal experts that extended criminal liability for corrupt 
practices by public servants it was the heart of de la madrids 
moral renovation campaign against corruption and it failed 
moral renovation failed because no one bothered to apply the 
public servants law del villar said indictments were 
discretional and in this case no one wanted to do it 
salinas abandoned moral renovation and ordered the arrests 
that so far have netted joaquin hernandez galicia the longtime 
chief of the powerful oil workers union eduardo legoretta a top 
businessman charged with stock market fraud and dozens of police 
agents in northwestern mexico alleged to have closed their eyes to 
drug trafficking 
salinas attorney general on april 27 ordered the arrest of 
carlos robles loustaunau who stepped down as mayor of hermosillo 
and three aides on charges of getting themselves elected last july 
through fraud they are members of salinas own institutional 
revolutionary party commonly known as pri its spanish initials 
taking their cue from salinas and his drive to modernize mexicos 
economy some mexican business leaders have openly attacked official 
bribetaking 
we are tired of corruption jorge ocejo moreno president of 
the national association of industries in transformation declared 
in april 
treasury health commerce and other federal department officials 
extort us without end he asserted 
to salinas both bureaucrats and private sector leaders are to 
blame for corruption that saps the economy and his own plans to 
generate growth 
salinas has promised measures to crack down on police corruption 
and to professionalize mexicos police forces 
as budget director under de la madrid salinas helped change the 
system of import licenses that encouraged corruption other 
deregulatory changes have also helped reduce the number of rules 
that can lead to extortion or bribery 
salinas also has laid down the law on chronic tax evasion by 
decreeing a 2 percent tax on business assets vociferous business 
protests have been largely ignored 
even so the roll call of corruption in mexico remains long and 
varied 
proud host of the 1986 world cup soccer championship mexico 
wont field a team in the 1990 games it was caught redhanded with 
four overage players in an international youth tourney last year 
salinas own election was the most disputed in the 60year 
history of the pri salinas won just over half the vote but reports 
abounded of multiplevoting stolen ballot boxes and other fraud 
mayor manuel camacho solis of mexico city in december ordered 
all car owners in the capital to have their vehicles tested to fight 
the citys smog generally considered the worlds worst almost 
immediately inspectors began passing polluting cars for fees 
ranging up to double the price of testing 
two acapulco judges were suspended in december and face trial on 
charges of accepting a 200000 bribe to order the release from 
prison of alejandro braun diaz a 34yearold playboy convicted of 
raping and killing a 6yearold girl braun is believed to have fled 
to canada 
on dec 11 explosions and fire ripped through a crowded mexico 
city street market killing 62 people residents blamed tons of 
illegal fireworks sold at the market and said police had been bribed 
to ignore the threat the government allowed them to sell here

day after day year after year 
venezuelans read or hear of official corruption but not a single 
person has ever been convicted at least no one from the political 
establishment 
corruption seems so deeply rooted and may have gained so many 
adherents in venezuela the author arturo uslar pietri suggests 
that the honest should regarded as fools 
normal in venezuela is to take advantage of a political 
position to obtain personal benefits and become rich he said in 
an interview those who dont do it are considered inferiors 
but corruption cases in venezuela become so entangled that few 
can sort them out and in the end they fade away in a loss of 
interest by a confused public 
the latest case involves elimination of a government agency known 
as recadi which in the previous government distributed 40 billion 
for subsidized imports 
of that amount some 6 billion is said to have been granted 
fraudulently mostly by overpricing personal connections or even 
outright bribery contributing to the depletion of the nations 
monetary reserves 
in a swirl of charges and counter charges one figure in the 
scandal attempted suicide the leftist past of the judge handling 
the case was brought into play with implications that he is acting 
for political reasons the judge sent an industrialist to jail for 
eight days for charging that the judge himself took bribes and for 
blaming the recadi fraud on a former president and his sweetheart 
secretary 
recadi was created in early 1983 as venezuelas oil bonanza began 
to fade and exchange restrictions were imposed cheap dollars were 
lavishly granted via recadi to both private and public companies for 
imports that otherwise would have fueled inflation 
but it soon became a nest of corruption that was 
practically designed for fraud congressional investigators have 
charged 
a thorough investigation however might take years just to check 
the 14000 or so companies that received cheap dollars 
in one case millions of dollars were granted to import holstein 
heifers to improve venezuelas dairy stock the heifers turned out 
not to be holsteins but scrawny feeble specimens as one 
rancher described them 
hundreds of the heifers were abandoned on a plain to become 
carrion for vultures the newspaper el nacional reported 
in another incident ana teresa herrera was fired as a recadi 
inspector when she began investigating a company that had been 
granted 14 million to import three airplanes only one was brought 
to venezuela 
and that plane never flew she told reporters after 
testifying before judge luis guillermo de la riva who is in charge 
of the current recadi case 
the scandal became a drama when former development minister 
hector meneses whose office also granted cheap dollars for imports 
shot himself in the head he survived but lost the sight of one eye 
and remains in a coma in a caracas hospital unable to tell what he 
knows 
before shooting himself meneses wrote a letter to his wife 
claiming innocence and suggesting he had merely carried out 
instructions from two of his former colleagues they in turn also 
claimed innocence 
so far only eight people have been jailed to await trial 
although de la riva has issued 32 arrest warrants 
in a setback for the judge however it turned out that most of 
subjects of the warrants had resigned from their business jobs long 
before recadi was even created and no longer live in venezuela 
then de la riva also came under the fire of critics who recalled 
that he had years before supported leftist guerrillas the 
implication was that it was more than coincidence that leftist 
congressmen were leading the public outcry in the case 
another setback for the judge was his order for the arrest of 
nicomedes zuloaga member of a prominent venezuelan family and 
president of gramoven a grain processing company accused of 
importing overpriced wheat 
upon turning himself in zuloaga noted that he was venezuelas 
ambassador to argentina when the alleged overpricing took place a 
friend alfredo paul delfino accused the judge of receiving bribes 
and charged that former president jaime lusinchi and his private 
secretary and companion blanca ibanez were the real thieves 
de la riva ordered delfino to jail for eight days 
lusinchi whose affair with ibanez and his attempt to divorce his 
wife of more than 40 years constituted a scandal in his years as 
president has threatened to file suit against delfino 
in the recadi case there is a too much transparent classism 
the independent newspaper el universal said in an editorial there 
are no politicians in jail and the laws hand strikes only on 
businessmen whereas the ones to blame for the corruption were within 
recadi 
as the plot becomes more entangled many believe that behind the 
scandal lies a political struggle between lusinchi and president 
carlos andres perez who took office in february for the leadership 
of their accion democratica the biggest in venezuela

a turkish peasant claims one of his kidneys was 
stolen philippines prison inmates trade organs for reduced 
sentences brokers in human body parts take their cut of a shadowy 
market 
the forces of supply and emand in the desperate world of organ 
transplants have created a commercial trade in human organs that 
worries health officials and ethicists worldwide 
the need for organs to replace faltering body parts is growing as 
research advances and surgery is more successful but the number of 
donated organs has failed to keep pace doctors say too few people 
die in circumstances that provide transplantable organs when they 
do relatives are often too grieved to donate a loved ones organ or 
object for religious or cultural reasons 
last fall reports in foreign newspapers that adoption rings were 
routinely buying babies in third world countries and selling them to 
american and israeli families whose children needed organ 
transplants drew angry us reaction 
the state department in october blamed the soviet union for the 
reports and said a european parliament resolution criticizing the 
purported activity was based on false and misleading statements 
and a discredited report by a soviet front organization 
what to do about the organ trade varies the united states japan 
and west germany ban it in india such trade thrives legally 
lawmakers in britain and the philippines have just begun grappling 
with the matter 
there simply doesnt seem to be any country that has a public 
policy to generate enough organs to meet the demand said arthur 
caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at the 
university of minnesota 
the world health organization in may called for a global ban on 
commercial trafficking in human organs dr ursula lehr the west 
german health minister spoke for the ban 
the idea of businessminded brokers taking advantage of the 
financial distress of people in the third world buying their organs 
for a pittance and reselling them to wealthy patients in developed 
countries is awful for me she said 
but some ask whats wrong if people fully informed of the risks 
decide to sell one of their organs for example a kidney the 
question however becomes complicated when the potential donor is 
desperately poor people can live with one kidney and offers for 
transplantable kidneys have ranged in individual instances from 
3000 to 20000 
is it really for us who are not faced with those difficulties 
and that heartrending decision to deny people that choice neil 
hamilton a british lawmaker asked in recent parliamentary debate 
it really isnt a choice if youre coerced by poverty said 
caplan the minnesota ethicist 
others worry that selling organs would decrease the supply of 
donated organs and make transplants more expensive in general 
we believe organs would go to the highest bidder rather 
than to the patient who needs them most said bernadette haze a 
spokeswoman for the netherlandsbased eurotransplant which matches 
organ donors and recipients in the netherlands belgium luxembourg 
west germany and austria 
britain which has no law controlling the sale of organs took up 
the issue this year after a turk was arrested in istanbul for 
arranging commercial transplants at a private london hospital one 
of the donors contended he was duped and robbed of his kidney 
the alleged organ broker tunc ay kunter was convicted may 18 
and sentenced to two years in prison for brokering the sale of a 
turkish peasants kidney to a libyan doctor police said kunter 
confessed to arranging four such sales when he was arrested 
turkish law allows organ donation but outlaws selling brokering 
or buying human organs 
the peasant ahmet koc who got a twoyear suspended sentence 
contended he went to the hospital for a physical connected to a job 
offer and thought he was being anesthetized for the checkup after 
the kidney was removed he said he was paid the equivalent of 4267 
british lawmakers have introduced legislation making it a crime 
to pay or receive payment for a human organ parliament is expected 
to pass it this month 
organ sales are not illegal in the philippines but in late may 
the vice president of the philippines senate filed a bill to ban 
sales of human organs and tissues calling practitioners 
modernday draculas 
filipino death row prisoners began donating organs in 1976 as 
part of a program to reduce overcrowding without resorting to 
widespread executions explained pablo rosales assistant director 
of the national penitentiary rosales said most donor inmates 
avoided execution and some were freed after spending a few more 
years in prison 
when capital punishment was banned in 1987 prisoners started 
asking for money he said one prisoner who donated a kidney even 
complained to rosales that he received only 95 without the 
minicassette recorder he was promised 
media attention greatly reduced the number of people seeking 
prisoners organs rosales said and no prisoner has donated a 
kidney since last year 
but rosales believes organ sales continue with private donors 
most likely poor slum dwellers 
dr kazuo ota chairman of the japan society for transplantation 
said he knew of several patients who had organ transplants in the 
philippines and that some japanese were acting as organ brokers 
organ sales are banned in japan 
dr jorge neumann of the sao paulo heart institute and a member 
of the brazilian association of organ transplants said certainly 
there exists a black market of organs in brazil but he said no 
statistics on organ sales were available 
in the united states selling organs has been illegal since 1984 
and sentiment against the practice is high but allegations of 
influence peddling in arranging precious transplants surface from 
time to time 
in april justice department investigators said they had dropped 
an investigation into accusations that pioneering surgeon thomas 
starzl head of transplants at presbyterianuniversity and 
childrens hospitals in pittsburgh had given highpaying foreigners 
preferential treatment 
the investigation followed newspaper articles that said about 28 
percent of transplants performed by starzls team in 19845 were on 
foreigners who often werent as sick as other patients or had waited 
a shorter time but who had paid surgeons fees four times higher 
than americans who had the same operations 
caplan argues for regulations to ensure that medical need rather 
than money or influence determines who gets available organs 
some in the field say the risk of exploitation would be reduced 
if a neutral party such as government replaced organ brokers and 
donations might increase with incentives such as compensation to 
donors or their families for all medical costs time lost from work 
or burial expenses there could also be a break on inheritance or 
other taxes 
recently transplant researchers began looking at animaltohuman 
transplants 
at a may meeting of the american society of transplant 
physicians researchers predicted pigs would become the main source 
of donor organs once crossspecies transplantation becomes practical 
theres always been a shortage of organs and there probably 
always will be unless we learn to take them out of animals said 
caplan i dont know if its going to be biologically feasible 
but i think thats the direction we have to try

a government effort to ban trade in body parts was 
prompted by a kidneysforcash scandal at a private london hospital 
this year 
the concept of organs being bought and sold for money is 
entirely unacceptable in a civilized society health minister 
roger freeman told a house of commons committee during debate on 
proposed legislation outlawing organ sales the bill is expected to 
pass parliament later this month 
not all lawmakers agree 
the bill will cause death where there could be life and to 
prolong suffering where we could provide relief said sir michael 
mcnairwilson a conservative parliament member awaiting a kidney 
transplant 
the legislation will make it a crime to pay or receive payment 
for a human organ act as broker in such transactions or solicit 
buyers or sellers it will however permit voluntary donors to be 
reimbursed for the costs of removing a kidney 
british lawmakers acted after news reports in january that 
turkish peasants were paid to donate kidneys for transplant surgery 
at the private humana wellington hospital turkish authorities said 
donors were paid 3200 to 5600 
following the disclosures humana hospital barred two doctors and 
the general medical council the disciplinary body for british 
physicians opened an investigation 
freeman said a gallup poll commissioned in february by the 
british kidney patients association found 87 percent of the 
respondents opposed commercial transactions in human organs 
whether they would think the same if faced with the choice of 
paying for an organ or of one not being available thereby causing 
death or prolonged suffering for a member of the family or a close 
friend is another matter mcnairwilson said in committee debate 
we are discussing a shortage of organs for transplant 
particularly of kidneys the waiting list stands at 3500 people 
but the list is growing he said many people are suffering 
considerable discomfort for long periods many people who could 
survive if they had a new kidney die without cause 
freeman conceded donations which average 1500 a year were 
falling short of demand and noted that health authorities had been 
ordered to find ways to identify potential donors the government 
has also asked health workers to record every death in intensive 
care and analyze why useable organs were not transplanted 
after publicity about his plight mcnairwilson said a woman in 
australia wrote to offer a kidney for 20000 according to 
mcnairwilson the woman said she had lost her home in a bush fire 
had no insurance and was sick of pulling myself and my children up 
by the bootstraps 
neil hamilton who cast the only vote against the bill in 
committee said he had pondered the dilemma facing one turk who 
allegedly sold a kidney 
his daughter was suffering from a medical problem which 
threatened her life but it could not be solved in turkey without 
money hamilton said if he did not get the money for the 
operation his daughter would die 
a similar argument for the right to sell organs was advanced by 
royden harrison emeritus professor of social history at warwick 
university in a february letter to the times of london 
what possible objection can there be if one person of their 
own free will and without duress should sell their kidney to 
someone else he asked nor is there any wrong done by the 
middleman who makes a profit out of this transaction the seller is 
able to indulge in a few of the good things in life the buyer may 
well be paying to survive

abdul hai a stocky 34yearold now in 
police detention sells human kidneys for a living 
he wasnt jailed for dealing in kidneys the sale of body organs 
is legal in india hai was arrested when a kidney donor complained 
of being mugged after refusing to pay hai a commission 
hai says hes one of about 100 middlemen who procure kidneys for 
the ailing rich from bombays willing poor 
hai who worked as a doctors chaffeur before becoming a kidney 
broker said he has arranged the sale of 20 kidneys since a surgeon 
suggested the business to him a year ago 
people queue up ready to give away a kidney you can find such 
donors everywhere he said in a cellblock interview 
hai was arrested may 12 after dhanraj agarwal a street vendor 
told police two people attacked him and stole almost 2000 he had 
been paid for a kidney agarwal said the attack came minutes after 
he refused to give hai a commission according to police inspector 
appa sahib shinde 
we have detained him only on suspicion of robbery and it 
doesnt matter to me if he sells kidneys for a living or not said 
shinde hai has denied involvement in the robbery 
hai told a reporter he charged roughly 95 to 190 for matching 
donors and patients india requires a kidney donor to officially 
affirm his desire to voluntarily give up a kidney but before that 
moment the donor could already have collected 1875 to 3125 from 
the recipient hai said 
the flourishing kidney trade has sharply divided indian doctors 
along ethical lines 
the world knows that bombay is a center for buying kidneys i 
think it is a shame for us to be so notoriously known said kisan 
mehta head of the life foundation a private group that advocates 
kidney transplants from cadavers indian laws prohibit transplants 
from the dead 
but what is ethics to a man who is dying asked dr keshava 
chandra reddy a kidney transplant specialist in madras the 
urologist said he and other surgeons from the pandalai 
cardiothoracic foundation have transplanted 485 kidneys in four 
years 
renal transplants became common in india about seven years ago 
when the antirejection drug cyclosporin became available locally 
there are no official figures on the number of transplants performed 
in india but since cyclosporins introduction at least 78 
million has changed hands in connection with the estimated 4000 
kidney transplants performed in bombay according to dr bn 
colabawalla chief of the national kidney foundation

directors of two top public pension funds which 
were successful in forcing recent changes at exxon corp are urging 
six major oil companies to alter their policies dealing with 
environmental safety and health issues 
the two directors who help manage major pension funds in new 
york city and california delivered their message in joint letters 
dated june 30 to amoco corp ashland oil inc pennzoil co 
tenneco inc amerada hess and kerrmcgee corp 
california state controller gray davis one of the trustees for 
the nations largest public pension fund and new york city 
comptroller harrison j goldin urged the companies to add an 
environmental expert to their boards of directors they also called 
for the creation of a public issues committee to monitor worker 
health and safety policies programs and practices and to recommend 
changes 
the trustees cited the march 24 oil spill involving an exxon 
tanker that dumped millions of gallons of thick crude oil into 
pristine alaskan waters as the catalyst for their latest appeal 
the exxon valdez disaster with its potential impact on 
shareholder value dramatizes the need for energy and chemical 
companies in particular to aggressively promote effective 
environmental and worker health and safety programs the trustees 
wrote 
exxons prompt decision to meet shareholder concerns by 
instituting changes in corporate policy at the board level is a 
commendable response to a deplorable event 
california and new york joined several other pension funds after 
the spill in threatening to attempt an ouster of exxon management if 
the company did not respond to the demands of shareholders 
represented by the funds 
exxon agreed at its may shareholders meeting to present the 
requests to its board

its said that dead men dont tell tales but 
advertisers are finding they do boost sales 
the use of the deceased celebrities to hawk products is on the 
rise as any glance through a magazine or quick look at television 
will attest 
theres the late actor james dean appearing in ads for sneakers 
baseball legend babe ruth selling electronics albert einstein 
pushing cameras other faces from the past are showing up in 
advertisements for greeting cards banks and computers 
everyone wants to associate their product with a winner or a 
legend said beth vahle vice president of the curtis management 
group of indianapolis which represents about 50 celebrities living 
and dead 
after using ruth a year ago for a limited advertising campaign 
zenith electronics corp reported that the promotion generated 
thousands of sales leads the ad featured ruth at bat with the 
slogan sometimes a major player can change the whole game 
we were looking for a symbol of what our customers would 
consider a major player said john taylor a zenith spokesman 
certainly babe ruth was a major player and a real recognized 
image 
athletic shoe maker converse inc decided to use dean after the 
company discovered a poster of dean shod in a pair of its jack 
purcells relaxing on the set of giant converse negotiated with 
the agency representing deans estate and the photographer who took 
the picture to use it in advertising 
michael s george marketing manager for the interco inc 
subsidiary would say only that the company paid thousands of 
dollars to use the moody blackandwhite photo 
it paid off george said sales of the jack purcells model rose 30 
percent to 50 percent in both 1987 and 1988 and thats partially 
attributable to the advertising 
the image projected in the photograph is very hip and 
nostalgic george said 
the practice of using yesterdays celebrities to hawk todays 
products has grown tremendously said roger richman president 
of the roger richman agency of beverly hills calif which 
represents nearly 40 personalities 
richmans agency handles the licensing of sigmund freud wc 
fields marilyn monroe and einstein 
richman would not discuss revenues but he said his agency 
receives about 35 percent of the royalties generated by such ads 
in addition to the popularity of the late greats there are 
practical advantages to advertisers using dead celebrities 
cost is one since living personalities usually cost more to use 
in an ad than an estate would charge mrs vahle said 
another benefit is concern about reputation an advertiser using 
a dead celebrity to pitch products doesnt have to worry about the 
star tarnishing his name through a messy divorce or drug arrest for 
example 
but at the same time the management agencies are promoting the 
use of dead celebrities they must spend time tracking down 
unauthorized appearances from beyond the grave 
both curtis management and the richman agency have gone to court 
seeking either to halt unauthorized use of an image or to demand 
royalties for the families or estates involved 
heirs and representatives of celebrities say they should be paid 
a royalty and have some control over how the departed are portrayed 
mrs vahle and others argue that a persona should be considered 
property that can be inherited 
in new york state sen emanuel r gold proposed a bill that 
would do just that by making the likeness of a dead person a 
property right that can be inherited the bill was killed last week 
however 
fewer than a dozen states have laws to protect the rights of dead 
celebrities and in other states judges have established some rights 
through their decisions said mark roesler curtis president

pepsico inc has snapped up two of britains 
largest potato chip manufacturers from bsn of france in a 135 
billion cash deal that gives the food and beverage giant a larger 
share of the european snackfood market 
bsn had acquired the companies walkers crisps and smiths crisps 
just a month ago as part of its purchase of rjr nabiscos european 
food operations rjr sold the division to trim some of the debt from 
its record 25 billion buyout by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
earlier this year 
mondays sale makes pepsico one of the largest snackfood 
producers in europe at a time when the continent is moving toward 
eliminating trade barriers by 1992 it also allows bsn to focus on 
its core biscuit and pastry businesses industry analysts said 
we view the acquisitions of walkers and smiths as strategically 
important as it will transform the fritolay division of pepsico 
into a worldwide snackfood manufacturer said lawrence adelman 
of dean witter reynolds inc 
joanna scharf of drexel burnham lambert inc agreed theyre 
investing in a business that they know very well no one else can do 
in this business what they can do 
wall street wasnt as enthusiastic however in composite trading 
monday on the new york stock exchange pepsico closed down 125 
cents at 5312 a share 
walkers and smiths are among britains largest sellers of potato 
chips and snack foods with sales estimated at 460 million this 
year the united kingdom is the worlds secondlargest market for 
snack food behind the united states although percapita consumption 
is only twothirds of the us rate 
for pepsico this acquisition represents a onetime opportunity 
to significantly strengthen and expand our international snackfood 
business pepsico chairman d wayne calloway said 
smiths and walkers have a leadership position in the united 
kingdom similar to that of fritolay in the united states 
pepsico based in purchase ny is one of the worlds largest 
soft drink fast food and snackfood companies with sales of 13 
billion last year 37 percent of which came from snack foods 
among its wellknown businesses are pepsicola co sevenup 
international plus the pizza hut taco bell and kentucky fried 
chicken restaurant chains its snackfood operations which hold a 
60 percent market share in the united states manufactures products 
under the fritolay doritos and lays brands 
bsn with 1988 sales totaling 7 billion produces biscuits 
dairy and other grocery products beer champagne and mineral water 
the french company had purchased five rjr businesses including 
smiths and walkers on june 6 for 25 billion bsn said it planned 
to keep the other three companies the united kingdom biscuit 
business of nabisco brands the belin group a french biscuit and 
pastry business and saiwa a biscuit and snack producer in italy 
analysts said the pepsico purchase would dilute 1989 and 1990 
earnings per share by about 8 cents each year but they said that 
would be offset by the estimated 490 million in cash surplus 
expected this year 
adelman said he expects the company to earn between 325 and 
330 per share this year and around 380 a share in 1989 pepsico 
earned 7622 million or 290 a share in 1988 
it appears that what they pepsico paid for this business is 
in line with cash flow multiples being paid for good companies 
said george e thompson an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc 
i think that when you put pepsico together with these companies 
they bought themselves a strong earnings stream over the 
intermediate and long term

international business machines corp 
has stepped up production here of a new fourmegabit memory chip 
critical to the development of the computer giants most 
sophisticated products 
the sindelfingen plant about 15 miles west of stuttgart is only 
the second plant in the world that will mass produce the complex 
semiconductors for ibm officials said monday 
productionline manufacturing began in burlington vt a few 
months ago and another ibm manufacturing plant is scheduled to 
open in yasu japan later this year according to peter w thonis 
a spokesman at ibms armonk ny headquarters 
it had been widely assumed that japan was leading in the battle 
to gain early dominance in production of the fourmegabit chip but 
industry analysts and ibm note that the us company has been 
producing the chip in volume for the past few months 
we have leadership position said thonis 
the fourmegabit chip which can store 4 million bits of 
information or about 200 typewritten pages of information is 
considered a vital element of virtually all of the advanced 
consumerproduct and defense technology of tomorrow 
production of this fourmegabit computer chip signals without a 
doubt a powerful new phase in computer development said west 
german chancellor helmut kohl who attended the sindelfingen plant 
opening 
according to helmut roeder a stuttgartbased ibm spokesman the 
company succeeded in producing the first fourmegabit memory chip 
from a 200millimeter silicon wafer he said the new chip will allow 
increased computer memory while keeping down costs 
this can be used for all types of computers he said in a 
telephone interview with a larger wafer it is cheaper and you 
have a much higher production output the objective was to reduce 
the cost of memory 
roeder did not say precisely what kind of savings could be 
expected from production of the new chip but he noted that ibm 
would not be selling the new chip to other computer producers 
we are planning to use this new chip generation in our own 
products he said 
other companies have been unable to produce a fourmegabit chip 
from larger silicon wafers because of the sensitive production 
procedures required roeder said 
as it is he said it will take about eight weeks before the 
first chip of this nature is completed at the sindelfingen plant 
this process is very difficult no one else has been in the 
position to handle it correctly and economically he said there 
are so many processes so many control mechanisms to make sure each 
step is correct thats why it takes two months 
roeder said he believes some japanese companies are close to 
duplicating ibms achievement 
we expect there are competitors who are not far behind us he 
said

as golfing booms across the country like 
a 275yard drive zipping down a fairway dave austad knows theres a 
lot of golf clubs to be sold 
and while hes trying to hawk mashies woods and wedges to an 
estimated 23 million us golfers he figures theyll also need golf 
bags golf balls at least one glove apiece shoes loud clothes and 
maybe some fuzzy head covers 
austad is president of sioux fallsbased austad co a mailorder 
golf equipment supplier thats one of the biggest in the world his 
father oscar austad started the business out of the back of his 
car in 1963 when he sold polyurethane tubes to protect golf club 
shafts 
the company has since grown into a 50 millionayear business 
golf merchandising is a nearly 8 billionayear industry 
according to the national golf foundation austad co says it has 
about 2 percent of the 2 billion catalog business in equipment for 
the links 
the company boasts a mailing list of over 2 million names and 
about 26 million catalogs are sent out every year an average of 
61000 orders a month are taken with 60 as the average price per 
order austad said 
so with those kind of numbers and all that golf equipment around 
youd expect oscar and dave can play some stick but oscar hasnt 
played in 12 years and daves golfing ability is just average 
the story goes dad would go to a tournament and when hed 
step up to the tee everybody would figure this guy is going to kill 
the ball said austad 
he was absolutely so terrible hed drop three in the water and 
everybody would walk away thinking that if he cant hit his own 
product they sure arent going to buy it 
he decided for the betterment of the company he should quit 
playing 
the firm has begun to make a big push in foreign markets with 
the japanese the big prize of the golf marketing world in japan 
golf like baseball is fanaticized 
golf is exploding everywhere austad said in japan it is 
more than in the us but theyre not as accepting of direct mail 
last year austad co signed an agreement with mazda corp to 
sell the automaker clubs and other equipment wholesale that are 
sold in turn to its workers at discount prices 
recently austad placed ads in two of japans biggest golf 
magazines for subscriptions to its catalogs which have been 
translated into japanese 
were really just putting our toes in the water right now he 
said what weve found surprising is a lot of companies dont want 
to go into japan they see it as a hassle 
the company also is making a move in the retail market in 
addition to its flagship store in sioux falls which sports an 
indoor sand trap and a golf video range a second shop is opening in 
minneapolis 
we see retail growing rapidly said wayne steinhauer 
austads vice president of customer relations many of the companys 
customers are in the minneapolis area he said 
that raises the question of location as one of the sports 
biggest suppliers some might think the austad co should be near 
pebble beach calif or augusta ga both home to golf 
championships but south dakota 
it hasnt hurt austad said in the states people think 
south dakota these guys have to be honest some people get a 
little uncomfortable giving their credit card number over the phone 
to somebody in new jersey

the us dollar ended slightly lower tuesday in 
european trading becalmed by the absence of us traders for a 
holiday and the retreat of european players to the sidelines 
gold prices were higher 
foreign exchange dealers said activity was generally light 
because of the us independence day holiday trading grew 
progressively quieter during the afternoon 
they attributed the overall downward trend of the dollar to 
speculation about us interest rates 
the market is figuring that the united states will lower rates 
to halt a slowdown in economic growth said a trader at a large 
frankfurt bank 
he predicted that if that happens many investors are likely to 
flee from dollars into pounds attracted by an interest rate 
differential which is favoring sterlingdominated assets 
traders said the dollar managed to firm to 14155 yen in europe 
as the clouded outlook for japans ruling liberal democratic party 
continues to make the yen look vulnerable 
the partys reputation has been hurt by the recruit co scandal 
a second scandal involving prime minister sousuke unos personal 
life and its recent electoral losses 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 155 yen to close at 14095 yen later in london 
it was quoted at 14155 yen

the idea of sucking bugs off crops instead 
of spraying them with toxic pesticides is causing a proliferation of 
product names playing on the word vac as in vacuum 
it all started last year when driscoll strawberry associates inc 
of watsonville designed a machine called a bugvac that uses just 
enough suction to remove lygus bugs from the top parts of berry 
plants while not disturbing beneficial bugs that congregate farther 
down the plant 
that idea helped spur salinasbased tanimura amp antle inc the 
nations secondlargest lettuce grower to develop a machine called 
saladvac to vacuum bad bugs off lettuce 
now comes vacus designed by two men from delano 125 miles 
north of los angeles for use on grapes and cotton 
the device consists of a specially designed fivehorsepower 
hydraulic fan that collects bugs in wire mesh bags after sucking 
them off plants said harold nelson who designed vacus with don 
neumann his partner in daco farm supply 
the 50pound vacuum units can be mounted in several 
configurations on farm equipment to accommodate individual 
requirements of farmers nelson said 
he and neumann have begun field tests of a sixunit 
tractormounted implement with three units on each side 
hydraulically positioned around a row of grapevines they think it 
could be profitable because the cost of about 20000 for an 
eightunit vacus would be considerably less than that of other 
types developed so far 
a vacus unit on top of the vines and one on each side can remove 
up to half the flying insects on the plants as the tractor moves 
between rows nelson said 
even though it doesnt eradicate all flying pests in a single 
pass nelson thinks vacus will be valuable as another tool to let 
growers rely less on pesticides 
were not a replacement for chemicals he said were a 
tool to help reduce the amount of chemicals needed people are 
looking at how to reduce pesticides and this is another concept 
however nelson thinks repeated vacuumings will remove most 
flying insects and the number of times a grower would need to 
vacuum plants depends on a particular insects life cycle he 
estimated that a single application of pesticides would cost about 
as much as three sweeps of a field with vacus 
the device can be used to remove leafhoppers white flies moths 
weevils thrips and lygus bugs from strawberries grapes and cotton 
he said 
after flying insects are sucked off the plants beneficial 
predator insects can be introduced to eliminate mites and other 
bugs nelson said the wire mesh bags are designed with openings 
large enough to allow some surviving predators to escape

the amount of revenue wall street firms raised by 
underwriting new issues of stock and bonds plunged sharply in the 
first half of the year increasing the financial pressure on 
brokerage houses that are still reeling from the 1987 stock market 
crash 
fees from bringing new stock and bond issues to the market in the 
first half dropped 32 percent despite a drop of only about 3 percent 
in the volume of these securities according to securities data co 
which tracks the performance of wall street companies 
the disparity is due to a 45 percent decline in the volume of 
stocks issued stock issues are much more lucrative for investment 
firms than debt issues 
total fees charged by investment firms in the first half totaled 
138 billion down from 204 billion in the same period of 1988 
securities data said 
the volume of all securities underwritten dropped to 1416 
billion from 1457 billion in the first half of last year 
at the same time the volume of straightdebt issues brought to 
market increased to 72 billion its highest level for the period in 
three years straight debt excludes mortgagebacked securities and 
other debt issues backed by assets 
securities data attributed the growth in debt issues to declining 
interest rates and a strong dollar which made these investments 
more attractive 
merrill lynch amp co inc was the leader in all new domestic stock 
and bond issues in the first half underwriting 252 billion the 
investmenthouse research firm said 
merrill lynch raised about 91 percent of this amount through debt 
offerings making it the leading debt underwriter as well 
in second place overall was goldman sachs amp co which managed 
169 billion in new stock and bond issues first boston corp was a 
close third at 163 billion 
despite merrill lynchs lead its underwriting fees dropped 33 
percent to 1944 million from 2894 million in the first half of 
1988 this is due to the fact that most of its underwritings were 
debt issues 
drexel burnham lambert took first place in underwriting fees at 
2568 million drexels fees were boosted by the record 1496 
million it earned in helping finance the record leveraged buyout of 
rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co a new york 
investment firm 
boosted by the rjr financing drexel ranked first in the 
underwriting of junk bonds or highyield debt issues at 68 
billion out of a total of 148 billion issued by all wall street 
firms of drexels 68 billion 4 billion was raised for the rjr 
deal 
merger activity lagged in the first half compared with the first 
half of 1988 announced acquisitions of us targets valued at 10 
million or greater totaled 695 down from 784 during 1988s first 
half the total value of these planned acquisitions dropped by more 
than 20 percent to 1649 billion from 2095 billion in the 1988 
period 
also during the first half initial public stock offerings 
plummeted to 61 billion from 129 billion in the yearago period 
as the number of companies going public declined to its lowest level 
since the second half of 1982 securities data said 
in the first half only 100 companies registered new stock 
offerings compared with 138 in the first half of 1988

the assets of multimillionaire 
businessman whose debts led to a recent stock market scandal must be 
sold at auction a judge ruled 
the investor naji nahas owes 67 million to a us trading 
firm the debt by the lebaneseborn brazilian citizen forced the 
closure of six brokerages and the resignation of the governments 
top banker last month 
sao paulo federal district court judge luis gomes da silva has 
ordered nahas assets put on lien for future auctioning to 
guarantee payment of 67 million he owes to a company identified 
as conticommodity services inc of chicago a court clerk who asked 
not to be identified said by phone tuesday 
nahas assets include his apartment two properties in sao paulo 
and shares in selectacomercio e industria a holding company that 
controls his more than 20 enterprises the clerk said 
the clerk said he did not know how much these assets were worth 
nor when they would be auctioned 
nahas lawyer teofilo rocha declined to comment when contacted 
by the associated press 
the o globo newspaper of rio de janeiro quoted rocha as saying he 
was waiting for documents from the united states that prove nahas 
paid his debt owed to conticommodity and that the lien on his assets 
should be suspended 
no listing for conticommodity could be found in the chicago 
telephone book or in business directories and company officials 
could not be reached for comment tuesday 
the us commodity futures trading commission has linked nahas to 
texas billionaires nelson bunker and william herbert hunt in their 
unsuccessful bid to corner the world silver bullion market 
a year ago the brazilian supreme court ratified a 1986 verdict 
by a new york court that found nahas guilty of irregularities 
committed in the negotiation of 182 silver futures contracts 
in june nahas was the pivot of a scandal that sent brazilian 
stock markets into a tailspin the scandal broke june 9 when nahas 
failed to cover checks worth 31 million to pay for highly 
speculative deals on the rio de janeiro stock exchange 
on june 12 the government shut all of brazils stock exchanges 
to avoid panic and nahas was prohibited from leaving the country 
the markets reopened the next day 
six brokerages involved in the scandal were closed and elmo 
camoes president of the central bank and owner of one of the 
brokerages resigned 
on june 26 the federal police charged nahas with two counts of 
whitecollar crime police said the investor in 1987 illegally tried 
to take 20000 to london and in 1983 borrowed the equivalent of 12 
million from a bank of which he was a major shareholder a violation 
of brazilian law 
if found guilty on these two charges he could be sentenced to up 
to 11 years in prison

mary kay cosmetics inc target of comic strip 
barbs over animal testing and jokes about its pink cadillacs is 
doing nicely thank you 3 years after founders mary kay ash and 
her son richard r rogers took the company private in a 469 million 
deal 
sales have increased 631 percent since 1985 the last year the 
company was publicly traded reaching 406 million last year all 
through the efforts of 185000 sales consultants most of them 
women and some of them rich women 
since mrs ash founded the company in 1963 33 consultants have 
each been paid more than 1 million in commissions in february 
alone 10 national directors earned more than 20000 each with 
the top director getting 4030353 
mary kay has an estimated 2 percent of the cosmetic market but 
claims as much as 9 percent of the skincare products segment and 
about 35 percent of the socalled glamour segment primarily 
makeup 
the success of mary kays leveraged buyout prompted vice chairman 
john p rochon in may to venture a takeover of competitor avon 
products inc which had 3 billion in mainly doortodoor sales 
last year avon rejected the offer and rochon has not broached the 
subject publicly again 
at the time rochon said the cultures of mary kay and avon 
would remain distinct but he said avon would benefit from a touch 
of mary kaystyle motivation 
the mary kay approach is sloganfilled 
god first family second career third in business for 
yourself but never by yourself the gogive spirit are some 
of the sayings used to motivate the sales force 
a monthly magazine is entitled applause and gemstudded 
jewelry is given to even new recruits 
every year the company stages four sessions in which thousands of 
mary kay consultants descend on dallas for a productionnumber 
extravaganza top sellers are awarded minks crowned and throned on 
stage at the dallas convention center and treated to a reception at 
mrs ashs pink mansion 
but it is the cars that have become the company signature 
top achievers are given pink cadillacs to drive for the rest of 
their lives getting a new one every two years as long as they 
maintain their high performance lesser efforts are rewarded by 
smaller cars buicks and pontiacs 
there are about a thousand mary kay pink cadillacs on the road 
plus 1000 buicks and 3000 pontiacs 
consultants earn money by selling cosmetics at home presentations 
and recruiting other consultants 
unlike some direct sale companies each sales person orders 
products directly from mary kay and not from another person one 
step up a sales ladder consultants do however receive commission 
based on the sales by their recruits 
behind the flamboyance is a detailed program telling consultants 
everything from how to set up business and do their accounting to 
how they should dress it provides a detailed code of ethics and 
outlines how to win prizes 
over this kingdom rules mary kay ash whose age is a closely 
guarded secret one she wouldnt even reveal to the securities and 
exchange commission 
mrs ash who is recovering from eye surgery and unavailable for 
interviews created the company in 1963 after leaving a firm that 
wanted her to move every six months 
she was angry at her former employer and began cataloging the 
problems facing businesswomen 
mainly i was doing it to help other women she told one 
interviewer 
but president richard bartlett said ms ash realized she really 
was creating an outline for a successful company so she began to 
implement it herself even though some of those ideas ran counter to 
accepted management and direct sales theory 
i thought that i knew about party planning when i came here 
said bartlett who spent time at tupperware home products before 
joining mary kay in 1973 where others were talking fun and games 
at the home visits she was deadly serious 
i had spent over 15 years learning that you couldnt do those 
things that they wouldnt work he said they do and we 
thrive 
he cites as examples her decision to limit the size of home 
presentations to six people and abandoning the party approach 
for a more serious skin care class 
the company continues to take an adventurous approach to business 
although admitting leveraged buyouts can be troublesome and drain 
company resources to pay off debt i think were a shining example 
of lbos bartlett said 
before the lbo we had a tendency to make decisions on what the 
shareholders would expect next or that we thought the analysts 
thought bartlett said 
now we can take the long view 
an example of that view may be the companys decision earlier 
this year to stop testing its products on animals 
the decision followed a long series of bloom county comic 
strips criticizing mary kays testing including one that compared 
mrs ash to ayatollah khomeini 
it was not ridicule that led to the moratorium bartlett said 
but the confusion and concern shown by mary kays sales force 
which he described as a microcosm of american women middleclass 
and up demographically 
bartlett said the moratorium may cost mary kay sales even though 
most products planned through next year already have been cleared 
the company also is trying to correct mistakes it made in the 
early 1980s 
we got complacent with our product line we laid back and said 
we had the worlds finest product bartlett said 
the company lost much of its sales force as an improving economy 
opened more jobs to women 
since then the mary kay pitch has been restructured to appeal to 
working women bartlett said 
part of that plan is to have women in mary kays top management 
and even president richard bartlett says a woman should be president 
of the company 
other than mrs ash whose official title is chairman emeritus 
most toplevel management is male although there are many female 
vice presidents

the european economic community said 
tuesday it would begin talks july 7 with poland which should be the 
last before concluding a trade and cooperation agreement 
the eec also said that on july 19 and 20 the eec will hold the 
first round of talks with the soviet union which also are expected 
to lead to a trade and cooperation agreement 
nico wegter external relations spokesman for the eecs executive 
commission said he expected the agreement with poland to be signed 
before the commission begins its monthlong summer break at the end 
of july 
the talks are a result of the mutual recognition pact signed in 
june by the eec and the moscowled comecon trade bloc moscows 
partners in comecon are east germany poland czechoslovakia 
hungary bulgaria vietnam cuba and mongolia 
since then the eec has signed trade and cooperation agreements 
with czechoslovakia and hungary and has opened negotiations with 
east germany the only hitch so far has been the suspension of talks 
with romania which the eec said it would only resume if the 
bucharest government improved its human rights record

brazil worried about its dwindling cash 
reserves has skipped an 812 million interest payment on its debt 
but the government denied tuesday that it plans to declare a 
moratorium on foreign debt payments 
finance ministry spokeswoman rosa alcin said in an interview that 
the government had postponed the payment due monday for one week 
because of operative problems she would not elaborate on the 
problems 
but ms alcin added the delay should not be interpreted as the 
first step toward a moratorium on brazils 112 billion foreign 
debt the largest in the developing world 
a moratorium does not figure in the governments plans she 
said 
brazil owes about 9 billion to creditors in the socalled paris 
club composed of 10 industrialized countries with the greatest 
influence in the international monetary fund it was to these 
nations that mondays payment was due 
in addition brazil has a 600 million payment due to private 
banks later this month and 3 billion more in september 
the delay on the current payment comes just as the central bank 
brazils equivalent of the us federal reserve is attempting to 
stem the outflow of money from the country and keep currency 
reserves from falling below a critical level 
on friday the central bank centralized foreign monetary 
operations not only for debt payments but also for export of profit 
dividends and capital by multinational companies that operate in 
brazil 
according to central bank figures 2 billion was sent abroad by 
these means in the first six months more than the 18 billion 
transferred in all of 1988 
at the same time brazil has received no new money from abroad 
although it anticipates the release of more than 4 billion promised 
by the imf the world bank private banks and the socalled 
nakasone fund created by the japanese government 
the major obstacle to the release of these funds has been 
brazils failure to reach an agreement with the imf which is 
concerned with the governments inability to control skyrocketing 
inflation 
inflation was 25 percent in june alone and totaled 964 percent 
in the past 12 months 
ms alcin reiterated remarks by finance minister mailson da 
nobrega who said last week that brazil would maintain interest 
payments while able to maintain an adequate level of reserves 
according to the local financial press the government considers 
the minimum level of reserves to be the equivalent 45 billion 
enough to purchase needed imports for three months the last 
official figures divulged showed brazil had 56 billion in reserves 
in june

farmers may someday process their soybean 
crop into fuel and pour it into their tractors using a formula 
developed by scientists trying to reduce us dependence on foreign 
oil and find new markets for soybeans 
the only problem is that it likely will take an energy crisis to 
drive the price of petroleumbased fuels high enough to make it 
economical to mass produce soybeanoil fuels 
who knows when another petroleum shortage will push prices up 
making our fuel more competitive said marvin bagby an organic 
chemist at the us department of agricultures northern regional 
research center in peoria where the fuel is being developed 
we were close to the cost of diesel in 1983 bagby said in a 
recent interview 
but the price of petroleumbased diesel fuel eventually dropped 
below 1 per gallon making soybeanoil fuel unattractive at its 
estimated production price of 145 per gallon 
a number of research laboratories studied the use of 
vegetableoil fuels when oil embargos caused an energy crunch a 
decade ago 
but as petroleum products became available again and fuel prices 
dropped most scientists abandoned the project 
bagby and his team persisted fearing both another embargo and 
eventual depletion of the earths natural resources 
we dont want to be caught unprepared for another embargo 
said bernard freedman an organic chemist who works with bagby 
were working hard on this because we feel we need to get this 
technology in place 
we want to be able to provide farmers with fuel in the case of 
an emergency or an embargo comes along again 
ideally freedman said farmers would be selfsufficient in terms 
of fuel by growing and producing their own 
were going to be running out of petroleum perhaps in 50 
years and this is a renewable resource that we can grow every 
year he said we think this is a very important project 
scientists have faced tough challenges converting soybean oil 
into a diesel engine fuel increasing its volatility and reducing 
its viscosity or thickness 
bagby said early experiments with vegetableoil substitutes for 
diesel fuel produced catastrophic results because of their 
tendency to thicken and clog mechanical parts 
it formed a solid mass in the crankcase bagby said to 
remove it you had to take the engine apart and chisel it out 
scientists have since developed four formulas to attack the 
viscosity problem 
freedman said other nations have successfully mastered 
vegetableoil fuels 
this fuel is being used internationally by a number of 
countries including brazil and south africa he said brazil has 
a fleet of trucks using soybean oilbased fuel i think theyre 
having pretty good luck with it 
freedman said the technology for making soybeanoil fuel is not 
new its used by american industry to make vegetable oil and in 
the process that produces cosmetics detergents and specialtyfood 
products
