turkish premier turgut ozal on 
tuesday ruled out any withdrawal of turkish troops from the divided 
mediterranean island of cyprus unless there is a complete 
settlement of greekturkish disputes 
i would like to see a solution to the cyprus problem but it 
should be a complete one ozal told reporters on the second day 
of his threeday visit to greece there should be a bicommunal 
bizonal federated state in cyprus and i think it has to take 
some time 
his remarks dashed greek hopes he would make a gesture to 
improve relations by reducing the turkish military presence in 
cyprus 
greek officials say there are about 30000 turkish soldiers in 
northern cyprus where the turkishcypriot community declared a 
breakaway republic in 1983 the turkish government says it has 
19000 troopers in cyprus 
cyprus was divided into separate greekcypriot and 
turkishcypriot sectors when turkey invaded the island in 1974 
following a brief coup by greekcypriot national guard leaders who 
planned to unite the island with greece 
the cyprus problem sidelined at two earlier greekturkish 
summit meetings this year in switzerland and belgium has emerged 
as the key issue in ozals talks with greek premier andreas 
papandreou at a seaside hotel here outside athens 
papandreou has proposed a demilitarization of the island and the 
establishment of a joint greekcypriot and turkishcypriot police 
force under un auspices 
he also links a settlement on cyprus with dropping greeks 
objection to turkeys application to join the european economic 
community 
the turkish premier said he believes the complex web of 
greekturkish disputes could be solved with courage and 
creativity 
the two nato allies came close to war last year over 
oildrilling rights in the aegean sea they also have quarrels over 
aegean airspace the military status of some greek islands and 
greekowned property in the turkish city of istanbul

seven score and four years ago a lanky 
circuitriding lawyer with political ambitions paid 1500 for a 
comfortable frame house on a muddy sidestreet a few blocks from the 
new state capitol 
he lived there with his wife and children for all but two of the 
next 17 years the family moved out of town in 1861 and never 
returned 
because the frontier lawyers name was abraham lincoln his 
springfield home became a tourist site drawing 500000 people 
annually in recent years that prompted a 22 million renovation 
completed last month 
restorers believe that if the former president and his family 
were to walk in the front door when their home is reopened to the 
public thursday theyd be pleased with the result 
at the moment it probably looks an awful lot better than it 
ever did when they lived there said francis o krupka 
historical architect for the national park service which maintains 
the home 
the restoration is the fruit of three years of sleuthing by 
historians and architects pursuing details such as wallpaper 
patterns the precise shade of brown on the homes exterior and 
whether the indoor woodwork was stained varnished or painted 
their search might seem to border on the obsessive but 
restorers say theyre assembling small pieces of the historical 
mosaic of lincolns life 
it demonstrates something of the environment that he lived and 
worked in a remnant of the environment that produced the man and 
possibly influenced what he did krupka said 
lincoln bought the house in may 1844 from charles dresser an 
episcopal clergyman who presided at lincolns wedding after 
boarding at a tavern for 4 a week and renting a cottage for his 
growing family it was the only home lincoln ever owned 
the framework and floors were oak the laths handsplit 
hickory the doors door frames and weatherboarding black walnut 
poet carl sandburg wrote in the prairie years the first part 
of his epic lincoln biography 
the house was painted one visitor wrote a quaker tint of 
light brown three blocks east the cornfields began and farms 
mile after mile 
similar accounts by contemporary visitors along with 
photographs and prints from lincolns time served as important 
guides for restorers 
but the primary source of information krupka said was the 
house itself 
you cant after 150 years recreate an environment exactly when 
you have insufficient documentation he said all you can do is 
make the best of what you have you get in there and start 
looking at it and see the various details of the structure 
the restorers found that termites had bored a 6inch tunnel 
through an 8inch floor beam nails connecting structural timbers 
had loosened the houses brick foundation had to be shored up 
floors designed for a family were reinforced to bear the weight of 
tourist throngs 
but they also found solid evidence of the skill of the 
19thcentury tradesmen who built the house 
it had some problems but it was a very wellconstructed 
house krupka said it had to be otherwise it wouldnt have 
survived this long 
to ensure its survival the house has been equipped with smoke 
detectors automatic fire extinguishers vapor barriers and systems 
to control heat and humidity all neatly concealed in the original 
framework 
set amid four blocks of restored 19th century houses the 
lincoln home now appears as best restorers can determine as it 
did in 1860 when lincoln was elected president 
a few months later on a rainy monday in february 1861 lincoln 
left springfield to take office 
here i have lived a quarter of a century and have passed from 
a young to an old man lincoln told a crowd that had gathered at 
the train station here my children have been born and one is 
buried 
i now leave not knowing when or whether ever i may return 
 
the president was assassinated in 1865

a viral epidemic that has killed 
up to 800 seals in the north sea eventually will cut in half the 
number of seals roaming dutch coastal waters a dutch wildlife 
expert says 
the epidemic which has decimated seals in the west german and 
danish sectors of the heavily polluted north sea this spring will 
leave only 500 seals in dutch waters according to dr peter 
reynders of the dutch national nature conservation institute 
it may be the year 2000 before the seal population can be 
restored he was quoted as saying in a interview published tuesday 
in the amsterdam newspaper trouw 
medical experts are investigating the possibility that the 
disease is linked to a herpestype virus according to the seal 
nursery in pieterburen in the northern netherlands western 
europes only seal hospital 
the infection attacks the animals immune system and they 
eventually die of pneumonia 
the hospital has linked at least 15 recent seal deaths and nine 
premature births in dutch waters to the viral infection 
every preparation has been made for the intensive nursing and 
treatment of sick and prematurely born seals said a hospital 
statement 
dutch researchers also are trying to find out whether the deaths 
are linked to north sea pollution or to the massive clusters of 
algae that have killed thousands of fish off norway and denmark 
this spring 
in west germany the seal epidemic has sparked a major debate on 
oil slicks and chemical discharges in the north sea and 
environmentalists are demanding drastic measures to halt the 
pollution

italy is demonstrating its willingness to 
share the risk of defending the west by agreeing in principle 
to welcome a unit of us warplanes president reagan told italian 
prime minister ciraco de mita on tuesday 
de mita met reagan at the white house to prepare for next weeks 
annual economic summit of leading industrialized democracies in 
toronto and talk about the presidents summit with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev in moscow 
reagan praised italy for moving toward acceptance of 72 f16 
fighter jets that comprise the air forces 401st tactical fighter 
wing the wing is being ejected from torrejon air base in spain 
the united states wanted spain to keep the planes which are 
earmarked for the defense of southern europe but after lengthy 
negotiations spain declined last year to renew the base agreement 
reagan said italys willingness to consider accepting the 
planes at natos suggestion was exemplary and was typical 
of italys serious approach toward its alliance commitments its 
willingness to do its part to share the risk and responsibilities 
as well as the benefits of nato membership 
de mita told editors and reporters of the washington post on 
tuesday that the decision already had been made to take the planes 
and he described the required votes by the italian parliament as 
formalities 
the prime minister told the newspaper for a story in wednesdays 
editions that italian military authorities decided tuesday to 
station the fighterbombers at a military airport at crotone in 
southern italy he said his fiveparty coalition government agreed 
june 4 to take the planes and has only to report to parliament 
on its decision 
reagan thanked italy for supporting the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty adopted by the united states and the soviet 
union 
without italys courage determination and support throughout 
inf deployment and negotiations there would have been no treaty 
reagan told de mita we will continue to depend and gratefully 
so on italys support as an ally and advice as a friend 
italys lower house of parliament is scheduled to vote on the 
f16 basing thursday or friday and then the italian senate must 
give its approval 
following parliamentary approval nato experts will meet to 
determine where to deploy the planes said a us official who 
briefed reporters monday on grounds he not be identified publicly 
asked if de mita expressed optimism about approval the official 
said the prime minister did not offer a judgment of the outcome 
but the whole matter was discussed in very positive terms as a 
matter that is in place and moving forward 
the official indicated that a new facility may have to be built 
to accommodate the 401st but he said no decision had been made 
de mitas visit to washington was his first since taking office 
in april as the head of italys 48th government since world war ii 
his predecessor giovanni goria served only seven months 
in a farewell statement at the white house de mita said he 
reaffirmed the fact that italy will continue with conviction to 
share in the commitments and undertakings of the alliance which 
binds us safeguards our freedoms and underpins the development of 
the west 
the prospects for a lasting peace require us to prevent any 
weakening of our atlantic solidarity to refrain from any actions 
of unilateral disarmament he said 
de mita said later at a news conference that a disagreement over 
middle east policy was aired during his talks with administration 
officials 
secretary of state george p shultz is trying to arrange 
negotiations between israel and a delegation of jordanians and 
palestinians he has ruled out participation by the palestine 
liberation organization unless it accepts israels right to exist 
as well as creation of a palestinian state 
de mita said he told the americans that italy continues to 
believe the plo is the legitimate representative of the palestinian 
people 
one of the topics expected to arise at the toronto summit is the 
extent to which the industrialized democracies should help eastern 
european nations solve their economic problems 
de mita said he and the president agreed that massive aid for 
these countries should be withheld as long as their economies are 
predominantly statemanaged 
de mita planned to meet on wednesday with members of congress 
and defense secretary frank c carlucci before making a private 
visit to bar harbor maine

international paper co shrugs it off as a 
fact of life and tends to business the unions are waging a 
boycott and as the strike by 1200 paperworkers turns 1 year old 
thursday both sides say their resolve holds strong 
whatever it takes for as long as it takes dick tardif said 
recently as he walked a picket line at ips sprawling androscoggin 
mill 
the unions are focusing on the united paperworkers international 
unions national corporate campaign organized by labor 
strategist ray rogers it is designed to put financial and 
political pressure on banks and businesses that own ip stock or 
have directors who also serve as ip directors 
the company continues to run the mill one of its largest 
around the clock with about 1000 replacement workers recruited 
elsewhere it boasts that production is nearly at prestrike 
levels and it insists the nonunion employees are there to stay 
theyve given up other jobs to come work for the company they 
endure harassment intimidation threats certainly daily verbal 
abuse in some cases acts of violence said ip spokesman richard 
white 
white said the company accepted a moral obligation to these 
people when it hired them and gave the unions repeated warnings 
that replacements would be permanent 
the strike has gone on too long he said its time to get 
it behind us 
its been a long tense year for this oncesleepy western maine 
town including boisterous rallies and marches and a court order to 
curb namecalling vandalism and occasional violence on the picket 
lines a judge cited the unions for contempt ordering a 10000 
fine and the company is seeking a second citation 
no talks are scheduled and the jay strikers the largest group 
among 3500 union members embroiled in labor disputes that also 
affect ip mills in alabama pennsylvania and wisconsin will 
automatically lose any say in the unions future at the mill as of 
thursdays anniversary of their walkout 
the replacements are seeking an election to decertify the upiu 
and the international brotherhood of firemen and oilers as 
bargaining agents for mill employees after thursday by law only 
the replacement workers may vote 
union leaders acknowledge it is only a matter of time before the 
national labor relations board orders an election and that 
decertification is inevitable instead they look to their ongoing 
campaigns to boycott companies with ties to ip and to build 
solidarity with union members at other ip mills 
right now all we have with ip is a paper relationship 
anyway said jonathan reitman a lawyer for upiu local 14 which 
represents the vast majority of strikers any election would be 
almost irrelevant he said 
its an allout war between the company and the upiu said 
felix a jacques executive vice president of local 14 
among the unions boycott targets are the pnc financial corp a 
pittsburghbased holding company with banks in three states 
cocacola co and the bank of boston and its subsidiaries in 
maine connecticut and rhode island the union also may eventually 
call for boycotts of ip products by institutions and government 
agencies said jacques 
ips white cites rogers involvement in the 1985 hormel 
meatpackers strike in minnesota which was marred by violence and 
ended a year later with replacement workers still there as 
evidence that the campaign against ip will not succeed 
white said production at the jay mill is up to nearly 94 percent 
of its average capacity of 1500 tons a day compared to 97 percent 
before the june 16 walkout 
the company has sought to divert attention from the replacement 
workers and toward the dispute that led to the walkout ips 
demand for looser work rules and elimination of premium pay for 
sundays and holidays 
but the unions have rejected any proposal that does not 
guarantee the strikers their old jobs 
the mood could turn uglier this summer when the strikers state 
unemployment benefits already extended to the oneyear maximum 
expire strikers who averaged more than 35000 a year at the 
mill can collect weekly unemployment checks of 161 plus 5 per 
dependent and less than 100 a week from the union 
inside the mill replacement workers are settling in and 
building their own camaraderie ip baseball 1 strike amp youre 
out reads one employees tshirt

for 500 years brazils northeast has 
been potentially rich and chronically poor 
today as brazil struggles to become a modern developed nation 
the northeast holds it back not wholly of its own accord 
the nine northeastern states cover 1 million square miles of 
land where brazil bulges out into the atlantic in the area 2 
times the size of texas live 45 million of the nations 143 
million people 
but while the prosperous south with its airplane and computer 
factories has made brazil the worlds eighthlargest economy the 
northeast remains poor neglected diseased and assailed by 
devastating cyclical droughts 
statistics paint a gloomy picture of the northeast 
infant mortality is higher than in subsaharan africa at 124 
deaths per 1000 births compared to 67 per 1000 in the south 
life expectancy is 51 years compared with 67 in the south 
a full 50 percent of northeasterners cannot write their own 
names 26 percent cant elsewhere in brazil 
diseases longeradicated elsewhere leprosy chagas disease 
polio tuberculosis even the plague still kill and deform in the 
northeast 
were creating a race of undersized subhumans who think only 
of survival said carlos hollanda labor health secretary for the 
northeasts ceara state 
in the early 1960s president john f kennedy recognized the 
parched region considered one of the worlds poorest as a 
possible source of social unrest shortly after fidel castros 
revolution in cuba kennedy launched the us alliance for 
progress which promised billions of dollars and poured millions 
into development of brazils northeast until a 1964 brazilian 
rightwing military coup eased fears of a communist or leftwing 
uprising 
droughts were a tragic part of the northeastern landscape even 
before portuguese conquerers recorded the first one more than 400 
years ago 
a drought that lasted from 1979 to 1984 killed an estimated 
250000 peasant farmers and chased millions more to big city slums 
in search of food water and jobs 
this year an expected rainfall of 31 inches will provide a 
respite for the characteristically smallstatured northeasterners 
but it is not likely to alter their struggle to survive 
the essential problem here is not whether it rains or not 
said ari guimaraes head of the political science department of the 
university of bahia another northeastern state the problem is 
that the government hasnt built reservoirs explored underground 
water supplies irrigated peasant properties or distributed land 
among those who have no means to survive 
from the 1500s well into the 19th century the northeast was a 
productive area but the wealth stayed with a few 
agriculture led the economic activity and the vast open spaces 
lent themselves to production of brazils most precious commodities 
at the time cattle cotton sugar tobacco and much later coffee 
the portuguese crown handed out large stretches of land to 
nobles and deserving soldiers but far from central government 
control in the south northeast landowners set wildwest laws 
for peasant subjects and used private armies to chase 
individual farmers from modestsized lands 
such scenes have been pointedly described by brazils leading 
novelist jorge amado in gabriela clove and cinnamon 
bahia and most recently showdown 
successive governments have made promises to wrench the inland 
population from medievallike poverty but gun battles over land 
and vast misuse of government funds in the region are still common 
the military government that governed from 1964 through 1985 
built dams for hydroelectric power roads soccer stadiums and 
stretched electricty lines across the dry cracked land one tough 
military president the late gen emilio medici who is said to 
have condoned the torture of political opponents was on the verge 
of tears when he saw the northeasts poverty first hand 
but the grandiose projects of the military government did little 
to ease the average northeasterners lack of food jobs water and 
land 
a common belief among northesterns is that the few direct 
investments in their social concerns such as food and water 
distributions during droughts and emergency workrelief jobs were 
turned to political advantage by local landowning politicians who 
pass along favors to those who vote for them 
it is in the interests of the landowners to maintain the 
region in utter poverty claimed maria luiza fontenelle mayor of 
fortaleza capital of ceara and the northeasts largest city with 
a population of 16 million 
when people are poor they depend upon favors to survive 
according to bishop jose rodrigues of the roman catholic church 
in the hinterlands of bahia mayors control local unions and decide 
who gets access to government health care jobs and other benefits 
when the military stepped down and civilian government returned 
to brazil in 1985 hopes for widespread social reforms ran high 
but many northeasterners say civilian rule for them has been a 
hollow triumph 
last year the region sold 44 billion worth of fruit nuts 
cocoa sugar tobacco and petroleum to southern brazil and foreign 
countries but received only 1 billion in government investments 
promises of a land reform irrigation of 25 million acres of 
land and 2 million jobs were slashed as the government of president 
jose sarney sought to to cut a massive budget deficit control 
runaway inflation projected at 600 percent annually and meet 
payments on a 121 billion foreign debt 
most significantly brazils proposed new constitution makes 
virtually impossible a longpromised land reform to distribute the 
46 percent of rural properties owned by just 12 percent of the 
population the catholic church has accused the government of 
bowing to powerful landowners on the issue 
but political scientists say the northeasts problems are fast 
becoming problems for the rest of the country most particularly 
the more affluent south 
northeasterners for example now occupied whole shanty towns in 
the major cities of rio de janeiro and sao paulo pressing already 
precarious social and health services and pushing up crime rates 
brazil will never be a stable democracy nor a developed 
country without resolving its vast inequalities said one 
political scientist helio jaguaribe 
but the political balance also may be shifting 
in the 1986 gubernatorial elections northeasterners chose four 
governors who are considered politically progressive and more 
likely to contest landowner power 
mayor fontenelle of fortaleza for example is a member of the 
radical workers party 
at the same time the roman catholic church presses on its own 
for change 
bishop rodrigues has helped rural workers in seven of his 11 
doceses take control of local labor unions often resulting in gun 
and stick battles between private armies of conservative mayors and 
local farmers 
in jucas a town of 8000 people 300 miles west of fortaleza 
the rev hans stecker a german priest who arrived 28 years ago 
wages a relentless battle with mayor jose fagundes also the towns 
largest landowner 
the priest has built a hospital 39 schools and preschools and 
started health and education programs stecker said that in 
response to his projects the threeterm mayor cut churchs 
telephone lines and prohibited the teaching of religion in town 
schools 
in some towns said political scientist guimaraes the 
local priest cant leave home without a gun

high in the hills overlooking budapest 
communist hungarys new rich are carving out one of eastern 
europes most exclusive residential enclaves 
while thousands of hungarians still wait up to 10 years for new 
apartments and homes construction of fashionable modern villas for 
successful entrepreneurs and professionals is booming in the buda 
hills outside the city 
ive never seen anything like this said a longtime owner of 
a modest stucco home not far from sandor endroedy street where 
many of the new homes are being built 
everywhere you look another big one is going up said the 
resident asking not to be identified 
communist officials throughout eastern europe have long laid 
claim to some of the most desirable preworld war ii residences in 
budapest and other east bloc capitals but there is no parallel to 
the building boom now being financed by budapests wealthy 
throughout the area around endroedy and tuske streets workers 
are busy completing three and fourstory homes and landscaped 
estates owned by hungarys top professionals they include medical 
specialists lawyers art dealers popular entertainers and private 
entrepeneurs who have parlayed highdemand services such as auto 
repair and real estate into substantial profits 
from their terraces and balconies homeowners have a commanding 
view of the citys skyline and the danube river 
high concrete walls ensure cozy seclusion expensive 
westernmade automobiles are parked in many of the new twocar 
garages 
economic reforms introduced in the late 1960s encouraged limited 
private ownership and enterprise those activities were allowed to 
expand in the 1970s and small private companies and cooperative 
partnerships flourished 
people supplemented incomes with second jobs by running shops 
or offering soughtafter professional services the lucky ones have 
achieved perhaps the highest standard of living in the soviet bloc 
despite a growing foreign debt of 18 billion 18 percent 
inflation and recent government austerity measures the nations 
successful professionals still seem to have plenty of cash to spend 
on luxuries once reserved for the party elite 
with few opportunities to reinvest the accumulated wealth the 
newly rich have gone on a building spree 
many of the new homes in the buda hills cost more than the 
equivalent of 150000 state housing officials estimate 
most hungarians must set their sights far lower thousands of 
families still wait in austere housing projects and decaying 
apartment buildings for new lodgings that better suit their needs 
ivan t berend president of the hungarian academy of sciences 
and a leading economic reformer has called hungarys housing 
shortage the nations no 1 social problem 
erzsebet rikli head of budapests housing authority said 
66000 people are on the agencys waiting list for new apartments 
she said the average waiting period for young singles is eight to 
10 years married couples with one child wait about five years 
while families with three or more children can hope for a new 
apartment in about a year 
far from criticizing the upsurge in posh new developments like 
the buda hills housing hungarian government officials say they are 
an important part of a broader program designed to expand private 
housing ventures 
these private and cooperative efforts are extremely important 
in solving our current housing crisis rikli said we encourage 
people to take the initiative 
in recent years the hungarian government has gradually reduced 
its involvement in new housing construction relying increasingly 
on private and cooperative efforts to fill the gap 
of the 10000 new apartments built in budapest each year only 
1500 are now constructed by the state 
the state is also putting apartments up for sale in many housing 
complexes hastily erected in the 1960s and 1970s 
housing costs remain high despite new government credits to ease 
the burden 
the average monthly salary is 6000 forint 130 while the 
budapest housing authority estimates that the average new 
twobedroom apartment sells for 13 million forint 28260 
austerity measures designed to curb inflation and reduce the 
foreign debt are further reducing the buying power of many 
hungarians leading to growing resentment at the ostentatious 
lifestyle of those in the buda hills 
there is growing social tension said rikli the tolerance 
level is getting lower

government leaders appear to have forgone for 
the moment the uncustomary practice of lambasting the united 
states an ally and investor of long standing but they may start 
again at election time 
having the audacity to bash a superpower even if its your 
largest trading partner and strongest friend is one way to rally 
voters an asian diplomat said 
parliamentary elections must be held by december 1989 in this 
island republic of 26 million people but are expected to be called 
about a year earlier 
the peoples action party of prime minister lee kwan yew has 
been in power since 1959 and won its seventh election in 1984 
capturing 77 of the 79 parliament seats it won only 63 percent of 
the popular vote however compared to 76 percent the time before 
no viable opposition is in sight but lees party has lost the 
affections of some voters and its authoritarian style grates on an 
electorate that is becoming better educated and more affluent 
under his leadership singapore has been transformed from a 
shabby british colonial outpost to a regional banking industrial 
and communications center 
direct us investment is 23 billion and increasing by about 
200 million a year according to us statistics the largest 
private employer is seagate technology a us diskdrive 
manufacturer that began with 50 workers six years ago and now 
employs 13000 
lee the longestserving democratically elected leader in the 
world forged close links with washington years ago 
he was invited to address a joint session of congress in 1985 
and is among the few heads of asian governments to be outspoken in 
support of keeping us military bases in the philippines 
so why did his subordinates aim harsh words at the united 
states adding it to a list of targets including otherwise 
unspecified foreign powers foreign journalists marxist 
conspirators australia and international human rights and legal 
oganizations 
one european diplomat suggested tensions involving both the 
coming election and other impending changes were responsible 
the prime minister will be 65 in september and has indicated he 
may retire from office 
it has been confirmed that the constitution will be amended to 
give executive powers to the largely ceremonial presidency 
speculation is widespread that lee will be the first executive 
president 
former president cv devan nair and other critics say the 
government used the specter of foreign menace to deflect attention 
from a joint statement in april by nine former political detainees 
who said they were falsely arrested as alleged subversives a year 
ago and physically abused 
earlier this year washington said it will remove singapore 
taiwan hong kong and south korea the fastgrowing economic 
dragons of asia from the generalized system of preferences the 
policy takes effect in january 
under the preference system certain goods from developing 
countries have dutyfree access to the united states the four 
countries no longer are regarded as developing 
the other three took it in stride but singapore said it was 
betrayed because washington promised to retain the special 
treatment if it tightened laws against patent and copyright piracy 
which it did 
a carefully arranged demonstration was staged at the us 
embassy 
relations grew worse may 7 when singapore expelled e mason 
hendrickson first secretary in the us embassys political 
section 
hendrickson was accused of meddling in domestic politics by 
encouraging several lawyers to run as independents against 
government party candidates in the next election 
washington said his actions were nothing more than normal 
diplomatic informationgathering it ousted a singaporean of 
equivalent rank from the united states in response 
singapore alleged that hendrickson and other state department 
officials had dealings with francis seow 59 a former 
solicitorgeneral and president of the law society 
seow has been in jail for a year under the internal security 
act which allows detention without trial to keep him from 
acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of singapore 
in the home ministrys words 
lee said charges of meddling should not be allowed to harm 
longterm relations between singapore and the united states 
he told parliament his country was not condemning the criminal 
designs of an enemy but regretting the misdemeanors of a friend 
we should not harm our longterm basic interests when we 
protest against this unwarranted american interference 
his moderate tone contrasted with shrill rhetoric from others 
goh chok tong deputy prime minister threatened to reduce the 
number of diplomats allowed at the us embassy unless washington 
mended its ways 
goh 46 who is positioned to succeed lee said the country 
can move into a more neutral and nonaligned posture 
his remarks were made during five days of debate on a motion 
supporting firm action of the government to prevent our country 
from being subverted whether by marxists communists western 
powers or other foreign interest groups 
a cosponsor goh choon kang likened the countrys situation to 
that of a girl in a bar being molested by a sex maniac

george bush in the presidential polls but when it comes to 
handwriting the race is a draw 
thats the conclusion of the national coalition to stamp out 
chicken scratching organized as a publicity stunt for scripto 
corp a national pen manufacturer based in this los angeles suburb 
a coalition expert analyzed the penmanship of the various 
candidates in both parties and concluded tuesday that dukakis led 
the legibility race among the democrats and that bushs john 
hancock was the clearest in the gop pack 
the group declined to endorse either bush or dukakis in the 
writein contest said publicist bette dragoun pleading 
nonpartisanship 
we believe the next president should have respect for rule 
number 1 in basic fundamental interpersonal communication 
handwriting should be legible said charles lehman a portland 
ore writing expert who signed on as executive director of the 
coalition 
in true nonpartisan fashion the coalition voted a split ticket 
when it came to naming the sloppiest scrawlers in the presidential 
race 
illinois sen paul simons scribble was dubbed worst among the 
democrats the most impenetrable hieroglyphics in the gop were 
those of rep jack kemp of new york who dropped out early 
presumably because he saw the handwriting on the wall

when ralph shewell a high school 
history teacher challenged his class to resurrect a 1920s slang 
expression the typical reaction was banana oil 
so to speak anyway in the 1920s the term banana oil was 
as common an expression of disbelief as its contemporary 
counterparts no way or get out of here shewell said 
shewell offered his westminster high school class extra credits 
if they could coax someone in the national news media into using 
the phrase before june 14 
on tuesday the day of the deadline one effort bore fruit when 
a letter from sophomore nicky naylor appeared in a column by 
syndicated columnist ann landers 
in her published letter the student wrote if everyone who 
reads your column uses the expression im sure that by the end of 
the school year june 15 something might happen maybe this 
letter will prove that one unknown teenager can make something 
happen 
dear unknown teenager landers replied today is june 14 
it would be a miracle if a national news commentator said banana 
oil but maybe one of your local disc jockeys will read this say 
those immortal words on the air and you can persuade your teacher 
to count it please let us know what happens 
shewell said he may count the appearance of banana oil in 
the column for the extra credit he said he came up with the 
challenge while his class was studying the fads of the 1920s 
just to motivate them to get interested in the times 
ms naylor 16 said she sent her letter to landers because the 
columns go everywhere 
i was gonna write to dan rather ms naylor added but i 
kind of figured i wouldnt hear anything about that at all

north dakotans rejected a lottery for the second time in 18 
months tuesday while virginians chose democrat lf payne jr as 
their newest congressman and a conservative ll bean heiress lost 
her bid for a us house nomination from maine 
with 77 percent of the north dakota vote in the lottery was 
opposed by 41505 voters or 59 percent and favored by 28391 voters 
or 41 percent 
it would seem to me the vote is a decisive expression of the 
will of the people and i would hope that the proponents would 
accept the decision of the voters of north dakota said former 
gov arthur link 
but backers said the lottery question probably would be on the 
general election ballot in november 
payne developer of a ski and golf resort defeated the 
republican candidate former white house aide linda arey in a 
special election in the southside 5th district he succeeds rep 
wc dan daniel a conservative democrat who died of a heart 
attack in january while serving his 10th term 
with all the vote counted payne had 55406 votes or 59 percent 
to ms areys 38086 votes or 41 percent 
in maines southern 1st district linda beanjones was edged by 
senatorial aide edward s omeara for the gop nomination to oppose 
democratic rep joseph e brennan a former twoterm governor 
with 96 percent of the vote counted omeara had 15313 votes or 
52 percent and beanjones had 14102 votes or 48 percent 
recounts dont seem to pay off beanjones said im still 
going to be around were not going to disappear i feel i have a 
role to play in politics 
south carolina also had congressional primaries and in the only 
challenge to an incumbent threeterm democratic rep robin tallon 
easily turned back retired postal worker luther lighty in the 6th 
district with 98 percent of the vote in tallon had 64548 votes 
or 89 percent and lighty had 8262 votes or 11 percent 
besides the lottery vote north dakotans also had the 
lastinthenation presidential primary but because of its late 
date no democrats bothered to file and on the republican side the 
ballot listed only vice president george bush who long has had 
the nomination wrapped up and mary jane rachner a retired 
teacher who says the spirits of her late mother and grandmother 
told her to run for president 
with 16 gop delegates at stake bush was piling up 94 percent of

the north dakota lottery was defeated in november 1986 the 
first time a state had failed to approve a staterun lottery 
twentysix states and the district of columbia currently have 
lotteries 
backers said a lottery would raise 7 million in new revenue for 
the state which is struggling through a depressed economy 
the atmosphere this time is a lot better said gorman king 
sr a mandan businessman who has led the drive for a lottery 
link a longtime foe of statesanctioned gaming found himself 
joined in opposition by some of north dakotas existing charitable 
gaming operators who feared a lottery would cut into their 
business 
beanjones granddaughter of outdoors outfitter ll bean and 
founder of a defunct conservative publication known as the maine 
paper tapped her personal wealth for her first political race 
spending 455000 out of her own pocket omeara a longtime 
district aide to sen william s cohen spent between 60000 and 
65000 
because of a tradition of neutrality in primaries the moderate 
omeara was unable to draw active support from top republicans 
although his rhetoric that at times suggested the soul of the state 
party was at stake 
beanjones stressed her business background as a real estate 
agent and entrepreneur contrasting it against omearas years as a 
government insider 
last week she was quoted in the kennebec journal in augusta as 
calling the minimum wage an oppressive law that keeps people 
from working and saying she would vote to abolish the 335 
standard she later issued a statement saying she thought she had 
been asked about a pending bill to increase the minimum wage but 
her statement did not disclaim her comments in the story 
in virginia neither ms arey 43 nor payne 42 was well known 
in the 5th 10th district and neither had sought elective office 
previously

sunday in danville a textile and tobacco center payne stressed 
his ties to the states democratic party and received backing from 
gov gerald l baliles 
ms arey and payne both had their partys nominations to compete

the cycle of terror and hatred in israel and 
the occupied territories has created a psychological barrier 
between jews and palestinians that distances prospects for peace in 
the middle east social scientists say 
we israelis and palestinians both feel trapped in this 
conflict if we dont master our emotions they will master us 
bernard sabella a palestinian sociologist told an unusual joint 
seminar of jewish and arab social scientists on tuesday 
about 400 leftwing israelis and several dozen arabs attended 
the daylong conference aimed at discussing how to minimize the 
psychological damage caused by the violence 
during the conference israelis poured out guilt feelings about 
being occupiers and palestinians spoke of the pain of their 
sixmonthold uprising 
many voiced concern that the prolonged conflict which dates to 
early in the century when the british ruled palestine is causing 
children to grow up in hatred making peace unattainable 
each society the israelis and the palestinian feels a need 
to politicize their children we socialize our children into the 
conflict it is a central element in their willingness to continue 
it said sabella who teaches at bethlehem university 
but he said the palestinians after 21 years of israeli military 
rule in the west bank and gaza strip had no choice but to stage 
the uprising 
we are suffering from the intefadeh sabella said using the 
arabic term for uprising it is a trip not a happy trip but a 
trip we have been forced to take 
since the rebellion began dec 8 in the occupied lands more 
than 205 palestinians have been killed two israelis have also died 
the conference was held at a hotel in primarily jewish west 
jerusalem because no institution could be found to sponsor the 
meeting 
the israelis who took part were not typical of the population 
which polls show is becoming more hawkish most at the session were 
critical of their countrys treatment of arabs and of its failure 
to do enough to get peace talks started 
psychoanalyst joachim stein said israeli jews are largely 
denying that the violence is at a crisis point or they are 
rationalizing tough tactics against arabs as a necessary defense 
against threats to their security he said 
stein said centuries of persecution and the more recent 
experience of being surrounded by enemy arab countries has made 
jews accustomed to feeling like victims 
there is a complex here where the conqueror always feels he is 
conquered he said we continue to be victims even though 
others are the victims how do we emerge out of this vicious 
cycle 
about 20 jewish psychologists also debated the question in a 
heated twohour encounter group one of the topics was a string of 
recent fires blamed on palestinians that have razed more than 
25000 acres of trees and pastures 
pedro rothman a teacher said that because of the fires it was 
difficult for him to educate his pupils to empathize with the arabs 
as much as i identify with the palestinian problem i get up 
every morning and i see that they are burning down forests and it 
really hurts he said i was taught to think of trees as being 
like human beings 
but countered nitza aminov if you have trouble dealing with 
burning forests then show the pupils a picture of the baby from 
gaza and ask them how they think she feels she was referring to 
a 9monthold arab girl whose eye was knocked out recently by a 
rubber bullet 
the army has apologized for the incident 
other jewish social scientists said they felt an identity crisis 
because the armys heavy hand in quelling riots conflicted with 
democratic and other values 
i have this fear that were losing our own sense of justice 
this is a terrible thing for a nation to lose said psychologist

actress zsa zsa gabor has filed a 
30 million libel suit against the new york post over a story that 
quoted her as saying hitler had his good points according to 
her attorney 
the lawsuit says the comments were falsely attributed to miss 
gabor and that she was emotionally distressed by the report said 
paul monzione an attorney with melvin bellis law firm in san 
francisco 
the lawsuit which names the new york post co and several 
unidentified individuals was filed monday in the los angeles 
county superior court here a clerk said 
an editor at the post referred questions to attorney charles 
moerdler who had left his office and was not available by 
telephone tuesday afternoon he did not return the associated 
press telephone call tuesday night 
monzione said the posts april 22 story described a 
confrontation that miss gabor had with another guest on the regis 
philbin show a talk show televised in the new york city area 
she was so upset by the confrontation on live television she 
began making statements and comments but at no time did she ever 
say the things that the post stated were her statements monzione 
said 
the lawyer said the alleged libel described zsa zsa as getting 
into a limousine drinking some vodka and then launching into a 
diatribe the gist of which was that hitler had his good 
points 
miss gabor is not a drinker and never has been and so to 
attribute that practice to her is just flat out wrong monzione 
said but even more damaging is attributing the statement to her 
that hitler had his good points 
monzione said the newspaper subsequently published a retraction 
saying it was unable to confirm that miss gabor had made the 
statement but he said the retraction wasnt given sufficient 
prominence and should have unequivocally stated that the 
hungarianborn actress never made the statement

presbyterians overwhelmingly adopted a major 
statement on christian responsibilities in a nuclear age tuesday 
after lengthy revisions to mollify members who feared the church 
was embracing civil disobedience 
the general assembly of the 3 millionmember presbyterian church 
usa broke into applause at the announcement of the 50268 
vote adoption of christian obedience in the nuclear age ended 
a process that began in 1983 when congregations asked the church 
how to deal with tax resisters 
also tuesday the rev james e andrews was narrowly elected to 
a second fouryear term as stated clerk of the general assembly he 
defeated harriet nelson a lay leader from california 323298 
andrews 59 said he had been sent a message by the narrow 
margin to heal the divisions in the denomination stemming from its 
formation in the 1983 merger of the united presbyterian church 
usa and the presbyterian church us 
in other action the assembly recommended a higher minimum wage 
and called for a national dialogue on the status of americans 
indians it also began moving through suggested actions on 
abortion pornography health costs and religious freedom in an 
effort to pass resolutions before the nine day meeting ends 
wednesday 
conservatives within the denomination have blamed declining 
membership on what they perceive to be increasingly liberal stances 
by the churchs bureaucracy under andrews there also have been 
complaints that the church was not attentive enough to evangelism 
on saturday a committee nominated nelson among seven candidates 
for the post surprising many who expected the panel to nominate 
two people including andrews in nominating mrs nelson the rev 
j randolph taylor called andrews a reminder of our divided 
past and said the church needs a sense of newness 
andrews who was stated clerk of the smaller pcus from 1973 to 
1983 said he thought the vote showed the delegates believed his 
faults are correctable he promised he would be very active 
in bringing in various viewpoints various factions together in 
a denomination thats growing up 
he also said many of the churchs problems reflect the 
difficulty of consolidating the old atlanta headquarters of the 
pcus and the new york headquarters of the upcusa in louisville ky 
most of the move is expected to be complete by the end of this year 
nelson who comes from the upcusa did not comment on the vote 
but said prior to the election that she would do whatever the 
church asked of her 
the stated clerk is the chief constitutional officer of the 
church and represents the church in ecumenical bodies oversees the 
preparation for and operation of the annual assembly and runs a 
staff of 65 people with a budget of about 7 million the post 
carries a salary of 62000 a year 
the heavily revised document on christian obediance in a nuclear 
age lays out ways the church can deal with government resisters but 
stresses that normal behavior is to obey civilian authorities the 
paper also says nuclear war is immoral and nuclear deterrence as 
an adequate permanent means to national security is not 
morally defensible 
groups working on the paper reviewed the policy statement and 
recommendations linebyline revising it throughout to indicate 
obeying the government is normally the case 
however recognizing god alone is lord of the conscience 
the paper says under certain circumstances however 
noncooperation with or disobedience to duly constituted 
authorities has been deemed an appropriate christian response 
the paper was revised to delete language that suggested the 
church provide financial support for members who refuse to pay 
taxes in protest against military spending 
nevertheless the paper requests church agencies to set up a 
voluntary fund for obedience to a higher authority for the 
assistance of those who suffer financial loss or difficulty as a 
result of acts of conscience 
the paper also was changed to include a statement that military 
service can be an acceptable response to conscience 
the adoption came after several committee members told the 
assembly they had intended to vote against the paper but had 
changed their minds as the deliberations went on 
fountain odom of charlotte nc a onetime unsuccessful senate 
candidate told the assembly he first felt the paper was the 
epitome of naive simplicity but odom said the final document 
is true to the gospel and allows strong divergent emotional 
views within the church 
with no discussion the assembly adopted a lengthy discussion of 
pornography that concludes it is fundamentally caused by sexism 
the recommendations reiterate the churchs call for the enactment 
of the equal rights amendment 
the statement also directs church officials to return to the 
assembly in two years with a recommended public policy statement 
in the meantime the churchs mission responsibility through 
investment committee is to investigate the pornography industry to 
determine whether church assets are invested with companies that 
profit from pornography including telephone services 
earlier tuesday the assembly voted to set up a national 
dialogue on american indians in response to president reagans 
comments in moscow saying the us government had humored 
native americans by establishing reservations 
the assembly also recommended a hike in the minimum wage from 
335 per hour to its historical level of 50 percent of the 
average nonsupervisory nonagricultural wage and provide for 
regular increases that will keep the minimum wage at an adequate 
level to lift people out of poverty 
congress currently is considering legislation that would raise 
the minimum wage to 465 an hour the first increase since 1981 
such an increase would meet the 50 percent criterion called for by 
the presbyterians

spanks pinches and other aversive therapy 
techniques would be outlawed for treating severely handicapped and 
autistic youngsters under measure approved by the massachusetts 
house 
the legislation approved tuesday and sent to the senate was 
prompted by the 1985 death of a young autistic patient at behavior 
research institute a treatment center for severely disturbed 
youngsters in providence ri that has residential facilities in 
massachusetts 
after the death the state office for children attempted to ban 
the use of aversive therapy an aggressive form of behavior 
modification using rewards and escalating punishments 
but the states courts overturned the ban siding with the 
institute and some parents who said that aversive therapy is a 
lifesaving treatment for the most extremely selfdestructive 
patients who are not helped by any other program 
they call it treatment they call it behavioral modification 
it is corporal punishment said rep paul kollios he said the 
therapy would constitute child abuse or assault in any other 
setting 
rep thomas walsh offered an amendment that would allow judges 
to certify aversive therapy programs and order the treatment for 
specific individuals 
it is not corporal punishment it is a lifesaving treatment 
parents whose children receive it support it almost to the 
person said rep philip travis who supported the amendment 
but proponents of the ban refused to consider the amendment and 
the house rejected it 
we have to be naive if not silly to think that a court 
monitor and a treatment plan is going to ensure what is not 
abusive said rep david cohen the people doing the whacking 
the slapping and the shackling are among the lowestpaid people in 
the mental health system

searing drought that has withered fields in 
americas breadbasket could escalate into fullscale disaster 
unless rain comes soon the nations top farm official says 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng told lawmakers tuesday 
that the government is providing aid to ease what could well be a 
catastrophe he said it was still a little bit soon to say we 
have a general disaster nationwide but the potential is there 
wheat fields in montana and the dakotas already are in bad 
shape he said and additional weeks of scorching temperatures and 
no rain could cause severe damage in the corn belt and across the 
south 
corn and soybeans are drawing on moisture stored in soil and 
remain viable he said he added that july weather is more critical 
to the crops and good rainfall from now on could do much to 
revitalize them 
lyng answered questions tuesday morning from the senate 
agriculture committee and returned to capitol hill in the afternoon 
for a talk with house agriculture committee chairman e kika de 
la garza dtexas 
lawmakers are talking about congressional action to help ease 
farm money woes arising from the drought both house and senate 
have formed task forces to work with lyng in formulating a bill the 
white house would accept 
such a bill would involve a hefty payout and sen richard lugar 
rind warned his colleagues against disparate legislative 
initiatives hung on various bills and flying in from various places 
with no certainty that the administration would accept them 
there may be no rain sen rudy boschwitz rminn said 
but theres going to be a rain of various proposals with everyone 
trying to outdo one another whoever gets to the press first 
lyng said it was too early to push such a measure now but said 
it was important to be ready to do so before congress adjourns this 
fall 
i guess the best thing for us to do is pray for rain lyng 
said he noted that usda already is providing an array of emergency 
aid payments 
but he continued to reject opening conservation reserve program 
acres for cutting hay and grazing livestock a move sought by 
farmers facing livestock feed shortages because of the drought 
the program is a special 1985 plan to take 45 million highly 
erodible acres out of production for a decade and plant them in 
grasses and trees it is separate from usdas annual conservation 
program which already has been opened for haying and grazing in 
more than 900 counties 
stock producers in montana the dakotas and minnesota are among 
those pushing for permission to use hay on the reserve program 
acreage 
i dont know of anything that irritates my producers more than 
to drive right by all this hay as they drive their cattle south 
sen tom daschle dsd told lyng 
the drought already is driving up crop prices as wheat fields 
turn brown higher prices in turn are shrinking government 
incomesupport payments for farmers 
some farmers are thus faced with the prospect of having no crop 
they can take to market at the same time that their federal 
payments are drying up and some may be forced to repay part of the 
advance incomesupport payments they already have received 
the emergency is upon us declared sen john melcher 
dmont the disaster is here 
if the skies open up it looks like we have lost 40 percent to 
50 percent of the crop said sen kent conrad dnd 
one concept under discussion among lawmakers would guarantee 
minimum incomesupport payments to farmers 
these amounts formally called deficiency payments represent 
the difference between market prices and target prices that are 
adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture as market prices 
move up the difference becomes smaller and smaller and the farmers 
receive less from the government 
the system is supposed to work that way except that when 
drought destroys crops the farmers do not receive the benefit of 
the higher market prices 
the shrinking deficiency payments mean cost estimates for farm 
programs are moving downward in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars said ewen m wilson assistant secretary of agriculture 
for economics 
lawmakers are talking about recycling the savings and using them 
to bolster farm incomes in drought areas

howard baker jr says his resignation as white 
house chief of staff isnt a sign of lameduck status for president 
reagan but its being read that way just the same 
one former senior white house official said after bakers 
departure was announced tuesday that the remaining days of the 
reagan presidency amount to a caretaker period its just a 
holdtheline thing said the former official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
baker himself conceded in an interview that the lameduck label 
is probably not far away and that other staff members are sure to 
leave as the clock runs down on the reagan administration 
and baker said the last major objective of a reagan presidency 
a strategic arms agreement with the soviet union probably is not 
possible for this president 
while it is not impossible it is not probable that we can do 
that but he certainly can narrow the differences and hand his 
successor major progress in this field baker said after the 
surprise announcement that he was leaving the white house 
effective july 1 
baker will be succeeded by his deputy kenneth duberstein 44 
who like baker has a reputation as a conciliator and shrewd 
negotiator particularly with congress 
duberstein will be responsible for directing the flow of paper 
and visitors to the presidents office and coordinating reagans 
schedule he will supervise a white house staff of about 325 people 
including speech writers counselors press officials and policy 
specialists 
along with baker white house communications chief thomas 
griscom said he too will be leaving soon though he did not say 
when griscom and baker have been longtime allies dating back to 
bakers service in the senate 
in discussing his departure baker did strike himself from the 
list of possible running mates with george bush on the republican 
presidential ticket 
you dont turn down requests of that sort if they are made 
baker said its really something that is presumptuous in the 
extreme to say no i would not do that but i do not want to do 
that i do not expect to do that and i think its extremely 
unlikely i would be asked to do that 
baker said he had told bush he was quitting but did not raise 
the issue of whether he might be available as a running mate 
laughingly baker added more important hes never discussed 
that with me 
when duberstein replaces baker there will be slightly more than 
six months remaining in reagans presidency it will be only four 
months before reagans successor is chosen 
he will be a lame duck at some point but it will be after 
labor day in my view at least baker said and who knows he 
may not be then if were making progress especially on foreign 
policy issues 
reagan asked during a picturetaking session if bakers 
departure was evidence of a fading administration replied well 
i dont think it should be he had his reasons for what hes had to 
do were going to miss him of course 
baker joined the white house on feb 27 1987 abandoning his 
own presidential ambitions to help reagan dig out from the 
irancontra scandal he replaced the embattled donald t regan who 
was at odds with nancy reagan and bore the scars of the irancontra 
affair 
baker said his objective was to see reagan through the turmoil 
of the irancontra situation see that he wasnt immobilized 
during that period as richard nixon was during the watergate 
hearings and see that he didnt lose any foreign policy 
opportunities arms control 
and i think that is clearly accomplished so this is a nice 
breakpoint and its a good time to go 
moreover he noted that his wife joy has been chronically ill 
for some time and that his 86yearold stepmother irene has been 
hospitalized with stomach pains i feel a little like the man who 
walks around with a black cloud over his head baker said 
looking back over his 16 months as chief of staff baker said 
if there is a legacy it is that we brought cooperation and 
direction to the white house and to the staff it was really in a 
pretty low state when we got here 
and i couldnt ascertain that there was any agenda much 
baker said we had to sort of invent one and take it to the 
president

a washington lobbyist a boston insurance 
company a thirdgrade teacher and a member of congress were among 
bulk buyers of a book that netted house speaker jim wright nearly 
55000 in royalties 
wright dtexas mentioned the purchasers tuesday when reporters 
asked him who had bought multiple copies of his 1984 book 
reflections of a public man 
critics of the speaker have alleged that the book which was 
sold primarily in bulk and at political rallies was a thinly 
disguised way for lobbyists and others seeking favors to give money 
to wright who was house majority leader at the time the book deal 
is among the items being examined by the house ethics committee in 
its investigation of wright 
wright has defended his receipt of royalties from the slim 
117page volume as proper and contends the attacks on him are an 
electionyear gambit by republicans wright is to be chairman of 
the democratic national convention in atlanta next month 
the new england life insurance company in boston was among bulk 
buyers of the book senior vice president gordon mackay said the 
company had invited wright to speak to a management group about 
three years ago and bought 2000 worth of wrights books instead 
of giving him an honorarium 
there is a limit on the amount of honoraria a member of congress 
can receive each year but there is no limit on income from book 
royalties 
mackay said he found the book enjoyable it gave insights into 
the man the company sent its 336 copies to be distributed to 
local high school civics classes he said 
the book was published for wright by a fort worth friend of the 
speaker william carlos moore who also has done some 600000 
worth of campaign work for wright over the years wright received a 
55 percent royalty or 325 for each 595 volume sold totaling 
55000 nearly all 20000 copies printed have been sold 
the ethics panel formally known as the committee on standards 
of official conduct also is looking into the propriety of wrights 
use of a congressional staff member to compile and edit the book 
and wrights use of tax money to pay the aides expenses for a 
threeweek final editing trip to fort worth in late 1984 
craig raupe a former wright aide who now lobbies congress for a 
long list of private businesses also bought numerous copies the 
speaker said raupe said he bought only 10 and gave them away to 
family members 
but raupe also said he arranged for the copies to be purchased 
by the new england life insurance company im not saying hes a 
great author or anything but id do this for him whether i was on 
staff or not raupe said 
lobbying records show raupe represents the new england life 
insurance company along with a number of energy and transportation 
companies 
another bulk purchaser was a wright constituent clarence swor 
who owns a sand and gravel company near forth worth dorothy 
harkness an longtime employee of swor said he was hard of hearing 
and could not come to the telephone but she acknowledged her boss 
had bought 200 copies and sent them to relatives 
she said swor had known wright since the speaker was mayor of 
weatherford texas in the 1950s and felt gratitude since wright 
once stopped and gave him a ride when his cattle truck was broken 
down they have been friends ever since she said 
charlene bice a thirdgrade teacher in forth worth who is on 
the board of directors of the national education association sold 
about 250 copies to other teachers for placement in school 
libraries around the state she said bice is a longtime campaign 
worker for wright 
wright also said rep bart gordon dtenn bought 150 copies of 
the book an aide to gordon harrison wadsworth said the books 
were bought with gordons campaign funds and given to contributors 
at an aug 3 1985 fundraiser in tennessee where wright spoke 
the speaker also mentioned several purchasers whose names had 
been previously reported including s gene payte a fort worth 
developer who bought 1000 copies of the book to funnel money to 
wright 
i was just trying to make a contribution to jims income 
payte told the new york times and i couldnt give him any money 
there are rules against that so i bought his book 
others who bought 1000 copies each included the teamsters 
union former democratic national committee chairman john c white 
bernard rapoport chairman of the american income life insurance 
company in waco texas and leslie a berkowitz who was a lobbyist 
for a texas gas pipeline company 
meanwhile it appeared that wrights next publishing venture may 
be a casualty of the current controversy wright has indicated that 
he no longer has time to devote to collaborating with aide george 
mair on a book about speakers of the house through its first 200 
years 
mair acknowledged tuesday that we may be overcome by events 
its just a casualty of circumstances

syndicated columnist carl t rowan says he 
still strongly opposes handguns even though he used one to shoot a 
teenager who had taken an uninvited dip in his backyard swimming 
pool 
i am absolutely for gun control i still am said rowan 
but as long as we have a situation where druggies can get guns 
easily you have to protect yourself 
rowan shot the 18yearold youth in the wrist early tuesday 
morning at his home in an affluent section of the city he said he 
fired only after the young man lunged at him 
the youth ben smith of chevy chase md disputed rowans 
account saying he was trying to flee when rowan shot him thats 
no reason to shoot a person for swimming in his pool smith 
said 
smith and a companion were initially charged with unlawful 
entry but those charges were dropped later on tuesday 
police said the 22 caliber pistol rowan used was not registered 
with the city which has some of the toughest guncontrol laws in 
the nation rowan said however that it was registered with the 
federal government 
the district of columbia passed a law in 1976 saying that only 
guns already then registered were legal for private possession 
police said their investigation was continuing 
rowan said he was awakened at about 155 am by the sound of 
someone outside his bedroom window 
i lay there thinking did i dream that then i heard a woman 
scream or shout he said 
he said he peeked out saw four people at his pool and called 
the police 
after i called the police i got the gun said rowan 
he said the weapon was given to him by his son carl t rowan 
jr an attorney and former fbi agent after he had received 
several threats 
when i saw the police cars arriving i opened the pool door 
assuming the police would want to come in that way 
i was confronted by a tall young man striding over as if 
coming into my house 
first i said freeze then i said i warn you i have a 
gun 
he said aw hell man and kept coming 
that kid was at point blank range as he tried to come into my 
house i was trying to let him know he was walking into peril i 
was shooting at his feet but he was lunging at me 
smith who was treated at georgetown university hospital and 
released in good condition told local radio station wmal that he 
was on rowans property but didnt threaten him 
he had no right to shoot me i mean i guess i was trespassing 
thats no reason to shoot a person for swimming in his pool 
smith said 
smith said he was trying to flee when he was confronted by rowan 
smith and a companion laura bachman 19 of bethesda md were 
charged by police with unlawful entry but those charges were later 
dropped by the us attorney which prosecutes all crimes in the 
district of columbia rowan said the others he saw at the pool got 
away 
a spokesman for the us attorneys office who asked not to be 
identified said the investigation of the case continued as did 
dc police spokesman capt william white 
rowan said the gun which police confiscated was purchased by 
his son when he was with the fbi and is registered with the federal 
government 
when he left the fbi he went to the district authorities to 
see if it had to be registered with the district said rowan 
they said it didnt need to be 
he left the gun in my house to protect the family during a 
period a few years ago when we were receiving threats rowan 
said last night was the first time i ever fired that weapon 
rowan was criticized as hypocritical by wayne lapierre 
legislative coordinator for the national rifle association 
hes another example of someone who is out front for taking 
firearms away from other people but when they make the decision 
for themselves they choose to own one said lapierre

the house took a look toward the fall election 
and decided now is not the time to give itself a pay raise but it 
left intact plans to boost salaries for federal civilian employees 
by a vote of 230170 the lawmakers on tuesday stripped from a 
government spending bill a proposed 4 percent hike in pay for 
themselves and other top government officials they left in place 
the boost in salaries for other federal workers 
the house then voted 30196 for the overall bill a 161 
billion spending package for the treasury postal service the 
executive office of the president and other federal agencies the 
measure now goes to the senate 
members of congress now make 89500 and the bill would have let 
that automatically increase by 4 percent next january along with 
the rest of the federal work force 
rep phil crane rill offered the amendment to block the 
raises for lawmakers supreme court justices cabinet officers and 
other federal officials at the top of the pay scale 
crane said congress didnt deserve more pay especially given 
its dismal record in reducing federal deficits 
i think based upon performance we should not be 
contemplating such pay raises just a little over a year since 
congress last boost he said he suggested that lawmakers consider 
putting themselves on a commission basis as an incentive to 
reduce federal red ink although that was not part of his 
legislative proposal 
several members defended the increases as needed to attract top 
people to government 
rep steny hoyer dmd said hed want the voters to throw him 
out of office if they didnt think he deserved the same pay 
increase as other federal employees 
its image its political posturing hoyer said of the 
amendment 
the pay raise issue dominated tuesdays debate but the 
presidents office of management and budget said other problems 
with the bill were the ones likely to provoke a veto 
omb said the house was failing to provide money to cover the pay 
boosts twice what the president recommended for the bulk of the 
federal work force the agency said congress should have cut 
spending to offset the increases instead of waiting for additional 
federal spending later 
the bill also contains 417 million in postal subsidies opposed 
by the white house and some federal construction projects for 
which omb said congress had not properly accounted for the cost 
across the capitol the senate voted 7818 to approve a 18 
billion bill covering congressional operations in the coming fiscal 
year 
the measure a 22 million increase over this years spending 
covers the current salaries and expenses of lawmakers and 
congressional employees and the costs of upkeep and protection for 
the buildings where they work 
the senate did not address the issue of pay raises for members 
of congress and other top government officials in this measure 
the house passed a similar version of that bill last month a 
few minor differences will have to be worked out by negotiators 
from the two chambers before the bill can be sent to the president

in choosing kenneth m duberstein as his new 
white house chief of staff president reagan has turned to a 
skilled parliamentary veteran in the tradition of retiring chief 
howard h baker jr 
otherwise the two men could hardly be more different 
duberstein 44 is a peppery brooklyn native with a gift for gab 
who was lobbying for the general services administration while 
baker was building his reputation in the senate as a watergate 
interrogator 
baker 62 is a slow spoken tennessean with a gift for 
compromise widely credited with regrouping the white house staff 
after the irancontra debacle but also criticized as too easygoing 
in the hot seat he inherited from donald regan 
reagan announced tuesday that baker is resigning for personal 
reasons effective july 1 and that duberstein his deputy will 
succeed him 
dubersteins biggest problem is going to be that he doesnt 
have a duberstein said tom korologos a washington lobbyist with 
strong administration ties 
ken was the tactician the strategist the handson mover and 
shaker and baker thought deep thoughts said korologos 
another source a reagan administration veteran who spoke on 
condition he not be identified said duberstein has a lot of 
energy there will be a lot of hard charging 
howard liebengood a longtime baker aide in the senate said 
youve got to consider that this is howard bakers first 
experience being a staff person he was always the principal as 
senator from tennessee and as minority and majority leader 
duberstein on the other hand has been a staff person most of 
his life 
he started out in 1965 fresh out of franklin amp marshall college 
in lancaster pa as an intern for sen jacob javits rny he 
left javits staff as a research assistant in 1967 and returned to 
his alma mater for five years as assistant to the president 
from 1972 to 1976 he was director of congressional and 
intergovernmental affairs for the gsa the landlord agency for the 
federal government 
duberstein also served as deputy undersecretary of labor 
responsible for legislative and intergovernmental activities in 
the ford administration 
during the white house term of democrat jimmy carter he served 
for four years as vice president and director of 
businessgovernment relations for the committee for economic 
development an organization of business and university leaders 
he joined the reagan administration at the outset in january 
1981 as chief lobbyist at the house of representatives he was 
later promoted to head of the legislative affairs office 
in december 1983 he left the administration to join the 
washingtonbased business consulting firm of timmons and co as 
vice president he came back to the white house in march 1987 as 
bakers deputy 
ken will be my principal aide and will lead the white house 
staff as we head into the home stretch said reagan 
he will be reagans fourth chief of staff the first was james 
a baker iii who became treasury secretary early in 1985 by 
trading jobs with regan bakers predecessor 
duberstein is married to the former sydney greenberg and has 
three children jennifer 13 jeffrey 3 and andrew 1

the matching snow crystals were discovered during cloud research 
by nancy c knight of the national center for atmospheric research 
in boulder colo 
one of the most quoted statements about snow crystals is that 
no two are alike a bit of folk wisdom that is generally accepted 
even among those few regarded as experts in the subject mrs 
knight wrote in a letter appearing in the just published may 
edition of the bulletin of the american meteorological society 
but she went on she has found a striking example of two snow 
crystals which if not identical are certainly very much alike 
in many years of snowcrystal collection the author has seen 
no other examples of such crystals nor are any given in the 
standard references she wrote 
my first reaction was to say thats absolutely 
impossible said her husband charles knight also a researcher 
at the center 
but there the two crystals were side by side on a slide 
exposed in a cloud on a research flight over wausau wis 
when you say no two are identical thats a sort of 
philosophical question there have been an awful lot of snow 
crystals over the history of the earth said knight whose wife 
is out of the country doing research 
especially with small ones it is likely many were similar to 
one another but these two are a paradox he said in a telephone 
interview 
meteorologists prefer the term snow crystals to snowflakes 
because the structures take many forms other than the commonly 
pictured sixpointed star snow crystals also can be shaped like 
columns needles plates and just plain lumps 
the crystals photographed by mrs knight are shaped like columns 
with vaseshaped hollow centers they are very tiny only 
onequarter millimeter 0009 inch the long way slightly less on 
the short side 
columnshaped snow is not really unusual knight said when 
you go out and see real snow crystals you begin to appreciate that 
those beautiful crystals in picture books are really quite rare 
because crystals tend to grow fastest at their edges 
columnshaped crystals with hollows in the middle called lacunas 
are not unusual 
the two virtually identical crystals were collected on nov 
1 1986 said knight the researchers were studying clouds at the 
time 
the crystals were collected on a glass plate coated with oil 
which was exposed to the cloud for 11 seconds at an altitude of 
nearly 20000 feet the plate was then kept cold until the airplane 
could return to the ground and the snow crystals were photographed 
the crystals in question dont exist any more knight noted 
in order to develop such identical shapes the two had to go 
through identical growth histories accumulating freezing water 
as they passed through layers of cold air he said 
research in cirrus clouds like those where the matching crystals 
were found has become increasingly popular in recent years so more 
matched pairs could turn up he said

the judge in the irancontra conspiracy case 
is sticking with his decision to hold separate trials for former 
white house aide oliver l north and three codefendants 
us district judge gerhard a gesell on tuesday rejected 
independent counsel lawrence e walshs suggestion that he try 
north and former national security adviser john m poindexter 
together before two juries 
walshs proposal for a dualjury trial followed by another for 
arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard 
v secord was made last week after gesell ordered four separate 
trials 
the prosecutor who suffered a tactical and logistical blow by 
the judges ruling contended that four separate trials would 
inconvenience both the prosecution and the defense 
gesell ruled that each of the four men accused of conspiring to 
divert usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels must be 
tried separately to allow them to use each others immunized 
congressional testimony as evidence 
a joint trial would be impossible gesell ruled because a 
defendants right not to have his congressional testimony used 
against him would conflict with a codefendants right to use all 
available evidence to help his defense 
the judge has not ruled definitively on whether the 
congressional immunity given north poindexter and hakim would 
prevent the cases from going forward 
but gesell gave further indication tuesday that he planned to 
proceed with a trial of north whom walsh has designated as the 
leadoff defendant 
in a memorandum issued to explain why he canceled mondays 
hearing to take testimony on the issue gesell said he wanted to 
defer this aspect for posttrial consideration at which time 
counsel will be guided by the courts forthcoming opinion 
the defense contends that the prosecution was tainted by 
exposure to the testimony the three men gave under grants of 
limited immunity from prosecution 
gesell has indicated he will rule on pending pretrial motions 
by july 1 to enable him to set a prompt trial date 
the judge rejected as too cumbersome walshs proposal for 
twojury trials under walshs plan the jury considering the 
evidence against poindexter for example would have left the 
courtroom when norths lawyers cited the former national security 
advisers congressional testimony 
quite unlike any prior twojury trial the need to exclude one 
jury alternating with the other will continually arise with 
practically every witness and an orderly trial free of error could 
not be achieved gesell said 
the judge also indicated that it might be unnecessary for walsh 
to divide his staff into three trial teams to prevent his 
prosecutors from being tainted by exposure to congressional 
testimony cited during the trials 
counsel for all parties are advised that once the government 
is exposed to the immunized testimony during a trial of one 
defendant the court is presently aware of no decision that would 
foreclose the same prosecuting attorneys handling the first trial 
from full participation in subsequent trials the judge said 
but resolution of this issue must await further developments

business and consumer interests are moving to 
a new house battleground in their highstakes war over revamping 
the nations product liability laws with little likelihood that 
either side can claim victory in congress this year 
a complex politically explosive bill that would impose uniform 
federal liability standards for lawsuits over defective consumer 
goods cleared the house energy and commerce committee by a 3012 
vote tuesday 
it was the first time a product liability bill had ever been 
approved by a house committee but the measure is given little 
chance of passing congress until next year at the earliest 
the bill which is vigorously opposed by consumer groups is now 
headed for further scrutiny by the house judiciary committee which 
shares jurisdiction that panel traditionally has supported trial 
lawyers many of whom specialize in filing damage suits in their 
opposition to such legislation 
even if the measure eventually manages to win house floor 
passage it faces a daunting challenge in the senate a similar 
bill died on the senate floor in late 1986 after ernest b 
hollings dsc himself a former trial lawyer led a filibuster 
against the measure 
the bipartisan compromise approved tuesday would limit the legal 
grounds available to victims seeking damages from manufacturers of 
hazardous products the bill would preempt a wide variety of state 
liability laws that both sides say are much more favorable to 
plaintiffs in damage suits 
alexander b trowbridge president of the national manufacturers 
association said the bill would help curb the number of 
unwarranted lawsuits stimulate the economy and reduce consumer 
prices 
the nam executive said the measure would go a long way toward 
bringing americas lawsuit crisis under control 
consumer advocate ralph nader countered that the liability 
insurance crisis of the 1980s was created by the insurers 
own mismanagement and possible illegal anticonsumer tactics 
nader accused the energy and commerce committee of siding with 
toxic chemical producers dangerously defective product 
manufacturers and other promoters of corporate violence 
four consumer groups including the consumer federation of 
america charged that the bill would reduce manufacturers 
liability for producing and selling defective products and would 
restrict the legal rights of their victims 
the committees 25 democrats were almost evenly split over the 
measure which was unanimously backed by the panels 17 republicans 
rep james florio dnj a key figure in negotiations for a 
compromise said he voted against the bill because of what he 
called specialinterest amendments that tip the scales unfairly 
against the consumer 
the major feature opposed by consumer lobbyists was the state 
of the art defense available to manufacturers under the bill 
that defense states that manufacturers can escape liability if 
they can prove they did not know or could not have known of a 
design defect with knowledge reasonably available to experts 
or if there were no feasible alternative design 
under a proconsumer compromise crafted by rep mike synar 
dokla plaintiffs could overcome the stateoftheart defense if 
they prove that a product was so unsafe compared with its 
usefulness that it should not have been marketed 
critics say a federal standard allowing a stateoftheart 
defense currently available to manufacturers in only eight states 
would undermine the legal doctrine of strict liability used in 
47 states and favored by consumer interests 
that doctrine shifts the focus of a liability trial from the 
manufacturers alleged misconduct to the defective product itself 
relieving the courts of establishing what a manufacturer knew or 
should have known about a products defects

the 10000 american women who took part in 
americas longest war will be commemorated by an additional statue 
at the vietnam veterans memorial if the house goes along with the 
senate as expected 
the senate approved the new statue tuesday on a 961 vote 
sending the bill to the house a house subcommittee will hold a 
hearing on the bill next tuesday 
the memorial itself was built with 11 million in private 
donations and quickly became one of the capitals most popular 
monuments after it opened in 1982 it has attracted an estimated 30 
million visitors 
located on 22 acres near the lincoln memorial the vietnam 
memorials walls list the names of the more than 58000 americans 
including eight uniformed army nurses who died or are missing from 
the war 
but the black granite design was also the subject of 
controversy with critics saying a more traditional memorial should 
have been erected 
in 1984 two years after the memorial opened a large american 
flag and a statue of three infantrymen were added to a spot near 
one end of the memorials chevronshaped wall 
about the same time a push began to add a statue honoring women 
who served in vietnam 
the measure approved tuesday calls for a bronze statue of an 
army nurse 
sponsored by sen david durenberger rminn the bill had 75 
cosponsors and was endorsed by the interior department 
durenberger said the statue would be an appropriate and long 
overdue symbol of this nations gratitude for the sacrifices and 
contributions of the 10000 women who served in vietnam 
sen dale bumpers dark agreed calling the statue an 
altogether appropriate way to honor the women who took part in 
the vietnam war 
the lone opposition vote was cast by sen daniel evans rwash 
who also opposed the measure last month when it was approved by the 
energy and natural resources commission 
evans did not speak tuesday but he made clear last month that 
his opposition is based on a belief that another statue would 
destroy the artistic integrity of the vietnam memorial 
the commission of fine arts and the national capitol planning 
commission also opposed the female statute arguing that the 
vietnam memorial was already complete 
another opponent was maya lin the architect who designed the 
original memorial 
durenberger said he wants to halt the addition of more statutes 
to the vietnam monument the bill includes a provision noting that 
after the addition of the statue the vietnam veterans memorial 
will be complete and no other additions to the site will be 
authorized or undertaken

cattle pigs and chickens in the soviet union 
have a record amount of grain to eat but vodka makers are going to 
have to keep on skimping says an agriculture department analyst 
domestic use of grain for feed is estimated at a record 132 
million metric tons reflecting the continued soviet policy of 
boosting livestock production according to christian j foster 
of the departments economic research service 
the latest usda estimates show soviet total grain production 
this year at 215 million tons up from 2114 million tons in 1987 
and 2101 million tons in 1986 an unprecedented string of bumper 
harvests for the soviet union 
by far the largest use of grain in the soviet union as it is 
in the united states is for livestock feed 
the 132 million tons of grain expected to be used as feed in 
198889 compares with 47 million tons for human food 25 million 
tons for seed and only 5 million tons for industrial purposes 
which includes the manufacture of vodka also an estimated 25 
million tons will be lost to spoilage and other postharvest causes 
industrial use of soviet grain peaked at around 6 million tons 
in the late 1970s and again as recently as 1984 
foster said soviet industrial use of grain remains below the 
1984 peak because of decreased vodka production as part of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs antialcoholism campaign 
soviet production of vodka in 1987 declined for the third 
consecutive year down 16 percent from 1986 and 58 percent from 
1980 foster said in the june issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine both wheat and rye are used in making vodka barley is 
used in beer 
but foster added that as the soviet unions official state 
production of alcoholic beverages has dropped illegal distilleries 
have proliferated 
in 1987 more than 500000 people were fined or arrested for 
the illegal production of alcohol he said the number of fines 
and arrests is up 13 times from 1984 
foster added because of public tensions over the reduction in 
vodka for sale soviet authorities have decided to increase alcohol 
production mainly beer wine and brandy in 1988

the governments joint agricultural weather 
facility says dry conditions have forced wheat and some other grain 
crops to mature rapidly in most of the eastern half of the country 
moreover the lack of soil moisture hampered seed germination 
and growth of corn and other row crops during the week of june 
612 the facility said tuesday in its weekly report 
hot temperatures in the early part of the week depleted soil 
moisture and caused plants to begin wilting in some areas the 
report said 
overall winter wheat was 93 percent headed 5 percentage points 
ahead of the 5year average for this time of the season harvest 
which has begun in the delta and southeast areas was estimated to 
be 9 percent completed slightly ahead of normal 
the facility which is operated jointly by the agriculture and 
commerce departments reports on weather and general conditions of 
crops but makes no production estimates 
spring wheat was mostly fair to poor in the northern great 
plains the report said soybeans were 90 percent seeded 15 
points above the previous week and 10 percent above average 
dryness hampered germination and growth plants began wilting in 
some corn belt states 
corn planted for this years harvest was in mostly fair to 
good condition by june 12 but varied by areas depending on 
available moisture the report said

a sharply expanded acreage of us rice may 
lead the way for a general increase in world rice production this 
year according to an agriculture department report 
if indicated plantings are borne out and yields are in line with 
past trends us rice production could be around 157 million 
hundredweight this year up 23 percent from 1987 the departments 
economic research service said tuesday 
assuming a return to normal weather in asia foreign production 
could rise 7 percent in 198889 the agency said in that case 
global rice consumption would be expected to increase substantially 
following last years decline the first since 197172 
global trade probably will rise in 198889 as exportable 
supplies become more plentiful the report said while the 
united states stands to benefit from the growth in consumption and 
trade competition for world markets in 1989 may intensify

financial regulators from the reagan 
administration are finally hearing kind words for their goslow 
response to the october stock market crash after enduring two 
grueling sessions before critical lawmakers 
house agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas 
on tuesday praised the members of an administration working group 
on stock market reform for their political courage in 
recommending for the most part preservation of the status quo 
the regulators led by treasury undersecretary george d gould 
offer few dramatic changes in federal oversight of the nations 
stock futures and options markets and they reject calls from 
some members of congress for more unified regulation of the markets 
the group which includes the heads of the securities and 
exchange commission the federal reserve board and the commodity 
futures trading commission issued their report on may 16 in two 
hearings immediately following the release one in the house and 
one in the senate few in congress had anything good to say about 
it 
senate banking committee chairman william proxmire dwis who 
wants a committee headed by the fed chairman to coordinate 
intermarket issues denounced the panels findings as pitiful 
house finance subcommittee chairman edward markey dmass who 
would transfer jurisdiction over stock index futures from the cftc 
to the sec said the administration took a horse and buggy 
approach to regulatory reform 
markeys panel oversees the sec while proxmires committee has 
jurisdiction over both the fed and the sec 
however members of both the house and senate agriculture 
committees which oversee the cftc have staunchly defended that 
agencys autonomy when the cftcs jurisdiction was expanded in 
1982 to include stock index futures as well as traditional futures 
contracts for commodities like oil and pork bellies the 
agriculture committees jurisdictions were expanded as well 
de la garza characterized previous debate over market crash as 
an exercise in fingerpointing and turf battles and said 
we want to make sure neither we nor any other congressional 
committee is trying to fix something that isnt broken 
i commend the members of the working group for having the 
political courage to tell those who would legislate for 
legislations sake that such a course of action would be both 
unnecessary and unwise he said 
sec chairman david s ruder who has dissented from some of the 
administration groups stands came under sharp questioning from 
several committee members 
unlike the other regulators ruder would expand his own agencys 
authority to cover stock index futures he also would temporarily 
raise margins on futures contracts to dampen the wide price swings 
that have characterized the market in recent months 
rep glenn english dokla said cftc regulation of futures 
during the crash generated far fewer complaints than sec regulation 
of the options markets he told ruder maybe you ought to take a 
look at your own shop before seeking wider power 
ruder replied that english was comparing apples with 
oranges contracts are traded on only about 20 stock indexes 
while there are hundreds of options traded on individual stocks he 
said

progress on a senate welfare bill designed to 
alter radically the way the nation helps its poor stalled behind 
closed doors as the reagan administration sought to mold the 
measure to its liking 
senators and staff aides met with white house representatives 
throughout the day tuesday trying to avert a veto fight at the end 
of an arduous journey toward a welfare system oriented more toward 
work than income maintenance 
a compromise was on the table at the end of the day but there 
was no indication of whether the administration was going to go 
along 
its not very clear what will satisfy the administration and 
that makes it very difficult sen john chafee rri said at 
one point in the negotiations 
senators were prepared for a floor fight if the negotiations 
failed 
were either going to wind it up or go out there and start 
battling it out said republican leader bob dole of kansas 
the fiveyear 26 billion family security act would require 
states to set up broad new education training and employment 
programs they would have to enroll as many welfare parents as they 
could afford concentrating at least half their resources on those 
who are or are likely to be longterm recipients 
building on the theme of parental responsibility the bill also 
requires extensive state efforts to determine paternity and 
automatic wage withholding immediately upon the awarding of child 
support 
the administration was trying to win greater state latitude in 
experimenting with innovative welfare plans and a guarantee that a 
certain percentage of welfare recipients would participate in the 
new jobs and education program 
the bill written by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny is 
sponsored by 64 of the 100 senators and according to an aide at 
least two others support it 
before going to the white house the senate bill will have to be 
reconciled with a similar but much more expensive house bill passed 
last december it is unclear whether either the senate or the house 
could muster the twothirds majority needed to override a 
presidential veto 
moynihan said tuesday that the administration had dropped its 
opposition to a new requirement that states make welfare benefits 
available to poor twoparent families for at least six months in a 
year twentysix states already provide yearround coverage 
sen bob packwood rore said senators were discussing a 
mandatory 10 percent or 15 percent participation rate for welfare 
recipients in the jobs and education program rising eventually to 
25 percent the administration wanted to go higher than that he 
said 
the nations governors oppose mandatory participation rates 
because they say that would force them to focus on people who are 
easy to help and provide services that are less than comprehensive 
totally contrary to the bills purported focus on those apt to 
become longterm welfare clients 
moynihan said the governors had told him dont make us get 
into faking the statistics we want to get into the hard cases

congress seldom lets a year pass without 
writing a tax bill and this year apparently will be no different 
but budget restraints are likely to reduce the number of new tax 
breaks considerably 
however rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house 
ways and means committee says any tax bill that passes this year 
is sure to include special relief for farmers from the federal tax 
on diesel fuel 
despite a need to correct some mainly technical errors in the 
big 1986 tax overhaul there is no certainty that any tax measure 
will pass this year but rostenkowski said he feels better about 
the prospects after separate meetings tuesday with democrats and 
republicans on his committee 
im encouraged that they want to write a technicalcorrections 
bill rostenkowski told reporters we have a responsibility to 
write a technicalcorrections bill 
he said he expects the committee to start work on a bill next 
week under rules requiring because of budget constraints that any 
amendment offering tax relief to a specific group be paid for in 
the same legislation by raising taxes on someone else 
the only tax break that rostenkowski said is sure to be in the 
bill would relieve farmers from a requirement that they pay the 
federal tax on diesel fuel used for offtheroad purposes and then 
apply to the government at the end of the year for a rebate more 
than half the members of the house have signed a bill to wipe out 
that requirement 
the senate finance committee has voted to extend the repeal to 
state and local governments as well 
the technicalcorrections bill and whatever amendments the 
house and senate agreed to attach to it likely would be the only 
tax legislation that has a chance of passing congress this year 
the tight budget and an agreement between the white house and 
congress on reducing the deficit are apt to reduce sharply the 
number of amendments that are tacked onto the bill 
rostenkowski said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
finance committee is encouraged that he can hold a very 
welldisciplined bill together on the floor of the senate that 
is that he could protect it against serious amendment 
rostenkowski said there is considerable support on his committee 
for extending for one or two years some tax breaks that have 
expired or are scheduled to end later this year these include a 
tax exemption for revenue bonds that help firsttime homebuyers a 
credit for increased research and development and a tax credit 
that encourages employers to hire the poor 
any tax bill is likely to face amendment by lawmakers who want 
to reduce the tax on capital gains which are profits from the sale 
of stocks land and other assets 
this issue is complicated by the fact that advocates of a 
reduction including vice president george bush contend such a 
move would increase tax collections by encouraging investment 
opponents deny it 
another hot issue is a taxpayer bill of rights aimed at 
curbing alleged excesses of the internal revenue service the 
finance committee has approved a version but ways and means 
members have been cool to the idea 
efforts likely will be made to enact some kind of tax incentive 
to encourage parents to save for educating their children 
and there is considerable support for making permanent a 1987 
change that relieved mutual fund shareholders from a tax on 
phantom income a portion of operating expenses passed along to 
shareholders as income 
rostenkowski said he would be happy to settle for about 2 
billion worth of new tax relief in the package the same figure 
that reagan administration officials have mentioned but he 
acknowledged he and the administration probably would not agree on 
what the 2 billion would be spent for 
he said he and his staff will draw up a list of suggestions for 
raising the revenue needed to pay for any new tax relief that list 
almost certainly would include a new tax on singlepremium 
lifeinsurance policies under which generally upperincome 
investors buy large policies against which they may borrow taxfree

when howard henry baker jr moved into his job 
as white house chief of staff there was a tendency in the capital 
to think perhaps even yearn that he would become acting 
president 
irancontra had ronald reagan on the ropes his handsoff style 
discredited and a hostile congress eager to open a watergatestyle 
investigation of the scandal 
in addition the presidents extraordinary talent as a 
communicator was under challenge from a new soviet leader who 
appeared capable of stealing scenes from reagan 
washington insiders were looking for one of their own to take 
charge and rescue the administration if not the country 
and what could be more comforting in those troubled times than 
to have baker move into the white house after all the former 
tennessee senator was widely regarded as qualified to be president 
even though temperamentally illsuited to the rigors of winning the 
job 
just as bakers presidential ambitions never lived up to 
expectations his tour as chief of staff also was open to mixed 
reviews as he prepared to leave at the end of the month 
baker himself summed it up as he prepared to assume the post 
i am acutely aware of the fact that ronald reagan is the 
president and i am not 
and after the judicial confirmation disasters of robert h bork 
and douglas ginsburg and the protracted negotiations with 
panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega baker must now appreciate 
how right he was 
things continued going wrong and baker often found himself 
trying to explain why 
it often falls to top white house aides to explain why things 
went wrong the president gets to explain the things that went 
right like arms control agreements and moscow summits 
when baker accepted the white house post in the spring of 1987 
he gave up what was looking like another disastrous bid for the 
presidency an effort in which the candidate always seemed to be 
talking about how it was too early for serious campaigning too 
early for him while his rivals were spending every spare moment in 
iowa and new hampshire 
in 1980 baker was the senate republican leader and washington 
insiders considered him a strong contender for the gop presidential 
nomination to challenge democrat jimmy carter 
ronald reagan the former governor of california was surely too 
old and too conservative and who else was there george bush had 
become practically a resident of iowa but whod ever heard of the 
former twoterm congressman from texas 
baker was the favorite of party moderates the senator who had 
helped win ratification of the panama canal treaties 
it became clear that something was wrong when maine republicans 
held a straw poll at their state convention and baker was sure that 
his ally sen william cohen of maine would deliver a victory for 
him 
while baker depended on cohen bush worked on individual 
delegates and pulled off an upset that was the first signal that 
the baker bandwagon was never going to get rolling 
now many of the gop moderates who thought baker would make a 
fine president are touting him as an ideal running mate for george 
bush in the 1988 presidential election 
bush asked by reporters tuesday whether he would consider baker 
as a possible running mate responded no talk about a vice 
president its too early 
the odds that bush would turn to baker are long at best 
to begin with conservatives still remember bakers role in 
winning approval of the panama canal treaties they so fervently 
opposed and while bush doesnt need to bow to every conservative 
demand he doesnt want to alienate that wing of his party either 
geographically baker also is wrong his base is the south a 
region where bush also is strong 
but the biggest argument against baker is the job he has held 
the past 14 months 
one of bushs most obvious tasks as a presidential candidate is 
to show what he would do as president where he would take the 
country after nearly eight years of ronald reagan 
it is a difficult and often uncomfortable task for bush he 
prizes loyalty to the president and has only reluctantly expressed 
differences with administration policy 
that task would become that much more difficult if his running 
mate were out on the stump being asked if he agreed or disagreed 
with this or that policy during his tenure as reagans top white 
house aide

democrat michael dukakis denouncing president 
reagan for allowing coast guard cuts continued his tough talk on 
drugs while his campaign stepped up the search for a running mate 
the massachusetts governor visited the new bedford waterfront on 
tuesday and denounced reagan for allowing budget cuts that forced a 
55 percent reduction in coast guard patrols 
dukakis was continuing his focus on drug and crime matters 
today he had meetings set with new york law enforcement officials 
and with new state police recruits 
the governor also planned to meet with his anticrime council 
and announce the latest additions to the states violent fugitives 
list 
after a meeting with leaders of a local drug task force aboard 
the coast guard cutter vigilant on tuesday dukakis said the 
commander told him the vessel would be out of service for at least 
three months because of the cuts part of a budgetcutting 
compromise between reagan and congress 
if this ship is tied up here for the next three or four 
months thats not waging a war he said how can we talk about 
waging a war 
dukakis said if elected he would restore the coast guard 
funding 
of course congress shares the responsibility he said when 
asked about the compromise agreement but the leadership has to 
come from the white house 
he called coast guard patrols the nations first line of 
defense in the drug war 
we need them the nation needs them and this boat is going to 
be tied up here the next three months dukakis said that just 
doesnt make any sense 
dukakis was at the southeastern massachusetts port to salute 
about 100 police officers who completed a training program for 
streetlevel drug investigations 
meanwhile dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas remained 
in washington to continue the search for a running mate 
campaign and capitol hill aides said brountas would spend the 
next few days in washington consulting with party leaders and 
others including two senators often mentioned as potential running 
mates john glenn of ohio and bill bradley of new jersey 
brountas has said he will consult with dukakis after the 
meetings to trim the list of potentials and have background checks 
conducted on the remaining candidates 
dukakis will begin a threeday campaign swing through the south 
on thursday during that trip he expects to pick up the endorsement

vice president george bush laying a 
cornerstone of his plan to be the education president is 
proposing a 500 million recognition program with 100000 awards 
for schools that improve the performance of disdvantaged students 
he unveiled his national merit school idea tuesday at a 
luncheon honoring 139 high school seniors who are the 1988 
presidential scholars 
saying our schools are absolutely not as good as they must 
be bush said he would stress policies that reward excellence and 
better performance 
the likely republican nominee also called for awarding states 1 
million each for experimentation and innovation in areas such 
as merit pay for teachers and yearround schools 
our program for the future must be built around a strategy of 
investing in our children bush said 
the federal government pays only 7 percent of local public 
school costs and that isnt going to change said bush 
when it comes to better schools almost all of the wisdom and 
the good answers and the money to pay the bills should come from 
outside washington dc he said 
but then bush who has been accused by michael dukakis and 
others of offering little to back up his oftrepeated intention of 
being the education president took the wraps off his 
national merit school idea 
it would honor schools that significantly improve their 
performance on test scores dropout rates or other measures 
selected by each state and it would shower cash awards on the top 
20 percent of schools with a significant proportion of 
disadvantaged students the vice president said 
the awards would be based on school size and would average 
100000 for up to 5000 schools 
each winning school could use the money as it pleased for 
lab equipment library books or rewards for teachers and 
principals he said 
the vice president also called for expanding an existing 12 
million program to 50 million for financing experiments in 
education reform only by testing these concepts in practice will 
we be able to learn which reforms work and which do not he said 
he also backed a proposal by education secretary william bennett 
for giving 50 million to states for matching grants to create or 
support magnet schools that feature academic or vocational 
specialties 
bennett said in a statement the vice president has focused on 
the central issues of education reform accountability choice 
raising standards and rewarding success this is a good agenda for 
the education president 
bush urged the national education association the 19 
millionmember teacher union to support merit pay for the best 
teachers 
howard carroll an nea spokesman replied thats a lot of 
baloney that doesnt work 
of bushs merit school program carroll said the 500 million 
would set up another bureaucracy that money could better be 
spent on chapter one or other programs that desperately need it 
chapter one is the governments 4 billion program to help pay for 
remedial education for the poor 
bush said that school reform must put an emphasis on 
accountability changing what doesnt work and rewarding what 
does 
bush also reiterated his support for taxfree savings bonds to 
help finance college educations 
charles w greenleaf jr bushs domestic affairs adviser said 
the new proposals outlined on tuesday are by no means all of 
bushs educational plans additional ones will be detailed this 
summer he said 
greenleaf said that the total 600 million pricetag would have 
to be offset by savings in other areas under bushs flexible 
freeze proposal to hold overall federal spending to the rate of 
inflation but no decisions have been made on where those cuts 
would be made

the insurance industry is so protected by a 
federal antitrust exemption that a few executives are able to 
exercise immense control over rates and who should receive 
liability insurance the texas attorney general told a senate panel 
the leaders of the property and casualty insurance industry 
meet constantly to discuss their profits their losses and their 
objectives for the future jim mattox told the senate antitrust 
committee on tuesday 
they sit aroud the table in the board rooms of iso insurance 
services office and they do what no other industry can do by 
meeting together talking together planning together strategizing 
together and i might say conspiring together he said 
mattox and his counterparts in new york and massachusetts are 
urging congress to strip the insurance industry of its antitrust 
exemption 
robert abrams of new york presidentelect of the national 
association of attorneys general said congress should repeal the 
anomalous and anachronistic mccarranferguson act thereby 
requiring the insurance industry to operate within the same basic 
competitive framework which has served american business and 
consumers so well 
the mccarranferguson act passed in 1945 grants the antitrust 
exemption a number of states have filed suit alleging that dozens 
of insurance companies conspired under the exemption to create the 
liability insurance crisis of 198586 which made coverage 
unavailable or too costly for many governments and businesses 
mattox abrams and james a shannon of massachusetts also called 
for the replacement of the datagathering function of insurance 
services office iso the primary industry rate and trade advisory 
organization with the commerce departments bureau of economic 
analysis or another existing federal agency 
they also recommended the establishment of strong american 
reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance markets in an effort to 
halt the flow of money overseas where they said almost all the 
reinsurance companies are located 
reinsurance is insurance purchased by insurers to help pay 
claims that they in turn must pay similarly retrocessional 
coverage is insurance for reinsurers 
craig a berrington general counsel of the american insurance 
association which represents 183 propertycasualty companies said 
there is no need to repeal the mccarranferguson act because state 
insurance agencies have the tools to regulate the industry in their 
states 
he said the lawsuits raise important public policy questions 
about the role of state regulation of insurance the true causes of 
the liability crisis and the extent of competition in the insurance 
business

a jewish family again was refused permission to 
emigrate two weeks after president reagan canceled a meeting with 
them for fear of dooming their 11year campaign to leave 
tanya zieman whose 12yearold daughter had appealed to the 
president and mrs reagan for help in leaving the country said she 
received the news tuesday evening from the moscow city council 
she said the moscow soviet or council told her the familys 
appeal was turned down by a special review commission of the 
supreme soviet the nations nominal parliament and could reapply 
after 1992 
during the reagans summit trip to moscow two weeks ago us 
sources said the american first family agonized over whether to 
stop at the ziemans home after a top soviet foreign ministry 
official warned such a visit would ruin the familys chances to 
emigrate 
the ziemans younger daughter vera who calls herself a 
lifelong refusenik because her family applied to emigrate shortly 
after she was born had written the reagans asking for their help 
white house officials had been to the ziemans tiny threeroom 
apartment in southwest moscow to survey the home for a presidential 
visit the week before the reagans may 29 arrival in moscow 
soviet authorities getting wind of the plans sent a swarm of 
workers to repave the drive paint the apartment building repair 
the stoop scrub the corridor walls and landscape nearby flower 
beds 
a massive security force deployed around the building the day 
the reagans arrived in the capital drew a crowd of several hundred 
local residents 
but us and soviet sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said deputy foreign minister aleksandr bessmertnykh warned us 
ambassador jack f matlock and an accompanying white house official 
that if the reagans went through with the visit the ziemans would 
never leave the country 
in the end the reagans scrubbed the plan 
they didnt want to knuckle under to intimidation but they 
didnt want to hurt the ziemans either one source said 
the family headed by yuri zieman a former computer specialist 
did attend a tea the reagans gave for people the us 
administration considers victims of soviet human rights abuses 
yuri zieman who lost his job when he applied to emigrate in 
1977 worked as a plumber until he was stricken several months ago 
by a mysterious brain ailment that has left him with double vision 
and a loss of balance 
during his hospitalization for that condition he contracted 
hepatitis and his wife said tuesday he remained very weak 
zieman has been told he is not permitted to leave the country 
for security reasons although he contends he never had access to 
state secrets and has no information that could threaten soviet 
security 
he had been feeling much better the last two weeks thinking 
we would be getting some good news soon following the moscow 
summit mrs zieman said tuesday 
asked if the family would apply again for exit visas she said 
im still very much in a fighting mood

north dakota voters again refused to jump on the lottery 
bandwagon maine republicans rejected a 500000 bid by an ll 
bean heiress for a congressional nomination and virginians sent a 
democrat to washington in a special election 
with 77 percent of the north dakota vote counted from tuesdays 
election the lottery proposal was losing by 41505 votes or 59 
percent to 28391 votes or 41 percent 
that was an even wider margin than the 5545 percent it lost by 
in november 1986 when north dakotans became the first voters to 
reject a staterun lottery twentysix states and the district of 
columbia have lotteries 
it would seem to me a decisive expression of the will of the 
people and i would hope that the proponents would accept the 
decision said former gov arthur link who opposed the measure 
as a regressive tax on the poor 
link found allies in some of north dakotas charitable gaming 
operators who feared a lottery would cut into their business 
gorman king sr a businessman who backed a lottery said the 
initiative might be resubmitted in november with revenues dedicated 
to a specific program such as education or aid to the elderly 
king and other supporters said a lottery would raise 7 million a 
year for the economically depressed state 
north dakotans also had a meaningless lastinthenation 
presidential primary no democrats entered the race and on the gop 
side vice president george bush racked up 94 percent of the vote 
against retired teacher mary jane rachner 
in maines southern 1st congressional district linda 
beanjones the granddaughter of outdoors outfitter ll bean was 
edged by edward s omeara an aide to sen william cohen for the 
gop nomination omeara will face popular democratic rep joseph e 
brennan a former twoterm governor 
with 96 percent of the vote counted omeara had 15313 votes or 
52 percent and beanjones had 14102 votes or 48 percent 
recounts dont seem to pay off beanjones said im still 
going to be around were not going to disappear i feel i have a 
role to play in politics 
beanjones founder of a defunct conservative publication known 
as the maine paper spent about 550000 on her first political 
race 455000 out of her own pocket omeara spent between 60000 
and 65000 
in southside virginias 5th congressional district democrat 
lf payne jr developer of a ski and golf resort defeated former 
white house aide linda arey in a special election the incumbent 
conservative democrat wc dan daniel died of a heart attack 
in january while serving his 10th term 
the final count showed payne with 55406 votes or 59 percent to 
ms areys 38086 votes or 41 percent 
payne and ms arey are slated to run against each other again in 
november but ms arey could withdraw and ask the gop to choose 
another nominee 
south carolina also had a primary tuesday but only one 
incumbent congressman faced opposition in the 6th district

doctors at the national institutes of health 
are proposing a cancer research experiment that would for the first 
time involve putting genetically altered cells into humans 
according to a published report 
the washington post reported today that the proposal would call 
for doctors to remove human cells from the body genetically alter 
them by inserting a marker gene into a type of cancerfighting 
cell and return the altered cell to the body 
the newspaper said the procedure is designed to track 
cancerfighting cells and not as a treatment for cancer scientists 
hope the experiment could open the door for gene therapy as a 
possible route to finding cures for such illnesses as cystic 
fibrosis muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia 
it is not the sort of experiment that one would normally think 
of as gene therapy said dr william gartland who heads a nih 
gene research advisory committee 
the research team would be led by dr steven a rosenberg of the 
national cancer institute and dr w french anderson of the 
national heart lung and blood institute according to the 
newspaper 
the post said rosenberg has conducted a similar skin cancer 
experiment in his procedure pieces of a tumor along with white 
blood cells called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are removed the 
lymphocytes or til cells are already attacking the tumor when 
they are removed 
the til cell count is multiplied by 10 trillion over 30 days in 
the laboratory using a white blood cell growth hormone called 
interleukin2 the increased number of til cells and more 
interleukin2 are then injected into the body 
rosenbergs has not been able to determine why his treatment has 
worked with some patients and not with others because the only way 
he has been able to track the til cells is by using harmful 
radiation hence the development of the marker gene proposed in 
his joint project with anderson 
however the report said it could be a year before the 
genealtering experiment proposed by rosenberg and anderson gets 
under way 
the proposal faces review by a board of scientists and ethics 
experts at the cancer institute hearing before at least three 
other panels and nih director james b wyngaarden before final 
approval

george bush calls horseshoes the national 
sport and brags that he can beat michael dukakis in november just 
as handily as he won a horseshoe demonstration for italian 
journalists 
bush showed off his horseshoe prowess on tuesday as he awaited a 
visit from italian prime minister ciriaco de mita at his residence 
here on the grounds of the us naval observatory 
the vice president first served cold soft drinks to the group of 
us and italian reporters and photographers then offered to kill 
time until we here the sirens of de mitas motorcade by showing 
the italians some horseshoe technique 
do they play horseshoes in italy bush asked is it the 
national sport like it is here 
youre seeing it here history were getting closer to the 
poles the poles are coming the right way in horseshoes and in 
real life bush said as he lobbed horseshoes at a metal pole in a 
dirt pit alongside his home 
get on he shouted at his final horseshoe as it clanged up 
against the pole defeating abc television producer steve hirsh by 
a score of 32 
youve seen it here right at the vice presidents house you 
saw history in the making this is the forerunner of whats going 
to happen in the election in november l988 bush said hamming it 
up for the italian television cameras so tell the italian people 
you saw it hereyou saw it all 
despite bushs optimistic talk a gallup poll released tuesday 
suggested dukakis holds a doubledigit lead over bush 
the poll conducted by gallup for the boston globe and boston 
television stations weei and wcvb found 52 percent support for 
dukakis and 38 percent for bush the poll conducted june 1012 
among 1005 registered voters had a margin of sampling error of 
four percentage points 
i dont believe in polls at this time i really dont the 
vice president told reporters 
on another subject bush said dukakis was wrong wrong 
wrong twice in opposing the strategic defense initiative and the 
mx missile 
and asked whether he would consider howard h baker the white 
house chief of staff who retired tuesday as a possible running 
mate bush said no talk about a vice president its too early 
baker told cbs news on tuesday i dont expect to be asked i 
do not wish to be asked and im doing nothing to try to be asked

scientists built a machine that could make 
transplants more available by allowing donor organs to be shipped 
worldwide but it also may intensify debate over surgery costs and 
the fairness of organ distribution 
the machine has preserved sheep and pig hearts up to 24 hours 
and should be ready in three years to preserve human hearts 
livers kidneys and other tissues including limbs for 72 hours or 
more said coinventor ralph purdy a university of california 
irvine pharmacologist 
technology now in routine use by transplant centers preserves 
hearts for only four to five hours livers for 12 hours and kidneys 
for 48 hours limiting how far organs can be transported he said 
tuesday 
if the device works on human organs it would be a revolution 
in transplantation because there now are a significant 
proportion of donor hearts that are lost because they cannot be 
transported to recipients in time said arthur caplan director 
of the university of minnesota center for biomedical ethics 
however the machine could make it more difficult to allocate 
organs fairly because more people will be eligible here and 
overseas to get these organs he said from minneapolis 
caplan said that while about 3 billion is spent annually on 
us organ transplants the machine developed in irvine will 
force us to address a question we havent addressed headon 
which is how much do we want to spend on transplants 
weve been able to escape having to think how much to spend 
because theres now a limit on the number of organs available 
he added with a machine like this you could easily conceive of 
increasing the number of available organs by 50 percent or more 
because you can procure donors anywhere in the world 
the possibility of a global donor pool means ethical rules must 
be developed to prevent officials or residents of developing 
nations from exporting organs that were obtained unscrupulously 
said jim martindale coinventor of the machine 
the nightmare is that someone sells their brother sister or 
child to killers who commit murder to harvest the organs he 
added 
caplan predicted the machine will be used on human organs within 
three years because the us food and drug administration will be 
pressured to approve it because of its great lifesaving potential 
the university of california has applied for a patent on the 
device so the protoype machine which can fit on a hospital cart 
wasnt displayed during a news conference 
however the key portion is a clear plastic cylinder in which a 
donor organ is placed it is attached to a pump to push oxygenrich 
artificial blood through an organ or limb and to other devices 
that automatically maintain proper temperature pressure oxygen 
and nutrient levels and also carry off wastes 
purdy displayed a videotape showing a sheeps heart pumping in 
the cylinder at a rate of 10 times per minute partly by its own 
action but also aided by a separate pump existing preservation 
methods bathe the heart in nearfreezing solutions to halt pumping 
even though donor organs are removed from braindead accident 
victims many people may feel repulsed at the idea of shipping 
beating hearts because it may seem disrespectful to the body 
caplan said 
purdy said the ability to maintain organs for longer periods 
will allow medical research on organs that are unfit for transplant 
but suitable for testing new drugs or medical procedures 
caplan said that will raise ethical problems for doctors who 
will have to ask relatives of a dead person to donate their loved 
ones organs for use in research rather than for transplantation 
in february 1987 researchers from gulf south research institute 
in louisiana said they had developed the total organ perfusion 
system which also uses a pump and special fluid to preserve 
organs they said they had preserved pigs hearts for 24 hours but 
didnt think the degree of preservation was adequate 
last september surgeons at the university of wisconsin 
announced they were using a new mix of chemicals to preserve donor 
livers more than 24 hours

democratic national chairman paul g kirk says 
he believes the differences on issues between factions backing 
michael dukakis and jesse jackson will be resolved to ensure party 
unity 
his republican counterpart frank fahrenkopf puts it a little 
differently 
theyll cut a deal fahrenkopf said 
in a sometimes testy occasionally funny and mostly goodnatured 
debate tuesday night the two party chairmen squared off on a host 
of issues including the economy foreign policy their respective 
presidential candidates and jackson 
asked by an audience member what the party would do about 
jackson kirk responded that at the platform meeting this past 
weekend the backers of michael dukakis and jackson were together 
working in a civil and constructive way about issues about the 
future 
i think rev jackson has run a very positive campaign and i 
think hell make a constructive and positive impact on the fall 
results kirk added 
within the platform there may be some differences there may 
be some votes on the floor of the convention i dont think theyll 
be the kind of issues that will divide the party i think they can 
make some statements which are important as well 
fahrenkopf who wasnt specifically asked about jackson blurted 
out theyll cut a deal 
the republican chairman also criticized kirk for what he 
described as the democratic failure to come up with a party 
platform detailing where they stand on major issues 
you say were for peace and were for everyone having a job 
and for good education and you wont level with the american 
people and tell the american people in a platform how youre going 
to arrive at it fahrenkopf said youre afraid to put that on 
the table 
democrats met this past weekend in michigan where they agreed 
that their platform must brand south africa a terrorist state but 
sidestepped the question of the federal budget deficit and whether 
to call for higher taxes on the rich 
at the debate kirk criticized the reagan administrations 
economic and foreign policies 
the united states of america went from the largest creditor 
nation in the world to the largest debtor nation in the world in 
five years under the republican party kirk said 
the democratic chairman noting the irancontra scandal said 
the nation has seen a foreign policy in disarray operating on 
deceit diversion and deniability 
kirk and fahrenkopf referred to the issues that the two 
presidential contenders dukakis and republican george bush are 
expected to focus on in the months leading up to the general 
election 
fahrenkopf pointed to a strong economy with high unemployment 
and a lower trade deficit he also noted the better relationship 
between the united states and soviet union 
kirk noted the administrations failure to balance the budget 
and cited dukakis success in achieving that goal in massachusetts

in a major policy shift president 
daniel ortega has lifted wage and price controls and instituted 
massive austerity measures in an attempt to salvage the 
warbattered economy 
speaking on nationwide television tuesday night he called the 
crisis deep and serious and said the economy can survive only 
through the adoption of a series of measures similar to those 
taken by capitalist countries 
ortegas leftist sandinista regime had been tightening controls 
over the economy since it seized power in a 1979 revolution 
virtually all prices have been fixed by the government and 
employers have been barred from raising salaries without government 
permission 
from now on ortega said employers and workers will agree on 
wages independently and prices will be regulated only by market 
conditions 
he said the government occasionally will announce nominal 
guidelines on prices of some basic products to keep them from going 
up too quickly it will also remove a host of subsidies with the 
exception of public transportation and cooking oil soap rice and 
sugar all of which are in short supply 
to reduce an estimated annual inflation rate of 4000 to 5000 
percent ortega said the government will restrict credit and 
closely regulate interest rates to reduce the money supply and 
force businessmen to reinvest profits 
to reduce the foreign balance of payments deficit ortega 
announced 30 percent cuts acrosstheboard in defense imports 
imports for farm and ranch production and diplomatic expenditures 
abroad 
nicaragua has a foreign debt of more than 6 billion soviet 
bloc infusions of about 400 million a year fail to cover the 
countrys trade deficit exports this year are expected to total 
270 million while imports excluding soviet bloc weapons are 
totaling 700 million 
the amount of soviet bloc weapons imported annually has not been 
made public but ortega has said the 6year war with usbacked 
contra rebels has cost the country 3 billion in property damage 
and lost production 
for the past five years more than half the national budget has 
been devoted to defense spending from 1980 to the end of 1987 
inflation caused the average urban workers purchasing power to 
drop almost 90 percent 
ortega made the announcement tuesday at a meeting of 1200 
sandinista labor leaders managers of stateowned enterprises and 
other government officials he said that even though the sandinista 
revolution is socialistoriented we cannot think of abolishing 
private property 
he called nicaraguas present economy a free market one in a 
revolutionary state that is socialistoriented 
ortega blamed the battered economy on the war and an economic 
blockade imposed by the united states shortly after the sandinistas 
began establishing close economic and military ties with the soviet 
union and its allies 
meanwhile the sandinistas are continuing to push for more 
negotiations to achieve a lasting peace 
a ceasefire initially in force for 60 days beginning april 1 
and later tacitly extended by both sides appeared to be holding 
because of the war thousands of people have fled fertile lands 
for the cities and many young peasants who normally would work on 
farms were forced to fight for either the contras or the 
sandinistas 
in april the government began laying off 20000 public 
employees in hopes they would turn to agriculture

fundamentalists tightened their grip 
on the southern baptist convention by electing another conservative 
president who said he hopes to mend the division in the nations 
largest protestant denomination 
the rev jerry vines who narrowly defeated a moderate tuesday 
said the denomination has turned rightward because of strong 
grassroots feelings on the part of our people 
vines also told a news conference he hoped we can move in the 
direction of healing the bitter conflict between conservative and 
moderate southern baptists 
meanwhile a moderate group the southern baptist alliance said 
vines election left them disenfranchised 
diversity is rejected and dishonored said a statement from 
the group headed by the rev john thompson of jackson miss 
fundamentalist authoritarian hierarchical and rightwing 
political ideology now prevailed it said 
vines defeated the rev richard jackson by 15804 to 15112 but 
similarly close votes in the past have not deterred extension of 
the fundamentalist platform 
vines 50 is copastor of the first baptist church of 
jacksonville fla while jackson 49 is pastor of the north 
phoenix baptist church in phoenix ariz each church has about 
18000 members 
vines victory represents the 10th straight year fundamentalists 
have gained the powerful presidency completing a timetable set by 
their strategist in 1979 for solidifying their control over the 
denomination the president serves a oneyear term but it is 
traditionally renewed a second year 
the outcome also signaled indefinite continuation of a 
rightwing theological and political agenda that has accompanied 
the fundamentalist dominance 
because of the size and nationwide influence of the 
147millionmember denomination the direction set here was seen 
as having an impact in broader evangelical circles 
asked why southern baptist positions on social and political 
issues have come to match those of the religious right vines cited 
grassroots feelings and said members reflect the general 
mood the conservative directions of this time 
jackson wryly discounted that explanation saying the grass 
roots are often quoted but you dont hear them talking much 
i feel there is manipulation he said it would have been 
unthinkable 20 years ago that a small group could get together and 
work out plans for taking control of the denomination 
the key architects of that plan judge paul pressler of houston 
and the rev paige patterson of dallas determined that by 
successively winning the presidency conservatives could gradually 
pack ruling boards of denominational agencies and seminaries 
through the appointive power of the office 
the fundamentalist victories have been achieved under the banner 
of biblical inerrancy that the bible is without error 
scientically historically and religiously 
but they have been accompanied by conservative positions on 
political and social issues such as unsuccessfully supporting 
judge robert bork for the us supreme court and favoring capital 
punishment prayer in public schools and aid to private schools 
vines said he hoped the denomination would not lose members over 
the conflict i want to include not exclude he said 
asked if he would seek only likeminded people as trustees of 
church institutions and agencies he said they must be within 
approved parameters that is biblical inerrantists 
several seminary and other church staff members have been 
pressured from their jobs by new screening processes instituted by 
the fundamentalists among the questions asked church employees is 
whether they believe adam and eve were real people and that 
biblical miracles actually occurred 
vines said the political ramifications of the fundamentalist 
upsurge were spinoffs from the theological concerns 
jackson said the split obviously isnt over theology but 
over different styles of leadership since he accepts the bibles 
infallibilty but he respects those holding other views 
i believe well stay together may god deliver us he said 
i dont want anybody to panic

the government will no longer grant asylum to 
all vietnamese in an effort to stem the growing influx of boat 
people a hong kong official said today 
effective thursday the government will screen all vietnamese 
boat people entering the british colonys waters to determine if 
they are political refugees or economic migrants said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
boat people who left their homeland for economic reasons will be 
housed in a prisonlike camp on an outlying island of hong kong 
pending an agreement with vietnam on repatriation the official 
said 
chief secretary sir david ford planned to announce the change of 
policy today before the legislative council hong kongs lawmaking 
body 
hong kong long has assumed all arriving boat people are refugees 
eligible for temporary asylum they are housed in refugee camps 
pending resettlement in a third country such as the united states 
or canada 
but local officials say many left vietnam for economic reasons 
not to escape political persecution and finding resettlement homes 
for them has become increasingly difficult 
about 7800 boat people have braved the treacherous trip from 
vietnam to hong kong this year through tuesday or 12 times the 
number who arrived during the corresponding period last year 
government statistics show the number of boat people has soared to 
about 16200 
only 1200 boat people left hong kong camps for resettlement 
this year through tuesday up slightly from the corresponding 
period last year 
the boat people already in the colony will not be affected by 
the new policy the government official said 
other noncommunist southeast asian governments recently have 
changed their policy toward accepting vietnamese boat people 
thailand earlier this year pushed back to sea vietnamese boats 
attempting to land and several deaths were reported bangkok backed 
off after sharp international criticism and reopened its doors but 
insisted the new arrivals would not be eligible for resettlement 
malaysia announced in april it would begin turning away boat 
people at some unspecified future date

after debate that pitted orthodox against more 
liberal jews parliament narrowly defeated legislation that would 
hve restricted the definition of a jew and thus limited who could 
immigrate to israel 
jewish communities abroad particularly in the united states 
had a special interest in the measures because of israels unique 
law of return which guarantees automatic citizenship to all jews 
who qualify under israeli law 
the two proposals would have recognized as jewish only those 
converts who were brought into the faith by orthodox rabbis not 
those converted by reform or conservative rabbis 
one proposal would have amended the law of return and the other 
would have put the orthodox rabbinate in israel in charge of 
determining who is a jew 
prime minister yitzhak shamir told american jews he would not 
support the socalled whos a jew amendments but voted for 
them in the knesset and enforced party discipline on others of his 
rightwing likud bloc to follow suit still the two proposals 
failed by votes of 6053 and 6051 
during intense debate rabbi meir kahane an americanborn 
member of parliament know for his antiarab views was ejected from 
the chamber 
the 120member knesset also rejected a bill providing pardons 
for jews now jailed for terrorist acts against arabs including 
murder 
avraham verdiger who proposed the whos a jew legislation said 
it would maintain the purity of the jewish people preserve the 
uniqueness of jews and help stop jews in other countries from 
assimilating into the general population 
in the united states especially members of judiasms 
conservative and reform movements greatly outnumber the orthodox 
who oppose intermarriage 
despite shamirs promises to defeat the proposals his 
rightwing likud bloc bound its members to vote for them because of 
pledges to the small ultraorthodox shas party which has supported 
likud on other issues 
small religious parties have a total of only 13 seats in the 
knesset but hold a disproportionate amount of power because they 
are potential coalition partners for the major political groups 
likud and the centerleft labor party led by foreign minister 
shimon peres

smaller is better in the case of what 
researchers are calling the worlds fastest and most powerful 
supercomputer 
the machine dedicated tuesday at the von neumann national 
supercomputer center near princeton will be about 170000 times 
faster than the best home computers yet small enough so that its 
main components could slide inside a briefcase 
by the middle of next year after four more processors are 
added it will be able to handle more than 10 billion calculations 
a second a capacity greater than any other computer said carl s 
ledbetter president of eta systems inc the computers 
minnesotabased manufacturer 
researchers are expected to use the eta10 computer to advance 
scientific discovery in fields like aerospace engineering weather 
forecasting and pharmaceuticals 
by expanding the computational power of our facilities in raw 
speed and scope we intend to inspire researchers to tackle a new 
genre of complex problems only supercomputers can efficiently 
solve said doyle d knight a rutgers university engineering 
professor and president of the consortium that manages the center 
ledbetter said the computer is the product of several 
technological advances 
it has smaller denser computer chips than its predecessor and 
uses copper tracings instead of miles of conventional wire 
this reduces the space electrons have to travel enabling faster 
calculations ledbetter said 
in another advancement the circuits are dipped in supercool 
liquid nitrogen enabling the electrons to move at an even faster 
pace 
this generates less heat than other semiconductor technology 
allowing the computers designers to make eta10 even smaller 
because when things are cooler you can put them closer 
together ledbetter said 
one of the ironies of these supercomputers is that they are 
very small ledbetter said 
the brain of the eta10 which will cost 25 million to 30 
million will be eight processors each 16by22by25 inches the 
first four processors were delivered to the von neumann center in 
march and have been operating for several weeks 
the fourprocessor computer can now handle 34 billion 
arithmetic calculations per second making it one of the worlds 
fastest supercomputers ledbetter said 
according to researchers the supercomputer will enable them to 
attack problems too complex for earlier generations of 
supercomputers to handle in any reasonable length of time one 
reason is that the new computer will be able to handle many more 
variables at the same time ledbetter said 
at a news conference tuesday researchers demonstrated a 
detailed threedimensional model of a protein molecule that took 
the eta10 two hours to create it would have taken an average home 
computer more than a year to do the task one researcher said 
some of the things that can be done include very sophisticated 
weathermodeling programs they can do three and four and 
sevenday forecasts much more accurately than had ever been done 
before ledbetter said 
the center one of five national supercomputer centers is 
managed by the consortium for scientific computing inc consisting 
of the university of arizona the university of pennsylvania the 
university of colorado the university of rochester the 
massachusetts institute of technology the institute for advanced 
study and brown columbia harvard princeton penn state new york 
and rutgers universities 
researchers from those schools will be able to use the 
supercomputer from their campuses 
the center was established in 1985 with a commitment of 692 
million in funding from the national science foundation and 121 
million from the new jersey commission on science and technology

attorney general edwin meese iii has ruled 
that a member of the irish republican army convicted of murder 
should be deported to the united kingdom overturning a decision by 
the board of immigration appeals 
meese said tuesday that deporting joseph patrick thomas doherty 
to ireland instead would be against us interests 
doherty was convicted in the united kingdom in 1981 of murder in 
the ambush of a british army convoy in which a captain was killed 
doherty escaped from a prison in belfast northern ireland 
before sentencing came to the united states in 1982 and has been 
held in the metropolitan correctional center in new york city since 
1983 on charges he illegally entered the country using a false 
passport 
michael armacost undersecretary of state for political affairs 
wrote the attorney general that a decision to deport doherty to 
ireland could undermine great britains confidence in the ability 
of the united states to cooperate in counterterrorism efforts

two former presidential candidates in opposing 
parties and usually at opposite ends of the political spectrum are 
urging israel to deal directly with palestinians in seeking a 
middle east peace 
barry goldwater and george mcgovern joined in saying israel 
should recognize the national legitimacy of arab palestinians 
and turn over territory to them in exchange for peace 
mcgovern the losing democratic standard bearer in 1972 and 
goldwater the losing republican in 1964 signed a statement 
endorsing the peace proposal along with former european government 
heads garrett fitzgerald of ireland anker jorgensen of denmark and 
bruno kreisky of austria 
their proposal differs from the plan unsuccessfully pursued by 
secretary of state george p shultz and strongly implies but does 
not specifically recommend creation of a palestinian state

the government is not doing enough to protect 
the public from allterrain vehicles according to a pair of 
senators who have introduced legislation to require the consumer 
product safety to ban the sale of threewheeled models 
sens alfonse damato rny and albert gore jr dtenn 
proposed the legislation which would also require the cpsc to 
establish a procedure for owners to obtain refunds 
the commission has not done an adequate job in protecting the 
consumer from the inherent risks and dangers associated with 
atvs damato said at a press conference on tuesday it is time 
for congress to force their hand in this matter 
gore said atvs have been linked to nearly 1000 deaths and more 
than 350000 injuries requiring medical treatment since 1982 
of the 25 million atvs now in use about twothirds are 
threewheeled models

the consumer product safety commission says 
500000 black amp decker weed trimmers that could pose an 
electrocution hazard remain in consumer hands despite an earlier 
recall 
the safety agency issued a new warning tuesday because of fewer 
trimmers were returned under the recall than expected 
involved are black amp decker model 82209 and model 82210 
bumpfeed string trimmers used on grass and weeds 
because of an error in wiring the electrical wires in some of 
the trimmers could be cut by the handle tube causing a potential 
for electrical shock the agency said owners should stop using the 
trimmers immediately and take them to a black amp decker service 
center for repair or replacement 
people needing more information can contact black amp decker at

the burning of woodlands apparently the latest 
tactic of the palestinian uprising has spurred an outcry among 
israeli jews whose founding fathers prided themselves on making the 
deserts bloom 
israelis gathered in emergency meetings across the country 
tuesday to develop ways to fight the fires in the nations scarce 
forests 
in one of three meetings on the fire threat police and army 
officers security agents and members of the jewish national fund 
agreed to set up three regional centers to coordinate information 
on fires 
in the galilee village of kfar tabor israeli arab and jewish 
village leaders agreed to create volunteer civil guards to carry 
out patrols 
but they dismissed a proposal for joint patrols saying that the 
current tensions between jews and arabs could make such patrols 
counterproductive 
since may 28700 acres of woodland and pasture have been 
destroyed by fire said lenny labensohn a spokesman for the jewish 
national fund which is responsible for afforestation and land 
reclamation in israel 
labensohns figure is six times the average acreage normally 
lost to fire in a year 
labensohn and police officials say a significant number of 
the fires have been set by palestinians who oppose israels 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
ten palestinians have been arrested on suspicion of setting 
fires prime minister yitzhak shamir has called for mandatory 
15year sentences for anyone convicted of arson and his suggestion 
has been taken up by others 
it is not possible to know for sure how many fires are the 
work of arsonists labensohn said but when we see trees 
burning that we planted with our own sweat and blood its very 
hard to take it just causes more damage to jewisharab relations 
early jewish pioneers to israel often acting with funds 
contributed from the united states and other countries worked to 
fill swamplands and plant trees on marginal land 
they dubbed the border between israel and the west bank in 1948 
the green line in part to emphasize the extent to which the 
land had been cultivated 
jews living outside israel planted trees in memory of deceased 
relatives or holocaust victims american donations have planted 20 
million trees in israeli national parks more than 10 percent of 
the countrys trees 
the israeli army has sometimes uprooted trees and olive groves 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip from which palestinians 
were suspected of throwing firebombs or stones at israelis 
on june 10 israeli troops broke up a treeplanting ceremony by 
leftwing israelis in the west bank village of beita scene of the 
april 6 clash between the villagers and teenage israeli hikers in 
which a jewish girl was killed 
the israelis were planting trees to protest the armys uprooting 
of orchards and demolition of 14 arab houses as punishment for the 
clash

gross of the pentagon to fail to tell the family that moscow had 
apologized 
the soviet unions highestranking military official apologized 
last month during the moscow summit for the shooting death of maj 
arthur d nicholson jr the pentagon announced tuesday 
nicholsons parents said it was the first they had heard about 
the apology nicholsons mother jean nicholson said she was 
pleased to hear an apology had been made but weve had no word 
from the government at all 
i never thought this would happen she said of the apology 
nicholsons father arthur sr said he called his sons widow 
in washington and she said she hadnt heard of the apology 
im somewhat distressed that nobody made any effort to notify 
us he said i think this is very gross 
nicholson said he did not want to comment on the apology itself 
until he heard its contents 
the apology was extended by soviet defense minister dmitri yazov 
to defense secretary frank c carlucci at a private meeting may 31 
said dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman 
yazov offered no new details or explanation for the march 24 
1985 shooting nor did he respond to previous us demands for 
financial compensation to nicholsons family howard said 
nonetheless we feel we have received the appropriate apology 
from the soviets the spokesman said 
in addition howard said the two sides agreed to come up with 
a list of recent such incidents violations whatever and to meet 
again to try to work out a set of ground rules 
howard quoted yazov as saying i express my regret over the 
incident and am sorry this occurred this does not promote improved 
relations secretary carlucci and i have agreed we will do all we 
can to prevent these kinds of incidents in the future 
howard disclosed the apology during a regular pentagon briefing 
he said he did not disclose it at the summit because no reporters 
asked about the matter 
nicholson 37 was a member of the us military liaison 
mission allowed under a 1947 treaty to keep tabs on soviet 
military activities inside east germany 
nicholson and a driver sgt jessie g schatz were trying to 
observe a soviet tank shed during a surveillance mission according 
to the us account nicholson was close to but not in a 
restricted area when a soviet sentry suddenly opened fire without 
warning 
the pentagon has charged that schatz was prevented from going to 
the wounded man with his first aid kit and that the major was left 
to die without medical attention 
the soviets have said nicholson was improperly wearing a 
camouflaged uniform had strayed into a restricted area and ignored 
shouted warnings before the sentry opened fire

a meeting between japanese antinuclear 
activists and officials of a high school whose symbol is a nuclear 
mushroom broke up when the principal angrily declared that the 
united states wasnt to blame for world war ii then left 
tuesdays meeting was called to discuss japanese objections to 
the richland high school symbol which celebrates the areas role 
in the production of us nuclear arms including plutonium in the 
bomb that destroyed nagasaki in world war ii 
we are not going to change our symbol because we believe it 
has something to do with the heritage of our community principal 
john nash told a delegation of 35 japanese who visited this town 
adjacent to the giant hanford nuclear reservation 
i heard some things here that made me angry nash said we 
can go back to history and recall a lot of things about the war and 
i could say some things here that would be very disruptive to you 
people but im not about to do this nash said 
but im going to say one thing and you should remember this 
we did not start that war and i think that should end it 
nash then walked out of the classroom to the loud applause of 
some residents in the southcentral washington city leaving the 
visitors to talk with faculty students and reporters 
it was not our intention to protest said masa takubo of 
washington dc who served as interpreter we wanted to present 
our views and we wanted to understand his views 
unfortunately he had to leave in anger takubo said 
i was embarrassed at my exprincipal said marcia cilian a 
richland high graduate he interpreted it the wrong way they 
were not asking us to change it just look at it another way 
hours later about 100 people who largely supported the japanese 
visitors attended an evening with them at the richland public 
library 
however mary baird of richland defended the dropping of 
atomic bombs on japan at the end of the war saying they prevented 
even greater slaughter of americans and japanese 
its unfortunate that a nuclear war occurred but i will not 
accept the blame for my country she said noting that the 
japanese launched hostilities in the pacific 
the japanese visitors have been in this country since may when 
they attended a united nations special session on disarmament in 
new york since then they have been touring us nuclear 
facilities 
hanford was created by the manhattan project in world war ii to 
make plutonium for nuclear weapons the jobs of up to 30000 
richland residents are tied to the nuclear weapons industry and 
criticism of their role in that work is a sore point with many 
locals 
earlier this year an attempt by some teachers and residents to 
eliminate the mushroom cloud symbol of the richland high school 
bombers was overwhelmingly defeated in a student election when 
students voted instead to officially adopt the cloud as their 
symbol 
the widespread media attention given that election attracted the 
japanese delegation 
tuesdays meeting began quietly with nash escorting the 
visitors into a classroom and welcoming them 
but the meeting turned sour when sakae ito a 77yearold 
survivor of the atomic attack on hiroshima made a lengthy speech 
about military symbolism and asked nash to change the school symbol 
to something more peaceful like cranes or rainbows 
the mushroom cloud reminds us of the tragedy of hiroshima and 
nagasaki she said through the interpreter i feel sorry and 
sad people here support the mushroom cloud 
nash replied that many athletic teams in the united states used 
aggressive symbols and noted that students voted to make the cloud 
their official emblem 
im not going to change it he said before walking out

people on their way to developing the most 
serious form of diabetes may be identifiable far in advance of the 
disease and the illness may then be prevented a study suggests 
scientists found that an abnormal blood protein appears up to 
seven years before a person develops the kind of diabetes that 
requires daily insulin shots 
the protein was detectable in all 12 study subjects who 
developed insulindependent diabetes from three months to seven 
years later it also appeared in 18 of 20 newly diagnosed diabetics 
but not in any of 18 nondiabetics of similar ages researchers 
said 
while other blood proteins have shown some ability to predict 
who will get insulindependent diabetes none has shown such 
promise for accuracy said mark atkinson clinical research fellow 
in pathology at the university of florida college of medicine in 
gainesville 
the protein may play a central role in causing the disease and 
strategies against it may be able to prevent insulindependent 
diabetes from developing he said in an interview before presenting 
the study tuesday at the american diabetes associations annual 
scientific sessions in new orleans 
george eisenbarth of the joslin diabetes center in boston who 
was familiar with the research said it was important because it 
confirms earlier indications that blood tests based on the protein 
can be used to help predict diabetes 
he also said there are other candidates for the role in causing 
the disease that atkinson suggests for the protein 
about 1 million americans are thought to have insulindependent 
diabetes they need insulin shots because their bodies do not 
produce insulin 
insulin is secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas the cells 
are destroyed by insulindependent diabetes the disease is thought 
to arise from a misguided attack on those cells by the bodys 
diseasefighting immune system 
nobody knows what triggers the attack but atkinson suggests it 
is carried out by the protein in his study 
the protein is an antibody a substance created by blood cells 
of the immune system to attack specific targets such as 
diseasecausing microbes the antibody in atkinsons study reacts 
with a protein found on the surface of the beta cells but not in 
other tissues examined atkinson said 
that fact and its early appearance are evidence that the 
socalled 64k antibody carries out the attack reponsible for 
insulindependent diabetes atkinson said 
if that is true then sabotaging its production early in the 
process may keep the disease from developing he said 
scientists may be able to create samples of the protein it 
attacks and link it to a poison he said if that combination is 
injected into a person with the antibody in his blood it might 
encounter and kill the blood cells reponsible for directing the 
immune system attack he said 
scientists hope to test that soon in mice atkinson said 
before such a strategy could be used for humans researchers 
must devise a simpler blood test than they have now to look for the 
antibody he said 
besides atkinson scientists in the study included noel 
maclaren lynn holmes and william riley at the florida school and 
and david scharp at the washington university school of medicine in 
st louis

the defeated drugaddled mary tyrone has always 
been the unhappy heart of long days journey into night eugene 
oneills harrowing tale of a family trying to come to terms with 
its tortured past 
that aspect of the play never has been made clearer than in the 
compelling revival of oneills masterpiece which opened tuesday at 
broadways neil simon theater as part of the first new york 
international festival of the arts 
the production directed by jose quintero stars a subdued but 
effective jason robards as james tyrone and a haunting colleen 
dewhurst as his doomed wife mary while robards is fine as the 
parsimonious old matinee idol it is dewhurst who holds the play 
together and mesmerizes the audience 
in his introduction to long days journey into night 
oneill calls the autobiographical drama a play of old sorrow 
dewhurst personifies that sadness you can see it the moment she 
walks on stage the womans face is masked in a tight smile as she 
tries to get through what would appear to be just another hot day 
at the tyrone summer cottage in new london conn 
the outward normality of events is shattered by the 
unintentional but inevitable return by father mother and two sons 
to events long past the death of marys son eugene her addiction 
to morphine and the neglect of her youngest child edmund plunge the 
family into a day and nightlong battle of recriminations and 
halting painful explanations 
dewhursts performance is never showy it exudes a patrician 
reserve a sense of correctness that hints at marys proper 
upbringing in a strict catholic household this propriety makes her 
final breakdown all the more poignant she turns into a lady trying 
to hold on to her last bit of dignity as the real world slips away 
robards has tamed the blarney that sometimes obscures tyrones 
soul he exhibits little of the hamminess that jack lemmon brought 
to the part in the revival new york saw two years ago 
he takes his time getting into character bringing tyrone slowly 
into focus the portrait crystallizes in the plays final act 
during the fathers long rambling explanation of his 
povertystricken youth when he learned to be a miser it is a 
beautiful quiet moment one of the most moving in quinteros 
production 
the revival is at its heartbreaking best during these 
revelations of the past in them oneill doesnt exonerate his 
characters but instead offers the audience some explanation for 
their actions as flawed human beings 
the understanding also comes through in this productions 
portrayals of the two sons a ruddyfaced jamey sheridan captures 
the frustration of the cynical older son drawn like his father to 
drink and bitter about the certainty that his life will not amount 
to much campbell scott is equally impressive as the sickly edmund 
torn between love and rage for his parents 
jane macfie delivers an effective cameo as the irish maid 
cathleen she resists the temptation to turn the woman into the 
usual cartoon stereotype 
the evocative living room designed by ben edwards resembles the 
real oneill summer home with a panoramic view of long island sound 
that darkens as the day turns into a long night 
what makes long days journey into night special is the 
completeness of its characters real people who are painted with 
unflinching honesty quintero has made sure that completeness comes 
through on stage and with the assistance of an exceptional group of 
actors particularly dewhurst turned the evening into a memorable 
journey 
in other reviews 
clive barnes of the new york post called the production 
oneill as oneill should be here is american classic 
theater at its greatest and dealing with an indisputable american 
classic 
in the daily news howard kissel wrote strikingly mounted 
the play moves naturally and effortlessly a work that can seem 
labored and elephantine here soars and dips like a lark wounded 
but unable to stop singing 
frank rich of the new york times called the production 
rewarding if imperfect but the evening is never less than 
essential theatergoing 
he adds one cannot assume that there will be another chance 
to watch these three great theater artists quintero robards and 
dewhurst explore the writer who has been their consuming passion 
for virtually their entire professional careers

an arabamerican expelled from israel amid 
charges of sedition reiterated his intention to convert to judaism 
to gain reentry to his homeland but liberal rabbis said political 
motivations are not enough reason for conversion 
mubarak awad who advocates nonviolent palestinian resistance 
to the israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip said 
tuesday he would convert from christianity to judaism and seek 
reentry under israels law of the return if everything else 
failed 
awad is a us citizen who was born in jerusalem where he has a 
home he was deported monday by israel which accused him of 
playing a key role in the palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories 
i am here but not by choice he said at a news conference 
arranged by the national council of churches i was deported just 
because i am a christian if i were a jew i would not be 
deported 
under the law of the return jews may claim israeli citizenship 
but the privilege is not absolute gangster meyer lansky for 
example sought israeli citizenship in 1970 but was forced to leave 
two years later after allegations of his continued involvement in 
organized crime 
pressed on the subject of conversion which he mentioned during 
his deportation battle awad said ill tell a rabbi frankly 
its not my belief that spurred the request its a political 
statement that im persecuted because im a christian 
leaders of reform judaism on tuesday issued a letter to 1500 
rabbis of the movement in the united states and canada urging them 
not to accommodate awad should he seek conversion 
no one can rule out the possibility of a sincere conversion in 
anybodys case but this must be proved at the end of a long period 
of instruction said the letter surely we need not remind you 
that extraneous motivations political motivations are not 
sufficient reason 
awad said he would first pursue other avenues including an 
appeal to international public opinion he said he planned meetings 
with officials at the united nations and in washington europe and 
the soviet union 
he defended his support of the palestine liberation 
organization but said he did not back all the organizations 
actions i condemn violence from the plo from israelis from 
everybody he said 
awad said he advocated the cutting of electrical wires to 
prevent israeli settlements from being established in arab areas 
but not in cases where settlements already existed he also said he 
opposed stone throwing setting forest fires and other violent 
tactics some palestinians have used 
some tactics he has long advocated such as tax boycotts and 
commercial strikes were adopted by leaders of the uprising in the 
territories israel captured in the 1967 middle east war 
awad the 21st arab expelled by israel since the uprising began 
dec 8 was deported on the ground that his threemonth tourist 
visa issued when he entered israel in august had expired the 
israelis refused to extend the visa and the israeli supreme court 
last week rejected awads appeal to remain 
awad lived in the united states for 13 years before returning to 
jerusalem in 1983 and still owns a home in wapakoneta ohio he is 
the founder of the palestinian center for the study of nonviolence 
in jerusalem his wife nancy nye an american said she soon will 
return to jerusalem to resume her job as principal of a quaker 
school

scientists have corrected malfunctioning liver 
cells from a rabbit by implanting a human gene a first step toward 
possible cure of a disease that can give children heart attacks 
the gene made the cells manufacture more protein structures 
called receptors that absorb cholesterol from the bloodstream 
in humans a deficiency in the receptor supply leads to familial 
hypercholesterolemia an inherited disease that causes heart 
attacks by leaving too much cholesterol in the bloodstream 
the milder form of the disease affects about one in 500 people 
and can be treated with diet and medication 
but one in a million people are born without the ability to make 
any receptors and they often suffer heart attacks in early 
childhood some have been treated successfully with transplants of 
the liver which contains most of the bodys receptors 
the new testtube work is reported in the proceedings of the 
national academy of sciences by james wilson and richard mulligan 
of the whitehead institute for biomedical research and the biology 
department at the massachusetts institute of technology and david 
johnston and douglas jefferson of the tuftsnew england medical 
center in boston 
they worked with liver cells from rabbits that showed a 
deficiency in receptors for lowdensity cholesterol called ldl a 
virus was used to carry the human gene that oversees production of 
ldl receptors into the rabbit cells 
one group of cells that took up the gene later showed four to 
five times the normal number of receptors that overabundance may 
help reduce the number of liver cells that would have to be 
transplanted back into a human patient after treatment in the 
laboratory researchers said 
the next research step will be to make the altered cells work 
stably when placed in rabbits researchers said 
but before such an approach could provide longterm cure in 
humans for this or other inherited liver diseases scientists must 
find better ways to transplant liver cells they said in the long 
run finding ways to plant the receptor gene directly into the 
liver of a patient may work better they said

the nations first law designed to 
protect workers from eyestrain and other complaints associated with 
longterm use of computer terminals could serve as a model for 
other measures proponents say 
theres no doubt that this will greatly encourage many labor 
groups to put this on the top of their legislative agendas said 
louis slesin editor of vdt news a new yorkbased industry 
newsletter that estimates 15 million workers use computers 
nationwide 
the law was enacted tuesday by a 135 vote of the 18member 
suffolk county legislature one vote more than was needed to 
override county executive patrick halpins veto halpin had 
predicted the measure would turn business away 
opposition to this bill was based on overreaction said 
legislator gregory blass weve heard the doom and gloom from 
business in the past when bottledeposit and antismoking bills 
were enacted 
im ecstatic said jan pierce vice president of 
communications workers of america which supported the measure 
the legislature stood up to big business and held its ground 
aflcio officials said they would work to enact similar 
legislation in erie albany and rockland counties where they said 
government leaders have been sympathetic to workerprotection laws 
statewide legislation is pending in at least six states 
including new york and connecticut 
under the law in six months businesses in the long island 
county with more than 20 visual display terminals will have to 
provide special treatment for workers who spend more than 26 hours 
a week in front of the computer screens 
the workers must have 15minute breaks or a new work assignment 
after three hours with a video display terminal 
the employer must pay 80 percent of the cost of annual eye exams 
and any eyeglasses that are needed 
in addition any equipment purchased after next year must have 
such features as nonglare screens adjustable desks and 
fivelegged chairs 
the bill was written in response to worker complaints of 
eyestrain muscle aches and other ill effects from longterm vdt 
use 
however halpin predicted after the vote that the law will 
cost suffolk many good high tech jobs he vowed to try to 
implement the law so it will have minimal impact on the business 
community 
james larocca president of the long island association a 
business group predicted the loss of more than 3000 jobs in 
pending expansion and relocation deals 
were definitely not expanding into suffolk said thomas j 
calabrese general manager of long island customer service for new 
york telephone which employs 2000 terminal operators in the 
county

dozens of cars and other vehicles that joined the cortege honked 
their horns as marchers some holding red balloons rhythmically 
blew whistles close to the hearse a woman recited the rosary 
through a loudspeaker mounted on a jeep but another loudspeaker 
blaring a nationalist song drowned her out 
the marchers shouted slogans describing president cory aquino as 
stupid and corrupt mrs aquino citing security reasons has 
refused to allow marcos to return to the country to attend the 
funeral of his mother who died may 4 at the age of 95 
marcos has lived in honolulu since he fled the country during 
the february 1986 civilianmilitary revolt that ended his 20year 
rule and swept mrs aquino to power mrs aquino is on a sixday

the mother of an air force officer killed in 
vietnam 22 years ago said she would remove the mia bracelet with 
her sons name but wear one with the name of another missing 
serviceman now that his remains are home 
the family of lt col vincent chiarello tearfully accepted his 
remains at philadelphia international airport on tuesday and vowed 
to continue to work for other families with relatives missing in 
vietnam 
anne chiarello the officers mother broke down during a 
service performed by an honor guard later during a news 
conference she said she will take off the mia bracelet engraved 
with her sons name that she has worn since 1978 
i will be happy to wear one for another mia until he comes 
home she said 
i will stay in the national league until the very end mrs 
chiarello said referring to the organization working for 
information about all americans missing in vietnam 
the 22year nightmare is over said joseph chiarello 
brother of the air force intelligence officer 
chiarellos plane was shot down near the laotian border over 
north vietnam on july 29 1966 according to his sister joanne 
cornell 
about four months ago the air force told the family the 
vietnamese government was returning the remains of 20 american 
soldiers including chiarellos 
however on march 3 the remains of only 17 soldiers were 
returned along with identification cards for chiarello and two 
others 
tom engkilterra a coordinator with the national league said at 
the time the remains returned to the united states only four or 
five soldiers had been identified 
identification of chiarello finally came through an exhaustive 
study of the remains and comparisons with dental military and 
family records 
the findings were so definite said mrs cornell we felt 
we must accept this we feel beyond a shadow of a doubt these are 
my brothers remains 
chiarellos relatives said they will try to help other families 
with missing loved ones 
we beseech the vietnamese government to act expeditiously 
on behalf of all these families joseph chiarello said 
engkilterra said there were 2400 stories out there that need 
to be told so this doesnt become a oneday event 
when the family learned that vincents remains were to be 
returned they received a tremendous amount of loving concern and 
support from relatives and friends including vincents friends 
from college mrs cornell said 
the outpouring has been so warm and wonderful she said 
about the time the family learned the remains would be returned

random house is considering withdrawing the new 
edition of james joyces novel ulysses because of criticism 
from scholars who say the corrected edition is more seriously 
flawed than its predecessors 
were going to leave it to a group of experts to advise 
us said jason epstein editorial director of random house but 
im inclined to think that the edition were publishing now is 
seriously flawed 
no single comprehensive manuscript of ulysses exists the 
novel first published in paris in 1922 was written during a 
sevenyear period in longhand that is often illegible joyce then 
added 100000 words to the page proofs 
to further complicate matters the book was typeset by hand by 
french printers who did not speak english 
a team of german scholars produced the new edition two years 
ago saying it corrected about 5000 omissions transpositions and 
other errors in previous editions 
at the time scholars and critics hailed the new edition as a 
landmark of textual scholarship and it replaced earlier editions in 
classrooms and most of the nations bookstores 
john kidd of the university of virginia is leading the 
criticism of the new version known as the gabler edition after its 
principal editor hans walter gabler of the university of munich 
among kidds complaints are assertions that the edition is the 
18th edition rather than the 11th that the version is not a 
purified text of joyces conceptions that the researchers relied 
on facsimiles of manuscripts making it impossible to separate 
joyces work from that of his assistants and printers and that 
some of the changes made are patently unjoycean thus 
endangering the fabric of one of the most acclaimed novels in the 
english language 
kidd makes his arguments in the scandal of ulysses an 
article appearing in the june 30 issue of the new york review of 
books 
gabler disputed or denied all of kidds charges although he 
said he had not seen the article 
he said that while the charges sound damaging he has heard 
them before and that they usually dissolve into thin air

a retired indian navy officer was arrested 
trying to smuggle classified papers onto a new yorkbound flight 
police said today 
the indian express newspaper said the papers involved indias 
topsecret efforts to produce a nuclearpowered submarine a 
project reportedly shelved when india leased a nuclearpowered 
submarine from the soviet union 
bombay police commissioner vk saras declined to give any 
details of the documents but said the exofficer was arrested may 
30 at bombays sahar international airport 
the indian express identified the officer as retired capt bk 
subba rao bombay police sources confirmed his surname is subba 
rao but said they were unsure of his rank and first name 
subba rao appeared in a bombay court tuesday and was remanded to 
police custody for 14 days under the official secrets act the 
police sources said 
under the indian judicial system suspects can be held without 
charge pending the completion of investigations 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity declined to 
give any details of the proceedings the interim hearing was not 
open to the public and court windows were sealed while subba rao 
was in the room 
none of the sources gave any indication of the intended 
recipients of the documents 
a us embassy official in new delhi speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it would be inappropriate for us to comment 
he would not elaborate 
the indian express a nationally circulated englishlanguage 
daily said subba rao had been closely associated with the 
submarine project from its start in the 1970s 
he later became involved in a dispute with the bhabha atomic 
research center over the project which was shelved when india 
acquired a nuclearpowered submarine from the soviet union earlier 
this year the newspaper said 
failing to persuade the indian government to go ahead with plans 
to make its own nuclearpowered submarine subba rao then sought to 
sell the plans to a foreign country the indian express said 
in 1985 four indian men including two retired air force 
officers were convicted of spying for the united states 
they were sentenced to 10 years at hard labor after being found 
guilty of conspiring with us officials and giving them classified 
information about soviet military equipment including mig fighter 
planes and t72 tanks

the apparently successful testfiring 
of a version of morton thiokols redesigned solid fuel booster 
leaves only one final test before space shuttle flights can resume 
officials say 
the 122second test tuesday at the rocket manufacturers remote 
plant west of here was the fourth of five required to qualify the 
redesigned booster before the shuttle program halted after the 
1986 challenger disaster can resume 
brilliant yellow flame erupted from the 126footlong rocket 
the ground trembled and grayishbrown smoke billowed thousands of 
feet into the air amid a roar that could be heard for miles 
its an extremely good test said royce mitchell solid 
rocket program manager for the national aeronautics and space 
administration its a good feeling to have everything looking so 
well at this time 
jr thompson director of the marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala said the apparent success of the test bodes well 
for an august launch of the shuttle discovery 
the motor was virtually identical to those that will help power 
the discovery and other shuttles thiokol spokesman rocky raab 
said unlike the three previous testfirings the rocket did not 
contain any intentional flaws designed to determine whether its 
joints can withstand the intense heat and pressures of launch even 
in the event of some failures 
the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 was blamed on a 
booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through 
an oring triggering the blast that killed the seven crew members 
thiokol plans to conduct the final fullscale test in late july 
with severe flaws introduced in the joints to test the system to 
its limits 
wed rather take the risks in the hills of utah rather than on 
the launch pad thompson said 
tuesdays test was the first conducted on a new 22 million test 
stand which uses hydraulic struts to duplicate steering flight 
turbulence and other stresses the motor will endure during launch 
raab said 
allen mcdonald thiokols vice president of engineering said 
preliminary data indicated that the motor successfully withstood 
the simulated liftoff and flight stresses which were worstcase 
sideloads similar to those experienced in past shuttle flights 
he said engineers will spend two days studying computer readouts 
of the test and disassembling the motor and officials expect to 
have a complete analysis within two weeks 
the new test stand also can heat an entire motor to 110 degrees 
fahrenheit or cool it to 20 degrees the rockets 11 million 
pounds of propellant were heated to a uniform 90 degrees or about 
20 degrees warmer than the usual launch temperature to allow 
engineers to test its performance at the upper limit for an actual 
launch raab said 
in late december a rocket motor and its propellant will be 
cooled to about 40 degrees for another test to analyze its 
performance at the other end of the spectrum he said 
the rockets three joints also are equipped with heaters to 
maintain a minimum temperature of 75 degrees freezing temperatures 
the night before the doomed challenger launch were found to have 
contributed to the joint failure 
officials said the testing has gone so well that discoverys two 
boosters were hooked up friday with an external fuel tank at cape 
canaveral fla and the boosters and tank were to be joined with 
the shuttle thursday

attempts to control a recent shortage of useable buses cta 
authorities said tuesday 
the insects have been discovered on as many as 40 buses coming 
from a major cta garage and repair center on the south side 
forcing the agency to send the vehicles back in for insecticide 
sprays officials said 
gloria chevere the agencys administrative chief offered one 
explanation for the hitchhiking cockroaches there was a lot of 
garbage that accumulated that we didnt have dumpsters for 
richard winston the agencys senior manager of bus 
maintainence said recent hot weather also may have been a factor 
he said there also was a possibility that the standard 
insecticide no longer works as well as it used to 
weve started a program of having our technical services 
people review the effectiveness of this material as well as other 
commercial products winston said 
a lack of replacement parts and delays in structural overhauls 
are the main reason for the bus shortage officials said 
on tuesday 61 bus runs were canceled and 64 other buses ran 
late because of a shortage of usable vehicles

a close friend of attorney general edwin meese 
iii warned wedtech officials not to boast about the companys 
washington connections according to a letter read at rep mario 
biaggis racketeering trial 
the less said about our clout the better said the june 
1 1985 memo from e robert wallach it was produced tuesday by 
defense attorney dominic amorosa who then crossexamined 
exwedtech president anthony guariglia about its significance 
the clout hes talking about included misters meese nofziger 
and bragg didnt it asked amorosa referring to exwhite house 
adviser lyn nofziger and nofzigers consulting partner mark bragg 
yes guariglia replied the memo also made mention of the 
special treatment wedtech a defense contractor had received 
from government agencies guariglia said 
earlier guariglia had testified that in its efforts to 
guarantee lucrative government contracts wedtech had attempted to 
lobby national security adviser robert mcfarlane through wallach 
the assertions were later denied by mcfarlanes attorney 
the person in question is not robert mcfarlane at no time 
directly or indirectly was mr mcfarlane contacted by the wedtech 
company or any of its representatives on wedtechs behalf said 
mcfarlane attorney peter morgan 
amorosa representing biaggis son and codefendant richard 
introduced the memo and several other letters from wallach during a 
contentious crossexamination of guariglia 
wallach is under indictment on federal racketeering charges that 
say he took payoffs from wedtech officials to influence meese and 
other public officials 
guariglia and other company officials have testified they paid 
800000 to wallach to influence the attorney general they have 
said wallach told them he got the attorney general to intercede on 
the companys behalf for a series of contracts worth 143 million 
to build pontoons floating portable docks 
amorosa trying to link wedtechs contracts to the efforts of 
wallach rather than the defendants quizzed guariglia about their 
relationship focusing on an illegal 150000 payoff for his 
lobbying that was funneled through a third party 
he knew you were a crook and you knew he was a crook 
right the lawyer asked 
guariglia paused before answering in a loud voice yes 
the witness is the last of four exwedtech officials who have 
pleaded guilty to corruption charges to testify at the trial in 
exchange for leniency guariglia 37 has said he faces up to 10 
years in prison despite his plea in the case involving the 
nowbankrupt company 
during the crossexamination amorosa and assistant us 
attorney mary t shannon squared off several times in the 
sweltering courtroom with the prosecutor at one point attributing 
her anger to the heat 
biaggi his son and the others wedtech founder john mariotta 
exbronx borough president stanley simon attorney bernard ehrlich

the leaders of greece and turkey 
failed to resolve conflicts over cyprus and the aegean sea but 
they agreed to meet again to discuss these and other longstanding 
disputes 
premier turgut ozal planned to return to turkey today after two 
days of private talks with greek premier andreas papandreou at a 
heavily guarded seaside hotel 
they planned to resume their dialogue in the turkish capital of 
ankara later this year officials said no date was set for the 
meeting but turkish officials said it probably will be held in 
october 
todays climate was positive filled with goodwill all 
these types of meetings are a step forward said greek spokesman 
yiannis roubatis turkish foreign minister mesut yilmaz said 
its useful to continue the dialogue 
but a 20 million greekturkish banking agreement due to be 
signed on tuesday was delayed at the last minute apparently 
because of greek reluctance to be seen making any concessions 
the agreement for a joint venture between greeces stateowned 
ionian bank and turkeys housing bank would have been the first 
substantive product of improved greekturkish relations 
papandreou and ozal launched the negotiations at a meeting in 
january at the swiss ski resort of davos 
ten months earlier greece and turkey had come close to war over 
oildrilling rights in the aegean seabed 
they also have longstanding disputes over aegean airspace the 
military status of some greek islands and greekowned property in 
the turkish city of istanbul 
ozal said he didnt intend to pull any of the 30000 turkish 
troops out of the northern sector of the divided mediterranean 
island of cyprus he also stuck to his demand for a twozone 
federated state on cyprus 
papandreou wants the turkish troops out of cyprus before peace 
talks begin he also links a cyprus settlement with lifting a greek 
veto on turkeys application to join the european economic 
community 
cyprus has been divided into northern turkish cypriot and 
southern greek cypriot sectors since turkish troops invaded in 1974 
after an athensled coup aimed at uniting the island with greece 
ozal took a more conciliatory approach to the issue of 
greekowned assets in istanbul he cited a new turkish government 
decree that enables greek citizens to make investments in turkey 
using funds raised from selling their istanbul property 
many greeks who formerly lived in istanbul want to sell their 
assets but they were discouraged by a turkish ruling that such 
funds must remain in blocked bank accounts 
more than 200000 istanbul greeks left the city when 
greekturkish relations deteriorated in the 1950s and 1960s

jurys recommendation 
the jury took 90 minutes to decide that john earl mcgrew a boy

the maximum in each case will run concurrently 
mcgrew who was convicted monday following a threeweek trial 
said he will appeal 
i am innocent of this crime and i will be moving to the next 
step to prove my innocence mcgrew said at a news conference 
after the sentencing 
defense attorney john weddle had asked jurors to place mcgrew on 
probation citing his numerous awards for work with the boy scouts 
and his selection as his elementary schools 1986 teacher of the 
year 
mcgrew claims he was the victim of a conspiracy but would not 
elaborate 
prosecutor faith johnson said johnson was a typical fixated 
pedophile and he doesnt want to admit hes guilty 
mcgrew who taught at john j rhoads elementary school in south 
dallas was arrested in december after an 11yearold former pupil

tennis ball machines would be relegated 
to the status of lawn mowers and bulldozers under a noise ordinance 
tentatively approved in this posh community that once tried to ban 
men from running topless 
the ordinance approved tuesday by the town council would limit 
use of the electric servers to the same weekday hours set aside for 
heavy construction 9 am to 530 pm between dec 1 and april 3 
and 8 am to 6 pm the remainder of the year unlike heavy 
machinery however the council would allow tennis ball machines to 
be used on weekends 
the ball machines were lumped into a category of equipment 
that may be obnoxious during certain hours said town attorney 
john randolph 
town officials had considered banning new ball machines from the 
island where the ordinance prohibiting men from topless jogging 
was struck down in march by an appeals court the community also 
was lampooned by garry trudeau in his doonesbury comic strip 
for a law requiring workers to carry identification cards that law 
was declared unconstitutional so the council in march made it 
voluntary for employers to require workers to have the cards 
some proponents of the tennis ball machine ordinance also wanted 
to prohibit their use on weekends 
the proposed regulations would be enforced only if there are 
complaints from neighbors town officials said the maximum fine 
for a noise violation is 250 a day 
one resident who attended the council meeting questioned why 
ball machines were singled out and cited driveway basketball games 
as a greater disturbance to the peace 
this goes into the delicate area of private recreational 
uses adrian winterfield said i suggest it is unnecessary to 
include a prohibition against one activity because if the noise is 
excessive it can be regulated on that basis 
the council will make its final decision on the ordinance next 
month

the lead attorney in a landmark cigarette 
liability suit said his partial victory leaves tobacco companies 
open to racketeering charges but industry lawyers gleaned another 
message if you puff you pay 
those were two of the reactions tuesday as the verdict in the 
case of antonio cipollone who on monday won the first judgment 
against a tobacco company in 30 years continued to reverberate 
throughout the industry 
tobacco companies went on the offensive holding a news 
conference to attack the fairness of the judge in the 4month 
case meanwhile stock prices dipped even though analysts played 
down longterm effects of the verdict 
in a separate decision tuesday a federal appeals court rejected 
a couples 107 million claim against rj reynolds tobacco co 
ruling that warning labels on cigarette packages are sufficient to 
inform people about the dangers of smoking 
mondays landmark verdict found that liggett group inc failed 
to warn the public about smokings dangers before labels were 
required in 1966 and granted damages for violating a promise or 
express warranty in advertisements that cigarettes were safe 
plaintiffs who were awarded 400000 were able to claim at 
least a partial victory for the first time in 30 years of cigarette 
liability lawsuits 
however the us district court jury in newark cleared liggett 
and two other cigarettemakers lorillard inc and philip morris 
inc of conspiring to mislead the public about the risks of 
smoking 
no punitive damages were awarded in the case brought by 
cipollone and his wife rose who was 58 when she died of lung 
cancer in 1984 after smoking cigarettes made by the three companies 
for 40 years 
the jury mostly blamed mrs cipollone for contracting her 
disease 
even so marc z edell the lead attorney for cipollone said 
tuesday the case suggested how to improve the chances of winning a 
judgment on a broader more damaging conspiracy charge charging 
the companies with a civil claim under the racketeerinfluenced 
corrupt organization statute 
the federal statute says a company can be found liable if it is 
found to be an enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering 
activity 
a jury that focused more on a pattern of acts would lessen the 
plaintiffs burden to show the smokers own behavior contributed to 
the disease edell told a news conference 
in a separate news conference in new york tobacco company 
lawyers said they regarded the verdict as fundamentally a victory 
because it reinforced the industrys defense that mrs cipollone 
made a decision to smoke knowing the risks 
the jury returned a resounding message that individuals who 
make informed choices have responsibility for those choices said 
philip morris general counsel murray bring 
tobacco company lawyers also attacked the fairness of judge h 
lee sarokin and released a detailed rebuttal of previously secret 
industry documents introduced by antismoking forces during the 
trial 
it is clear from any person looking at his rulings that they 
were preferential and unwarranted and against the rules of 
procedure stevens said of the judge we could not have had a 
more extreme adversary 
sarokins law clerk said the judge would not comment because the 
case was still pending before him 
edell said the companies claimed victory for public relations 
reasons to encourage industry investors and discourage other 
lawyers from pursuing such cases 
liggett attorneys have promised an appeal of the damages award 
tobacco stocks dropped tuesday with liggett group falling 50 
cents a share to 762 
philip morris cos inc the nations biggest tobacco company 
fell 175 to 8325 and loews corp parent of lorillard slipped 
25 cents to 6512 
rjr nabisco inc dropped 1 to 47 and american brands inc rose 
25 cents to 4512 rjr nabisco and american brands were not party 
to the suit 
but analysts expected a recovery after an initial slump 
we think its a victory for the industry said kurt a 
feuerman of drexel burnham lambert inc its a shot in the arm 
for antitobacco forces but its largely symbolic

anchorman dan rather and other cbs news 
personalities showed up to bolster executives spirits at a 
sometimes angry affiliates meeting as word came that the no 3 
network plans to revamp its eye logo 
the convention for the networks 206 affiliates which ended 
tuesday featured some harsh closeddoor attacks on the string of 
scheduling failures that mired cbs in third place this past season 
behind no 1 nbc and no 2 abc 
it was the first lastplace finish among the big three networks 
in cbs history 
this has not been a polite conference said howard stringer 
president of cbs news 
meanwhile cbs said it would unveil a new state of the art 
version of its trademark cbs eye logo along with new theme 
music to identify the network according to a story published in 
todays editions of the washington post 
the post quoted the network in a statement issued at the 
affiliates meeting as saying the new contemporary cbs logo 
is designed to appeal to younger viewers while still pleasing 
current viewers 
the network said the new logo and music could premiere by july 
4 but that no definite date has been set according to the post 
amid complaints from worried station chiefs of a lack of focus 
cbs also said at the meeting it will launch a campaign to promote 
rather and its news correspondents and begin using cable to sell 
itself in promotional spots 
cbs president laurence tisch and cbs broadcast group president 
gene jankowski said during the conference that poor promotion has 
hurt cbs 
we didnt do a good job tisch said of previous promotional 
efforts 
rather who was greeted with extended applause introduced 
several of the networks bestknown journalists 
i bring you warm welcomes from the men and women of cbs 
news rather told the affiliates im proud to be here with all 
of you and im proud of all of you 
others at the conference tuesday were harry k smith kathleen 
sullivan leslie stahl ed bradley diane sawyer and meredith 
vieira they all took a turn onstage as their various news programs 
were presented along with plans to improve them 
stringer introduced the journalists by noting that rather and 
the cbs evening news won the ac nielsen co ratings war last 
week snapping a sixweek run by abc world news tonight 
anchored by peter jennings 
the enthusiastic reaction to rather contrasted with some 
sentiments expressed at earlier meetings when station chiefs 
complained about rathers combative interview with vice president 
george bush in january and his angry departure from the set of the 
cbs evening news in august 
meanwhile the news promos unveiled showed such things as rather 
in the field covering a flood on the front line in vietnam in 
moscow india cuba and elsewhere 
before dan rather went to the front desk he went to the front 
line the ad announcer said 
the promos were scheduled to begin airing today

presbyterians paused to clap and pray after 
adopting a statement on christian obedience in a nuclear age 
then called early today to restudy the churchs prochoice abortion 
stance before ending a marathon meeting 
tuesdays session at the 200th general assembly of the 
presbyterian church usa began with the election of a top 
church officer and ended shortly before 2 am after the assembly 
voted 250244 to initiate a new study on abortion 
antiabortion groups in the 3millionmember church have sought 
a new study since 1985 when the denomination adopted a statement 
condemning abortion as a method of birth control but concluding 
that the decision remains a private one between a woman her 
physician and her conscience 
the assembly was to adjourn today after discussing 
denominational finances and the location of the headquarters of the 
denominations pension board 
the commissioners overwhelmingly accepted the christian 
obedience report prompting spontaneous applause in the cervantes 
convention center where the delegates called commissioners have 
been meeting since june 7 
the report was the result of a process begun in 1983 when 
congregations asked how to respond to those who refuse to pay taxes 
over disagreement with government action 
the paper responded that their decision should be recognized as 
proper under certain circumstances and they they should be 
given emotional support by the church 
committee revisions of the paper changed language to make it 
clear it is normally the case that christians obey civil 
authority 
a request was left in however that church agencies set up a 
fund for obedience to higher authority for the assistance of 
those who suffer financial loss or difficulty as result of acts of 
conscience 
the paper says nuclear war is immoral and that nuclear 
deterrence as an adequate permanent means to national security 
is not morally defensible 
language added by a committee at the assembly states that 
military service is a legitimate function of civil government 
and many presbyterians have decided that obedience to god leads 
them to participate in the military 
remaining on todays agenda was a recommendation to consolidate 
the denominations pension fund in philadelphia headquarters of 
the pension board in the united presbyterian church usa the 
larger of two denominations that merged in 1983 to end a 121year 
division 
commissioners will consider a minority report that recommends 
the pension board move to atlanta site of the headquarters of the 
presbyterian church us the smaller southern church in the 
union 
earlier tuesday the rev james e andrews was reelected to a 
second fouryear term as stated clerk or the denominations chief 
constitutional office by a 323298 vote he defeated harriet 
nelson 54 a lay leader from napa calif 
andrews 59 had to be nominated from the floor after a 
nominating committee rejected his nomination to the 62000ayear 
post 
andrews told commissioners he had been sent a message by the 
narrow margin to heal the divisions in the denomination stemming 
from the merger 
conservatives within the denomination have blamed declining 
membership on what they perceive to be increasingly liberal stances 
by the church under andrews 
in nominating mrs nelson the rev j randolph taylor called 
andrews a reminder of our divided past and said the church 
needs a sense of newness 
andrews who was stated clerk of the presbyterian church us 
from 1973 to 1983 promised to be very active in bringing in 
various viewpoints various factions together in a denomination 
thats growing up 
the stated clerk represents the church in ecumenical bodies 
oversees the annual assembly and heads a staff of 65 with a budget 
of about 7 million 
in other action the assembly recommended a higher federal 
minimum wage and called for a national dialogue on the status of 
americans indians it also considered suggested actions on health 
costs and religious freedom 
the assembly adopted a lengthy paper on pornography that 
concludes its fundamental cause is sexism the recommendations 
reiterate the churchs call for the enactment of the equal rights 
amendment and direct church officials to develop a public policy 
statement on pornography

drugrelated aids cases are 
increasingly linked to cocaine rather than heroin and crack users 
who trade sex for drugs may be spreading the epidemic further a 
researcher said today 
drugrelated aids also is spreading to parts of the developing 
world where illicit drug shipments originate said don des jarlais 
of the new york state division of substance abuse services in new 
york city he spoke at the fourth international conference on aids 
the reason for the growing link between aids and cocaine 
injection may be partly due to the frequency with which cocaine 
users inject themselves des jarlais said 
heroin users may inject themselves three or four times per day 
des jarlais said but cocaine users may inject themselves as often 
as every 15 minutes until their cocaine supply is exhausted he 
said 
that can lead to almost continuous sharing of drug injection 
equipment and a much greater likelihood of viral transmission he 
said 
the aids virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers it is most 
often transmitted through sexual contact 
various reports at the aids conference have identified the 
sharing of needles by drug abusers as one of the most rapidly 
growing components of the aids epidemic 
the disease also can be spread in transfusions of tainted blood 
or blood products and from mother to child at or before birth 
crack users do not inject the drug but the trading of sex for 
drugs could be further spreading aids infection among the 
drugabusing population des jarlais said 
the spread of aids among cocaine abusers which des jarlais has 
observed in new york city and san francisco is also of concern 
because of the difficulty of treating cocaine addiction des 
jarlais said 
we currently lack any largescale treatment for cocaine 
dependence he said heroin addiction can be controlled by 
substituting methadone for the drug but there is no such 
substitute for cocaine 
as of june 6 the us centers for disease control had reports 
of 64506 cases of aids 11914 of which or 18 percent were among 
nonhomosexual intravenous drug abusers 
des jarlais said the spread of aids among drug abusers appears 
to be slowing in san francisco 15 percent to 20 percent of 
cocaine and heroin abusers have been infected with the virus but 
that figure has not increased for about 18 months he said 
in new york city 55 percent to 60 percent of the drug abusers 
are infected and that figure has been stable for about three 
years he said 
we have seen substantial behavior change in a variety of 
cities he said 
in a separate report researchers said tuesday that proportion 
of drugrelated aids cases among puerto ricans in the united states 
is more than five times the rate among other hispanicamericans 
hispanics make up just 6 percent of the population but have 145 
percent of the countrys aids cases as of june 6 the us centers 
for disease control had reports of 9362 cases in hispanics out of 
a total of 64506 cases 
richard selik of the centers for disease control said 386 
percent of the aids cases among puerto ricans in the 50 states 
occur among drug abusers or their heterosexual partners 
he said that drugrelated cases made up only 42 percent of the 
aids cases in mexicanamericans 5 percent of the cases in 
cubanamericans and 73 percent of the cases in americans from 
other latin american countries 
efforts to prevent ivda intravenous drug abuse related aids 
in hispanics should be concentrated on persons of puerto rican 
origin selik said 
in another report a european research group said that 40 
percent of infants born with the aids virus develop the deadly 
disease or a related illness by the age of 10 months 
in the largest study yet done of aids transmission to newborns 
european researchers who have followed 219 infants of infected 
mothers for up to two years said it appears that 25 percent to 30 
percent of infants born to infected mothers will be infected 
themselves 
of the infected infants 40 percent will go on to develop aids 
or a related illness said the studys director dr catherine 
peckham of the institute of child health in london 
dr george rutherford of the san francisco department of public 
health reported new findings suggesting that most and perhaps all 
of the 1 million or more americans infected with the aids virus 
will ultimately develop aids 
an aids expert at the centers for disease control agreed the 
majority will get it said dr harold jaffe whether that will 
be 70 90 or 100 percent we still dont know 
rutherford has followed 71 men whose blood had been tested 
regularly for up to 10 years as part of a study of hepatitis 
tests of their blood samples show that 40 percent were sick with 
aids within nine years of becoming infected and that figure had 
climbed to 48 percent 10 years after infection

the chinese army has established a rapid response 
unit called the fist battalion to give more punch to chinas 
military under a reform program begun after an embarrassing 
miniwar with vietnam in 1979 
the battalion will be able to parachute into deserts deep 
forest or marshland and conduct guerrilla warfare the xinhua news 
agency said today quoting a report in tuesdays liberation army 
daily 
the battalion will also be able to reach any place inside china 
in less than 20 hours to respond to emergencies the official news 
agency said 
it did not say whether the unit might also be sent outside china 
if national interests are at stake 
the report also did not disclose the size of the unit or say 
when it was formed but the paper published two pictures dated 1986 
showing members parachuting and drilling on a snowcovered hill in 
chinas northeast 
since faring badly in a brief border war with vietnam in 1979 
chinas military has undergone a major overhaul manpower has been 
cut by 1 million to 3 million troops and greater emphasis has 
been put on holding battle drills and upgrading troops technical 
skills 
a 56000strong marine corps was set up in 1980 as a division of 
the navys south china sea fleet its mission is to defend coastal 
areas and the xisha paracels and nansha spratleys island chains 
in the south china sea that also are claimed by vietnam and several 
other east asian nations 
the official china daily recently reported that the marines are 
stepping up their training and acquiring new equipment it gave no 
other details 
todays report said the fist battalion may set an example for 
ordinary battalions to follow in a program to reform training 
exercises 
the liberation army daily quoted a veteran parachuter as saying 
the force was comparable to parachute units in the worlds most 
advanced countries

a college student says she dieted took voice 
lessons and spent 5000 during the 18 months that she plotted to 
disrupt the miss california pageant and expose the lies they 
promote 
michelle anderson miss santa cruz in mondays contest pulled 
from her bra a white silk banner reading pageants hurt all 
women just as the winner marlise ricardos was to be announced 
other participants yanked the banner from her and security 
guards promptly removed miss anderson from the san diego civic 
centers stage 
i wanted to go behind the scenes of pageants and expose the 
lies they promote such as women like to be judged by men or like 
to duct tape their breasts or starve to be thin anderson 
told a news conference tuesday 
she said the message beauty pageants give women is that to be 
beautiful they have to be thin blond and young 
women suffer severe indignities to try to be beautiful 
according to these standards she said 
anderson 21 a junior at the university of california santa 
cruz majoring in community studies said her protest cost her the 
miss santa cruz title and a 3000 scholarship 
she really took us in said donna williams the executive 
director of the santa cruz pageant i think im a pretty wise 
person weve known her for two years and i never had an inkling 
victoria garcia a spokeswoman for the miss california pageant 
said the pageant was helpless to prevent future protests from what 
she termed a plant 
i know it broke the heart of the people running the santa cruz 
pageant they put so much time and effort in coaching searching 
for the right person she anderson cheated another person out of 
a scholarship ms garcia said 
anderson said the idea for the stunt came during a protest 
planning session with former model ann simonton whose santa 
cruzbased group mediawatch has staged a number of pageant 
demonstrations 
the plan was for anderson to get to the largest audience before 
sharing her message the women said if shed won the miss 
california pageant she would have kept silent until reaching the 
miss america pageant 
it took anderson two tries to capture the miss santa cruz title 
she was the second runnerup in 1987 
according to anderson who said she is working on a book about 
her pageant experiences contestants must suspend their studies and 
spend an enormous amount of time and money on getting their bodies 
and talent in shape most spend far more than they win she said 
anderson said she spent 5000 lost 15 pounds bleached her 
hair exercised and took voice lessons 
she said she doesnt regret her actions even though she is 
sorry for hurting pageant organizers in santa cruz 
but theyre doing the wrong thing for women anderson said 
and im more interested in standing up for women than being nice 
and socially acceptable

france and iran said today they will reestablish 
diplomatic relations thursday after a break of nearly a year the 
move had been expected after the may release of last three french 
hostages held in lebanon

a jewish family again was refused permission to 
emigrate two weeks after president reagan canceled a meeting with 
them for fear of dooming their 11year campaign to leave 
tanya zieman whose 12yearold daughter had appealed to the 
president and mrs reagan for help in leaving the country said she 
received the news tuesday evening from the moscow city council 
she said the council told her the familys appeal was turned 
down by a review commission of the supreme soviet the nations 
nominal parliament and that the family could reapply to emigrate 
after 1992 
during the reagans summit trip to moscow two weeks ago us 
sources said the american first family agonized over whether to 
stop at the ziemans home after a top soviet foreign ministry 
official warned such a visit would ruin the familys chances to 
emigrate 
the ziemans younger daughter vera who calls herself a 
lifelong refusenik because her family applied to emigrate shortly 
after she was born had written the reagans asking for their help 
white house officials had been to the ziemans tiny threeroom 
apartment in southwest moscow to survey the home for a presidential 
visit the week before the reagans may 29 arrival in moscow 
soviet authorities getting wind of the plans sent a swarm of 
workers to repave the drive paint the apartment building repair 
the stoop scrub the corridor walls and landscape nearby flower 
beds 
a massive security force deployed around the building the day 
the reagans arrived in the capital drew a crowd of several hundred 
local residents 
but us and soviet sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said deputy foreign minister aleksandr bessmertnykh warned us 
ambassador jack f matlock and an accompanying white house official 
that if the reagans went through with the visit the ziemans would 
never leave the country 
in the end the reagans scrubbed the plan 
they didnt want to knuckle under to intimidation but they 
didnt want to hurt the ziemans either one source said 
the family headed by yuri zieman a former computer specialist 
did attend a tea the reagans gave for people the us 
administration considers victims of soviet human rights abuses 
yuri zieman who lost his job when he applied to emigrate in 
1977 worked as a plumber until he was stricken several months ago 
by a mysterious brain ailment that has left him with double vision 
and a loss of balance 
during his hospitalization for that condition he contracted 
hepatitis and his wife said tuesday he remained very weak 
zieman has been told he is not permitted to leave the country 
for security reasons although he contends he never had access to 
state secrets and has no information that could threaten soviet 
security 
he had been feeling much better the last two weeks thinking 
we would be getting some good news soon following the moscow 
summit mrs zieman said tuesday 
asked if the family would apply again for exit visas she said 
im still very much in a fighting mood

authorities investigating allegations of 
abuse at a boarding school for girls cut the homes locked gates 
and removed 29 students 
a spokesman at the private new bethany home for girls called the 
action tuesday an illegal raid all 52 girls ranging in age from 
12 to 17 were told they could leave the school but 23 remained 
an official said 
we feel this is a gross violation of civil rights said bob 
sensat a member of the homes board he denied allegations of 
abuse 
the state department of health and human resources obtained a 
court order to search the complex and interview the girls after 
receiving complaints from a runaway said lucky raley chief 
criminal investigator for the bienville parish sheriff 
about 30 girls flee the institution each year the juvenile 
officer said sheriff aarvis whitman calls the home a prison and 
has refused to send back runaways 
juvenile authorities said the girls removed from the home were 
placed in temporary housing 
yes praise godim going home finally one girl said 
as tears streamed down her face 
one girl said she received 20 licks with a paddle for having 
rock music tapes and for cutting her bangs 
dhhr officials two state troopers and five deputies arrived 
tuesday at the school which is situated 35 miles south of here 
and is surrounded by a 6foot chain link fence topped with barbed 
wire 
they said come on in but youre going to have to cut the lock 
to get in so we did said raley 
some girls who chose to remain at the school chastised departing 
students from inside the yard we are staying here with the 
lord one said 
the raid was a violation of constitutional rights because of the 
separation of church and state sensat said adding that the state 
had no right to intervene because the home receives no government 
funding 
the rev mack w ford pastor and director of the home was in 
south carolina sensat said ford founded the institution in 1971 
the state has no right to dictate to the church how to carry 
on its ministry when we do not have any proven abuse cases they 
came in merely on assumption sensat said 
dhhr tried to close the school in 1980 for refusing to allow an 
inspection and licensing but a judge ruled the state lacked such 
authority dhhr had received a number of complaints in 1979 about 
the homes operation 
on friday the bethel home for children a fundamentalist 
boarding school in lucedale miss was shut down its proprietor 
the rev herman fountain was arrested on charges of assulting a

israeli troops clashed with stonethrowing 
palestinians blocking roads near bethlehem today and killed a 
21yearold arab a hospital official said the army said it was 
investigating the report 
it was the 208th palestinian death in the 6monthold arab 
uprising against israel and came as arabs shut down the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip in a daylong general strike 
an official from beit jalla hospital identified the victim as 
nidal ibrahim hassan and said israeli troops shot him in the head 
during a confrontation in the village of battir five miles 
northwest of bethlehem 
arab youths had blocked roads in battir to prevent workers from 
going to their jobs said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity they threw stones and bottles at israeli soldiers who 
arrived at the scene he said 
todays strike was in solidarity with arab students held in 
israeli jails and also came in response to a call circulated on an 
underground leaflet 
israels army responded to the strike by stepping up patrols and 
closing 16 arab bus companies in the west bank and arab east 
jerusalem for a week 
the army also ordered a twoday closure of west bank schools 
which military officers say are a source of renewed violence 
we hope these two days will serve as a hint to those students 
who want to study to those parents who send their children to 
school and to those who are behind the disturbances so they will 
let the students complete the school year brig gen shaike 
erez head of the west banks military administration said on 
israel radio 
west bank schools a flashpoint for antiisraeli protests during 
the palestinian uprising were shut down in february studies have 
resumed gradually in the past three weeks with high school 
students the last to return june 6 
in the occupied gaza strip schools have remained open for most 
of the uprising 
israeli authorities closed 14 bus companies in arab east 
jerusalem for a week starting thursday as punishment for the 
companys participation in commercial strikes arab reports said 
also closed were the ramallah bus company and the bethlehem 
national bus company the companies owners said 
virtually all shops were closed and most streets empty today 
from bethlehem to the northern city of nablus in the west bank and 
in the seaside gaza strip 
in bethlehem graffiti on walls warned in arabic observe the 
strike or else some roads were blocked by boulders in nablus 
outlawed palestinian flags flapped from electrical poles 
it is wishful thinking for the israelis to say the uprising is 
dying said hanan ashrawi an english teacher at the west banks 
bir zeit university to end the occupation people are willing to 
sacrifice 
on tuesday the army said 2500 arabs had been ordered held for 
up to six months without charges up 500 from last month 
army officials said they could not provide figures on how many 
of the about 5000 arabs in israeli jails are students the army 
has said most administrative detainees are members of shabibe a 
youth group linked to the palestine liberation organization 
the army also said that dozens of israeli soldiers have been 
convicted of or charged with use of excessive force and other 
violations of army policy since the uprising began dec 8 in the 
west bank and gaza

that since the uprising began military police have opened 350 
investigations 
about 230 investigations have been completed and dozens of 
soldiers have been convicted of or charged with violating army 
regulations strashnov would not elaborate 
current army policy allows soldiers to club arabs to break up 
demonstrations but prohibits beatings once a suspect is in 
custody soldiers may only open fire in selfdefense 
in all 208 palestinians and two israelis have been killed since 
the uprising began

nasa administrator james c fletcher said 
today he is confident the next president will set a goal of having 
astronauts return to the moon or fly to mars 
fletcher interviewed on abctvs good morning america said 
the national aeronautics and space administration is back on 
track with a longrange goal of moving beyond the construction of 
a space station and into the solar system 
but he said the space station is threatened by possible budget 
cuts fletcher earlier warned that he would recommend killing the 
space station program if congress makes proposed deep cuts in the 
agencys requested 115 billion budget for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 
fletcher said pressure to reduce spending has prevented 
president reagan from setting the goal of long manned space flights 
the next step whether we go back to the moon or go to mars 
is to build a space station and that is in considerable doubt 
right now due to the severe budget crunch he said that is the 
next thing the president has to focus on and i think he will 
fletcher said he expects the united states to have a space 
station by the end of the century 
even if we dont get the funding this year the next 
prrsident im sure will sign up for the space station and an 
appropriate goal probably mars of the moon he said

thousands of people demonstrated in three baltic 
republics to mark stalins mass deportations of latvians 
lithuanians and estonians in the 1940s soviet media said today 
two people were reportedly arrested after raising the lithuanian 
flag 
officially sanctioned rallies were held tuesday in estonia 
latvia and lithuania according to dispatches by the official 
soviet news agency tass printed in todays edition of the communist 
party newspaper pravda 
unofficial groups also demonstrated in the three republics 
according to reports from the statecontrolled media and from 
emigre groups 
the decision to allow the demonstrations was part of kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs campaign to reform the soviet union 
but it was combined with sharp rhetoric and police harassment 
against some human rights activists in the republics 
two activists were reportedly arrested by plainclothes kgb 
officers at an unofficial rally attended by 6000 people in 
vilnius capital of lithuania the most rebellious of the baltic 
republics according to emigre sources 
the activists leonas laurinskas and genute sakaliene raised 
the tricolored flag of independent lithuania at the rally kgb 
officers pulled down the flag and held the two activists for a few 
hours according to lithuanian catholic religious aid an emigre 
group based in new york 
during the official commemoration in vilnius attended by 500 
lithuanians some extremistminded people tried to impart to the 
meeting a demagogic character and channel it to the route of 
nationalism tass said 
in washington president reagan proclamed tuesday baltic 
freedom day and said the united states will never recognize the 
forcible incorporation of the republics into the soviet union 
the situation has improved for some soviet human rights 
activists in recent months the us statement said but baltic 
men and women still suffer imprisonment banishment and persecution 
for daring to protest the continuing suppression of their national 
independence and cultures 
soviet officials reject us condemnation of the annexation 
carried out in june 1940 under a secret protocol of the 
molotovribbentrop pact between nazi germany and the soviet union 
but as part of gorbachevs campaign to change the system created 
by kremlin dictator josef v stalin soviet officials now 
acknowledge that heavyhanded methods were used 
before gorbachev came to power soviet authorities generally 
tried to forestall demonstrations in the baltic republics 
but they allowed demonstrations on june 14 1987 and last month 
in vilnius sponsored an official commemoration of a mass 
deportation that took place in 1947 however they broke up an 
unofficial demonstration attended by 5000 people in vilnius on the 
same day and harassed people at an unofficial rally tuesday 
tuesday marked the 47th anniversary of the first mass 
deportation when tass said thousands of families were illegally 
deported from estonia by the stalinist administrativebureaucratic 
system memorial meetings were held in tallin the estonian 
capital and tartus and piarnu 
alfred rudiks mayor of riga capital of latvia told an 
official rally there that the government of the republic had 
approved the initiative of young people to build in riga a 
monument to victims of stalins personality cult 
official reports of the mass deportations accused many of the 
victims of being nazi sympathizers and said that baltic emigre 
groups were seeking to undermine soviet authority 
we justifiably condemn the policy of cruelty tass quoted 
historian jan riekstins as telling a demonstration which it said 
was attended by many thousands of people 
emigre lithuanian groups say that 36000 were deported in 1941 
and another 200000 in 1948 
official soviet historians say a total of 31000 latvians were 
deported in 1941 when the baltic republics were occupied by the 
red army and in 1949 after the soviets had defeated the nazis 
tass said that apart from those who were deservedly punished 
for acts of political sabotage collaboration with fascists 
banditism and espionage the deportees also included innocent 
people 
tass also had harsh words for a latvian human rights activist 
who organized an unofficial demonstration there edmund cirvilis 
whom it called a former nazi soldier who was sent to latvia on a 
terrorist mission in 1945 
repeated efforts to telephone activists in the baltic republics 
were unsuccessful 
last month soviet police broke up a demonstration by 5000 
lithuanians marking the anniversary of the 1949 deportations 
according to lithuanian activists

the armenian legislature today endorsed a move to 
annex part of a neighboring republic turning a fierce ethnic 
dispute into a constitutional issue for the central soviet 
government to resolve 
a correspondent for the armenian communist party newspaper 
kommunist said the southern republics supreme soviet voted to 
approve the request of the disputed regions legislature to secede 
from azerbaijan and join armenia 
he said the meeting was broadcast live on television a first 
for the republic 
in moscow several hundred armenians applauded and raised 
clenched fists as tiran gureghian the armenian church 
representative in moscow told them the vote had been unanimous to 
annex the nagornokarabakh region which is predominantly armenian 
azerbaijans supreme soviet voted monday to reject the move 
saying it would be contrary to the interests of the azerbaijani 
and armenian population of the republic 
armenians and azerbaijanis have long been divided by religion 
and culture most armenians are christian while most azerbaijanis 
are moslem 
the dispute appears headed for consideration by the central 
governments supreme soviet in moscow which according to the 
soviet constitution must resolve territorial disputes among the 
countrys 15 republics 
moscow communist party officials rejected the annexation demand 
in february touching off a wave of ethnic violence and strikes in 
the two southern republics 
gureghian speaking from the steps of the redbrick church in a 
wooded armenian cemetery said armenians would now wait for 
moscows decision the people are united in their mood everyone 
is waiting for a just decision 
the kommunist correspondent speaking from the armenian capital 
of yerevan on condition of anonymity said seven deputies spoke 
before the republics supreme soviet voted today on the decree 
nagornokarabakhs council of peoples deputies the areas 
legislature voted feb 20 to request the transfer the regions 
communist party committee endorsed the move a month later saying 
it was wrong to make the area part of azerbaijan in 1923 during the 
formative years of the soviet state 
more than threequarters of nagornokarabakhs 160000 people 
are ethnic armenians 
unrest over the dispute began in february and on the 28th of 
that month there were riots in the azerbaijani city of sumgait in 
which 32 people were killed most of them armenians 
the crisis which has touched off economically damaging strikes 
in the disputed region and brought out thousands of demonstrators 
in yerevan represents a major test of soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost which permits more open 
discussion of soviet problems 
with the armenian and azerbaijani governments now taking 
opposite stands on the issue the dispute sets up a legal test as 
well 
moscow will now have to play the role of an arbitrator the 
journalist said 
the soviet constitution requires that changes in territorial 
boundaries be approved by the republics involved and be ratified by 
the central government it is unclear whether armenians will be 
able to get their way in light of the rejection of the annexation 
request by azerbaijans government 
unrest related to the dispute continued today more than 150 
students remained outside yerevans opera theater staging a sitin 
they began may 25 the kommunist journalist said 
three of the students have been lying on the square in a hunger 
strike since june 4 said mofses gorgisyan an armenian nationalist 
activist 
on monday armenians staged a general strike in yerevan and 
tens of thousands demonstrated 
armenians in nagornokarabakh have been striking and marching 
since may 23 the communist party newspaper pravda has reported 
elsewhere thousands of people rallied in three baltic republics 
to mark stalins mass deportations of estonians latvians and 
lithuanians in the 1940s 
officially sanctioned demonstrations were held tuesday in 
estonia latvia and lithuania according to dispatches by the 
official soviet news agency tass printed in todays edition of 
pravda 
unofficial groups also demonstrated in the republics according 
to reports from the statecontrolled media and from emigre groups 
two activists who raised the lithuanian flag were reportedly 
arrested at an unofficial rally attended by 6000 people in 
vilnius capital of lithuania emigre sources said

english soccer fans brawled at a train station setting off street 
battles and windowsmashing sprees that lasted into this morning 
police said 130 rioters were arrested 
later about 2000 english fans many of them drunk and wearing 
invasion of germany 1988 tshirts filled streets surrounding 
the main train station as dutch fans arrived for a match in the 
european soccer championships 
several hundred police kept the groups separated and directed 
the dutch fans through a side exit of the train station 
england and the netherlands were set to square off later today 
the two countries fans have the worst reputations for violence 
among european soccer supporters 
behave yourselves be a credit to your country and to your 
football team if you dont you are doing us no good at all 
bobby robson manager of englands team said in an appeal to fans 
before the game 
at least three police officers and an undetedays new york daily 
news 
meanwhile gov mario cuomo said tuesday the grand jury 
investigating the case should try to clear the names of anyone 
wrongfully accused by the teenagers advisers as well as find out 
if she was attacked 
he said he has asked attorney general robert abrams to continue 
his investigation as long as there is the slightest hope of 
producing evidence 
abrams said last week that his investigation would be winding 
down within a month if the brawley family did not cooperate 
the news and wcbstv reported tuesday that mckinnon a former 
director of security and communications at st marys hospital 
joined the team in january he said he broke with the others a 
month ago 
its all a pack of lies mckinnon was reported today to have 
told the newspaper and the tv station 
the real story is the political agenda of sharpton maddox and 
mason he told wcbs 
mckinnon who told the newspaper he is a former georgia police 
officer and private investigator said that sharpton himself 
admitted having doubts about what actually happened to miss brawley 
the wappingers fall teenager claims she was abducted and 
sexually assaulted by up to six white men over a fourday period in 
november she was found wrapped in a garbage bag her body covered 
with excrement and racial slurs 
through sharpton and her attorneys c vernon mason and alton 
maddox jr miss brawley has refused to cooperate with the grand 
jury her mother glenda brawley has sought sanctuary in a church 
to avoid a 30day jail sentence for refusing to testify 
i brought it up to sharpton that all the information doesnt 
jibe to me mckinnon said that it just didnt show where some 
whites had done it and that we shouldnt be taken off the beaten 
path by any rumors or any writing that was on her body he said to 
me that sounds shaky to me too 
mckinnon said its not about the story its about them trying 
to build a movement they have dreams of winning this thing 
sharpton vehemently disputed mckinnons account and said 
mckinnon was nothing more than a driver who was not privy to 
strategy meetings ive never had any doubt anywhere in the 
case he told the newspaper 
the governor tuesday said that everyone in the state may 
eventually be victimized by the brawley lawyers frightening 
mockery of the law he said mrs brawley should be arrested for 
defying a court order to testify 
maddox and mason without offering evidence have publicly 
accused dutchess county assistant district attorney a state 
trooper and a former parttime fishkill police officer of taking 
part in the alleged attack 
i think theres a tendency to say by some that they had their 
chance to prove there was this rape they didnt prove it so lets 
end the investigation cuomo said what about the other people 
who were accused until you explain how it did happen how do they 
defend themselves

major us insurers conspired to stop 
providing some kinds of liability coverage touching off a 
nationwide insurance crisis 10 states claimed in lawsuits 
the suits filed in us district court on tuesday follow eight 
others filed in march they claim the crisis forced municipalities 
and agencies to cut back on services and crippled businesses 
throughout the country 
the new states in the federal court action are maryland 
connecticut new jersey pennsylvania ohio colorado montana 
washington alaska and michigan 
new york state attorney general robert abrams said the case was 
one of the largest ever undertaken by a group of states in federal 
court 
the lawsuits accused 32 insurance companies and underwriting 
agencies of engaging in secret agreements that included targeting 
for elimination pollution insurance and general liability for 
damage discovered after expiration of a policy 
pennsylvania attorney general leroy s zimmerman and new jersey 
attorney general cary edwards at a news conference in philadelphia 
on tuesday said they could not estimate the dollar value of the 
damage claims but that it was in the millions for their two states 
alone 
the four major insurance companies named in the suit are 
hartford insurance company and aetna casualty and surety company 
both of hartford conn allstate insurance co of northbrook 
ill and cigna corp of philadelphia 
aetna condemned the suits as another political move by 
political officeholders who have consistently opposed any and all 
effort to address the real problems of the nations liability 
system 
hartford insurance called the suits totally without 
substance and expressed confidence the claims would be thrown out 
of court 
aetna allstate cigna and hartford fire insurance co started 
a campaign in 1984 to cut back on coverage then generally available 
in the country the suits claimed 
the suits also alleged that the companies got major us and 
british reinsurers including lloyds of london to threaten to 
boycott any us insurance company that provided broader coverage 
the companies pressured the insurance services office a 
1400member industry trade group to quit distributing standard 
forms in order to make it tough for companies to continue offering 
certain coverage the suits claimed 
as a result the suits said property damage insurance for local 
governments nonprofit agencies such as child care centers and 
various businesses suddenly became unavailable or extremely 
expensive 
the insurance industry finds that these attorneys general 
suits are based upon a total misunderstanding of how the insurance 
industry works said william f bailey special counsel to the 
new yorkbased iso 
every statement that was alleged to have been made in the 
secrecy of private clubs in new york was made in open hearings in 
front of state insurance commissioners bailey said there was 
no collusion to fix the market 
the 10 states who filed suit on tuesday joined california new 
york massachussetts west virginia wisconsin minnesota and 
alabama texas filed suit in its own state court

a treasure trove of spanish gold silver and 
emeralds that had lain unnoticed for centuries in the waters off 
florida attracted the rich the famous and the curious at an 
auction that brought 25 million 
before tuesdays sale treasure hunter mel fisher stood on the 
sidewalk outside christies auction house greeting passersby 
posing for photographs and wearing around his neck pounds of gold 
chain he took from the ocean floor 
i want to show how safe it is in new york the former 
indiana chicken farmer and california dive shop operator said 
before running upstairs for the auction 
the auction was the first of a twoday sale of booty recovered 
from a pair of spanish treasure galleons that went down in a 
hurricane off the florida keys in 1622 
most of the treasure which included gold and silver bars 
jewelry and artifacts as well as coins emeralds and 17thcentury 
navigation instruments came from the galleons of the nuestra 
senora de atocha and her sister ship the santa margarita fishers 
expedition discovered the atocha which held the richest treasure 
ever recovered from the sea in 1971 and the margarita nine years 
later 
however some of the auctioned artifacts were recovered by 
divers working off floridas east coast where a spanish fleet went 
down in a hurricane in 1715 
a 62inch renaissance gold chain from the margarita attracted 
the most attention and fetched 319000 in spirited bidding the 
chain formed from 136 oval links went to an anonymous telephone 
bidder 
several brass astrolabes used to navigate the illfated vessels 
also attracted high prices 
theyre very very rare things very important anthony 
phillips a christies executive said of the instruments several 
went to european museums that the auction house declined to 
identify 
celebrities in the crowd included texas oil tycoon nelson bunker 
hunt who said he was merely a spectator and actress margot kidder 
i tried for some emeralds but missed she said 
while items such as a twohandled gold cup that brought 275000 
or a silvergilt cup that sold for 165000 generated the most 
interest more modest items also went up on the block including a 
fishhookshaped gold wire that fetched 308

to a little brotherly competition 
this time the race was on in the maternity ward at bergan mercy 
hospital 
the arrival of two hall cousins on the same day delivered by 
the same doctor began with confusion saturday when geoff 27 and 
his wife kim arrived at bergans emergency entrance 
we walked in and they asked are you the hall family we 
said yes and then went up to delivery geoff recalled 
jim and kathy showed up about 15 minutes later and told the 
people at the desk were kathy and jim hall and the people at 
the desk said no youre not theyre here 
apparently the hospital pulled the wrong medical file when the 
motherstobe called to warn of their arrival geoff said 
it was understandable both mothers are 27 both first names 
begin with k and they had the same doctor 
the confusion did not end at the emergency room geoff said that 
tuesday when he and kim called for their nicholas samuel nurses

longdistance runner herself but this time geoff won 
nicholas samuel beat his cousins arrival by five hours and 42

the supreme court keeping alive a gay spys 
lawsuit against the cia today limited the agencys authority to 
fire employees without having to face court review 
by a 62 vote the court said the 1947 law creating the central 
intelligence agency did not give the cia director absolute 
discretion to fire employees whenever he deems it necessary 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
a cia employees allegations of violated constitutional rights may 
be reviewed in federal court 
the ruling flatly rejected the reagan administrations arguments 
that the spy agency should have virtually absolute authority to 
fire employees if their dismissal is deemed in the interests of 
the united states 
solicitor general charles fried in arguing for the cia before 
the justices last january said there does come a point where 
the agency simply must be able without giving reasons and 
without triggering inquiry within open court to fire an employee 
deemed a security risk 
but rehnquist said under the administrations view all agency 
employment termination decisions even those based on policies 
normally repugnant to the constitution are given over to the 
absolute discretion of the director 
we do not think the 1947 law may be read to exclude review 
of constitutional claims rehnquist said 
the court however said federal courts may not review 
nonconstitutional claims stemming from cia dismissals 
a homosexual identified in court documents only by the 
fictitious name john doe was fired by thencia director william 
casey in 1982 the agency claimed does homosexuality was a 
security threat 
doe had joined the cia as a clerktypist in 1973 and worked his 
way up to a covert job as an electronics technician in which he 
was rated an excellent agent 
in january 1982 he voluntarily told an agency security officer 
that he was gay doe was placed on paid leave pending an 
investigation and that may he was told he was being fired in the 
interests of the united states 
doe told agency officials that his family neighbors and friends 
knew he was a homosexual and that he had never revealed classified 
information to any unauthorized person 
doe sued the agency and demanded that he be reinstated he 
argued that his constitutional rights were violated when the agency 
fired him because he is gay and that the cia ignored its own 
firing procedures by denying him a chance to appeal his dismissal 
a federal appeals court ruled that doe could not be fired just 
because he is gay but could be fired if found to be a legitimate 
security threat 
todays decision upheld the appeals court ruling and sent does 
case back to a federal trial judge 
rehnquist said the judge should address does constitutional 
claims and the propriety of the equitable remedies reinstatement 
and back pay sought 
joining rehnquist were justices william j brennan byron r 
white thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
justices sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia dissented 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court after the case was 
accepted for review and argued did not participate in deciding it 
the case is webster vs doe 861294

the state of ohio admits to pouring money 
down a hole about 93000 of it 
state geologists recently used 200 pounds of old shredded bills 
from the federal reserve bank to fill in crevices in a 3inch 
diameter 4000foot hole 
the state geological survey began drilling the hole in a wayne 
township quarry in october as part of an effort to map the states 
underground strata 
water is pumped into the hole as a lubricant and coolant for the 
diamondstudded drill bit then pumped back up said geologist mike 
hansen at 1800 feet geologists found that the water was 
disappearing seeping into crevices 
doug crowell geologist and supervisor of the drilling program 
said drillers who had attended a seminar at wright state university 
a few years ago told him about using bills as a sealing agent 
we tried some standard products and just werent getting any 
results crowell said we tried the money and it worked 
because of the high linen content it doesnt dissolve easily and 
works well as a sealer

its official women spend more time in the 
restroom than men 
two virginia tech researchers armed with stop watches and 
questionnaires found that a womans visit to a public restroom 
runs 50 percent longer than a mans 
one reason savannah s day a virginia tech professor of 
housing and sandra k rawls who used the research to earn her 
doctorate said tuesday is that women often have youngsters in tow 
another factor they said is that women are often hindered by 
large handbags and packages 
the researchers spent several months timing more than 450 people 
going in and out of restrooms at sports arenas a conference 
center an airport and a highway rest area 
a restroom stop by a woman averaged between 153 seconds and 181 
seconds according to their findings the mens average was between 
84 seconds and 113 seconds 
the findings have a bearing on the legislative issue of potty 
parity 
state rep john a rollison iii is planning hearings in october 
on the ratio of mens restrooms to womens in public buildings 
some claim the standard 5050 split is not equal rollison said he 
would like to increase the number of womens facilities 
we know its a fact that women do take longer said ms 
rawls we can proceed from there and see how best the problem can 
be handled

the dalai lama exiled leader of the 
tibetan people today recognized chinas right to handle tibets 
foreign affairs and maintain troops on tibetan soil 
the dalai lama proposed talks with china to make tibet a 
selfgoverning democratic political entity in association with 
the peoples republic of china which could remain responsible for 
tibets foreign policy 
until such a peace conference can be convened and 
demilitarization and neutralization achieved china could have the 
right to maintain a restricted number of military installations in 
tibet he said 
his remarks were in a speech prepared for delivery to the 
european parliament the speech subsequently was canceled because 
of fears his appearance would offend the chinese government and 
the buddhist spiritual leader spoke with reporters after copies of 
his speech were distributed 
the dalai lama previously has made little mention of chinese 
interests in tibet he also neither accepted the chinese military 
presence in the remote territory nor recognized chinas right to 
handle its foreign affairs 
in todays speech he spoke both of accommodating chinas own 
interests in tibet while reestablishing tibets separate 
identity 
he also said the government of the peoples republic of china 
could remain responsible for tibets foreign policy and that 
china could have the right to maintain a restricted number of 
military installations in tibet 
but he said the ultimate goal is a demilitarized tibet a 
genuine sanctuary of peace 
china regards tibet as a critical buffer zone between itself and 
india a traditional rival western estimates put the number of 
chinese soldiers in tibet at tens of thousands 
the dalai lama said he was well aware that many tibetans will 
be disappointed by the moderate stand these new ideas represent 
but he argued that such conciliation represents the most 
realistic means for restoring the fundamental rights of the 
tibetan people 
china claims tibet has been part of its empire for more than six 
centuries tibetan activists say tibet is an independent country 
and point to its separate language culture and traditions as proof 
communist troops entered tibet after defeating nationalist 
chinese forces in 1949 
ten years later tibetan activists rebelled against chinese 
rule the chinese army crushed the uprising and the dalai lama fled 
to india with thousands of other tibetans 
during the cultural revolution of 196676 bands of chinese 
radicals called red guards destroyed most of tibets buddhist 
temples and killed monks 
after the fall of the ultraleftist gang of four conditions in 
tibet improved and the state began putting more money into the 
region 
but the improved conditions also led to increased expectations 
by the tibetan people 
tibet has been rocked by two major antichinese protests both 
in lhasa the capital the protests which occurred last fall and 
again in march left dozens of tibetans and chinese dead 
hundreds of tibetan monks who led the rebellion were reportedly 
arrested 
the dalai lama was to speak to the european parliament but the 
invitation was withdrawn he had been invited by lady elles a 
british conservative 
lord plumb the parliament president said he did not believe 
that the dalai lamas visit is helpful in the current circumstances 
of the european parliaments improving relations with china 
sources said plumb who is to visit china in july feared a 
formal speech to the parliament by the dalai lama would jeopardize 
plumbs visit to china 
in october the parliament urged china to respect tibets right 
to selfdetermination and invited the dalai lama to address the 
518member parliament beijing then canceled a visit to china this 
year by a parliamentary delegation 
the dalai lama is in the middle of a 16day tour of europe on 
tuesday he met with pope john paul ii

as they prepared to run against each other in novembers 
presidential election

<TEXT>
le monde of paris independent the governor and the vice 
president despite long public careers remain largely unknown 
vaguely perceived by public opinion they have taken care not to 
show their cards too soon to make commitments on nothing or almost 
nothing the technique has been shown shown to pay off for the 
primaries particularly for mr dukakis who did not have any 
particular advantage at the start over his democratic competitors 
while the vice president loyal aide to mr reagan started several 
lengths in front in his race 
the qualities needed to succeed in this kind of contest are 
not necessarily sufficient to make a good president but it is true 
that the system has worked while many in the democratic camp 
feared that it might get stuck 
werent they talking last autumn about the seven dwarfs 
these seven democratic candidates of whom none seemed to have the 
makings of a president or even of a credible candidate 
snow white has fallen in love with the smallest of the dwarfs 
who has grown up a great deal in the meanwhile to the point that 
he his more than 10 points ahead of his republican opponent in the 
polls and has increased his selfconfidence while benefiting from 
a very favorable treatment from the media especially television

el mercurio of santiago conservative dukakis has no 
experience in interntional policy bush as the second man in the 
present administration is tied to the painful affair of the sale 
of arms to iran and to an ineffective policy in central america 
dukakis is prepared to suspend the aid to the nicaraguan 
antisandinistas which has already been done by congress against 
reagans will and supports costa rican president oscar arias 
peace plan for central america which has in effect meant leaving 
everything unchanged with the sandinistas firmly in power

mainichi daily news of tokyo conservative englishlanguage 
for japan which has close relations with the united states in 
the political and economic phases the greatest vigilance is 
required every four years 
during the first half of the primaries japans political and 
economic circles exercised strong vigilance because of the 
appearance of the gephardt phenomenon that included the spread of 
a protectionist feeling in the grass roots and the trend toward 
japan bashing fortunately a wiser choice was later made by the 
americans and strong support was obtained by bush and dukakis who 
are both antiprotectionist 
hitherto both bush and dukakis have given careful attention 
to japan 
from now on it will be necessary for the two candidates to 
draw up their respective party platforms in advancing toward the 
presidential election it will be necessary to watch the definite 
form that the policy toward japan will take 
since this is an election in another country japan can only 
watch and wait

the times of london independent the reagan presidency has 
meant stability for nato 
would a dukakis presidency bring fundamental change 
unlike the current president he says he would always consult his 
allies before doing anything 
that is rather like preaching motherhood and apple pie 
he may discover if he becomes president that consensus 
among the allies can be elusive his commitment to consult the 
europeans will be popular in nato capitals but a president 
who is loath to act alone may then find it impossible to do 
anything 
but europe too must adjust in time if mr dukakis wins at 
present he seems dedicated to retaining american troops in western 
europe but that commitment may be less firm when subjected to 
political pressures within america the old issue of 
burdensharing is once more alive europeans should prepare to 
be cooperative if they want to keep the alliance strong in what 
could be an era of change and readjustment 
the need to respond to new perceptions in america must be 
impressed upon allied governments

jackson knows his dream of being the first black american elected 
to the highest office in the land will not be realized in 1988 
but even as dukakis moves inexorably towards the democratic party 
nomination it is vital that jackson keep running vital to the 
democrats even more vital to democracy in america 
jackson strikes a responsive chord with the vietnam veteran 
without work the single mother in the inner city people who sweat 
on the job if jacksons candidacy rekindles a commitment to 
the democratic process by those who have questioned its worth of 
late then jesse jackson will be a winner wherever he finishes in

the supreme court today expanded the financial 
liability of promoters of business deals that turn sour 
the justices voting 71 ruled that a texas oilman may not have 
to bear full financial liability for selling unregistered oil and 
gas leases the court said a promoter of the deal who also bought 
the securities himself may be forced to share liability 
the court overturned a ruling that favored the promoter and 
ordered further lower court study of the case 
todays ruling also favors the securities and exchange 
commission which argued that promoters who are not themselves 
sellers of securities should not be immune from penalties in such 
cases 
the ruling is at least a partial victory for billy bj 
pinter head of black gold oil co who sold oil and gas rights in 
texas and oklahoma to a group of investors in 1981 
maurice dahl a california real estate broker was instrumental 
in putting the deal together dahl was convinced the leases would 
be lucrative and promoted their sale to his friends and family 
members 
when the leases proved worthless the investors including dahl 
sued pinter 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1986 that pinter 
violated federal law by failing to register the securities the 
appeals court upheld a federal judges ruling that pinter must 
reimburse the investors for their losses plus interest 
pinter said that dahl because he promoted the investment is 
himself a seller of securities who should be forced to share 
the cost of reimbursement 
the 5th circuit court noting that dahl did not receive a 
commission for promoting the deal said he was more a buyer than a 
seller 
but the supreme court today ordered further hearings to explore 
that issue 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said it is 
unclear whether dahl urged the other purchases in order to 
further some financial interest of his own or of pinter 
moreover blackmun said there must be further study to 
determine whether dahl bears at least substantially equal 
responsibility for the failure to register the oil and gas 
interests or to distribute the securities in a manner that 
conformed with federal law 
there is conflicting evidence about the nature of dahls role 
blackmun said 
he said there is evidence on one hand that dahl initiated the 
entire investment and loaned money to pinter to make the deal 
possible but on the other hand there is also evidence that dahl 
invested more money in the deal than other investors whom he urged 
to participate 
a person in dahls position must share financial liability for 
sale of unregistered securities if his role is more as a promoter 
than as an investor blackmun said 
justice john paul stevens was the lone dissenter justice 
anthony m kennedy did not take part in the case 
the case is pinter vs dahl 86805

the maker of the suzuki samurai knew the 
sporty vehicles were unsafe but sold them anyway a classaction 
lawsuit charges 
the federal suit filed tuesday charges suzuki conspired to 
conceal the samurais instability in violation of the racketeering 
influenced corrupt organizations act a statute often employed 
against organized crime 
consumers union publisher of consumer reports said june 2 that 
the samurai rolls over in sudden turns at less than 40 mph and 
should be banned the 8500 samurai was the first car in a decade 
to get a notacceptable rating from the magazine 
the suit filed by dr harold kay of wynnewood pa on behalf 
of all samurai owners contends that suzuki and the companies 
handling its public relations and advertising knew the vehicles 
were by design and construction dangerous and that 
advertising and other sales representations were false and 
misleading 
it seeks unspecified damages 
laura segall spokeswoman for suzuki and an employee of the 
defendant public relations firm rogers and associates said 
tuesday the bottom line weve said for the last 10 days is that 
its safe and stable 
the manufacturer said the the samurai was thoroughly tested for 
safety stability and handling before it was introduced in the 
united states in november 1985 suzuki sold 154675 samurais 
through april 
in addition to the consumers union claims the suit points to 
the center for auto safetys february petition to the government to 
order a recall 
it also cites national traffic highway safety administration 
figures that at least 44 samurai rollover accidents resulted in at 
least 53 injuries and 16 deaths

the supreme court barring arizona prosecutors 
from using an accused burglars confession as evidence against him 
refused to narrow criminal suspects socalled miranda rights today 
by a 62 vote the court said police may not question a suspect 
who already has invoked his right to remain silent or receive a 
lawyers help even if their questions center on some other crime 
writing for the court justice john paul stevens said tucson 
police in 1985 violated ronald w robersons rights by questioning 
him about a burglary after he had refused to discuss another 
burglary until conferring with a lawyer 
the court in its landmark 1966 decision in a case called 
miranda vs arizona ruled that criminal suspects in police custody 
must be told about their right to remain silent to have a lawyers 
help and to have a lawyer appointed for them if they cannot afford 
one 
in other action today the court expanded the financial 
liability of promoters of business deals that turn sour and limited 
the cias authority to fire employees without having to face court 
review 
the justices ruled 71 that california real estate broker 
maurice dahl may have to share liability with texas oil man billy 
bj pinter who a federal appeals court said violated federal 
law by failing to register securities in a oil and gas rights deal 
that collapsed dahl had promoted the deal and bought into it 
himself 
in the cia case the court ruled 61 that the cia director does 
not have blanket discretion to fire employees the case involved a 
homosexual identified in court documents only as john doe the man 
was fired by thencia director william casey in 1982 
the agency claimed his homosexuality was a security threat but 
a federal appeals court ruled he could only be fired if he was 
found to be a legitimate security threat not just because he was 
gay todays decision upholds that ruling and requires court review 
of constitutional questions raised in firings by the agency 
in the arizona case the court said that if suspects invoke 
their right to silence or to have legal help police questioning 
must stop 
in deciding a case called edwards vs arizona in 1981 the 
justices emphasized that police officers may not seek to initiate 
any new contact with a suspect who already has asked to see a 
lawyer 
but arizona attorney general argued in robersons case that the 
courts previous rulings should not apply when police unaware of 
the suspects alleged participation in one crime seek to question 
him about another crime 
the court rejected corbins argument 
whether a contemplated reinterrogation concerns the same or a 
different offense or whether the same or different law enforcement 
authorities are involved in the second investigation the same need 
to determine whether the suspect has requested counsel exists 
stevens said 
the police departments failure to honor that request cannot 
be justified by the lack of diligence of a particular officer he 
added 
roberson had been arrested by tucson police on burglary charges 
when police detective jerry cotarobles learned of information 
suggesting that roberson may have participated in an april 15 1985 
burglary 
cotarobles went to question roberson about the april 15 
burglary but was not told that roberson previously had invoked his 
right to see a lawyer before answering police questions 
cotarobles warned roberson about his rights and questioned him 
roberson confessed to the april 15 burglary 
arizona courts refused to let the confession be introduced as 
trial evidence and prosecutors dismissed the case while appealed 
the decision to suppress the evidence 
the state court rulings were upheld in todays decision 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice anthony m 
kennedy dissented justice sandra day oconnor did not participate 
in the case for unannounced reasons 
the case is arizona vs roberson 87354

defense secretary frank c carlucci said today 
he intends to require pentagon contractors to provide a drugfree 
workplace for their 32 million employees 
the contractors would have to develop extensive antidrug 
programs including mandatory testing of employees with security 
clearances carlucci told the senate and house armed services 
committees 
carluccis announcement came as he said he is opposed to a pair 
of house and senate bills providing extensive new involvement of 
the military in the fight against illegal drug shipments into the 
united states 
the hundreds of defense contractors would have to educate their 
workers about the dangers of drugs and would also have to test for 
drug usage carlucci told the two panels 
an estimated 3 million workers on pentagon contracts have 
security clearances and thus would be subject to the testing 
program 
carlucci said it would be my intent to issue the regulation 
requiring the antidrug effort but did not say when that order 
would be made 
the two panels are working on a compromise version of a pentagon 
budget bill and some of the key proposals involve the militarys 
role in the antidrug fight 
the house overwhelmingly approved a proposal essentially 
requiring president reagan to have the military seal the us 
borders against drug smugglers while the senate easily passed a 
measure giving the military new powers including the authority to 
arrest drug smugglers in international waters 
none of the interdiction approaches in and of themselves 
will work carlucci said i believe that these are not 
solutions to the problem but rather the result of our rising 
frustration at our inability to find a real solution 
i remain absolutely opposed to the assignment of a law 
enforcement mission to the department of defense carlucci said 
i am even more firmly opposed to any relaxation of the posse 
comitatus restrictions on the use of the military to search seize 
and arrest 
i have discussed this matter with the president and other 
senior members of his cabinet and i can report that these views are 
shared throughout this administration he said 
carlucci was referring to the posse comitatus act an 1878 law 
that bars the military from enforcing civilian laws congress 
amended the law in 1981 to permit the military to take a limited 
role in the antidrug effort but the current proposals would 
provide new exemptions to the law 
our armed forces should not become a police force nor can we 
afford to degrade readiness by diverting badly needed resources 
from their assigned missions carlucci said 
the military is trained and equipped to shoot everything which 
comes over the hill he said in answer to a question theyre 
not trained and equipped to distinguish the good guys from the bad 
guys they are trained and equipped with weapons of mass 
destruction

scientists say they have developed forms of 
insulin that are absorbed more quickly after injection than current 
versions holding promise of better treatment for diabetics 
experiments in pigs showed the new forms are absorbed two to 
three times faster after injection than current rapidacting 
insulins researchers said 
that means they can better match the rapid rise in bloodstream 
concentrations that nondiabetics get in response to eating a meal 
researchers from denmark and britain wrote in thursdays issue of 
the british journal nature 
the work already has led to improved control of blood sugar 
levels in some diabetics but the new insulins must be studied for 
possible side effects before their usefulness can be established 
the scientists said 
to develop the new forms researchers altered tiny portions of 
the standard insulin molecule to prevent molecules from clumping 
together

americans view aids as the nations most 
serious health problem and a majority favor mandatory testing for 
the virus as well as more spending on education and research 
according to a poll released wednesday 
the survey for the american association of blood banks said 
people generally believe the blood supply is safer today than five 
years ago although nearly half 48 percent still think it is 
likely aids could be contracted through a blood transfusion 
half of those questioned supported making every effort to 
protect the blood supply even at the risk of much higher blood 
costs or blood shortages but officials cautioned against thinking 
that all risk could be eliminated 
we are concerned that americans believe it is possible to have 
a zero risk blood supply said dr paul j schmidt aabb 
president because blood is a human tissue it will never be 
zero risk 
the telephone survey of 1000 people selected at random was 
conducted by the polling firm of hamilton frederick and schneiders 
on april 19 and may 1 the margin of error was plus or minus 3 
percentage points 
fortyeight percent said acquired immune deficiency syndrome was 
the most serious health problem facing the country today 
compared with 35 percent in a prior aabb survey in december 1986 
fortysix percent said cancer was the most serious concern 
compared with 52 percent in 1986 
ninetyfive percent favored a nationwide aids education program 
and 84 percent supported increasing government spending 
significantly for aids research even if that would cause increased 
taxes or cuts in key programs 
seventyeight percent favored mandatory testing for drug users 
homosexuals and prostitutes 78 percent favored it for couples 
applying for marriage licenses and 75 percent favored mandatory 
testing for employees such as health professionals teachers and 
food service workers 
the american association of blood banks is a professional 
society which includes 2400 hospital blood banks transfusion 
services and community blood centers which collect nearly half the 
nations blood supply and transfuse more than 80 percent of the 
blood collected in the united states

jesse jackson said today his most critical 
political concern is to have the democratic convention accept his 
budget priorities which include increasing taxes and freezing 
military spending to pay for social programs 
now that michael dukakis camp has agreed to his platform 
position on south africa jackson indicated he will home in on his 
budget arguments 
the most critical becomes this budget a commitment to invest 
in people a commitment to reinvest in america jackson said 
following a meeting with leaders of civil rights groups 
he said dukakis talks of helping people but has made far too 
little commitment to offset the impact of reagans shortfall in 
investment in urban america 
now putting forth a commitment to dream a new dream to choose 
hope over dope and pay for our dreams will be central to our 
thrust at the platform hearings and in atlanta 
jackson has proposed a freeze on military spending and raising 
taxes on the wealthy and corporations to pay for his proposals but 
the dukakis forces have rejected those two ideas 
he said he urged the black leaders meeting at the invitation of 
the black leadership forum to meet with dukakis benjamin hooks 
head of the naacp said they would seek such a meeting and would 
voice concerns about budget priorities 
jackson also said the idea of moving the us embassy in israel 
from tel aviv to jerusalem a proposal endorsed by dukakis would 
be a fatal mistake if done outside the context of a negotiated 
peace plan he said such a move would create more chaos 
on tuesday jackson repeated his contention that he ought to be 
a contender for the no 2 spot on the ticket although hes still 
not saying whether hed accept it if an offer were extended 
i have earned my constituency has earned consideration to be 
on the ticket jackson said during a news conference following a 
speech to the us conference of mayors in salt lake city 
recent polls have indicated that having jackson on the ticket 
would hurt dukakis more than it would help but he brushed that 
suggestion aside 
our combined efforts could very well bring victory he said 
despite all the talk about the vice presidency jackson said he 
was still not willing to concede the nomination to dukakis the 
massachusetts governor has more than enough delegates to win the 
nomination on the first ballot at the democratic national 
convention in atlanta next month 
my priority at this point is to seek the nomination jackson 
insisted 
jackson also termed weekend democratic platformdrafting 
meetings on macincac island mich a step in the right 
direction toward resolving platform differences between him and 
dukakis 
they established a framework for negotiation he said 
in his speech to the mayors jackson said he did much to set the 
agenda for the presidential campaign 
the present focus on human rights drugs and now south 
africa ratifies my leadership he said 
jackson repeated his call for a military spending freeze and 
proposed financing small business loans and lowincome housing with 
securities purchased by public pension funds

an undercover agent testified today he was 
very flabbergasted that a secret investigation into widespread 
drug trafficking was abruptly halted at a california nuclear 
weapons laboratory before he could penetrate highly classified 
areas 
detective robert buda said the undercover investigation was 
terminated by energy department officials three days before he 
received his green card clearance to pursue drug ring leaders 
in the most sensitive areas of the lawrence livermore national 
laboratory near san francisco 
unfortunately that door was closed before we could get in 
he told a house energy and commerce subcommittee 
a subcommittee report circulated before todays hearing said 
more than 100 employees had been targeted in the investigation 
known as operation snowstorm 
the report said the investigation was halted in september 1986 
nine months after it began david a leary who was in charge of 
the investigation said that 127 suspects had been identified 
before the investigation was terminated 
rep ron wyden dore said the investigation should be 
called operation snowjob because energy department officials were 
too afraid of adverse publicity to continue the drug investigation 
the laboratory conducts topsecret research on nuclear weapons 
and president reagans star wars missile defense system timothy l 
mitchell of the laboratorys drug investigating team testified that 
the volume of drug trafficking at livermore has the potential to 
endanger national security 
according to the subcommittee report the drug investigation by 
the laboratorys security department was halted by lawrence 
livermore managers under pressure from energy department officials 
the investigation began in january 1986 after an alarming 
number of employees became involved in drugrelated activities 
and arrests the report fails to specify the drugs but a 
subcommittee source told the post that cocaine methamphetamine and 
marijuana were used during and after work hours 
john hunt head of the security at the laboratory told 
investigators we would have to arrest 20 percent of the lab if 
the operation were allowed to continue

president kennedy was murdered in a plot by texas 
oilmen the red army won world war ii virtually alone these and 
other lies have fatally flawed soviet textbooks according to the 
official media and educators 
huge unmeasurable is the guilt of those who deluded 
generation after generation poisoning their minds and souls with 
lies the government daily izvestia thundered recently in an 
unusually strong attack on distortions and omissions in the 
schoolbooks and on the authors who wrote them 
history texts used by 45 million soviet school pupils are so out 
of tune with mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for glasnost or 
openness that 160 teams of authors have competed to write new 
textbooks and this months history exams have been canceled for 
students in their 10th and final year of school 
the written tests would have required 16 and 17yearolds to 
parrot material at odds with recent disclosures about the countrys 
past including the misdeeds of dictator josef stalin 
what stalin did in the 1930s all the illegal acts are not 
mentioned in the textbooks said igor a parabrin editor of 
international relations for the educational newspaper uchitelskaya 
gazeta there is a lack of information a lack of truth and 
sometimes just plain lies 
for example parabrin said textbooks still depict stalins foes 
such as nikolai a bukharin as criminals or traitors or do not 
mention them at all bukharin a topranking bolshevik who was shot 
in 1938 after being convicted on trumpedup charges of spying was 
judicially rehabilitated this year 
the textbooks even those printed as recently as 1986 spotlight 
soviet victory in world war ii and the 1957 launch of the first 
sputnik but avoid tragedies such as the 193438 great purge in 
which western historians estimate at least 8 million people were 
killed or sent to labor camp under stalin 
here is a sampler from soviet textbooks printed in the last 
three years 
on kennedys assassination in 1963 international opinion 
viewed this crime of the century as the deed of ultrarightists 
linked to the cia and fbi who were carrying out the will of the oil 
magnates of texas 
on bourgeois lies about world war ii the falsifiers of 
history try to decrease the significance of the victories of the 
red army to minimize the decisive role of the ussr in the rout 
of the hitlerite bloc at the same time they exaggerate the 
military successes of the allies the significance of the fighting 
in the west 
on the soviet union our country will become even richer 
even stronger even more beautiful because the soviet people under 
the leadership of the party of communists is working well and is 
building a new happy life and that new and genuinely happy life 
is communism 
instead of the scheduled written exam students finishing the 
10th grade of soviet school will be given oral tests 
the decision to cancel the written exams was made in may by 
gennady a yagodin chairman of the state committee on public 
education a recently created superministry overseeing 
governmentmandated reforms in education 
canceling the exams was the only possible sober and honorable 
decision izvestia said in its frontpage article june 9 
everyone teachers parents students can feel only relief and 
thanks toward those who had the boldness to say that these exams 
would not take place 
soviet educators meanwhile are moving to create a new 
generation of textbooks that reflect the demands of glasnost 
vladimir shadrikov vice chairman of the education 
superministry told the tass news agency that the goal was to move 
away from the excessive uniformity that he said had plagued the 
soviet educational system 
izvestia suggested that if new textbooks cannot be printed by 
the beginning of the next school year in september intellectuals 
could compile anthologies of published glasnostera historical 
writings and documents for classroom use 
at some moscowarea schools teachers for months have begun 
basing their history lessons on articles in the weekly ogonyok the 
tabloid moscow news and other publications campaigning for more 
historical candor 
today we are reaping the fruits of our own moral compromising 
for silently encouraging everything for which we blush today 
and about which we do not know know how to answer our children 
izvestia said 
let us teach them in such a way that when they become parents 
they will not have to blush before our grandchildren

submit petition signatures 
us district judge robert demascio ruled monday in detroit that 
lenora fulani should have a place on the november ballot without 
having to submit 24000 petition signatures

law requiring independent candidates to gather the signatures the 
law says the signatures have to be collected no more than 180 days 
before the filing deadline but the law didnt take effect until 81 
days before this years deadline of july 21 
we maintain thats enough time for a bona fide candidate to 
collect 24000 signatures said elections director christopher 
thomas 
since fulani was the only party to the lawsuit its unclear 
whether the judges ruling will apply to other wouldbe independent 
candidates he said 
fulani 38 of new york was an unsuccessful gubernatorial 
candidate in 1986 and mayoral candidate in 1985 a psychologist 
she is the former director of the harlem institute for social

the reagan administration is weighing whether 
to seek new us military aid for the nicaraguan contra resistance 
in the wake of collapsed peace talks with the managua government a 
white house spokesman said today 
marlin fitzwater told reporters the policy review includes 
consultations with members of congress and a factfinding mission 
to central america by max kampelman one of the administrations 
key arms control negotiators 
fitzwater said the temporary reassignment of kampelman to the 
mission in central america did not represent a downgrading of the 
importance of negotiations on a strategic arms reduction treaty 
start dispatching the veteran diplomat to el salvador costa 
rica and guatemala he said was done to get a fresh eye on the 
problem 
fitzwater said that reagan in a meeting today with 
congressional supporters of the contras expressed frustration that 
the world was not being told enough about sandinista excesses 
the president said the sandinistas want to talk about how to 
lay down arms but they do not want to talk about how to bring 
democracy to nicaragua his spokesman said he said they want 
to talk about surrender but they do not want to talk about reform 
and democracy 
the president listened to their various points of view no 
decisions were made everybody agreed that we need to be more 
involved in pushing the contra cause fitzwater said of the 
meeting i cant say when we will have a decision 
rep mickey edwards rokla said he and other congressmen had 
sought the meeting with reagan out of a concern that the white 
house had given up on the contra issue after multiple setbacks 
earlier this year in the house 
it was necessary i think for some of us to point out that 
with the moscow summit and now the toronto summit and a lot of 
other things occupying the white house that we thought it was 
important that he keep the attention focused on central america as 
well edwards told reporters afterward we have said that we 
thought that more needed to be done to get leadership out of the 
white house 
leaders of the contra resistance were meeting with members of 
congress on capitol hill meanwhile to discuss the possibility of 
a renewal of military aid for the rebels 
house speaker jim wright dtexas issued a statement expressing 
opposition to military assistance house republican leader bob 
michel of illinois a longtime contra supporter indicated a 
reluctance to renew the fight for military aid suggesting that any 
such proposal might face defeat 
the failure of the peace talks produced vitriolic attacks by 
shultz against the sandinistas on tuesday and by nicaraguan 
ambassador carlos tunnermann on extremist elements within the 
contras and the reagan administration 
secretary of state george p shultz blaming the sandinistas for 
the breakdown of the talks said their actions have shown the world 
that their promises of democratization have no counterpart in 
concrete action 
their consistent and apparent goal has been to disarm and 
eliminate the resistance so that they can proceed to consolidate 
their rule in nicaragua shultz said after meeting at the state 
department with the contra leaders 
their kind of rule in nicaragua will never be accepted as 
legitimate by the united states we will stick with the resistance 
freedom fighters their cause of peace with freedom is the right 
cause 
it was not clear what shultz meant when he raised questions 
about the legitimacy of the sandinista government because the 
united states has always been represented in managua by an 
ambassador since the start of the 1979 revolution 
tunnermann in a letter to wright said the contras on the final 
day of the talks introduced an entirely new set of demands and 
insisted that the sandinistas accept them all within two hours 
there can be little doubt that the sole purpose of the 
contras lastminute maneuvering was to insist on demands so 
outlandish and unacceptable that our negotiators would be forced to 
reject them tunnermann said 
still tunnermann and the contras both left the door open to a 
resumption of the negotiations and shultz also indicated support 
for such a solution a ceasefire agreed to in late march is still 
being observed although each side has accused the other of 
violating it 
the rebels were dealt a setback last february 3 when the house 
defeated a proposal by reagan for additional military aid us 
assistance is now limited to humanitarian aid 
the contras share the reagan administrations view that the loss 
of military aid has robbed the rebels of leverage in their 
negotiations with the sandinistas but the administration is wary 
of seeking a new congressional vote on military assistance until 
there is some evidence that majority support can be obtained 
reagan discussed the issue with gop congressional leaders on 
tuesday but no decisions were reached contra leader adolfo calero 
has called for a resumption of military aid

democrat michael dukakis was sounding law and order themes today 
while jesse jackson talked about the budget and said he still 
hadnt surrendered in the presidential battle republican george 
bushs camp said he hasnt decided what to cut to finance his 600 
million educational incentive plan 
jackson talking with leaders of black organizations in 
washington said today the most critical policy item for him 
now is moving the democrats to his budget priorities which include 
increasing taxes on the wealthy and freezing defense spending to 
pay for a variety of social programs 
he told reporters he has no intention of joining the former 
democratic candidates who endorsed dukakis after the massachusetts 
governor won enough delegates to clinch the nomination at next 
months convention they lost and surrendered i did not were 
not in the same category he said 
meanwhile dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas scouted in 
washington for potential dukakis running mates 
campaign and congressional aides said brountas would spend the 
next few days consulting party leaders and others including two 
senators often mentioned as potential vice presidential candidates 
john glenn of ohio and bill bradley of new jersey 
bush confronted with yet another poll giving dukakis a 
doubledigit lead gave no clues tuesday when he was asked whether 
retiring white house chief of staff howard baker might have a place 
on his ticket 
no talk about a vice president bush said its too 
early 
baker said in an interview that you dont turn down requests 
to be on the national ticket but he said of running for vice 
president i do not want to do that i do not expect to do that 
and i think its extremely unlikely i would be asked to do that 
he said he had told bush he was quitting but did not raise the 
issue of whether he might be available as a running mate 
laughingly baker added more important hes never discussed 
that with me 
bushs new campaign press secretary sheila tate was asked 
today on cbstv about the gender gap a reference to polls that 
show the vice president with far more support among men than women 
that seems to be a traditional republican polling problem 
which often disappears when you get close to an election she 
said as the voters male and female focus after the 
conventions that gender gap as we call it will go away 
dukakis on tuesday continued his campaign on the drug issue 
meeting aboard an idled coast guard cutter in south bedford mass 
with members of a local drug task force 
the vessel was idled because of a 55 percent cut in the coast 
guard budget agreed upon by congress and president reagan dukakis 
said the administration must bear most of the blame 
of course congress shares the responsibility he said but 
the leadership has to come from the white house 
dukakis said that he would restore the coast guard funding if 
elected calling the agency the first line of defense against 
drugs 
dukakis had meetings planned today with new york law enforcement 
officials and with new state police recruits he also planned to 
meet with his anticrime council and announce the latest additions 
to the states violent fugitives list 
bush on tuesday laid a cornerstone of his plan to be the 
education president proposing a 500 million recognition program 
with 100000 awards for schools that improve the performance of 
disadvantaged students 
bush also called for awarding states 1 million each for 
experimentation and innovation in areas such as merit pay for 
teachers and yearround schools 
our program for the future must be built around a strategy of 
investing in our children bush said 
charles w greenleaf jr bushs domestic affairs adviser said 
the new proposals outlined on tuesday are by no means all of 
bushs educational plans additional ones will be detailed this 
summer he said 
greenleaf said that the total 600 million pricetag would have 
to be offset by savings in other areas under bushs flexible 
freeze proposal to hold overall federal spending to the rate of 
inflation but no decisions have been made on where those cuts 
would be made 
bush has maintained an upbeat stance in the face of polls 
suggesting he trails dukakis 
the latest of those conducted by gallup for the boston globe 
radio station weei and television station wcvb in boston found 52 
percent support for dukakis and 38 percent for bush results of the 
poll conducted june 1012 among 1005 registered voters had a 
margin of error of four percentage points 
i dont believe in polls at this time i really dont bush 
told reporters tuesday 
the presidential primary season came to its official end tuesday 
in north dakota for all practical purposes it had ended a week 
earlier with races in california new jersey new mexico and 
montana 
because of the late date no democrats bothered to file on the 
republican side bush was opposed by mary jane rachner a retired 
teacher who says the spirits of her late mother and grandmother 
told her to run 
with 16 gop delegates at stake bush who long ago wrapped up 
the gop nomination was piling up 88 percent of the vote

ll bean heiress linda beanjones says 
her decision to spend more than 500000 seeking a republican 
congressional nomination may have backfired 
beanjones was defeated tuesday by edward s omeara an aide to 
gop sen william s cohen returns from 99 percent of the precincts 
in southern maines 1st district showed omeara with 52 percent of 
the vote and beanjones a businesswoman and conservative with 48 
percent 
beanjones granddaughter of outdoors outfitter ll bean spent 
more than 500000 on her losing effort more than 455000 of it 
from her own pocket omeara who credited his win to support by 
republican party regulars spent between 60000 and 65000 a 
spokesman said 
beanjones said the spending gap became a dominant issue in the 
campaign and that her reliance on her wealth seemed to boomerang 
that was the reason that a lot of people gave us as to why 
they are supporting him she said after conceding defeat 
beanjones said voters are not very forgiving of heavy spending 
in a campaign when it so outdistances a challenger 
omeara will face incumbent democratic rep joseph e brennan in

secretary of state george p shultz 
registering concern about terrorism at the olympics said today 
that north korea has placed soviet surfacetoair missiles within 
range of seoul where the summer games will be held 
shultz said he had received assurances from soviet leaders that 
they feel certain there wont be any terrorist acts by their 
north korean allies 
i have no reason to doubt the sincerity of that statement 
shultz said 
but he said north koreans are people you have to keep your eye 
on and we will do so 
shultz made the remarks on the us information agency 
television program worldnet 
he said the missiles had been installed near the demilitarized 
zone and have a range that can go over the seoul area 
shultz said north korean terrorists arranged the murder of half 
of south koreas cabinet ministers on a visit to rangoon burma 
several years ago and also placed a bomb aboard a south korean 
airliner 
certain facts are disturbing he said 
shultz said he expected the leaders of the seven western 
countries to discuss joint measures to combat terrorism at their 
meeting next week in toronto 
as a result of a united stand shultz said terrorism in western 
europe is declining 
he said the seven leaders may agree on a proposal that all 
governments refuse to refuel hijacked planes that have landed on 
their territory with hostages aboard 
its a specific thing that if given broad endorsement might be 
helpful shultz said 
on another subject the secretary dismissed the idea of a 
marshall plan to provide economic assistance to eastern europe 
the countries are very different from each other and they have 
to be thought of country by country 
he said the eastern europeans should be approached 
onebyone to develop trade and other ties with the west as 
they seek to open themselves up 
shultz described president reagans participation in the toronto 
summit meeting as a kind of valedictory since it will be his 
last meeting with the leaders of canada britain france italy 
west germany and japan before leaving office in january 
shultz said the economic picture had brightened considerably 
since the last summit in canada in 1981 with inflation way down 
taxes reduced and growth and incentives increased 
free enterprise is catching on and were going to wind up 
better off shultz said

democrats moved to breathe new life into their 
vetoed trade bill wednesday by splitting off a provision that would 
require large companies to notify employees of plant closings and 
major layoffs 
the bottom line is that were now going to have a trade bill 
without a plantclosings provision house speaker jim wright 
dtexas told reporters 
he said the house would repackage the plantclosings plan as 
separate legislation and act on it before taking up the newly 
refurbished version of its 1000page trade bill 
he also said the plan envisions dropping alaskan oil provisions 
that would have capped exports from the states new refineries at 
70000 barrels a day and 50 percent of output while requiring 
canadianbound crude shipments to detour first to ports in the 
lower 48 states 
president reagan was critical of both the plantclosings and the 
oil provisions in his may 24 veto of the trade bill the house 
subsequently voted to pass the measure notwithstanding his 
objections but the senate on june 8 fell short of the twothirds 
needed for a presidential veto override 
at the core of the bill are provisions to overhaul the system 
under which the united states imposes import curbs to protect us 
industries and retaliate against international trade violations it 
also would grant the administration authority to make deals in 
current global trade talks 
the bill required companies with 100 or more employees to give 
60 days notice of plant closings or largescale layoffs 
other provisions range from substantial agricultural subsidies 
to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies 
senate democrats have been saying they would seek to attach the 
plantclosings provision to any refurbished trade bill sent from 
the house 
there was no immediate word on whether they would go foward with 
that plan or instead redirect their efforts into the separate 
plantclosings bill 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva has been warning 
that any new legislation was likely to become badly bogged down 
some of the administrations supporters in the senate however 
have been eager for another crack at the trade issue before 
lawmakers adjourn to hit the campaign trail 
trade representative clayton k yeutter earlier called for swift 
congressional action on a more moderate version of trade 
legislation and senate minority leader bob dole rkan has been 
suggesting that he might sponsor trade legislation of his own 
were working on it dole said wednesday he said it was 
necessary to get the ethanol provision out of it otherwise 
theres not going to be a trade bill 
one provision criticized by reagan would permit dutyfree 
imports of ethanol from the caribbean a measure hotly opposed by 
midwest corn growers 
aflcio and other labor representatives who have been 
campaigning for the plantclosings provision for 15 years 
buttonholed democratic leaders in a hallway adjacent to the house 
chamber wednesday morning 
at one point rep augustus hawkins dcalif emerged from the 
house chamber where the democratic caucus was meeting in an 
apparent effort to smooth any ruffled feathers they later were 
ushered into wrights office 
wright told reporters he would bring the new freestanding 
version of the plantclosings legislation to the house floor prior 
to action on the refurbished trade bill he said there was a good 
chance a veto of the plantclosings plan could be overridden

as george bush seeks to overcome his negative 
ratings in presidential campaign polls he might draw hope from 
recent history ronald reagan suffered equally low ratings in his 
races and overcame them to win 
but this year there is an important difference poll analysts 
say while reagan won by beating opponents who were viewed even 
less favorably than he was bush faces a far more popular opponent 
in gov michael dukakis 
dukakis has scored high favorable ratings in polls this spring 
though not as high as jimmy carter at his pinnacle of popularity in 
june of the 1976 election year bush has scored poorly though not 
nearly as poorly as carter at his nadir in 1980 
such measures taken by asking if poll respondents have a 
favorable or unfavorable view of candidates provide an important 
guide to votegetting ability a poor score means that theres a 
chunk of people who dont like you said cbs news pollster 
kathleen a frankovic they probably wont vote for you unless 
of course they cant stand the other guy more 
strategists on both sides have focused lately on favorability 
ratings with dukakis campaign spokesman leslie dach contending 
bush was sitting on some of the highest unfavorable ratings of a 
presidential candidate in recent memory 
dach said tuesday he based that claim on gallup poll figures 
but the gallup organization said its past figures are not 
comparable to its current ones because it changed its questions and 
procedures in other comparable polls other candidates have rated 
considerably worse than bush rates now 
still bushs negative rating is high 33 percent favorable to 
35 percent unfavorable in a cbs newsnew york times poll in may 51 
percent favorable to 35 percent unfavorable in a may abc 
newswashington post poll 5340 favorable to unfavorable in a 
gallup poll this week 
contrast the ratings for dukakis 3814 favorable to unfavorable 
in the cbstimes poll 6411 in the abcposts 7020 in gallups 
the general election campaign though hardly has begun were 
looking at where these people are starting out frankovic said 
michael dukakis is starting out very nicely george bush is 
starting out with as many people disliking him as liking him so 
hes got some work to do 
bushs negatives are by no means historic all three candidates 
in the 1980 and 1984 elections reagan carter and walter mondale 
had as bad or worse favorability ratings during their campaigns 
in june 1980 carters cbstimes rating was a dismal 33 favorable 
to 60 unfavorable 
bushs 3335 score in the cbstimes poll was comparable to 
reagans 3838 favorability rating in september 1980 but reagan 
had the advantage of facing carter the unpopular incumbent 
while bush does not have an unpopular opponent there has been 
some movement in dukakis rating he went from 15 percent 
unfavorable in a gallup poll in may to 20 percent unfavorable the 
new gallup poll 
the key issue is not where a candidate stands when considered 
alone but where he stands in relationship to his opponent in 
1976 people liked both of them said frankovic in 1980 they 
really didnt like either of them and in 1984 you had a popular 
incumbent 
even reagans advantage was not apparent from the start in 
january 1984 an abc newswashington post poll gave reagan a 5438 
favorable rating and mondale a 4830 rating but 23 percent didnt 
know about mondale many went against him and he lost in a 
landslide 
as many 25 percent didnt know about dukakis in the abcpost 
poll in may and pollsters noted that his high favorable rating 
came amid positive publicity as he chalked up a string of primary 
victories over jesse jackson 
dukakis has a quarter of the people who have to get to know 
him said kelly hanley an abc news poll analyst bush is going 
to start talking about dukakis record and well see how people 
react to that 
bush with the republican nomination wrapped up was out of the 
news in may with voters not yet focused on the race his rating 
may have been more a reflection of reagans lagging popularity than 
of his own standing 
those negatives dont represent some personal shortcoming with 
george bush as much as some dissatisfaction with the reagan 
administration said larry hugick of the gallup organization 
i dont think people have much of a sense of bush and dukakis yet 
to give a response to these questions 
the issue for the campaigns the analysts said is whether bush 
can establish his own positive identity separate from reagan and 
whether he can capitalize on the publics unfamiliarity with 
dukakis

about 750 barges were backed up on the 
mississippi river near here today because of low water and the 
army corps of engineers said twice as many could be stranded by the 
weekend 
the barges began backing up after one ran aground monday and 
others decided to wait for a dredge to arrive thursday to deepen 
the channel 
they are skittish about using it because one messup costs 
lots of dollars said michael logue spokesman for the corps 
vicksburg district 
the river is only 9 feet deep near vaucluse landing ark about 
3 miles north of the greenville bridge 
logue said about 750 barges were backed up today and that the 
number would probably double during the dredging which is expected 
to take a day or two 
when the dredge gets in and begins working its likely we 
will have to stop traffic off and on this will back up normal 
traffic he said 
logue said the barges could be carrying anything just like 
an interstate highway it could be coal grain steel chemicals 
petroleum products or military cargo they do not normally carry 
perishables 
he said army engineers had no estimate of cargo value involved 
in river shipping by the scores of barge lines that operate on the 
mississippi 
ron goldman chief of water control management for the vicksburg 
district said the mississippi is at its lowest point for this time 
of year since records were first kept in 1872 
he said the vicksburg gauge read 25 feet on tuesday the lowest 
level on record is minus 7 feet in february 1940 when much of the 
upper river froze solid 
without significant rainfall the river will fall below zero on 
the vicksburg gauge within two weeks goldman said with zero on 
the gauge representing 462 feet above mean sea level 
louis logue chief of river operations for the corps vicksburg 
district and michael logues brother said dozens of other trouble 
spots could develop if the river falls as expected 
im talking seriously with the lord about this now he said 
up until now ive just been talking regularly

traditionalist archbishop marcel 
lefebvre heralded the first split in the roman catholic church in 
more than a century with an announcement today that he will 
consecrate four bishops june 30 
the consecration without papal authority seems certain to lead 
to the excommunication of lefebvre and the first schism since the 
old catholics broke from rome in 1870 because they refused to 
accept the dogma of papal infallibity 
in the vatican church spokesman dr joaquin navarro said the 
announcement has serious canonical consequences and make 
inevitable procedures for warning those involved 
the holy see is also following with particular concern the 
faithful who have chosen this option which puts them outside the 
ecclesiastical communion navarro said in the statement 
navarros office said he was unavailable for further comment 
speaking at a news conference lefebvre the 82yearold founder 
of the traditionalist st pius x fraternity announced that these 
four traditionalist priests will be consecrated june 30 
the rev bernard tissier de mallerais secretary general of 
lefebvres fraternity 
the rev richard williamson head of the traditionalist center 
in ridgefield conn 
the rev alfonse de gallereta head of the traditionalist 
center in buenos aires argentina 
the rev bernard felley chief administrator of the fraternity 
a swiss national 
the rupture followed months of efforts pushed by pope john paul 
ii to work out a reconciliation with lefebvre suspended since 1976 
from his priestly functions for revolting against the church 
reforms 
lefebvre holds that modernistic trends condemned by the patron 
saint of his society assumed selfdestructive proportions in 
the reforms instituted by the second vatican council 196365 
he is the only archbishop in the traditionalist movement but 
claims several other bishops share his traditional views 
in defiance of the 1976 order by pope paul vi barring him from 
saying mass and giving the sacraments he has ordained more than 
200 priests they continue to use a 16th century latin rite the 
forbidden tridentine mass 
his movement claims millions of followers throughout the world 
lefebvre has said he would ignore an act of excommunication 
ejection from the church is the vaticans most drastic sanction 
in a 1976 interview with the associated press he said it is 
not we who have entered into schism it is the pope who causes 
schism to the extent to which he breaks with the church 
traditions 
antivatican rhetoric has been less sharp since john paul ii 
became pope but lefebvres announcement last year that he is 
considering the consecration of bishops brought new tension 
he spoke of new evidence that the vatican was plunging into the 
darkness of errors he cited a 1986 meeting pope john paul 
organized with the leaders of many world religions and a 
disappointing response he received from the vatican to 
questions concerning religious freedom 
lefebvre opposes the strengthening of contacts with protestants 
and other christian religions 
true ecumenism consists of trying to bring home the lost 
sheep said the rev franz schmidberger who succeeded lefebvre 
as superior general of the fraternity 
the vatican has made a series of conciliatory gestures 
culminating may 5 with the signing of a protocol that seemed to be 
the basis of an accord it reportedly provided for the recognition 
of lefebvres fraternity and the ordinations in return for a formal 
acceptance of church reforms 
however lefebvre reportedly felt that some points were too 
restrictive proposals for new negotiations were left unanswered by 
the vatican a source in the traditionalist movement said 
lefebvre then told the pope in a letter that he would proceed 
with the consecrations said the source who insisted on anonymity

the senate on wednesday joined the house in 
decreeing that the decision on whether to build the superconducting 
super collider should be made by the next president 
the senate took the position as it voted 925 for its first 
major fiscal 1989 appropriations bill a 1805 billion package to 
finance energy and water development programs in the year beginning 
next oct 1 
the bill totals nearly 300 million more than what the house has 
approved for the army corps of engineers the bureau of reclamation 
and research activities by the energy department 
negotiators from both chambers will have to work out differences 
in the two bills which failed to grant an administration request 
for more than 350 million to begin construction of the 
superconducting super collider envisioned as the worlds most 
powerful atom smasher 
backers of the proposed multibilliondollar highenergy physics 
project say it could carry the nation to new scientific frontiers 
both bills provide 100 million to continue early research on 
the super collider but both specifically forbid any spending to 
start building the facility which could cost 54 billion or more 
appropriations committee leaders on both sides of the capitol 
have said they want the next president to review the project and 
decide whether to seek congressional approval to build it at a 
yetunspecified site 
supporters of the super collider say it is vital if this country 
is to be competitive with other nations in the area of basic 
science and technology opponents argue that the facility could eat 
up money needed by other areas of science 
managers of the bills have agreed that in a time of tight money 
and huge budget deficits there is no money next year for the corps 
and the bureau to start construction of new water projects 
both bills do contain funds to continue construction work on 
dozens of dams harbors and irrigation systems and to operate and 
maintain hundreds of completed water projects 
nearly half the money in both bills or 8 billion is earmarked 
for the energy department for defenserelated nuclear activities 
on tuesday the senate approved its first fiscal 1989 spending 
bill a 17 million package to finance congress next year

members of a truck convoy carrying aid to 
nicaragua were turned away at the mexican border today by us 
customs officials and then formed a human chain to block traffic on 
the principal bridge over the rio grande 
a mexican federal officical broke up the bridge blockade about 
1215 pm 
the blockade began when customs officials detained a convoy 
truck and its driver as he attempted to cross the bridge in 
defiance of federal authorities 
earlier wednesday customs agents stopped the veterans peace 
convoy to nicaragua a block from bridge no 1 and attempted to 
route it to an inspection area other than the one at the bridge 
but the group refused to budge 
were insisting that we be allowed to proceed right up to this 
inspection area as previously agreed upon said gerry condon a 
convoy organizer 
the difference is we know this inspection area thats where 
the media is thats where our supporters are thats the agreement 
we had with them were not going to let them lead us by the nose 
and take us out of sight of people 
one convoy vehicle driven by bob livesey of dorchester mass 
later drove up to the bridge where customs officials refused to 
allow it to turn south toward mexico 
another vehicle driven by hal muskat of san francisco was 
detained about noon 
my instructions are that i am not to allow you to leave 
said james purser chief customs inspector in laredo 
were going to keep on trying to get our vehicles down here to 
the border one at a time condon said 
as police and customs officials stood by the roadblock convoy 
members and supporters sang the song give peace a chance and 
chanted let the convoy pass 
witnesses said a small caravan left the convoy campsite for the 
bridge five miles away shortly before 9 am about 20 supporters of 
the group held signs that said embargo south africa not 
nicaragua and let the convoy pass 
the group must submit to a customs inspection to enter mexico 
customs officials said that the group is being asked to comply with 
normal export procedures and that it has played up the issue to 
attract media attention 
about 200 convoy members and supporters held a rally tuesday 
night at its camp many shouted viva nicaragua libre long 
live free nicaragua when candles were lit during the rally 
which featured leftist folk songs and an appearance by rep mickey 
leland dtexas 
im here to do what i can to see to it that the convoy gets 
across the border and to nicaragua to deliver the humanitarian aid 
that they have leland said 
notables including jesse jackson and actor ed asner also have 
urged the us government to allow it to pass 
leland met earlier tuesday with us customs officials in laredo 
and spoke by phone with treasury secretary james baker trying to 
persuade him to ease the ban on donating vehicles to nicaragua 
said convoy member tom hansen 
about 30 tons of food medicine and clothing are loaded on 38 
vehicles the treasury departments office of foreign assets 
control has told the convoy the cargo may be taken to nicaragua 
but that leaving the vehicles there would violate a trade embargo 
in effect with that leftistruled country for three years 
violating the embargo could result in fines of up to 50000 and 
up to 10 years in prison 
in addition condon said customs officials have told the convoy 
members that if they plan to go to nicaragua without intending to 
return the vehicles within 30 days the vehicles would be seized 
and the drivers subject to arrest 
condon said tuesday the convoy did not intend to violate any 
laws but added that the group was prepared to face a seizure when 
it reached customs at laredos bridge no 1 today 
convoy members contend that the vehicles mostly pickup trucks 
are a form of humanitarian aid exempted from the nicaraguan trade 
control regulations

idahos supreme court today struck down as 
unconstitutional the use of police roadblocks to catch drunken 
drivers 
the 32 decision written by justice robert huntley found the 
roadblocks violated the state constitutions ban on unreasonable 
search and seizure 
in light of the individuals right of freedom from arbitrary 
governmental intrusion and the questionable efficacy of roadblocks 
we conclude that such roadblocks cannot withstand constitutional 
scrutiny huntley wrote 
the decision came on an appeal by david henderson one of 11 
motorists picked up for drunken driving during a twohour roadblock 
operated by boise police on memorial day weekend in 1985 
all motorists approaching the roadblock were briefly stopped for 
evidence of intoxication 
huntley also said there was no authority for stopping motorists 
without evidence of criminal wrongdoing 
a citizen is free to stroll the streets hike the mountains 
and float the rivers of this state without interference from the 
government huntley wrote that is police treat you as a 
criminal only if your actions correspond 
acting justice jesse walters dissented supported by justice 
robert bakes 
he said the need to prevent alcoholrelated accidents by 
deterring drunken driving outweighs the minimal intrusion 
imposed on motorists 
the scales tip in favor of the public welfare he wrote 
and hence justify the systematic nondiscretionary and brief stop 
to check the sobriety of the driver

i do not expect that i do not want that 
and i have signaled that i do not want that to happen said 
howard h baker jr 
baker was talking about the possibility of his being offered the 
republican vice presidential nomination 
he was talking about it in 1980 
cut to 1988 baker the outgoing white house chief of staff is 
asked the same question 
its really something that is presumptuous in the extreme to 
say no i would not do that baker said tuesday but i do 
not want to do that i do not expect to do that and i think its 
extremely unlikely i would be asked to do that 
for 20 years the name of the former gop senate leader from 
tennessee has cropped up as a contender for the patys national 
ticket 
the poor guys been dragged through this more than any human 
should take but maybe the eighth times a charm or however many 
its been says former white house political director mitchell 
daniels jr a longtime baker fan 
others say baker does not appear to be a leading contender to be 
vice president george bushs running mate 
i think they could do a whole lot worse than howard baker but 
i have not heard a lot of speculation about it and i dont see his 
name often mentioned said howard liebengood a key senate staff 
member when baker was majority leader 
baker 62 recalled recently that the first time he was 
mentioned as a possible running mate was in 1968 the year richard 
nixon chose spiro agnew that was just two years after bakers 
election to the senate 
the tennessee senator moved into the national spotlight during 
the senate watergate hearings asking over and over what did the 
president know and when did he know it 
in 1976 he was on then president gerald r fords list of 
potential running mates but was passed over in favor of kansas 
sen bob dole baker supporters blamed his loss on publicity 
following disclosure that bakers wife joy had been hospitalized 
for a drinking problem five years earlier 
baker became senate minority leader in 1977 and ran for the gop 
presidential nomination from that post in 1980 bowing out after 
faring poorly in early primaries that years republican landslide 
made him majority leader but he retired from the senate in 1984 
and set his sights on a bid for the presidency this year he put 
that aside when president reagan asked him to replace donald t 
regan as chief of staff at the height of the irancontra crisis in 
february 1987 
bakers supporters say his assets as a running mate include his 
national stature his southern political base and his appeal to 
independent voters 
he has always been an attractive figure among democrats and 
independents where the vice president needs to make real gains 
said daniels 
possible liabilities include conservative resentment over his 
moderate record in the senate especially his support of the panama 
canal treaties 
he has always been sort of the poster child villain of the 
panama canal treaty debate with certain elements on the right 
said liebengood i would hope he has lived some of that down in 
their eyes but you never know 
bakers tenure as white house chief of staff could bolster his 
credentials with conservatives but hurt his chances among those who 
argue bush should assert his independence from the reagan 
administration 
it cuts both ways said tom korologos a former white house 
aide with strong republican ties its more of a plus except 
there will be the naysayers who say youre not independent 
enough 
baker has stopped short of saying he would not take the 
nomination if offered you dont turn down requests of that sort 
if they are made baker said tuesday 
said daniels as the race continues to come more and more into 
focus some very worthy candidates make less sense and some make 
more and he is one that i think makes very good sense

backers of a north dakota lottery said 
wednesday the issue will probably be put to voters again in 
november despite its second rejection at the polls in 18 months 
theres a very good chance well do it again retired 
businessman gorman king sr said after voters turned thumbs down 
tuesday on a proposed amendment to the state constitution 
final unofficial totals showed the lottery measure had failed 
61082 votes or 58 percent to 44043 votes or 42 percent 
king also was the driving force behind a november 1986 lottery 
initiative which failed 55 percent to 45 percent 
north dakota already had the distinction of being the only state 
to reject a staterun lottery at the polls according to the 
national conference of state legislatures 
former gov arthur link an outspoken foe of all forms of 
gaming said he hoped king would abide by the voters judgment and 
drop his crusade 
it would seem to me a decisive expression of the will of the 
people and i would hope that the proponents would accept the 
decision of the voters of north dakota link said 
link was joined by religious groups and north dakota charitable 
gaming organizations which feared a lottery would cut into their 
gambling take 
kings most recent lottery initiative called for channeling 
lottery profits into the state general fund he expected the north 
dakota game to gross 20 million in its first year with 7 million 
going to the state 
twentysix states including neighboring south dakota and 
montana operate lotteries as does the district of columbia

an increasing number of insurance companies 
are offering substantial premium discounts to the owners of cars 
equipped with air bags the transportation department said 
wednesday 
discounts for personal injury or medical premiums at 12 auto 
insurance companies range from 15 percent to 60 percent on cars in 
which air bags protect the driver in a collision the department 
said 
it cautioned however that the discounts are not available in 
all states they are not permitted in hawaii massachusetts north 
carolina texas illinois and kentucky it said 
the bags are becoming available on an increasing number of cars 
the national highway traffic safety administration estimates that 
by 1990 more than 2 million new cars will have the devices which 
inflate in a split second to protect a driver in a collision 
air bags alone can reduce the chance of fatality in crashes by 
20 to 40 percent and combined with a safety belt can reduce the 
risk by 50 to 55 percent said diane steed head of the highway 
safety agency 
the united states automobile association or usaa offers the 
biggest discount it recently announced a 60 percent reduction in 
personal injury and medical payments and a 300 direct payment for 
the purchase of an air bag 
the air bags have cost up to 800 as an option on some ford 
motor co cars but the prices are expected to go down as a larger 
number of bags are made available 
chrysler corp announced recently that it is installing air bags 
as standard equipment on six 1988 model cars other cars that have 
them as standard equipment are the acura bmw mercedes benz 
porsche and volvo according to the safety agency 
ford has offered the air bag as optional equipment on its ford 
tempo and mercury topaz and may provide them as standard equipment 
on some 1989 model cars general motors corp offers the bags as 
an option on the 1988 oldsmobile delta 88 and plans to offer them 
on additional car lines in 1989 
by 1990 more than 2 million new cars are expected to come off 
the assembly lines equipped with driverside air bags ms steed 
said 
auto safety advocates long have urged the insurance industry to 
offer premium discounts for air bags to help persuade car buyers to 
ask for the devices 
according to the safety agency the following discounts are 
being offered for driverside air bag equipped cars usaa 60 
percent aetna casualty geico continental casualty prudential 
amica all 30 percent nationwide 25 percent allstate state 
farm liberty mutual hartford all 20 percent and travelers 15 
percent 
the air bag which is stored in the steering wheel inflates 
within 120th of a second after electronic sensors detect the 
beginning of impact in a crash it then immediately deflates after 
protecting the drivers head and upper torso

james c miller ii director of the office of 
management and budget said wednesday that responsible employees 
are threatened by having to work with and depend upon coworkers 
who may be impaired by use of illegal drugs 
miller also told a house subcommittee that customers including 
the federal government should not have to wonder whether the 
products they purchase will fail because the workers putting them 
together were high on drugs 
testifying before the house government operations legislation 
and national security subcommittee miller said the reagan 
administration supports efforts to create a drugfree workplace but 
has reservations about legislation before congress including a 
bill by the panels chairman rep jack brooks dtexas 
the brooks bill would require federal contractors and grantees 
to establish a drugfree workplace policy require employees to 
observe that policy and would provide sanctions when that policy 
fails and drug abuse in the workplace occurs the sanctions which 
would be applied under due process requirements include future 
disbarment of contractors who are frequent violators 
miller said he particularly opposed parts of the brooks bill 
which calls for employers and employees to certify that they are 
complying with the law an action he said would require extensive 
new paperwork burdens 
a measure by rep robert s walker rpa would require 
debarment if one employee is convicted of using illegal drugs dale 
e kildee dmich would deprive a grantee or contractor of 
federal contracts and grants if the company fails to make a 
goodfaith effort to keep a drugfree workplace 
miller said he would like to see one measure emerge from the 
several before congress but that the program be flexible enough 
to permit departments and agencies to address the problems they 
face in the most effective way 
he suggested that instead of being specific congress should 
take a broader approach in enacting the law omb could issue 
guidelines for each of the departments and agencies to use in 
promulgating regulations

the pioneer of the polio vaccine 
presented encouraging but preliminary test results wednesday of a 
new vaccine intended to keep people infected with the aids virus 
from getting the disease 
dr jonas salk described the experimental use of his vaccine on 
nine men who had arc or aidsrelated complex a disease that often 
precedes fullblown aids 
although salk made no strong claims about the initial results 
he said they convinced him to begin giving the vaccine to 54 people 
who have been infected with the aids virus but who have not yet 
become ill with arc or aids 
we believe we might possibly get a positive answer he said 
in an interview in stockholm at the fourth international conference 
on aids thats why we set out when nature gives me the answer 
i will tell you 
researchers do not know how many people who are infected with 
the virus will go on to develop aids the most current studies show 
that 48 percent of people will develop aids about 10 years after 
infection and that number may get higher as more time passes 
salk founding director of the salk institute in san diego 
tested the new vaccine with dr alexandra levine and other doctors 
at the university of southern california 
unlike most other vaccines this one is intended to stimulate 
the body to fight off a virus that has already become established 
rather than keep one from getting in 
it involves giving people aids virus that has been killed 
exposed to radiation and stripped of its outer envelope of protein 
this theoretically exposes the immune system to parts of the virus 
that it would not ordinarily see 
if the approach works as planned the body will produce 
antibodies to the viruss inner machinery and kill it 
perhaps we can boost immunity and prevent clinical illness 
said levine we are not talking about curing aids 
the initial study was intended largely to test the vaccines 
safety one of the nine men developed aids a few weeks after the 
innoculation however the other eight are reasonably well and 
working 
levine said most of them are producing and perhaps increasing 
numbers of t cells the blood cells that are attacked and killed by 
the aids virus hiv in the man with the strongest apparent 
reaction the doctors have not been able to detect any sign of the 
aids virus 
they are very encouraging results the virus has disappeared 
in one patient said dr marc girard of the pasteur institute in 
paris 
dr leigh ann sawyer of the us food and drug administration 
cautioned we are very interested in their results but its 
really too early to tell 
most other aids vaccine tests have involved giving people just 
the outer envelope of the virus 
the envelope doesnt seem to be doing anything salk said 
why not use the whole virus thats what i used before in the 
polio vaccine i thought i would try it the oldfashioned way 
dr daniel zagury of the university of paris administered the 
first experimental aids vaccine intended to prevent infection in 
1986 
he gave it to himself and reported evidence wednesday that 
booster shots made from infected and killed blood cells taken from 
his own body can enhance the bodys production of antibodies 
against the virus 
he said his own body has produced high levels of aids 
antibodies some of which are capable of neutralizing the aids 
virus 
what he has done so far is not applicable to large numbers of 
people said dr dani bolognesi of duke university 
zagury said he hopes to find a way to produce a vaccine that 
will not require booster shots made from the recipients own blood 
cells 
he said he also plans to produce large quantities of aids 
antibodies his body produces he hopes to give these to babies born 
to mothers who are infected with the aids virus the goal is to 
kill the virus that may be lurking in their bodies before they also 
become ill 
in other research presented at the meeting 
dr george lemp of the san francisco department of public 
health said that people carry the aids for an average of 11 years 
before getting sick earlier experts had estimated the incubation 
period to be eight years 
dr scott holmberg of the us centers for disease control 
provided more evidence that having genital herpes makes it easier 
to catch the aids virus he found that herpesinfected homosexual 
men who had unprotected sex with aids carriers were two to three 
times more likely to contract the aids virus

the supreme court in a victory for the reagan 
administration and freetrade advocates ruled today the government 
does not have to place restrictions on imported uranium to help 
protect domestic producers of the nuclear fuel 
the unanimous ruling overturned a decision barring federal 
officials from enriching foreign uranium particularly from canada 
and australia for import into the united states 
administration officials had argued that the ban seriously 
jeopardized us trade nuclear cooperation and nonproliferation 
policies and could limit the supply of fuel used to run electric 
utility company nuclear reactors 
todays decision reversed a ruling by the 10th us circuit 
court of appeals based in denver which said last year that the 
department of energy must restrict enrichment of foreign uranim to 
safeguard the deteriorating domestic industry 
justice harry a blackmun in his opinion for the high court 
said federal law does not require the department to restrict 
enrichment unless it is assured such action would maintain a 
viable domestic uranium industry 
federal officials have determined that the industry has not been 
viable since 1983 
the industry has suffered in recent years with the decline of 
nuclear power due to its high cost and concern over safety 
triggered by the accident at the three mile island reactor in 
pennsylvania 
the number of operating uranium mines in the united states has 
dropped from 362 in 1979 to just three in 1986 the industry has 
operated at a loss over the last several years and imports have 
accounted for an increasing share of domestic requirements 
federal energy officials say the us uranium industry has 
collapsed and the government is not required by law to prop it up 
by limiting imports 
in 1983 federal law was amended to require the secretary of 
energy to annually determine if the industry was viable the 
secretary then determined the industry was not viable and the us 
trade representative recommended no action be taken to restrict 
import of uraniium 
uranium must be enriched to serve as nuclear fuel because in its 
natural state it lacks an adequate concentration of a fissionable 
material known as isotope u235 
the enrichment process increases uraniums u235 content from 
less than 1 percent to 3 percent 
the government has a us monopoly in providing enrichment 
services 
federal officials said at least 300 million a year in fees for 
enrichment services was at stake in todays case 
also the justice department said restricting enriched uranium 
from other countries could force up prices of electricity to 
consumers here as supplies of the nuclear fuel dwindle 
the department said also at stake were us trade relations with 
canada and australia the major suppliers of uranium to his country 
finally us officials said barring uranium imports could harm 
nuclear nonproliferation efforts because foreign supliers of 
uranium likely would turn for enrichment services to other nations 
that do not have as strict a nonproliferation polcy as the united 
states 
underscoring todays ruling are conflicts in congress over the 
recently signed uscanada free trade agreement the 
administration recently has begun negotiating an alternative plan 
in which the government would buy guaranteed amounts of domestic 
uranium 
but that plan estimated to cost 750 million from 1989 to 1994 
also faces stiff resistance from house leaders who say it would be 
too costly to the taxpayers 
meanwhile the senate passed a bill in march designed to 
revitalize the domestic uranium industry by imposing a schedule of 
escalating fees on nuclear utilities that load their reactors with 
more than 375 percent of foreign uranium 
that bill has run into stiff opposition in the house 
in todays case the government was opposed by three us 
uranium producers western nuclear inc energy fuels inc and 
uranium resources inc 
the producers were supported by officials from wyoming new 
mexico colorado utah arizona and nevada they said their state 
economies would be hurt by the collapse of the uranium industry 
the case is huffman vs western nuclear 87645

a security guard rescued a giant toad from 
a downtown street and splinted its broken leg with a paint stirrer 
but one wildlife expert suggested the pesky fourpound amphibian 
would be better dead than fed 
jim bartlett 20 found the 9inch greenandbrown toad when he 
got out of his car after seeing an animal that had evidently been 
struck by a vehicle 
i thought it was a dead cat or something i wasnt prepared 
for this bartlett said wednesday holding up the toad he named 
turbo 
wildlife and agriculture officials believe turbo is a bufo 
marinus a giant toxic toad native to coastal areas in south 
america but introduced to south florida in the 1930s to try to 
control the beetle population in sugar cane fields they grow up to 
a foot long and are sometimes found around miami 
i have never heard of one that far north said henry 
mushinsky a biologist at the university of south florida in tampa 
but they are becoming more and more common here in florida the 
fact that we havent had any harsh winters in the last few years 
has helped them move up both coastlines 
wildlife and agriculture officials fear the giant toad could 
become a proliferating pest on the order of the mediterranean fruit 
fly the formosan termite or the south american fire ant 
if he found several dozen then we would be concerned said 
lt john moran a wildlife inspector at the state game and 
freshwater fish commission office in orlando 
one agricultural specialist whom bartletts mother mary 
contacted suggested that their turbo would be better dead than fed 
i cant see killing something that hasnt done anyone any 
harm said bartlett who has tried to nurse turbo to health 
bartlett said he would turn over the toad to the central florida 
zoo senior reptile keeper carl barden will examine it 
bufo marinus has glands near its eyes containing a strong poison 
that can cause temporary blindness in humans if the fluid comes 
into contact with the eyes the white secretion also can kill small 
animals including cats and dogs that eat the toad 
turbo is showing signs of a pet personality the bartletts said 
he seems to like affection said mrs bartlett when you 
stroke his back he pushes himself up and moves around like a cat

treasury secretary james a baker iii told 
congress on wednesday that the united states will lose its veto 
over major decisions of the world bank unless it puts up 70 
million to join in increasing the banks capital 
i think it would be absolutely catastrophic if we withheld our 
cooperation and lost the veto right that now exists he said at a 
hearing of the house banking committee 
he argued that the world bank the largest source of aid to the 
third world helps countries like argentina and mexico which are 
important to us national security but get no direct aid from the 
united states 
the us veto right affects only major changes in the bank 
which is owned by 151 countries the united states has the largest 
voting strength about 15 percent this would be diluted if it 
failed to take up the shares allotted to it in the current general 
increase of its capital which is already 79 percent susbcribed 
baker said only 11 countries have so far failed to take up their 
shares including the united states among them are libya cambodia 
and vietnam 
one world bank official spokesman peter riddleberger has 
suggested that japan could became the largest single stockholder 
that would force the bank to shift its headquarters to tokyo after 
44 years in washington 
the us veto does not apply to individual loans which total 
17 billion a year the increased capital will enable it to loan 
well over 20 billion annually in the 1990s 
baker said the united states has opposed individual loans to 
some members of the bank that have communist governments in some 
cases the united states was outvoted in others the us 
representative supported loans to yugoslavia poland and hungary 
but not in the past three years he added

four years of providing clean syringes 
and needles to drug addicts in amsterdam has produced a significant 
drop in needle sharing and may have helped curb the spread of aids 
researchers said wednesday 
furthermore the needle exchange program did not lead to 
increased drug use as critics of such programs had feared said 
ernst buning a psychologist with the amsterdam municipal health 
service in the netherlands 
speaking at the fourth international conference on aids buning 
said the program gave health workers an opportunity to tell addicts 
how to lower their aids risk and the counseling was a critical 
component of the exchange program 
our conclusion is that the needle and syringe exchange helps 
addicts to use drugs safely he said 
the first us needle exchange program will begin soon in 
portland oregon under the sponsorship of the american foundation 
for aids research 
the foundation announced the program last week and said it was 
designed to determine if needle exchanges curb the spread of aids 
among addicts 
in a separate report to the conference don des jarlais of the 
new york state division of substance abuse services said 
drugrelated aids cases in the united states are increasingly 
linked to cocaine rather than heroin he said the trading of sex 
for drugs among crack users created the potential for further 
catastrophe by spreading the epidemic 
drugrelated aids is also spreading to parts of the developing 
world where illicit drug shipments originate des jarlais said 
the reason for the growing link between aids and cocaine 
injection may be partly due to the frequency with which cocaine 
users must inject themselves des jarlais said 
heroin users may inject themselves three or four times per day 
des jarlais said but cocaine users may inject themselves as often 
as every 15 minutes until their cocaine supply is exhausted he 
said 
that can lead to almost continuous sharing of drug injection 
equipment and a much greater likelihood of viral transmission he 
said 
the needle exchange program in amsterdam reaches about 5000 of 
the citys 7000 intravenous drug abusers buning said last year 
700000 needles and syringes were exchanged he said 
interviews with 148 intravenous drug abusers showed that about 
half of them were participating in the needle exchange using clean 
needles 90 percent of the time buning said the other half 
participated in the program rarely or not at all he said 
among those participating only 10 percent were sharing needles 
and at highest risk of aids buning said 
among nonparticipants 24 percent were sharing needles he said 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in 
which a virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers 
the disease is transmitted primarily through sexual contact and 
the sharing of needles and syringes by drug abusers various 
reports at the aids conference have identified drugrelated aids as 
one of the most rapidly growing components of the aids epidemic 
other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted 
blood or blood products and the passage of the disease from mother 
to child at or before birth 
the spread of aids among cocaine abusers which des jarlais said 
has been observed in new york city and san francisco is also of 
concern because of the difficulty of treating cocaine addiction 
des jarlais said 
as of june 6 the us centers for disease control had reports 
of 64506 cases of aids in the united states 11914 of which or 
18 percent were among nonhomosexual intravenous drug abusers 
des jarlais noted the hopeful sign that the overall spread of 
aids among drug abusers appears to be slowing in san francisco 15 
percent to 20 percent of cocaine and heroin abusers have been 
infected with the virus but that figure has not increased for 
about 18 months he said 
in new york city 55 percent to 60 percent of the drug abusers 
are infected and that figure has been stable for about three 
years he said 
we have seen substantial behavior change in a variety of 
cities des jarlais said

france fulfilled a pledge made in a deal for 
release of the last three french hostages in lebanon by announcing 
it will resume diplomatic relations with iran on thursday 11 
months after breaking them 
announcements made wednesday in both paris and tehran said 
ambassadors will be exchanged soon 
how far france went to meet conditions set by iran for 
reestablishment of relations was not clear immediately ten french 
hostages were freed at intervals over a twoyear period of fitful 
negotiations 
jean gueguinou chief foreign ministry spokesman indicated the 
decision would not hinder frances friendship with iraq with which 
iran has been at war since september 1980 iran has demanded 
neutrality from france which is iraqs main western arms supplier 
a ministry statement said the government of the french 
republic and the government of the islamic republic of iran have 
agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations beginning june 16 
1988 they have also agreed to exchange ambassadors shortly 
years of stormy relations preceded the break in relations july 
17 1987 after iranian embassy employee wahid gordji refused to 
turn himself in for questioning about a series of bombings in paris 
nearly a year earlier 
iran has been trying to break out of its diplomat isolation the 
last barriers to renewed relations with france were removed in the 
deal made with former premier jacques chiracs conservative 
government for release of the last three french hostages held by 
proiranian groups in lebanon 
journalist jeanpaul kauffmann and diplomats marcel carton and 
marcel fontaine were freed days before the may 8 presidential 
election in a move largely viewed as an electoral ploy 
chirac was the conservative candidate and lost to president 
francois mitterrand a socialist who won a second sevenyear term 
in welcoming the three men home may 5 chirac thanked iran for 
its role in the releases and said relations could be restored 
mitterrand ordered the process set in motion two weeks later 
michel rocard the new socialist premier said his government found 
no written record of the hostage deal but declared france gave 
its word it will be kept for that which is known 
french and iranian emissaries met in geneva to work out what 
gueguinou the foreign ministry spokesman said were technical 
details and a timetable suggesting that essential issues were 
dealt with earlier 
he said renewing ties does not imply any change in french 
policy in regard to the problems of the region 
chirac had made the freeing of french hostages a top priority 
and the series of releases prompted charges that his government 
dealt with the terrorists holding western hostages in lebanon 
eighteen foreigners still are captives in lebanon including 
nine americans held longest is terry a anderson 40 chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
iran had made normal diplomatic relations the price of using its 
influence with the groups holding french hostages 
as conditions for restoring ties iran demanded that france 
repay with interest a 1 billion loan the late shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi made for a nuclear plant stop harboring dissident 
iranians and be neutral in the iraniraq war ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis fundamentalist regime overthrew the shah in february 
1979 
in june 1986 after one french hostage was freed france 
expelled massoud rajavi he leads the peoples mujahedeen of iran 
the main armed opposition group and now is based in iraq 
france expelled 17 mujahedeen supporters to gabon in december 
1987 after two more hostages were freed but the expulsions later 
were revoked because of public pressure 
two payments were made on the loan in 1986 and 1987 coinciding 
in each case with the release of a french hostage 
then came the dispute over gordji which developed into 
embassy war in which the authorities in each capital besieged 
the others embassy 
on nov 29 two days after two more french hostages were 
released gordji was allowed to return to tehran in exchange for 
paul torri first secretary of the french embassy whom the 
iranians had accused of spying

a mass funeral was scheduled friday 
for 13 of the 44 decomposing bodies found last week at funeral home 
closed by state regulators after they found the corpses stacked in 
a closet 
in addition to the 44 bodies 26 boxes of cremated remains were 
found at the howell morning glory funeral chapel officials said 
the medical examiners office on tuesday turned over remains to 
the hardagegiddens funeral homes for the mass funeral the names 
of the dead have not been released because next of kin are still 
being notified said ronald l giddens executive vice president of 
hardagegiddens 
state inspectors found eight decomposing bodies in a routine 
check of the howell mortuary june 6 they received permission from 
the owner lewis j howell to search the funeral home and 
discovered the other bodies many stacked in a closet 
although some of the remains were recent a death certificate 
showed one body had been dead since july 1978 said dr peter 
lipkovic the city medical examiner 
since 1979 howell received 200749 for burial and cremation of 
indigents receiving 400 for each adult burial and 100 for 
cremation 
it was not known however if the decomposing remains belonged to 
indigents on tuesday virgil green director of jacksonvilles 
welfare division said a member of his staff witnessed all indigent 
services 62 burials and three cremations this year and about 70 
burials last year 
the florida timesunion quoted howell last week as saying it was 
paperwork not money problems that caused the delay in burials 
repeated calls to howells home and the mortuary for additional 
comment have gone unanswered 
meanwhile city accounting records show that several thousand 
dollars in city funds meant to cover the costs of indigent burials 
and cremations were paid directly to the small business 
administration to help howell repay a loan howell had apparently 
defaulted on the loan and in 1984 the city paid 5000 to the sba 
in exchange for howells burying 10 bodies in august and september 
of that year said louise squayars who manages the payable 
accounts for the city finance department 
riverside memorial park cemetery which is owned by service 
corp international the parent firm of hardagegiddens has agreed 
to donate up to 37 burial plots giddens said giddens said 
hardagegiddens will get 400 for each burial

the house interior committee approved 
legislation wednesday to strip top political appointees in the 
interior department of daytoday control over the national park 
service 
the bill reflecting increasing displeasure among committee 
democrats with the reagan administrations handling of the national 
parks was cleared for floor action by a 2514 partyline vote 
the legislation would make the park service director a 
presidential appointee subject to senate confirmation a director 
would serve a fiveyear term could be removed only by cause and 
would have to be knowledgable about managing natural and cultural 
resources 
currently the director is appointed by the interior secretary 
serves at the secretarys pleasure and is directly answerable to 
the assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks both are 
political appointees 
the plans principal advocate rep bruce vento dminn said 
the move would elevate the stature of the services director 
putting that official on a more equal footing with the current 
supervisors 
the bill also would create a threemember park system review 
board appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate the 
board would advise the director and congress on how to improve the 
park system 
budgeting for national parks would continue to be done through 
the interior department but the park service director would have 
more direct access to the white house and congress according to 
advocates of the changes 
vento says the changes are needed to counter years of 
encroachment on park service professionals by political appointees 
in democratic and republican administrations 
but a background statement on the bill by ventos national parks 
and public lands subcommittee cited activities during the reagan 
administration as reasons why the legislation should be enacted 
the reasons included 
political appointees were substituted for professionals at 
various levels and at different times including the deputy 
director of the park service 
the assistant secretarys office changed performance ratings 
of professional employees for political reasons 
the assistant secretarys office forced the resignation of 
one regional director and forced the demotion of another for 
political reasons 
park service personnel appearing before house committees 
present testimony written by lowlevel political appointees in the 
assistant secretarys office that rarely reflects the professional 
views of the park service 
vento said the situation has reached the point that park service 
director william penn mott is not allowed to use the word 
threats in discussing problems faced by units of the park 
system 
the interior department opposes the bill noting that the 
justice department considers it an unconstitutional infringement on 
the separation of executive and legislative branch powers 
this bill is not going to go anywhere said rep don young 
of alaska the ranking republican on the interior committee

israeli soldiers will be shown a film 
documenting their abuses of reporters and arabs in the occupied 
lands to discourage such behavior and show troops how news reports 
of brutality damage israels image 
the 22minute army film entitled the camera sees all shows 
disturbing images of troops responding to stonethrowing by beating 
arabs vandalizing their shops and tying palestinian children to 
jeeps 
the images prove there is no law and order and that the army 
has lost control narrator michael karpin of israel television 
says in the film 
the army showed the film to foreign journalists on wednesday at 
the militarys main headquarters in tel aviv 
army officials said commanders were ordered this week to show 
the film to all soldiers serving in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
these pictures will be shown by the media over and over 
again around the world they show exceptional behavior which does 
us much damage narrator michael karpin of israel television says 
in the film 
do not make the cameraman put you on stage you are not an 
actor western television especially in the united states works 
by the principle of getting a picture at any price if the reporter 
is treated well he will give a balanced account karpin said 
the movie was made in response to dozens of incidents in which 
soldiers have been filmed vandalizing photographers equipment 
speaking harshly to foreign newsmen and beating arabs during the 
sixmonth palestinian uprising in the occupied territories 
the foreign press association has complained of 150 cases of 
physical abuse of foreign journalists since the unrest began dec 
8 according to united nations figures 208 palestinians have been 
killed and two israelis have died in the rebellion 
this film will have a swift shocking effect on soldiers 
because the tough pictures show exactly what they have done 
wrong said col raanan gissin an army spokesman 
the message is we dont want bad pictures you can minimize 
them if you behave correctly gissin said 
in the film karpin urges soldiers not to cover camera lenses to 
try to prevent pictures from being taken and elite golani troops 
show how to politely steer reporters away from areas declared 
closed military zones 
the film tries to boost the image of foreign reporters by saying 
their reports are usually fair and professional it shows a foreign 
cameraman helping weeping israeli teenagers in the west bank 
village of beita after a clash between jewish settlers and 
villagers in which an israeli girl was killed 
the movie also runs through half a dozen of some of the worst 
incidents of brutality since the uprising began 
it shows jewish settlers chasing arab schoolgirls with their 
pistols drawn a soldier smashing the windows of a 
palestinianowned clothing shop and a trooper dragging an arab 
detainee by the hair and banging his head into a metal door 
another scene shows an incident filmed by the american cbs 
network in the west bank city of nablus in february showing 
soldiers beating arab youths detained for stonethrowing 
this is an extremely deviant incident karpin says the 
soldiers beat two detainees for 30 minutes 
the censor can ban pictures which are damaging to state 
security but the censor cannot ban transmission of a picture 
of a soldier beating an arab passerby karpin says 
western reporters will stress these pictures in their reports 
because television around the world stresses the unusual the 
narrator adds 
the film also shows riot police breaking up protests in south 
korea and the united states in the 1960s with karpin saying 
viewers are used to seeing pictures of force used to quell 
violence 
but karpin says western viewers are not used to seeing images 
of troops beating unarmed arabs or accosting foreign journalists 
these only make the viewer sympathize with the party who is done 
harm

george bush on wednesday blamed his poor 
showing in recent public opinion polls on a primary season filled 
with democratic candidates shooting at you every single day and 
held out the possiblity that he might name a woman as his running 
mate 
the vice president in an interview also said that while he 
would pursue president reagans efforts for the rebel contra forces 
in nicaragua id want to do it practically to see lets be sure 
what we do will pass 
the adminstration has repeatedly encountered broad congressional 
opposition to its attempts to provide military assistance to the 
contras 
and while the allbutcertain republican nominee said he wasnt 
advocating a change in direction from that policy he suggested he 
would try to work more closely with congress 
id love to find a way to take a package to the hill and get 
it passed bush said 
bush insisted that he still hasnt given thought to a possible 
running mate saying he will wait until after the democratic 
national convention in atlanta july 1821 
the number one criterion is will this person be capable of 
taking over if something happend to the president enough 
experience enough stature to do that but having said that man 
or woman i would say look the gender question was crossed when 
geraldine ferraro went on the democratic ticket in 1984 
and that was a good thing a very good thing he said 
asked if he would name a woman if polls suggested such a ticket 
would help him bush said anyone who would help me in the polls 
would be a factor a man or a woman 
recent polls also show bush receiving high negative ratings but 
the vice president said i think the answer on the polls is if 
there are negatives there to turn them into positives by getting 
out what i feel on the issues 
but when youre sitting out there in a primary process with 
two candidates shooting at you every single day and a lot of 
editorial media attention on controversial matters i think it 
would be surprising if things were any different he said 
so i feel fairly relaxed about that i think we have time to 
be sure that a positive image is out on who i am and what i feel 
and where ill take the country and ill readily concede that some 
of thats not that clear yet he said 
bush said that his gender gap problem the fact that his 
support is much weaker among female voters than among male voters 
should narrow in time as he speaks out on what i feel on peace 
and some of the issues that may disproportionately concern women 
the vice president said he intends to address the issue in 
campaign advertising and seek out prominent republican women to 
speak in his behalf 
however bush said he did not intend to go off to some extreme 
position in order to try to rectify what might be a gender gap 
just spell out your concerns people are interested in the 
family ive got a good one i dont think we get credit for how we 
manage family values yet and what really motivates me and caring 
and compassion and all of that stuff he said 
bush also said that while he doesnt plan to overdo his efforts 
to depict dukakis as an ultraliberal elitist for fear that it 
might backfire ive got to get peoples attention bush said 
he would mix rhetoric against the democratic candidate with 
precise facts 
in a wideranging interview bush also called for an aggressive 
investigation into allegations of bribery and fraud in the defense 
department 
it is essential that we get to the bottom of that whatever it 
is where there is smoke over there see what fire is there and 
clean that up it is our commitment to getting rid of waste fraud 
and abuse that is leading to some of this inquiry he said 
the fbi disclosed tuesday that its investigators bugged pentagon 
offices over a nearly twoyear period before staging coordinated 
raids there and at the office of defense contractors in 12 states 
the steps were part of a massive investigation of alleged fraud 
bribery and bidfixing in military purchasing 
bush said that if elected he would set up a presidential task 
force on urban affairs with a membership made up primarily of 
mayors 
he made the proposal in a letter to the us conference of 
mayors which is meeting this week in salt lake city we need to 
forge a new relationship i intend to be an activist president 
involved in helping you to find solutions bush said 
though massive amounts of federal aid are not available my 
goal is to shape a federal role that serves as a catalyst to help 
the cities solve their problems he said in the letter 
he also said he would not make any structural changes in the 
office of vice president such as having the vice president head a 
department that would be bad government former president 
gerald ford proposed making him the vice president chief of 
staff but i dont agree with that either 
bush has proposed making the vice president head of the 
administrations antidrug efforts

syria could use its military might to pressure 
proiranian factions to release american hostages in lebanon but 
the move might backfire against the captives lebanons ambassador 
to the united states said wednesday 
asked if syria could do more to bring about the release of the 
hostages abdallah bouhabib said physically the answer is yes 
politically i dont know 
proiranian shiites believed to hold nine american hostages in 
lebanon might take reprisals against their captives if pressed too 
hard by the syrians bouhabib said at a briefing for reporters 
late last month syrian troops ringed the area of south beirut 
where the hostages are thought to be held but did not try to gain 
their release 
bouhabib said his only information about the hostages was that 
they were alive in beiruts southern suburbs under the control of 
the hezbollah faction and iranian guards 
the ambassador said he disapproved of negotiating with the 
captors because that course spawned additional seizures he blamed 
iran for the hostagetaking that is irans brand of diplomacy 
he said 
bouhabib said he had no knowledge of a report that the united 
states had sent an envoy to beirut to seek the hostages release 
state department spokesman charles redman said he would have no 
comment on the report that appeared in the guardian newspaper in 
london 
i just stay with our position that we dont talk about 
operational questions redman said 
the guardian quoting shiites sources in beirut it did not 
identify said the envoy returned to lebanon last sunday for a 
second round of secret talks with hezbollah the article did not 
name the envoy 
terry anderson an associated press correspondent is the 
longestheld american hostage in lebanon he was captured in march 
1985 
the only concrete solution to ending hostagetaking bouhabib 
said is to restore order to strifetorn lebanon where both the 
syrians and the israelis have a military presence 
the lebanese are committed to the removal of all foreign forces 
from their country but they recognize that syria will always play 
a role in their future 
lebanese president amin gemayel who has been working for 
constitutional reform that would reconcile various factions in 
lebanon does not intend to seek reelection when his term expires 
in september 
constitutional reform has been put on the back burner until 
after lebanons parliament elects a new president sometime between 
july 23 and sept 23 bouhabib said 
at least 12 people are seeking to succeed gemayal

the leading industrial democracies plan to 
take joint steps against terrorism and to assist third world debtor 
nations at their eocnomic summit next week in toronto 
exercising the noplacetohide doctrine the united states 
and its six partners are expected to call on nations worldwide to 
deny refueling to airplane hijackers secretary of state george p 
shultz said wednesday 
the idea is to prevent hostageholders from taking off with 
their victims shultz said in a us information agency telecast 
and at a white house news conference 
its a specific thing that if given broad endorsement might be 
helpful he said 
shultz said joint action at past economic summit meetings had 
helped send terrorism into a decline in western europe although he 
said there also were indications it might be on the rise elsewhere 
sharing the white house platform with shultz treasury secretary 
james a baker iii predicted theres going to be real action on 
economic issues including decisions to ease the debt burden of 
subsaharan african nations 
also baker said president reagan and the leaders of canada 
britain france italy japan and west germany would consider 
cooperative measures to prevent drug dealers from laundering their 
profits through legitimate banks and ways for governments to share 
intelligence information on narcotics 
on another front however shultz indicated the united states 
would resist any attempt to impose stiffer economic sanctions 
against south africa because of its racial policies

americas defense contractors will soon be 
ordered to provide a drugfree workplace for their 32 million 
employees defense secretary frank c carlucci told congress on 
wednesday 
carluccis announcement came as he and the nations uniformed 
military leaders voiced strong opposition to new moves by congress 
to increase the pentagons role in the countrys effort to halt the 
use of illegal drugs 
the hundreds of defense contractors would be required to develop 
extensive education programs about the dangers of drugs and 
employees with security clearances could also be required to 
undergo mandatory drug testing carlucci said 
an estimated 3 million workers on pentagon contracts have 
security clearances of various types carlucci did not say if the 
testing would be required of all employees with clearances or just 
those with the more sensitive access clearances 
the nations 21 million uniformed military personnel are now 
subject to random mandatory drug testing carlucci told a pair of 
congressional panels those tests have been a key factor in sharply 
reducing drug abuse among the military services 
we have told our soldiers that drugs will not be tolerated in 
the military and reported drug use has decreased at least 67 
percent since 1980 carlucci said ask our commanders and they 
will tell you that drug testing works 
he said that it would be my intent to issue the regulation 
covering contractors but did not say exactly when the order will 
be made 
carlucci testified before an unusual joint meeting of the house 
and senate armed services committees which are now trying to work 
out a compromise version of a pentagon budget bill for the fiscal 
year starting oct 1 
in its version of the bill the house voted to tell reagan to 
order the pentagon to essentially seal the us borders against 
illegal drug trafficking 
the senate bill did not go quite as far but it did require the 
pentagon to provide more intelligence help to civilian antidrug 
agencies and also granted arrest powers to navy officers aboard 
warships which stop suspected drug boats in international waters 
none of the interdiction approaches in and of themselves 
will work carlucci said i believe that these are not 
solutions to the problem but rather the result of our rising 
frustration at our inability to find a real solution 
he said i remain absolutely opposed to the assignment of a 
law enforcement mission to the department of defense i am even 
more firmly opposed to any relaxation of the posse comitatus 
restrictions on the use of the military to search seize and 
arrest 
i have discussed this matter with the president and other 
senior members of his cabinet and i can report that these views are 
shared throughout this administration he said 
carlucci was referring to the posse comitatus act an 1878 law 
which bars the military from enforcing civilian laws congress 
amended the law in 1981 to permit the military to take a limited 
role in the antidrug effort but the current proposals would 
provide new exemptions to the law 
our armed forces should not become a police force nor can we 
afford to degrade readiness by diverting badly needed resources 
from their assigned missions carlucci said 
air force gen robert t herres vice chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff said there were a number of myths which he 
said gave rise to the belief that the us military could halt drug 
shipments 
the first myth is that our defense forces include a seamless 
network of radars along the border that could spot all ships and 
planes he said we have a lot of holes in our air defense system 
there are all kinds of ways for planes to penetrate our 
borders 
another myth is that detecting enemy fighters and drug planes 
is similar he said explaining that soviet jets and bombers 
generally fly high and fast compared to drug planes that travel 
much more slowly and closer to the water or ground 
asking the military to seal the borders is an unrealistic 
expectation and a mission the armed forces cannot accomplish under 
any foreseeable rules of engagement for within our own borders 
in another development wednesday the house foreign affairs 
committee approved legislation giving the government new authority 
to withhold us military and economic aid from countries suspected 
of involvement in drug trafficking 
the bill also would require the secretary of state to revoke the 
passports of us citizens convicted of violating drug laws

the jury hearing former gov evan mechams 
criminal trial began deliberations today after hearing the 
prosecution describe him in closing arguments as a liar who blames 
others for his failure to report a 350000 campaign loan 
prosecutor barnett lotstein who was likened to a guard at 
auschwitz on tuesday by defense attorney michael scott said 
scotts comment came from the desperation of the defense to 
create an aura in the courtroom because the facts do not support 
their theory 
im not guilty of anything neither is willard mecham said 
as he entered court 
mecham and his brother willard are accused of concealing the 
350000 loan on financial statements required by the state the 
defense has contended the loan was properly reported as part of a 
465000 lump sum listed as a contribution from mecham 
lotstein told the jurors tuesday that mechams attorney gave a 
laundry list of excuses but no valid explanation why the former 
governor and his brother failed to report the loan on financial 
reports required by the state 
lotstein bitterly criticized scott for comparing him and 
coprosecutor michael cudahy both assistant attorneys general to 
the guards at the nazi death camp 
earlier tuesday scott contended that attorney general bob 
corbin sought charges against the mechams to boost his own 
political ambitions 
perhaps i shouldnt be so hard on my colleagues lotstein and 
cudahy because like the guards at auschwitz theyre just doing 
their job scott told the court 
lotstein termed the statement a vicious personal attack and 
added its not a new tactic its used when you dont have 
anything else to say 
willard mechams lawyer joe keilp contended the prosecution 
had sought to prove its case by innuendo not evidence 
how dare they try to sell you this shoddy merchandise and tell 
you its the truth keilp said the only scheme to defraud in 
this case has been perpetrated by the prosecution in trying to 
get you to convict these men 
cudahy told the maricopa county superior court jury that mecham 
desperately needed the loan from developer barry wolfson to keep 
his 1986 gubernatorial campaign afloat however he said mecham 
felt he could not make the loan public because it would destroy his 
campaign theme of being beholden to no one 
evan mecham never had any intention of disclosing the wolfson 
loan said cudahy who claimed the loan was hidden in a campaign 
financial report as part of afabricated 465000 lump sum 
listed as a contribution from mecham further the prosecutor 
pointed to a letter in which mecham promised wolfson the loan would 
remain confidential as well as a receipt that was written a 
month later and listed a 350000 personal contribution from evan 
mecham 
scott contended that the charges were based on the slimmest of 
all evidence he insisted there was no motive to conceal wolfson 
as the source of the loan because the financial report on which the 
loan would have appeared was filed after the election 
scott noted that mecham could have been charged under another 
state law that makes false campaign finance reporting a 
misdemeanor but a misdemeanor is not good enough for bob corbin 
and his henchmen 
keilp said willard mecham is not the most sophisticated 
bookkeeper in the world and filled out the financial statements 
the best he knew how 
but lotstein contended that willard mecham lied when he told the 
state grand jury he had never seen the letter in which mecham 
promised wolfson the loan would remain confidential 
mecham was charged with six felony counts of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents and faced from almost nine 
to 22 years in prison if convicted of all charges 
willard mecham who was his brothers campaign treasurer faced 
three similar counts and up to 9 years in prison if convicted of 
all charges 
mecham a republican took office in january 1987 and was 
removed april 4 when the state senate convicted him of two 
unrelated charges he also was impeached in connection with the 
loan but the senate decided not to hear that charge for fear of 
prejudicing his criminal trial

a nationwide communist party conference will 
discuss the soviet unions ethnic troubles but probably wont 
consider armenias demand to annex a region of a neighboring 
republic two delegates said wednesday 
the party conference that begins june 28 is to take up a series 
of theses approved by the party central committee last month 
including a statement calling for more attention and compromise on 
difficult ethnic problems 
about 5000 party members will gather in moscow against a 
backdrop of continued tension between armenia and azerbaijan over 
control of the nagornokarabakh region 
the issue of nationality relations will be debated at the 
party conference vladimir kluyev a moscow party official told 
reporters at a news conference sponsored by the government news 
agency novosti 
but kluyev head of the party organization in the lenin region 
of moscow said he would be against reviewing a demand to allow 
armenia to annex nagorno karabakh from azerbaijan 
otto latsis deputy editor of the theoretical journal kommunist 
said it is necessary to discuss national relations and what is 
being done and what is going to be done at the party conference 
but the specific dispute between azerbaijan and armenia should not 
be brought up 
the supreme soviet of armenia approved a request wednesday to 
annex nagornokarabakh and armenian activists said they are 
waiting for a response from moscow officials in the capital 
already have turned down the request 
a general discussion of ethnic problems at the party conference 
is unlikely to satisfy ethnic armenians in nagornokarabakh and in 
armenia who have rejected a special government aid package for 
nagornokarabakh as insufficient 
when communist party authorities rejected the armenian 
annexation request in february strikes and bloody ethnic violence 
occurred in armenia and azerbaijan on feb 28 riots broke out in 
the azerbaijani city of sumgait and 32 people mostly armenians 
were killed 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has called for a meeting of 
the policymaking central committee to discuss ethnic questions 
which he described as one of the countrys most crucial issues 
the theses for the party conference approved by the central 
committee said that interethnic relations require constant 
attention as does the progress of every ethnic entity 
interethnic issues shall be settled on the basis of genuine 
democracy in the spirit of perestroika gorbachevs effort to 
restructure the economy the theses say 
they called for development of a policy that would satisfy 
ethnic interests while subordinating them to a spirit of equality 
among all ethnic groups

legislation giving the government new 
authority to withhold us military and economic aid from countries 
suspected of involvement in drug trafficking was approved on 
wednesday by the house foreign affairs committee 
the bill also would require the secretary of state to revoke the 
passports of us citizens convicted of violating drug laws 
described as containing a series of modest new initiatives 
the legislation will be included in a more comprehensive bill to be 
considered by the full house later in the year

to give specific authority to the agency for international 
development to withhold economic and military aid from countries or 
individuals known or believed to be involved in narcotics 
trafficking 
the bill also is intended to eliminate confusion in present law 
on preventing aid from flowing to socalled drug transit

making the secretary of state the coordinator of all overseas 
antinarcotics assistance 
waiving present law to permit providing weapons to foreign 
police units for antinarcotics purposes only 
creating a special aid package for colombia which is struggling 
with powerful narcotics cartels 
exploring the possibility of working with the organization of 
american states to create a multinational regional antinarcotics 
force 
rep dante fascell dfla the committee chairman said that 
while the bill does not substantially increase spending for the war 
on drugs it does provide incentives for cooperating countries to 
do more to help us

because of kidnapping threats following the states closure of a 
baptist boarding home for troubled youths

happen the term children and my daughter was specifically 
mentioned threats of kidnapping and putting her in a home 
where she would never be found again he said 
brittain said his daughter brandi was moved about a week ago 
after he had received three calls with specific kidnapping threats

nancy reagan offered a bit of advice to her 
successor on wednesday warning the next first lady that she will 
experience her greatest thrills and her greatest heartaches 
while in the white house 
life has been so magnified here the first lady said 
sometimes its been hard to comprehend what living in this house 
really means the day you come through the white house gates your 
life somehow becomes larger than life 
mrs reagan addressed more than 100 women at the annual senate 
wives luncheon she traditionally holds at the executive mansion 
along with wives of most of the nations senators one possible 
sucessor as first lady vice president george bushs wife barbara 
was present and seated next to mrs bush was elizabeth dole the 
wife onetime presidential candidate senate minority leader bob 
dole of kansas 
looking back over her eight years in the white house the first 
lady said shed experienced a rollercoaster of emotions ranging 
from the first inauguration to the absolute terror of the march 
30 1981 assassination attempt on president reagan 
mrs reagan noted that within the space of a single week 
recently shed visited the kremlin with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and his wife raisa buckingham palace with queen 
elizabeth 10 downing street with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher and disney world with a group of foster grandparents 
every one of those years has been fascinating in its own way

gov bob martinez signed a bill into 
law wednesday that will require unmarried girls under 18 to obtain 
parental or judicial permission before getting abortions 
the law also reenacts regulations of the states abortion 
clinics and allows the department of health and rehabilitative 
services to revoke the license of any clinic that doesnt properly 
dispose of fetal remains 
martinez and representatives from several antiabortion groups 
who attended the bill signing said the measure restored the rights 
of parents to make decisions about their children 
this has got to be seen as a victory for the children because 
what child going through surgery should not have permission from 
their parents said kay james spokeswoman for national right to 
life even prochoice people ought to see this as a victory this 
is not about abortion 
opponents of the law said it would lead to an increase in the 
number of teenage pregnancies and force some girls to go out of 
state to seek abortions or prompt them to selfinduce abortions 
the parentalconsent bill doesnt work said jerry klein 
director of planned parenthood of tallahassee you end up with a 
minor who delays telling the parent you end up with a minor who 
may seek an abortion out of state 
under the new law girls will be able to obtain permission from 
a judge for an abortion the socalled judicial bypass was designed 
in cases such as incest 
the law says the supreme court will develop rules to make sure 
those cases are handled quickly and that the girls anonymity is 
protected 
klein estimated there were 10000 teenage abortions in florida 
in 1982 the latest available statistics 
tom horkan director of the florida catholic conference one of 
several groups that lobbied hard for the parentalconsent bill 
said at least seven other states have parentalconsent requirements

vice president george bush said wednesday he is sick and 
tired of democratic attacks on white house drug policies even as 
michael dukakis declared bush and president reagan have lots of 
answering to do for actions the democrat said undermine the war 
against drugs 
dukakis presidential campaign signaled that jesse jackson is on 
the list of those being considered for the vice presidential spot 
on the democratic ticket 
jackson met in washington with paul brountas dukakis campaign 
chairman and head of the search for a running mate for the 
massachusetts governor 
it was a very meaningful preliminary discussion jackson 
said in revealing the meeting 
dukakis aides say brountas is meeting with a wide variety of 
democratic leaders in the search not just possible vice 
presidential candidates but brountas has met with most of the 
democrats mentioned for the no 2 spot on this trip 
dukakis spent a third day in a row at anticrime events in his 
home state wednesday while bush went to capitol hill for a news 
conference on the war against drugs 
how can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs 
when were cutting coast guard patrols by 55 percent dukakis 
said at the massachusetts state police academy in framingham 
its that kind of thing one of the reasons im running for the 
presidency 
he rejected suggestions that bush and the republicans could 
portray him as soft on crime noting that the massachusetts crime 
rate has dropped 14 percent in the past four years 
anyone whos been familiar with me for the past 5 years knows 
how strongly i feel on thiseternal vigilance is whats needed 
he said after meeting with state police recruits 
dukakis said bush and reagans actions over two terms suggest 
the gop might be vulnerable to such a charge 
theyve got lots of answering to do for whats been happening 
over the past eight years he said but did not elaborate beyond 
the coast guard budget cuts 
on capitol hill bush accused the democrats of making antidrug 
programs a shrill political issue and said congressional 
democrats were responsible for a 72 million cut in the coast guard 
budget for drug patrols 
im sick and tired in hearing the democrats do nothing but 
tear down and criticize im talking about jesse jackson and 
michael dukakis the last two months bush said at a news 
conference where he endorsed a package of antidrug measures 
sponsored by house republicans 
in an interview with the associated press on wednesday bush 
blamed his high negative ratings in the polls on democratic attacks 
and a fuzzy image the voters have of him 
when youre sitting out there in a primary process with two 
candidates shooting at you every single dayi think it would be 
surprising if things were any different bush said i feel 
fairly relaxed about thatwe have time to be sure that a positive 
image is out on who i am and what i feel and where ill take the 
country and ill readily concede that some of thats not that 
clear yet 
that sentiment was echoed by a group of 15 gop state chairmen 
who met with bush and reagan on wednesday 
voters in the midwest know nothing at all about michael 
dukakis when they find out they wont vote for him said 
indiana party chief gordon durnil 
with dukakis and bush trading general election jibes jackson 
rejected suggestions he should follow the lead of other vanquished 
democratic hopefuls and endorse dukakis sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee will endorse dukakis on thursday 
they lost and surrendered i did not were not in the same 
category jackson said after a meeting in washington with civil 
rights leaders they surrendered their constituencies because 
they lost my constituency continues to growso were still in 
the process 
jackson also said he would step up pressure on dukakis to swing 
the democratic party platform in line with his ideas 
the most critical becomes this budget a commitment to invest 
in people a commitment to reinvest in america jackson said 
jackson forces want the platform to include a freeze on military 
spending and higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations to pay 
for his social programs dukakis aides reject those ideas saying 
the massachusetts governor is for stable defense budgets and would 
raise taxes only as a last resort

the armenian legislature defied central soviet 
communist party authorities on wednesday by siding with 
demonstrators who for months have demanded annexation of a region 
in a neighboring republic 
the chairman of the armenian supreme soviet gramt voskanyan 
emerged from a fivehour session of parliament to announce the 
decision to thousands of people gathered outside the legislatures 
headquarters in armenias capital yerevan according to a 
television journalist 
the parliamentary session was broadcast live on armenian 
television a first for the republic and the official soviet news 
agency tass reported that the armenian parliament decreed to give 
its consent to the inclusion of the nagornokarabakh autonomous 
region into the armenian republic 
the tass dispatch also read on the nationally broadcast 
television evening news show vremya or time did not explain 
the dispute 
in moscow several hundred armenians applauded and raised 
clenched fists as tiran gureghian the armenian church 
representative in the capital told them the vote had been 
unanimous to annex the nagornokarabakh region the region is 
populated mostly by armenians who are christian but is located in 
neighboring azerbaijan which is predominately moslem 
the vote by the armenian parliament transforms the issue which 
has caused bloody ethnic violence into a national constitutional 
crisis because the soviet constitution requires that all republics 
concerned and the central government approve any territorial 
changes 
and central soviet communist party authorities have already 
rejected armenian annexation of nagornokarabakh 
it was far from clear whether the armenians would be able to 
wrest control of nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan to which it has 
been attached since 1923 
the presidium or executive committee of azerbaijans supreme 
soviet voted monday to reject the annexation demand saying it 
would be contrary to the interests of the azerbaijani and 
armenian population of the republic 
the full supreme soviet of azerbaijan is to take up the issue 
friday said the tv reporter who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it is unlikely the azerbaijani supreme soviet will go against the 
wishes of its presidium 
central soviet communist party officials in moscow rejected the 
annexation demand in february touching off ethnic violence and 
strikes in armenia and azerbaijan 
the national parliament the supreme soviet headed by president 
andrei a gromyko has not addressed the issue 
thus the latest twist in the armenianazerbaijani dispute puts 
it at the heart of a debate now developing in the soviet union the 
balance of power between the legislature which according to the 
constitution is supreme and the communist party which has run the 
soviet union since its creation in 1917 
the armenian supreme soviet in the resolution it passed 
wednesday said that a majority of residents of armenia and 
nagornokarabakh want the region taken out of azerbaijan according 
to the tv journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity 
nagornokarabakhs local legislature voted feb 20 to request 
the transfer the regions communist party committee endorsed the 
move a month later saying it had been wrong to make the area part 
of azerbaijan 
more than threequarters of nagornokarabakhs 160000 people 
are ethnic armenians most armenians are christian while most 
azerbaijanis are moslem 
gureghian speaking from the steps of the redbrick church in a 
armenian cemetery said armenians would now wait for a decision by 
national authorities the people are united in their mood 
everyone is waiting for a just decision 
the crisis has been costly on feb 28 riots broke out in the 
azerbaijani city of sumgait and 32 people mostly armenians were 
killed the armenian supreme soviet resolution passed wednesday 
condemns that violence and offers condolences to relatives of the 
victims according to the tv journalist 
additionally official press reports said strikes in armenia and 
nagornokarabakh have damaged the areas economy 
the turmoil puts soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
administration in a political quandry if it agrees to transfer 
nagornokarabakh it will anger azerbaijanis if it rejects the 
demand armenians will be incensed 
the bitter ethnic dispute has been an important test of 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost which encourages the soviet 
people to speak out 
moscow will now have to play the role of an arbitrator a 
correspondent for the armenian communist party newspaper kommunist 
said he spoke by telephone from yerevan on condition he not be 
identified 
the unrest over the dispute continued wednesday more than 150 
students remained outside yerevans opera theater staging a sitin 
they began may 25 the kommunist reporter said 
the tv journalist estimated that 1 million people from armenia 
gathered wednesday in yerevans streets to monitor the supreme 
soviet session

vice president george bush on wednesday 
endorsed a house gop plan to severely punish narcotics users then 
accused democratic presidential candidates of making a shrill 
political issue of antidrug programs 
im sick and tired in hearing the democrats do nothing but 
tear down and criticize reagan administration antidrug efforts 
bush said im talking about jesse jackson and michael dukakis 
the last two months 
standing with some 50 house republicans the allbutcertain gop 
presidential nominee turned a news conference on their plan into a 
blistering partisan attack he declared the proposed package 
better than anything the democrats are going to dream up 
included in the proposal are recommendations to take away 
driving licenses of those convicted in drug cases fine them up to 
25 percent of their adjusted gross income and net assets and make 
them ineligible for federal contracts loans or licenses 
answering reporters questions bush said he supports the 
administrations zero tolerance policy of seizing property when 
even a small amount of illegal drugs is found he said if some 
yacht owner is inconvenienced its too damn bad 
he challenged dukakis his likely presidential rival this fall 
to endorse a section of the plan calling for the death penalty for 
drug kingpins 
dukakis who has said capital punishment wouldnt help 
lambasted the administrations drugfighting effort earlier 
wednesday in framingham mass 
in particular he criticized cuts in funds for the coast guard 
saying how can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on 
drugs when were cutting coast guard patrols by 55 percent its 
that kind of thing one of the reasons im running for the 
presidency 
bush however blamed congressional democrats for a 72 million 
cut in the coast guard budget for drug patrols 
the vice president said the military can do more in the 
antidrug effort but added i have trouble with proposals for 
the military to arrest civilians 
the gop plan would 
make anyone convicted of a drug trafficking offense or of two 
drug possession offenses ineligible for federal grants contracts 
loans or licenses for five years 
create a civil fine of up to a quarter of the adjusted gross 
income and net assets of anyone caught possessing illegal 
substances 
require that before a state could receive federal highway 
money it must enact laws to suspend a drivers license upon 
conviction of a drug offense 
require that before receiving a federal contract or federal 
assistance a company must show a goodfaith effort to maintain a 
drugfree workplace 
mandate drug testing for all federal arrestees in drug cases 
and revocation of bond if the result is positive a clean drug test 
would be a condition to federal probation and parolees would be 
tested at random 
increase drug abuse treatment services 
authorize grants for states that establish innovative antidrug 
programs 
require a 10year prison term for using a firearm in an assault 
on a federal officer and prohibit possession of a firearm in a 
us courthouse 
require governors to use the national guard in assisting drug 
enforcement efforts 
increase penalties for train or other transportation operators 
convicted of operating their vehicles while under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs 
increase the militarys role in drug interdiction a proposal 
identical to legislation already passed by the house

the nations cable tv industry increasing is 
controlled by a few large companies the reagan administration said 
wednesday in a report recommending rule changes to increase 
competition 
the report by the national telecommunications and information 
administration a commerce department agency said opening local 
cable tv markets to more competition would reduce growing concerns 
about ownership trends in the industry that may give large cable 
companies excessive power to influence program distribution 
only a handful of communities offer residents a choice of cable 
tv services and outdated regulations serve only to perpetuate 
monopoly franchising said alfred c sikes assistant commerce 
secretary for communications and information 
lets get more competition so we can have marketplace 
solutions and not government regulatory solutions sikes said 
his agency is responsible for developing us information and 
communications policy and the report was the reagan 
administrations first review of the cable tv industry 
the head of the federal communications commission praised the 
reports conclusions which generally propose the same deregulatory 
course the commission has followed during the reagan administration 
competition and open entry regulate best dennis r patrick 
fcc chairman said in a statement they guarantee responsiveness 
to consumer demand and are the most effective safeguards against 
market power 
the national cable television association called the report 
interesting reading but disagreed with some of its 
recommendations including a proposal that would give telephone 
companies more freedom to provide transport facilities for cable tv 
in their local service areas 
the report says allowing phone companies to provide video dial 
tone would allow anyone including hollywood studios sports 
organizations and broadcasters to lease video channels to 
distribute programs to subscribers 
the report recommends elimination of a law that permits local 
phone companies to lease channel capacity only to cable companies 
that have a local cable franchise it also recommends however no 
change in laws that prohibit phone companies from owning cable 
systems 
the cable association says the proposal would put at a 
disadvantage franchised cable companies which pay a portion of 
their revenues to the local municipal governments and which must 
meet other community requirements 
we dont want someone out there competing with us when they 
dont have the same requirements imposed on them as we do by the 
cities cable association spokeswoman lynn mcreynolds said 
the report also recommends eliminating a regulation that 
prohibits tv networks from owning cable systems the report says 
national programming and advertising markets have become more 
competitive since the 1970 ban was imposed 
in addition the agency recommends the fcc investigate ownership 
concentration in the cable industry and consider taking steps to 
limit cable ownership 
cable tv is available to about 80 percent of american homes 
about half of those households an estimated 427 million 
subscribe to cable 
the report noted that telecommunications inc the nations 
largest cable company owning or controlling systems with about 10 
million subscribers has seen its share of the market grow from 91 
percent in 1983 to 234 percent last year the companys share more 
than doubled from 1986 to 1987 
the secondbiggest cable company american television amp 
communications corp owns or controls systems with about 44 
million subscribers continental cablevision inc is third with 
22 million subscribers cox cable communications and storer 
communications have about 15 million each and warner cable and 
comcast cable communications each have about 14 million

unwelcome passengers are bugging commuters on 
city buses say officials trying to get rid of a cockroach invasion 
blamed on hot weather and garbage left by riders 
these roaches have been using little cracks and crevices for 
their little homes when the weather was not so hot chicago 
transit authority spokeswoman rosemarie gulley said wednesday 
with summer approaching the authority is painting and doing 
other maintenance that destroys the varmints homes she said 
once we throw paint on them they go running the transit 
authority has to deal with the problem somehow she added since 
we cannot count on our riders to starve them despite an eating 
ban on buses 
for people who want to become squeamish about it its not a 
health hazard and its not a safety hazard she said 
cockroaches have been found on about 40 of the agencys more 
than 2000 buses she said they show up every year when the 
weather turns hot 
the agency routinely sprays insecticide in the buses but this 
years roach crop is resistant to the poison she said a shortage 
of dumpsters at a south side bus terminal also contributed to the 
garbage problem she said 
a couple of riders spotted a cockroach or two or three ms 
gulley said but to call it an epidemic is overstating the case 
still the problem is serious enough to have made the agency 
look for a stronger insecticide and haul more dumpsters to the 
terminal 
and the buses put out of commission for spraying added another 
bug to the citys attempts to control a recent shortage of usable 
buses 
tuesday 61 bus runs were canceled and 64 other buses ran late 
because of a vehicle shortage 
but transit authorities say it was due mainly to a lack of 
replacement parts and delays in structural overhauls 
ms gulley said its too soon to tell how well the new 
insecticide is working 
at least one insect expert predicts riders may have to wait 
until winter for relief 
there are enough areas back behind the paneling and walls and 
under the floors of buses that roaches find places to hide said 
entomologist philip nixon of the university of illinois cooperative 
extension service in champaign

israels army closed schools and ordered 
arabowned bus companies off the streets wednesday after arabs shut 
down the occupied territories in solidarity with thousands of 
jailed palestinians 
troops killed a 21yearold arab who was blocking a west bank 
road to force workers to stay home from their jobs the army said 
it said another arab was wounded by army gunfire 
the commercial shutdown was called for in a widely distributed 
underground palestinian leaflet 
the strikes success appeared to anger military leaders who 
closed west bank schools for two days they also closed 16 
arabowned bus companies in east jerusalem and the west bank for a 
week beginning thursday because they had participated in the strike 
if protests continue the arabs will all be sorry about 
it said the military government chief brig gen shaike erez 
palestinian leaders said the school closings and bus ban would 
not slow six months of arab protests against 21 years of israeli 
occupation 
the uprising will continue because it is the key to our 
future said deposed nablus mayor bassam shakaa who lost his 
legs in a 1982 attack by jewish terrorists 
also wednesday 
israels chief fire official rami kachalon said his office 
had recorded 2500 forest and brush fires since may 15 most set by 
arab activists we ask all the public to mobilize because of this 
emergency situation said yaacov markovitz the government 
official in charge of firefighters 
leaders of israels tourism industry held an emergency meeting 
with tourism minister avraham sharir to try to reverse a 40 percent 
decline in visitors to israel so far this year 
the army showed journalists a documentary film about israeli 
army brutality that will be viewed by all soldiers who serve in the 
occupied lands the film which focuses on abuse of arab civilians 
and journalists is intended to teach troops how to avoid such 
behavior 
wednesdays fatality occurred in battir five miles northwest of 
bethlehem where 40 youths blocked a road with boulders and 
overturned trash barrels to make sure arab workers participated in 
the strike said villager ribhi mustafa 
when israeli troops arrived on the scene the palestinians began 
throwing bottles and stones said mustafa and an official at nearby 
beit jalla hospital 
soldiers responded first with tear gas and then fired live 
ammunition hitting nidal ibrahim hassan in the head and killing 
him said the hospital official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the army confirmed hassan was the dead man and said troops shot 
him after he hurled a firebomb a military spokesman said troops 
wounded another palestinian who was about to throw a firebomb 
the death brought to 208 the number of arabs killed since the 
uprising began dec 8 two israelis also have been killed 
wednesdays strike was virtually universally observed among the 
west bank and the gaza strips 15 million palestinians as well as 
in east jerusalem 
in bethlehem graffiti on walls said in arabic observe the 
strike or else in nablus outlawed palestinian flags flew from 
electrical poles 
the army released figures wednesday showing 7800 arabs now are 
held in israeli detention centers and 2500 of those are under 
administrative detention which permits jailing for six months 
without trial 
hanan ashrawi an english teacher at the west banks bir zeit 
university said the effectiveness of the strike showed the 
intefadeh arabic for uprising was still alive 
it is wishful thinking for the israelis to say the uprising is 
dying she told the associated press to end the occupation 
people are willing to sacrifice

the new jersey national guard commander 
apologized wednesday for a recruitment letter which was 
accidentally sent to a 91yearold world war i veteran and hundreds 
of other men too old or too disabled to enlist 
the world war i soldier whose name was not released by state 
officials wrote that he was flattered but the states 
adjutant general maj gen francis r gerard said he feels some 
of the other ineligibles are upset 
theres enough for us to be concerned about and to publicly 
apologize i wish we could have avoided it gerard said it is 
something that is very embarrassing to happen 
some people were originally concerned about the cost or felt 
dont you know im 70 years old or dont you know im 67 years 
old said ray martyniuk a spokesman for the state department 
of veterans affairs and defense 
the new jersey army national guard needs recruits because only 
80 percent of its 13000 authorized positions are filled the unit 
is considered combat effective at 85 percent officials say new 
jerseys booming economy and low unemployment rate are primarily 
responsible for the shortage 
the mailing which included an appeal signed by gov thomas h 
kean went out nearly two weeks ago to 300000 new jersey veterans 
the guard targeted this group in order to save the 40000 in 
training costs incurred every time someone with no military 
experience enlists 
a concerted effort was made to purge from the mailing list 
veterans over 41 years old those who receive disability checks 
and other ineligibles but the names of hundreds and possibly more 
than a thousand inappropriate candidates slipped through much 
more than expected gerard said 
it is quite evident that the realities of mass mailing 
produce a certain percentage of error gerard said 
the direct mail campaign cost 203000 but will pay for itself 
if only six veterans enlist gerard said so far the response has 
been promising more than 2800 veterans have written or called the 
guard expressing an interest in signing up 
even the ineligibles who received letters and contacted the 
guard were satisfied once they received an explanation martyniuk 
said 
other veterans like the world war i soldier were thrilled or 
in some cases amused to get the letter and the accompanying 
certification of appreciation from the governor 
i am tremendously flattered by gov keans offer said 
albert marks 75 a world war ii veteran if he would offer me a 
star at my age all i would like is one star i would consider 
it 
harry romano 67 of west new york said he was surprised to 
find the letter in his mail and added i dont even think i can 
hear the bugle in the morning

rebel archbishop marcel lefebvre 
threatened the first split in the roman catholic church in 118 
years by announcing wednesday he will consecrate four bishops june 
30 without papal authority 
the 82yearold traditionalist said he can no longer trust 
rome 
bishop henry schwery president of the swiss conference of 
bishops has said such a breach of discipline would formalize a 
schism it would be the first since the old catholics left the 
church in 1870 because they did not accept papal infallibility 
pope paul vi barred lefebvre in 1976 from saying mass and giving 
the sacraments but the archbishop has ordained more than 200 
priests who continue to use the 16th century tridentine mass a 
latin rite for which special permission is required 
lefebvres declaration wednesday followed months of efforts at 
reconciliation sponsored by pope john paul ii 
joaquin navarro the vatican spokesman said wednesday in rome 
the sad announcement has serious canonical consequences and 
makes inevitable procedures for warning those involved 
the holy see is also following with particular concern the 
faithful who have chosen this option which puts them outside the 
ecclesiastical communion he said in a statement 
lefebvre has rebelled against what he calls selfdestructive 
church reforms for nearly two decades he made clear wednesday he 
would not be impressed by excommunication which is considered a 
certainty after the consecration 
it does not have any value he told a news conference in 
this village where he founded his traditionalist st pius x 
fraternity in 1970 pius x who was pope in 190314 condemned 
religious modernism and opposed anticlerical laws in france 
who is to excommunicate us lefebvre asked a modern rome 
that no longer sticks to the catholic faith which now longer 
thinks catholic we are being excommunicated by the modernists by 
the people who really should be excommunicated 
only popes are empowered to name bishops canon law says 
consecrating a bishop without papal permission is grounds for 
automatic ejection from the church of both individuals 
excommunication is the last and most drastic sanction left in 
the vaticans arsenal of disciplinary measures against lefebvre 
he has pointedly ignored the papal order of 1976 both by 
ordaining priests and continuing to speak against the reforms 
adopted by the second vatican council of 196365 which simplified 
and modernized the liturgy 
lefebvre said he would have no more contacts with the vatican 
before the june 30 ceremony at econe which is to take place the 
day after ordinations of more priests 
rome is setting a trap for us he asserted it is no 
longer possible to trust rome 
he apparently referred to the efforts by john paul since last 
fall to get the traditionalists back into the fold by offering to 
lift sanctions in return for a facesaving formal acceptance of the 
reforms 
those efforts culminated in the signing of a protocol may 5 
intended to be the basis of a settlement but two weeks later 
lefebvre sought more negotiations on points he considered as too 
restrictive 
when the vatican did not respond lefebvre advised john paul he 
would proceed with the consecretions in order to ensure 
continuity of the church a wellplaced source in the 
traditionalist movement said privately 
the movement claims to have 70 centers around the world with 
seminaries in switzerland the united states france argentina and 
west germany and more planned for gabon mexico and australia 
priests using the tridentine rite are said to be conducting 
masses in 28 countries 
no firm statistics on the number of followers are available but 
lefebvre says millions of catholics support him a west german 
opinion poll in 1982 indicated 57 percent of respondents 
sympathized with some traditionalist concepts 
even less clear is how many catholics who support the rebel 
archbishop would be willing to suffer excommunication for him 
lefebvre said he is not worried about the future declaring 
wednesday the fight will continue we will continue to have 
seminars to ordain priests that is what is important 
he said the bishops to be consecrated june 30 are the rev 
bernard tissier de mallerais of france secretarygeneral of the 
traditionalist fraternity the rev richard williamson head of the 
traditionalist center in ridgefield conn who is a britishborn 
convert from the anglican church ordained by lefebvre in 1976 the 
rev bernard felley of switzerland chief administrator of the 
fraternity and the rev alfonso de galarreta of argentina

the dalai lama tibets exiled leader 
urged china on wednesday to grant limited independence to his 
homeland while retaining the right to run its foreign affairs and 
maintain troops there 
during a visit to the european parliament the buddhist 
spiritual leader said complete independence for tibet is very 
difficult to achieve 
now is the time to find a middle way he added 
the tibetan leaders call for a negotiated settlement under 
which china can keep a hand in tibets affairs signaled a shift in 
policy to date he has made little mention of chinese interests in 
tibet and has never accepted chinas military presence in the 
country or its right to run its foreign affairs 
the dalai lama urged china which invaded tibet in 1949 to make 
tibet a selfgoverning democratic political entity in 
association with the peoples republic of china which could 
remain responsible for tibets foreign policy 
until such a peace conference can be convened and 
demilitarization and neutralization achieved china could have the 
right to maintain a restricted number of military installations in 
tibet he said 
we are prepared to meet with the chinese to discuss details of 
such a proposal aimed at achieving an equitable solution the 
dalai lama said 
the tibetan leader 53 made his remarks in a speech prepared 
for delivery to the european parliament he did not address the 
full parliament but spoke in a conference room in the parliament 
building to 200 people journalists and parliamentarians after 
distributing copies of his speech 
the parliamentarians gave him a standing ovation 
last october the parliament urged china to respect tibets 
right to selfdetermination and invited the dalai lama to speak to 
the legislature but parliament withdrew the formal invitation 
after beijing canceled a visit a parliamentary delegation had 
planned to china for later this year 
the dalai lama proposed a democratic government for tibet under 
an elected president with a bicameral legislature and an 
independent judiciary 
i will not participate or seek any position in the proposed 
government he told reporters i am not concerned about 
myself 
according to the dalai lama china has 300000 troops in tibet 
western estimates put the number at tens of thousands 
chinese communist troops invaded tibet in 1949 they crushed an 
uprising in 1959 forcing the dalai lama to flee to india with 
thousands of other tibetans 
since last fall lhasa the tibetan capital has seen two major 
antichinese protests in which dozens of tibetans and chinese were 
killed and hundreds of buddhist monks who led the rebellion were 
reportedly arrested 
the dalai lama said although many tibetans would be disappointed 
by his moderate stand his proposals were the most realistic 
means by which to reestablish tibets separate identity and restore 
the fundamental rights of the tibetan people while accommodating 
chinas own interests 
he also praised recent changes in china which have brought 
about a new group of leadership more pragmatic and liberal 
but referring to the recent riots he said unless china 
forsakes the brutal methods it employs tibetans cannot be 
responsible for a further deterioration in the situation 
china claims tibet has been part of its empire for more than six 
centuries tibetan activists say tibet is an independent country 
with its own language culture and traditions 
during the cultural revolution of 196676 bands of chinese 
radicals called red guards destroyed most of tibets buddhist 
temples and killed monks 
after the fall of the ultraleftist gang of four conditions in 
tibet improved as tibetans were allowed to travel from village to 
village and the state began putting more money into the region 
lord plumb the parliaments president said tuesday an official 
visit by the dalai lama was not helpful as the parliament seeks 
to improve its ties with china which he is due to visit in july 
the dalai lama in strasbourg on a private visit at the 
invitation of lady elles a british conservative parliamentarian 
is on a 16day tour of europe on tuesday he met with pope john 
paul ii

pain concert 
jim corder an attorney for one of the youths said motley 
crues insurer firemans fund will pay an undisclosed sum to 
robbie miller now 17 of athens and david wright now 19 of

house members urged their negotiators on 
wednesday to accept senate legislation imposing random drug and 
alcohol testing on the 33 million employees of the airline 
railroad and trucking industries 
the 37727 vote will have no legal effect because the resolution 
was nonbinding but it adds momentum to the efforts of lawmakers 
seeking to spread drug testing requirements and gave them another 
opportunity to participate in what has become a popular 
electionyear exercise of voting against drug abuse 
the two chambers have been locked in a dispute over the testing 
measure since october when it was approved by the senate because 
of the standoff a bill that would require airlines to provide more 
flight information to passengers of which the drug testing 
language is a part has been bogged down in a housesenate 
negotiating committee 
supporters of the testing proposal say the threat of random 
examinations would deter transportation workers from using drugs 
and alcohol and thus help prevent accidents 
we cannot allow one more disaster to happen while the house 
and senate quibble over the importance of this amendment said 
rep e clay shaw jr rfla who sponsored the nonbinding 
measure 
members of the house negotiating team have argued that testing 
is an invasion of privacy and that laboratory techniques are not 
error free and could jeopardize the careers of workers by producing 
false results 
sen john danforth rmo sponsor of the testing provisions 
passed by the senate said the house vote would put pressure on 
that chambers members to finally approve the drug and alcohol 
requirements 
he also said he will look for other legislation to which he 
could attach the testing proposal in an effort to increase its 
chances for receiving final congressional approval 
anything that moves well add it he said in an interview

about 8000 people marched behind a 
motorcade carrying the body of ferdinand marcos mother on 
wednesday to honor the matriarch and to show support for the former 
president 
thousands of onlookers lined the 8milelong route as marcos 
loyalists marched from josefa edralinmarcos suburban manila home 
to a highway bordering the capital she died about 40 days ago 
the motorcade then continued to the town of agoo 100 miles 
north of manila where mrs marcos remains were to lie overnight 
in a roman catholic church the mayor of the town is a marcos 
supporter and thousands of people were gathered outside the church 
to keep vigil 
mrs edralinmarcos who died may 4 at age 95 is to be buried 
at a still undetermined date in her northern home province of 
ilocos norte 
the funeral cortege by supporters of the exiled former president 
preceded the twoday 270mile motorcade which is to make short 
stops in seven towns along the way to ilocos norte there mourners 
are again to march behind the body to the town of sarrat mrs 
edralinmarcos birthplace 
during wednesdays funeral procession dozens of vehicles honked 
their horns as marchers some with red balloons rhythmically blew 
whistles and chanted slogans describing president corazon aquino as 
stupid and corrupt 
mrs aquino who is on a trip to europe cited security reasons 
for refusing to allow marcos to return from exile in hawaii to 
attend his mothers funeral 
marcos loyalists distributed leaflets to the marchers 
eulogizing mrs edralinmarcos as a great mother who served 
as the light and teacher of her great son ferdinand marcos

allowing marcos to return for the funeral 
marcos fled to hawaii in february 1986 after the 
civilianbacked military revolt that ended his 20year rule and 
swept mrs aquino to power

kept at a sanctuary in the manila suburb of san juan since she 
died her two children in manila pacifico marcos and fortuna 
marcosbarba have set no date for the funeral in hopes their 
exiled brother would be allowed to attend the burial

the government on wednesday said vietnamese 
boat people will no longer be offered automatic asylum in hong kong 
and will be detained for repatriation if they fled their homeland 
for economic reasons 
the policy which takes effect thursday was designed to end the 
growing influx of vietnamese refugees thousands of whom have been 
arriving in hong kong by boat since the end of the vietnam war in 
1975 officials said 
hong kong is not the gateway for resettlement for people who 
are leaving vietnam for essentially economic reasons governor 
sir david wilson told reporters 
about 7800 boat people have braved the treacherous waters from 
vietnam to hong kong this year or 12 times the number who arrived 
during the same period last year according to government 
statistics 
under the new policy immigration officers will interview 
arriving refugees to determine if they are fleeing persecution in 
vietnam those who do not qualify will be put in a prisonlike 
detention camp on an outlying island of this british colony 
pending their return to vietnam 
we feel most strongly that a stand must be taken here and now 
against the continuing outflow of boat people from vietnam the 
vast majority of whom have no claim to be treated as refugees in 
the normal internationally accepted sense chief secretary david 
ford said in announcing the new policy in the legislative council 
if recent trends continue less than 10 percent of arrivals 
would qualify as refugees officials said but the new measure will 
not apply to boat people already in hong kong who will remain 
eligible for resettlement whether they left home for economic or 
political reasons 
government officials say vietnam has shown little interest in 
accepting returning boat people and an orderly repatriation plan 
may have to wait until western nations offer hanoi additional 
economic aid

himself as an effective crimefighter said wednesday misguided 
reagan administration action in fighting illegal drugs was one of 
the reasons im running for the presidency

nominee touted the declining massachusetts crime rate 
he also accused reagan of hampering the war on drugs by cutting 
coast guard funds it energizes me on the presidential trail 
dukakis said of the reduced antidrug patrols 
how can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs 
when were cutting coast guard patrols by 55 percent he told 
reporters outside the state police academy its that kind of 
thing one of the reasons im running for the presidency 
in washington republican george bush dukakis likely opponent 
in the fall blamed congressional democrats for the coast guard 
budget cut and he accused democratic presidential candidates of 
making a shrill political issue of antidrug programs 
im sick and tired in hearing the democrats do nothing but 
tear down and criticize reagan administration antidrug efforts 
bush said im talking about jesse jackson and michael dukakis 
the last two months 
while dukakis was in massachusetts his close friend and 
campaign chairman paul brountas continued meetings in washington 
with party leaders and prospective dukakis running mates sens 
john glenn of ohio bill bradley of new jersey llyod bentsen of

on crime dukakis cited his states crime rate which has dropped 
14 percent in the past four years 
then lumping bush with reagan he added theyve got lots of 
answering to do for whats been happening over the past eight 
years 
the governor broke into a broad smile when asked what he thought 
of bushs comment that he was a brookline mass liberal a 
reference to dukakis hometown 
if you come from milton dukakis said before breaking 
off in midsentence milton in the same county as brookline is 
bushs birthplace 
on other matters dukakis 
supported in general the recommendations of a presidential 
commisson on aids and said as president he would personally lobby 
for an antidiscrimination law called for by the panel to protect 
victims of the disease 
said he had made no decision whether to support a 40 million 
cigarette tax being considered to help the state erase a projected 
budget shortfall for next year

a judge suspended for misconduct is 35 days 
into a fast to protest what he contends is discrimination against 
him because he is hispanic bisexual and critical of the judicial 
system 
ramsey county district judge alberto miera has vowed not to eat 
for 100 days which nutrition experts say would mean certain death 
however some have questioned whether the st paul judge is really 
sticking to his fast 
obviously im weak physically that has to be expected 
miera said wednesday but emotionally and spiritually and in 
terms of internal strength i feel very strong 
miera 37 was suspended with pay in march by the minnesota 
supreme court which is considering a recommendation by the state 
board on judicial standards to remove him from the bench 
the board recommended in february that the supreme court remove 
miera for forcibly kissing his male court reporter for making 
improper remarks and gestures to female court employees for 
referring to other judges as bloodthirsty hypocrites and for 
other alleged misconduct 
mieras case has divided the twin cities hispanic community 
there are people in the community that dont agree with whats 
going on and there are those in the community that feel alberto has 
brought it upon himself said martin diaz chief legal officer 
for centro legal a hispanicoriented legal aid organization with 
offices in minneapolis and on st pauls west side which has a 
large hispanic population 
the minnesota minority lawyers association has called for an 
investigation saying minnesota judges face a hostile 
environment 
miera said he began a 40day partial fast on april 1 eating one 
meal every other day supplemented with nutritional liquids on may 
11 he began drinking only water with lemon and taking vitamins he 
said 
but a nutrition expert last month questioned whether miera was 
sticking to his fast 
dr ancel keys an expert on human starvation said when the 
judge appeared for a supreme court hearing may 24 he looked better 
than a person at that stage of the fast would look 
if he lasts 100 days well know hes cheating but i think 
hes cheating anyway keys director and professor emeritus of 
the university of minnesotas epidemiology department told the st 
paul pioneer press dispatch 
miera who would not discuss his weight loss maintains he has 
stuck to his fast and has invited reporters to observe him at home 
granted i tried something extreme miera said if thats 
what i need to demonstrate the sincerity of what i said the 
commitment i need and the dedication i have then thats what i 
have to do 
some legislators have called for miera to end his fast and for 
an investigation of alleged bias in the judicial system gov rudy 
perpich who appointed miera to the bench in 1983 met with him 
last weekend to urge him to end his fast but the judge would not 
relent 
archbishop john r roach of the archdiocese of st paul and 
minneapolis prayed with miera at the judges home wednesday miera 
said an archdiocese spokeswoman confirmed the meeting but released 
no details 
neil k johnson the former court reporter who won a civil jury 
verdict against miera last year but declined comment for months 
after the trial broke his silence this week on wednesday he 
called mieras fast manipulative 
this whole story breaks down to a guy whos so outrageous and 
just happens to be mexican johnson said nobody comes to help 
me because im white 
in march 1987 a jury found that miera committed battery under 
civil law by forcibly kissing johnson in december 1984 the jury 
awarded johnson 375000 in damages but district judge john 
weyrens of litchfield reduced the amount to 125000 the jurys 
decision and the judges award reduction were upheld by the 
minnesota court of appeals on june 7 
miera said he fired johnson for poor work habits and attitudes 
johnson contends he was fired because he refused the judges sexual 
advances 
johnson accused miera of trying to manipulate public sympathy 
hes getting national press and he knew he would johnson 
said im defending myself for having won 
miera said hell end his fast only if johnson recants or if 
other ramsey county judges acknowledge that they did not have a 
right to publicly comment while mieras case was pending he does 
not expect either to happen

iraq said its warplanes flew hundreds of 
sorties wednesday and iran claimed to have shot one down 
iraq said its fighter jets and helicopter gunships flew 332 
sorties 60 more than tuesday the official iraqi news agency 
monitored in nicosia said 83 fighter jets and 249 helicopter 
gunships were involved 
heavy use of gunships usually indicates major ground battles 
iraqs strategy in the war that began in september 1980 has been to 
use its air superiority to counter irans greater strength on the 
ground 
a television report in tehran said iranian fighters shot down an 
iraqi mirage fighter jet over the persian gulf but iraq denied any 
losses 
iran reported several other air encounters iraq said its 
soldiers won skirmishes in the northern and central sectors of the 
730mile border war front but iranian reports did not mention 
fighting on the ground 
conflicting reports cannot be reconciled because neither side 
allows independent observers near battle zones except on rare 
guided tours 
the current battles started monday with an iranian assault on 
iraqi positions east of basra the iraqi port and southern 
provincial capital 
in the persian gulf the us navy completed its 36th convoy of 
the year on wednesday as the usflagged kuwaiti tanker surf city

a decision to suspend a federally funded 
program to develop an artificial heart is being challenged by a 
group of senators whose states stand to lose millions of dollars in 
research grants 
the senators said in a draft of a letter wednesday that they 
will seek to insert language into an appropriations bill to compel 
the national heart lung and blood institute to continue the four 
contracts under the program 
the contracts were worth more than 20 million under a 69month 
program to develop a permanent fully implanted artificial heart 
the program began in january 
but last month the institute part of the national institutes 
of health announced it was suspending the program as of sept 30 
and shifting its focus instead to developing a left ventricular 
assist device which would help a diseased heart pump blood 
so far all five patients with the jarvik7 artificial heart 
have died within two years the jarvik7 runs on compressed air 
the program suspended by claude lenfant director of nhlbi was for 
development of an electric selfcontained heart 
the centers that would lose research grants under the decision 
are the hershey medical center of pennsylvania state university 
the university of utah in salt lake city abiomed inc of danvers 
mass which is working with the texas heart institute of houston 
and the nimbus co of rancho cordova calif which is working with 
the cleveland clinic in ohio 
the plans to seek a legislative remedy were unveiled in a draft 
of a letter being prepared wednesday by sens orrin hatch rutah 
and edward m kennedy dmass 
the letter asks the senate appropriations subcommittee which

drought has punched hard at much of the nation 
and threatens to shrivel this years corn crop if rains dont come 
soon vice president george bush said wednesday after a briefing at 
the agriculture department 
bush and senate minority leader bob dole met about half an hour 
with agriculture secretary richard e lyng to hear the latest 
information on the widespread drought that has gripped many of the 
nations most productive agricultural areas 
the nations corn crop is now entering a very crucial growing 
period bush said in a statement while it is too early to 
fully assess any damage from the drought without rain there is the 
potential for this to be a catastrophe 
bush said the administration is working closely with the 
members of the senate and the house and we hope to do whatever we 
can to minimize the effect of the drought on us agriculture 
farmers in more than 800 counties in 21 states are receiving 
some form of emergency relief he said 
but sad to say nothing will take place of rainfall and we 
have to be concerned about the plight of the nations farmers 
bush said 
bush and dole left the usda meeting without responding to 
reporters questions 
however norton strommen the departments chief meteorologist 
went over material he said was presented to bush and dole 
including redandyellow charts showing the advent of drought 
conditions 
strommen said the west was severely lacking in moisture from 
reduced snowpack during the winter which resulted in 
wellbelownormal reservoir levels in much of the region 
including idaho washington oregon and nevada 
another major problem area to develop was in the northern great 
plains notably in montana and the dakotas he said and dry areas 
still persist in the southeast which has not yet fully recovered 
from the 1986 drought 
the best areas in terms of moisture are the southwest up into 
the central great plains in kansas and nebraska strommen 
said 
just in the last two weeks the drought has expanded into the 
eastern corn belt states of the midwest and this is a major 
concern for us he said 
without substantial rains soon strommen said the corn belt 
drought has a potential for deterioration of crops 
it simply is too early in the growing season to try and define 
what that potential is he said 
corn planted this spring will need enough moisture to get it 
through its critical pollination stage of development in midjuly 
while soybeans are later and run into critical moisture needs in 
july and august he said

actor jimmy stewart urged congress on 
wednesday to preserve the creative vision of the directors of 
classic films by preventing their work from being colorized or 
otherwise altered by computer techniques 
i have been in the motion picture business quite a while now 
almost 60 years and i have great respect for the motion picture 
stewart said i think its something of tremendous value and i 
want to do everything i can to preserve it 
stewart 80 spoke with reporters on the eve of a congressional 
committees vote on the national film preservation act of 1988 the 
measure seeks to settle the dispute over the artistic rights of 
directors who object to color being added to black and white films 
or to editing or other changes made to their films by distributors 
or exhibitors 
thereve been all sorts of things happening lately that take 
the motion picture as a means to make more money and in doing so 
destroy the original picture itself stewart said 
stewart read a letter of support from frank capra who directed 
him in its a wonderful life through a clerical error the 
film fell into the public domain was bought colorized and 
copyrighted by the new owners 
this monstrosity is an embarrassment to me and my friend james 
stewrt capra said they splashed it all over with easter egg 
colors and they ruined it 
lamenting the alteration of what capra described as a film 
originally intended to prove the worth of every person the 
letter said even the villian looks pink and cheerful the story 
therefore has been changed 
earlier this year stewart and a number of hollywood directors 
voiced their opposition at senate hearing investigating the 
dispute which became more heated after atlanta businessman ted 
turner bought the rights to and colorized classic films such as 
casablanca yankee doodle dandy and its a wonderful 
life 
the film preservation act sponsored by rep robert j mrazek 
dny creates a national film commission to determine which films 
are culturally historically or esthetically significant to be 
placed in a newly created national film registry 
once designated these films if altered would have to include 
a disclaimer indicating that this version is not the original 
creative vision of the director actor or screenwriter he said 
our national film commission simply has the responsibility to 
determine whether in fact certain films are works of art and 
deserving of some protection by us government because they are an 
enduring part of our national cultural heritage mrazek said the 
bill seeks 500000 to create the commission 
he said the bill also affords full copyright protection to the 
creators of designated films and makes it unlawful to colorize or 
materially alter these works without changing the titles 
this is the best compromise we could come up with i think we 
have a consensus mrazek said 
asked if his old friend ronald reagan agreed with his position 
stewart mentioned a brief meeting during which the president was 
very positive in his statement that he was with us all the way

postal officials have found a way to cut but 
not eliminate their loss in hauling building materials for an 
alaska shipper 
an anchorage buildingmaterials supplier is mailing more than 
10000 concrete blocks and bags of cement about 700 miles to a 
remote village postal officials confirmed wednesday 
each block and bag of cement must be individually addressed to 
get within the 70pound weight limit on parcels 
it will cost us about 180000 to transport all that stuff 
spokeswoman meg harris said the postage is expected to bring in 
only about 45000 meaning a loss of about 135000 for the post 
office 
but thats still considerably better than the loss of 500000 
originally reported for the shipment 
the postal service is faced with transporting the material for 
less than its actual costs because postage rates are universal 
meaning they are the same across the country 
thus the price charged for sending mail is based on the average 
cost of delivering it if the postal service only has to take a 
parcel from cleveland to dayton it comes out ahead on the deal 
if it has to carry concrete blocks 700 miles across the tundra 
or cartons of eggs down into the grand canyon costs exceed the 
postage 
the idea of universal rates explained ms harris is that 
people do not have to suffer because they reside in rural areas 
when confronted by an unusual case however such as the alaskan 
contractor the postal services only recourse is to try and find a 
way to handle the material for less 
the original higher cost estimate for the massive shipment was 
projected under a special bypass mail system used in alaska 
where groceries and other large heavy items often are mailed to 
rural areas the bypass system lets mailers bring their items 
directly to the airlines bypassing the post office 
ms harris said officials have decided to bypass the bypass 
system at least in the case of the shipment of concrete blocks 
and cement 
instead the shipment will be trucked to a mail center at dead 
horse alaska and flown from there reducing the agencys overall 
costs 
the shipment 6000 blocks and 4600 bags of cement is being 
sent by bush consolidators in anchorage to the village of 
wainright about 90 miles from barrow

about 750 barges were stranded wednesday 
on the mississippi river because of low water and the us army 
corps of engineers said that twice as many could be stranded by the 
weekend 
the low water has forced barges to operate only during daylight 
hours and to lighten their loads said jeffrey smith vice 
president of the american waterways operators in arlington va 
low water since the days of mark twain has been an 
occupational hazard and they know how to deal with it things are 
somewhat restricted but cargo is still moving smith said 
wednesday 
mississippi river barges carry such cargo as grain petroleum 
chemicals iron and steel he said 
the barges began backing up after one ran aground monday and 
large barges decided to wait for a dredge to arrive thursday to 
deepen the channel 
the river is only 9 feet deep near vaucluse landing ark about 
3 miles north of the greenville miss bridge 
they are skittish about using it because one messup costs 
lots of dollars said michael logue spokesman for the corps 
vicksburg district 
ron goldman the districts chief of water control management 
said the mississippi is at its lowest point for this time of year 
since records were first kept in 1872 
the vicksburg gauge read 25 feet on tuesday he said the 
lowest level on record is minus 7 feet in february 1940 when much 
of the upper river froze without significant rainfall the river 
will fall below zero on the vicksburg gauge within two weeks 
goldman said with zero on the gauge representing 462 feet above 
mean sea level 
louis logue the districts chief of river operations said the 
river is expected to keep falling and other problem sites could 
develop 
im talking seriously with the lord about this now he said 
up until now ive just been talking regularly 
logue said barges and tows generally require 9 to 10 feet of 
water each barge carries an average cargo of 1000 tons 
bob gardner vice president of conticarriers in chicago said 
the low water was also creating bottlenecks near memphis and cairo 
ill 
the low water is definitely causing us some disruptions on the 
lower mississippi said gardner a former mississippi river 
captain 
he said his company has reduced the number of barges to a 
maximum of 20 per tow and some lines are running only in daylight 
hours

journalist carl t rowan writes in his 
syndicated column for thursday that as long as society is awash 
in guns and drugs he feels justified in using a gun to protect 
his home and family 
the column distributed to 100 newspapers by north america 
syndicate a part of the king features group recounts events 
surrounding rowans shooting of a teenage intruder outside his 
door before dawn tuesday 
yes ive given the headline writers and the progun zealots a 
field day said rowan who has written frequently on the need for 
gun control 
the irresponsible headlines and provocative labels do not 
bother me because i know that todays newspapers could be carrying 
something worse my obituary he wrote 
i am appalled that so many people are so eager to spread their 
propaganda about gun laws that they ignore the first overriding 
fact that my home was violated my family was threatened by 
strangers who came in the darkness 
rowan said he was awakened at 155 am by the sound of someone 
at his bedroom window and the sight of four people at his backyard 
swimming pool after calling the police he armed himself with a 
handgun he said his son a former fbi agent gave him during a time 
when he was receiving death threats 
he said he shot ben smith 18 of chevy chase md in the wrist 
near his doorway after smith lunged at him despite being warned to 
stop and being told rowan had a gun the youth was treated at a 
hospital for the injury and released 
the national rifle association called rowan hypocritical for 
being against guns but owning one himself 
sen steven symms ridaho a strong supporter of the right to 
bear arms bought rowan a membership in the nra and sent him a 
telegram wednesday reading 
notwithstanding your past columns to the contrary you 
demonstrated by your recent actions that you agree with my position 
concerning every americans right to bear arms 
in america freedom and justice have always come from three 
sources the ballot box the jury box and when those fail the 
cartridge box 
the citizens committee for the right to keep and bear arms made 
light of the incident by announcing that it would award the 
columnist the 1988 pool shooters award for defending his pool 
from those who would prey on people pools 
the group also took the opportunity to condemn the capitals 
strict gun law which forbids private citizens from having handguns 
unless they owned and registered them before 1976 
police said rowans gun was not registered with the city the 
columnist said his son who bought it while he was with the fbi 
told him city authorities had said it did not need to be 
the weapons was confiscated by police and the us attorneys 
office is investigating the incident 
headlines and labels such as rowan shoots teenage intruder 
columnist shoots teen skinnydipper rambo rowan and the 
jacuzzi gunman have been applied to the accounts of rowans 
encounter with smith 
but rowan said when someone has scaled an 8foothigh fence 
and is testing a way to enter my house i assume he is not coming 
to get my autograph 
the columnist said that when he confronted smith the youth was 
smoking something he suspected was marijuana 
let the national rifle association or others call me a 
hypocrite because i fired a gun in a moment of personal peril i 
shall still be for strict gun control rowan wrote 
but as long as police and prosecutors tell people that they 
can scale my fence in the darkness bring their drugs and beer 
party around my pool rattle my bedroom windows all with impunity 
ill never know which druggie also has brought a gun 
a lot of theoretical ideological crap is being written by 
people who have not been threatened have not had a stranger at 
their bedroom window at 2 am and have not been confronted by a 
dopedup intruder just outside their door 
let my political enemies crow but let them know that as long 
as authorities leave this society awash in drugs and guns i will 
protect my family 
police did not charge smith with any drug offense he and a 
young woman companion were accused of unlawful entry initially but 
prosecutors dropped those charges late tuesday

president reagan suggested wednesday that 
everyone would feel that it was more proper if house speaker 
jim wright were investigated by an independent counsel instead of 
the house ethics committee 
the committee is looking into allegations by rep newt gingrich 
rga and others that wright dtexas has violated house ethics 
rules by misusing his office for personal gain and improperly 
intervening with federal regulators 
some republicans including vice president george bush have 
suggested that it would be better to have the investigation 
conducted by an independent counsel 
reagan asked whether he agreed said i have to wonder if it 
should not be an independent counsel from the standpoint of the 
relationship of the speaker to the majority of the committee and i 
think everyone would feel that it was more proper if it was done by 
an investigator outside an appointed investigator 
although reagan spoke of the majority of the committee the 
panel is actually evenly divided among republicans and democrats 
with six members from each party the chairman of the committee is 
rep julian dixon dcalif 
wright who has declared his innocence was not immediately 
available for comment his spokeswoman charmayne marsh repeated 
his statement that he had no objection to use of an outside counsel 
if the committee decided to hire one 
weve said all along its up to the committee she said 
we want them to get every piece of information they possibly want 
and settle it as quickly as possible 
house majority leader tom foley dwash a staunch defender of 
the speaker said i think it is further indication of the 
politicization of this matter which is most unfortunate 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president was 
not talking any specifics in terms of what kind of independent 
investigation should be undertaken but was just saying he thinks 
an independent investigation is appropriate 
fitzwater said he believed the only legal possibility would be 
an independent investigator appointed by the committee he said 
there was no legal authority for an investigation of the speaker by 
an independent counsel of the kind set up by law to look into 
allegations of wrongdoing by officers of the executive branch the 
justice department has challenged the constitutionality of that law 
on the substance of gingrichs charges the president said i 
think it is proper that there is an investigation going forward 
with regard to these charges but i dont think that anyone should 
give an opinion until we know whether they are just accusations or 
whether they really have happened 
reagan made the remarks during an interview with seven reporters 
from the seven countries that will participate in the economic 
summit june 1921 in toronto 
wright is accused of six possible violations of house rules but 
has denied any wrongdoing 
the accusations include improper lobbying on behalf of oil 
companies with which wright may have had financial relationships 
circumstances surrounding publication of a book for which he 
received a higherthanusual royalty and which was produced with 
the help of a congressionally paid staffer contacts with federal 
officials on behalf of texas savings and loans and use of a 
condominium in fort worth for which he paid no monthly rent

old habits die hard which may explain why 
clarence walker occupies a stool at western tool and die works each 
morning when nearly all his contemporaries are deep in easy chairs 
retirement says the 92yearold was no more satisfying the 
fourth time than the first 
the reason im back at work is because i want to live a while 
longer walker said during a telephone interview wednesday 
without work i was laying around just kind of dying 
my mind was going blank and i didnt know what to do with 
myself he added i didnt need the money so much as something 
to do 
walkers last job lasted more than a decade and his fourth try 
at fulltime leisure for three years after that most of it spent 
watching television and enjoying the company of his gray cat 
smokey 
feeling he was getting stale walker bought a new pickup truck 
renewed his habit of wandering on weekends then enrolled in 
operation able a countyfunded job program to help people 55 and 
older find work 
he landed at western tool and die a subsidiary of chicagobased 
eastco corp which draws as much as 30 percent of its workforce 
from the 65andover crowd 
hes happy to be working and were just as happy to have 
him said eastco president george patrick pollack talking to 
him or looking at him or listening to him trade barbs with the 
guys on the assembly line youd never guess his age 
its only when he walks that you can see him slowing down 
added pollack 
walker has rheumatoid arthritis in both knees and needs two 
canes but thanks to the pickup he still spends most weekends 
crisscrossing wisconsin where he owns five acres of land and 
michigan 
i got lost sunday on the way back from michigan but i just 
figured that kind of thing is the spice of life he said ive 
always had a yearning to see whats on the other side of the hill 
that yearning prompted walker to join the army he was a chief 
cook in winchester england during world war i and several years 
later to quit a job as a bakery truck driver and rode the rails out 
west for a year and a half 
it was he says the best time of my life 
walker returned to wisconsin and began working steadily again 
and married in 1923 he and his wife of 52 years anna had five 
children she died in 1975 
walker first retired at 65 from modern machinery in cudahy 
wis he was back a year later but left two years after that 
because he hit the mandatory retirement age of 68 
he drove a school bus outside milwaukee the next four years but 
at 72 they told me i was too old they couldnt get insurance 
so after gardening at his wisconsin home he moved to illinois 
in the early 1970s went to work for chicago cylinder for more than 
10 years then made another try at retirement before landing his 
current job 
walker concedes that inspecting 6inch electrical wires for 
defects six hours a day five days a week is boring work but hes 
done assemblyline work before the pay 7 an hour isnt bad 
and it beats sitting around the house 
when youre 65 retirement isnt too bad because you have some 
friends around and your family said walker when youre 90 
you dont have any friends left and your kids have got their own 
lives to lead so you dont want to be with them all the time either 
thats why this working business is so nice i never could sit 
still

jesse jackson said he held a meaningful 
preliminary discussion on wednesday with the michael dukakis 
campaign aide interviewing potential running mates but said he has 
not decided if he wants the spot 
following a meeting with the congressional black caucus in 
which members urged him to seek the post jackson revealed he had 
talked to dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas earlier in the 
day about the matter 
it was a very meaningful preliminary discussion he told a 
news conference 
later in an interview on cable news network jackson elaborated 
briefly saying we simply discussed today the process discussed 
the guidelines we talked about the requirements after all we 
need to know what the rules are what the standarsds will be 
jackson also made clear he wants to discuss a range of issues 
in addition to the vice presidency with the dukakis camp he said 
he is prepared to go to the convention floor if dukakis balks on 
jacksons key budget items of increasing taxes on the wealthy and 
corporations and a military spending freeze 
of course thats the proper mechanism and its the thing to 
do he told cnn when asked if he would wage a floor fight over 
those issues 
dukakis who already has the delegate strength to win the 
democratic presidential nomination at the partys convention in 
july has designated brountas to prospect for running mate 
possibilities 
dukakis has previously said that jackson will be considered but 
not that he will get any special consideration by virtue of his 
runnerup status 
jackson made clear he would like the offer to be made to him 
although he has declined to say that in so many words publicly 
instead stating that it is dukakis option 
black caucus chairman mervyn dymally dcalif said there was a 
consensus among the caucus members that we ought to urge reverand 
jackson to seek the seocnd spot on the ticket 
he said jackson reacted privately with the congressmen as he 
does publicly on the issue and did not go further in disclosing 
whether he would accept it if offered 
ive not yet made that decision jackson told reporters i 
have stated very clearly ive earned the right of serious 
consideration 
despite all the talk of the vice presidency jackson has not 
officially conceded the presidential nomination to dukakis he said 
earlier wednesday that he has no intention of throwing the governor 
his support before the convention and said of his former 
democratic rivals who are lining up behind dukakis they lost and 
surrendered i did not were not in the same category 
the black caucus members said they want to meet with dukakis and 
lobby him to put jackson on the ticket as his running mate 
we come in with a candidate it seems to me that governor 
dukakis has to come up with a better candidate or at least be 
prepared to share with us why he does not believe that reverand 
jackson is the best candidate if he does not choose jackson 
said rep charles rangel dny he added nobody in this room 
can think of a better choice than jackson 
we want governor dukakis to say why he believes that 
reverand jackson is a liability for the ticket if in fact that 
is the governors decision he said 
one caucus member rep gus savage dill said he would not 
support the democratic ticket if jackson was not on it and he felt 
there was racism in keeping him off 
but dymally said savage was the only one to voice that opinion 
and others said they would be faithful to the demcratic ticket 
regardless 
jackson during a twoday swing through washington also said 
wednesday that his most critical political concern now is for 
the democratic convention to accept his budget priorities 
jacksons proposals include increased taxes on the wealthy and 
corporations and a military budget freeze to pay for social 
programs 
the most critical becomes this budget a commitment to invest 
in people a commitment to reinvest in america jackson said 
following a meeting with leaders of civil rights groups

gov michael s dukakis and top legislative 
leaders announced an agreement wednesday to close the states 
current 400 million budget gap skirting a sensitive presidential 
campaign issue by avoiding new taxes 
dukakis and the lawmakers failed to resolve the spending and tax 
questions for the fastapproaching new fiscal year however 
dukakis the allbutcertain democratic presidential nominee 
has been resisting calls from rival jesse jackson to include a 
plank in the party platform calling for higher taxes on the wealthy 
and any plan to increase taxes in dukakis home state would 
surely be made into a campaign issue by the republicans 
the solution to the immediate massachusetts budget crunch worked 
out by the democrats mainly involves government bookkeeping with 
little impact on government programs and no new taxes or fees 
for fiscal 1989 which begins july 1 dukakis and the 
legislative leaders agreed on a target spending level of about 
118 billion or nearly 200 million less than the governor 
originally proposed in january and about the same as approved by 
the house in may 
to meet that goal the government will need new revenues 
officials acknowledged there were indications that the extra funds 
could come from higher corporate and personal taxes as well as a 
modest increase in some fees 
weve not only solved this years problem but weve left 
substantial fiscal flexibility for next year even though the 
governor expects to sign a balancd budget in the next few weeks 
finance secretary frank keefe told reporters at a briefing after 
the closeddoor meeting in dukakis office 
with the senate about to begin debate on a spending plan for the 
new year democrats are struggling to find ways to deal with a 
revenue forecast that has dropped by more than 200 million since 
april 
the tax proposals under discussion for next year include a 40 
million sales tax on cigarettes a 70 million increase in 
corporate taxes by closing loopholes and a similar amount 
through realigning the state and federal income tax codes

the energy department prematurely shut down an 
undercover investigation of widespread drug trafficking at a 
topsecret california nuclear weapons laboratory and tried to 
prevent congress from finding out house investigators were told 
wednesday 
at the time the drug investigation codenamed operation 
snowstorm was killed agents were still pursuing leads on 127 
employees at the lawrence livermore national laboratory near san 
francisco who were suspected drug users or dealers witnesses said 
rep ron wyden dore said the ninemonth investigation was 
abruptly halted in september 1986 because officials were fearful of 
publicity about rampant drug trafficking at livermore where highly 
classified research into president reagans star wars missile 
defense system is conducted 
it seems to me that this operation snowstorm should be called 
operation snow job wyden said he said doe officials seem to 
think just saying no is enough doe is too afraid of the stigma of 
drugs to do anything about it 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations declared 
we have serious questions about the integrity of security at our 
nations most sensitive nuclear weapons and research facilities 
dingell said that after doe and livermore officials shut down 
the drug investigation they attempted to conceal this fact from 
the subcommittee by providing conflicting statements to the 
subcommittee staff and by withholding key documents 
energy undersecretary joseph f salgado said officials decided 
to terminate the investigation because it had run for eight 
months and was apparently not uncovering new productive leads 
he said operation snowstorm had served its purpose in putting 
livermore employees on notice that drug use would not be tolerated 
salgado denied that the energy department had attempted a coverup 
in a report circulated in advance of the hearing dingell said 
operation snowstorm began in january 1986 because of an alarming 
number of laboratory employees who were becoming involved in 
drugrelated incidents and arrests including the sale of 
computers and other government property for drug money 
david a leary who managed the undercover investigation 
testified that many of the drug pushers among livermores 8500 
employees held topsecret q security clearances he said the 
illicit drugs they were selling included cocaine marijuana 
methamphetamine and barbiturates 
by contrast with salgados testimony leary said his 
investigators were still pursuing 127 leads when the probe was 
halted 
dingell quoted john hunt head of safeguards and security at 
livermore as telling investigators that if operation snowstorm had 
been allowed to continue we would have to arrest 20 percent of 
the lab 
dingell also said that leary and three other livermore leaders 
of operation snowstorm were effectively demoted when the 
investigation was halted and were barred from dealing further with 
the laboratorys drug problems 
when leary resisted pressure to shut down operation snowstorm 
his career took a nose dive dingell said 
leary once supervised 200 employees as second in command of the 
laboratorys safeguards and security department and as head of 
operation snowstorm dingell said but four months after the 
investigation was terminated leary was working in livermores 
laser program where he supervised no one 
salgado said the four were given diminished responsibilities 
detective robert buda who was recruited as an undercover agent 
from the university of california police force for the 
investigation said he was very very surprised at being able 
to make his first drug purchase from a livermore employee within 
one week 
buda said this convinced him that drug traffickers regarded 
classified areas of the laboratory as a complete sanctuary where 
they were untouchable 
within a few months the panel was told confidential informants 
had fingered 35 suspected dealers or drug users at the laboratory 
many of whom held sensitive q clearances 
buda said he was flabbergasted to learn that the 
investigation was terminated three days before he received 
clearance to pursue drug suspects in livermores classified green 
badge area 
we felt like the kid in front of the candy store said john 
c barber the university of california police chief who served as 
consultant to operation snowstorm 
we had the money in our hands and we were ready to go inside 
and do business barber said but the investigation was shut 
down before we reached the goal wed set out to accomplish 
in may 1986 midway through the investigation security agent 
timothy l mitchell said he told his superiors at livermore that a 
laboratory chemist had bought a 65foot houseboat was throwing 
weekly champagne parties and was flashing wads of 100 bills 
mitchell said he told james kahn associate director at 
livermore that the chemists extravagant lifestyle which he could 
not afford on his salary suggested he was involved either in drug 
trafficking or espionage 
according to mitchell kahn replied whats the matter are 
you just jealous 
mitchell said kahn told me to let doe deal with security and 
you just butt out 
from the beginning there has been reluctance among senior 
managers at the laboratory to acknowledge there was a drug issue in 
classified areas of the laboratory mitchell said 
mitchell said the volume of drug trafficking at livermore has 
the potential to endanger national security under questioning by 
dingell buda agreed that the sale of computers and other sensitive 
laboratory equipment in drug transactions could jeopardize 
national defense secrets 
dingell said the subcommittee staff has evidence that senior doe 
officials exerted pressure on authorities at livermore to shut down 
operation snowstorm prematurely and to conceal operation snowstorm 
from house investigators

a federal judge sentenced a 
former guerilla leader to life in prison wednesday for the murders 
of an argentine businessman and his bodyguard and for his role in 
the attempted murder of a cabinet member 
mario firmenich who led the montoneros guerrillas and is 
already serving a life prison sentence will serve a maximum 30 
years in prison under terms of an extradition agreement with 
brazil which returned him to argentina in 1984 
federal judge martin irurzun ruled that firmenich 40 killed 
businessman francisco soldatti and his bodyguard policeman ricardo 
duran in 1979 firmenich was also found guilty as 
codeterminator in the 1979 wounding of former treasury 
secretary juan alemann in an attack in downtown buenos aires 
among evidence presented were press communiques issued by the 
montoneros under firmenichs leadership including an instruction 
manual telling how to carry out commandostyle attacks against the 
government and its forces 
firmenich was given a life term earlier for the 1974 kidnapping

killed in the abduction the born brothers were freed after payment 
of a 60 million ransom 
the supreme court has repeatedly rejected appeals filed by 
firmenich and his lawyers for his release from a buenos aires 
penitentiary 
firmenich led the montoneros during the turbulent 1970s when 
argentina was wracked by social and economic chaos the montoneros 
battled police and the armed forces and kidnapped foreign and local 
industrialists for ransom before being virtually eliminated 
the chaos continued even after a 1976 military coup replaced 
president isabel peron eventually resulting in a bloody campaign 
by military forces to wipe out leftist subversion 
that campaign dubbed the dirty war resulted in the 
disappearance and presumed deaths of at least 9000 suspected 
subversives human rights groups say up to 30000 people 
disappeared before civilian rule was restored in 1983 with the 
election of president raul alfonsin

southern baptists who a day earlier 
elected a fundamentalist to lead them for a 10th straight year on 
wednesday toned down a hallmark doctrine emphasizing members 
rights to dissent from the clergy 
that doctrine called the priesthood of the believer also 
has stood as a hub of the 16thcentury protestant reformation the 
modified interpretation espoused here was denounced by critics as 
reflecting a new clerical authoritarianism 
what its talking about is denominational dictatorship said 
the rev buckner fanning of san antonio it says the only way to 
lead is by blind obedience 
about 200 baptists assembled late in the afternoon at the alamo 
andceremoniously tore up copies of a resolution passed by the 
convention on priesthood of the believer 
the action repudiates the heritage of of baptists said the 
rev randall lolley pressured out of the presidency of 
southeastern baptist theological seminary along with four acadmic 
colleagues by new rules imposed by fundamentalist trustees 
the demonstrators sang 16thcentury protestant reformer martin 
luthers rousing hymn a mighty fortress is our god 
in the resolution the convention declared that the idea of the 
equal priesthood of believers should not be applied contrary to 
authority of the pastor which is seen in the command to the 
local church 
the concept has been used to justify wrongly the attitude that 
a christian may believe whatever he so chooses and still be 
considered a loyal southern baptist 
the doctrine in no way gives license to misinterpret explain 
away demythologize or extrapolate out elements of the supernatural 
from the bible the resolution said 
its passage came after a tumultuous session of representatives 
of the 147 millionmember denomination the nations largest 
protestant body for southern baptists the governing body is the 
local church 
protests that the resolution meant a papal system of 
clerical control and that it undermined jesus view that ministers 
were servants not masters crackled through the convention hall 
the rev adrian rogers of memphis tenn departing president of 
the denomination halted the discussion and put the matter to a 
vote by a show of hands it passed by about a twothirds majority 
the action came a day after the factionally divided convention 
had elected another fundamentalist the rev jerry vines of 
jacksonville fla to succeed rogers vines takes over at the 
close of the meeting thursday 
he narrowly defeated the moderate candidate the rev richard 
jackson of phoenix ariz 
through presidenial appointive powers the fundamentalist wing 
gradually has brought the vast network of denominational operations 
under its control it would take a decade even with unlikely 
successive moderate wins to reverse the pattern 
the fundamentalist leadership has stacked institutional boards 
setting stricter rules for literalistic interpretations of the 
bible and inaugurating screening processes to assure adherence 
the new qualifying limitations on the universal priesthood 
concept was seen as the latest move toward extending clerical 
supervision 
historically baptists more than any other protestants have 
stressed freedom both of individuals from clerical domination and 
of the church from the state and state from the church 
besides the equal priesthoodofall concept the historic 
emphasis has been on autonomy of local churches and soul 
competence of individuals to interpret the bible 
fanning pastor of trinity baptist church here said the 
universal priesthood notion dates to protestant reformers martin 
luther and john huss burned at the stake over it 
its one of the fundamentals that the fundamentalists 
ignore he said noting that it is also mandated in the new 
testament calling all believers not just the clergy a royal 
priesthood 
the the rev james dunn of washington dc director of the 
interbaptist joint committee on public affairs said the 
fundamentalists dont know what baptist means 
meanwhile the denominations peace committee set up to try 
to settle the prolonged factional conflict went out of business 
lamenting that peace has not been achieved 
we deplore the divisive political activities and counter 
activities by all sides this past year said the chairman the 
rev charles fuller of roanoke va

serial killer edmund kemper told 
authorities wednesday that he is fit for freedom but society isnt 
ready to accept him and was denied parole by state officials 
in his first parole hearing in six years kemper 40 said he 
believed he should remain in prison for the rest of his life for 
killing eight women including his mother and decapitating seven 
of them 
i think i could handle a parole but i believe 
wholeheartedly that society is not ready in any shape or form for 
me he said i cant fault them for that 
three members of the state board of prison terms the agency 
that decides release dates for inmates sentenced to life terms 
ruled in a unanimous decision after a threehour hearing that 
kemper is unfit for parole 
the panel said kempers crimes shocked the public conscience 
and cited the deparavity and brutality of the murders 
once dubbed the ogre of aptos the 295pound 6foot9 hulk 
with a 136 iq began his twoyear killing spree three years after 
leaving a state hospital where he served a conviction for killing 
his grandparents when he was 15 
beginning in may 1972 he killed six women he picked up 
hitchhiking then killed his mother and her closest friend in april 
1973 before turning himself in seven of the victims were 
decapitated including his mother 
jack fleming a prison psychologist who has treated the killer 
for the past eight years said he found kemper suitable for release 
art danner a prosecutor from santa cruz county where the

exemplary behavior in prison where he has been active with bible 
study groups become an awardwinning potter and directs a 
booksfortheblind project 
brown said it is unlikely kemper will be paroled within the 
next few years because his previous murder convictions 
unstable social history and the brutal nature of his crimes 
kemper will have the right to another parole hearing in three 
years

president daniel ortega says he is 
moving away from marxist wageandprice controls to surmount the 
economic damage inflicted on nicaragua by a 6yearold war with 
usbacked rebels 
ortega announced the moves toward what he called freedom of 
prices in a twohour televised speech tuesday night but did not 
provide many details 
in what may have been an attempt to appease marxist hardliners 
he said the the nicaraguan economy is now a free market in a 
revolutionary state oriented toward socialism 
as ortega outlined it the leftist government will stop 
mandating most salaries and prices it has been controlling the 
prices of primary products and of most imports and exports 
despite ortegas speech the situation was unclear wednesday 
the labor ministry issued a statement calling for wages to rise 30 
percent and the government announced a huge devaluation in the 
nicaraguan currency the cordoba 
the ministry said the official exchange rate would go from 13 
cordobas to the dollar to 80 cordobas at the eastern market where 
prices for dollars far exceed the official ones vendors said they 
didnt know what ortegas announcement will mean 
ortega said economic changes were needed to spur production and 
enable the economy to survive the damage dealt by the war with the 
contras as the rebels are known 
the united states has coupled its support for the rebels with a 
trade embargo against nicaragua the sandinistas say the war has 
inflicted 3 billion in damage 
us officials regard nicaragua as virtually bankrupt despite 
huge infusions of soviet bloc aid 
this small central american nation has a foreign debt of more 
than 6 billion an inflation rate of about 4000 percent and a 
serious trade deficit the average urban workers purchasing power 
dropped almost 90 percent since 1980 
the sandinistas took power in a 1979 ousting dictator anastasio 
somoza amid widespread popular support they promised social 
programs to end the years of inequities 
but they have delivered on few of those promises in 1981 the 
contras then mostly disgruntled former national guardsmen began 
trying to oust the new government 
scores of government clinics and schools in the northern and 
central war zones were destroyed and agricultural production the 
nations export mainstay dropped dramatically as families fled war 
zones and farm workers joined the civil war 
we are not defending a capitalist system nor are we 
establishing a socialist state where private enterprise ceases to 
exist ortega said in his speech tuesday 
he said the government does not plan to abolish private 
enterprise as cuba did because there would be political 
pluralistic demonstrations against the revolution 
nicaragua is not at the stage where the application of 
socialist measures contribute to the consolidation of the 
revolutionary process he said 
the government last enacted major economic changes in february 
setting wages at between 50 to 750 monthly strict prices were 
set on almost all basic products but black marketeers circumvented 
the measures almost immediately 
in april the government began laying off 20000 public 
employees encouraging them to seek agricultural work 
public dissatisfaction with the state of the economy has become 
more apparent the past few months with the reopening of opposition 
radio stations and the newspaper la prensa there has been strong 
criticism of the chronic shortages 
the measures announced tuesday night would maintain a subsidy on 
public transportation and regulate the prices of basic but always 
scarce commodities such as sugar cooking oil soap and rice 
ortega said the civil war was unlikely to end soon and called on 
nicaraguans to be prepared for new larger extraordinary 
mobilization of our forces agains the counterrevolution project of 
the yankee administration 
the sandinistas and the contras signed a ceasefire agreement in 
march but peace talks later broke down both sides accused the 
other wednesday of violating the ceasefire

pacheco and the national agrarian research institute identified 
the victims as constantine orson gregory 25 of los angeles and 
gustavo rojas 35 of lima a spokesman for a us company in whose 
agricultural project gregory was involved confirmed the 
identification 
reporters on the scene said the guerrillas wrote in red ink 
across a notebook belonging to gregory this is the way the 
lackeys of yankee imperialism die 
the police colonel said the attackers dynamited the agronomists 
truck and escaped he said 30 suspects have been arrested in sweeps 
of the region

baby were living in aramachay a hamlet without electricity or 
piped water 15 miles north of huancayo a major city in the central 
andes 125 miles east of lima institute officials said 
gregorys wife dolores was not in the truck 
the attack came four days after procuban guerrillas lobbed 
three mortar rounds at the residence of us ambassador alexander 
watson in lima causing minor damage but no injuries 
in another attack tuesday a column of shining path rebels 
swarmed into huallay village in the highland state of ayacucho 
killing 14 peasants who belonged to a civil defense patrol 
organized by the army police said 
the us embassy said wednesday that gregory and rojas were 
teaching peasant farmers methods to improve production of sheep and 
small farm animals

frequently assassinated development workers in perus impoverished 
highlands in an effort to spawn economic chaos

confirm their nationalities before positive identification was 
made a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
embassy sent a team to the area to identify the victims 
gregory had been working on the project only a few months and 
was preparing to return to the united states in august to pursue a 
phd degree a us development official told the associated press 
the official who spoke on condition he not be identified 
described gregory as just a young kid wanting some experience 
he said gregory was married this year in huancayo 
the embassy said the men worked for the institute on a project 
funded by the us agency for international development near 
huancayo 
institute spokesman javier recuenco told the associated press 
the two were en route from aramachay to buy supplies in the town of 
sincos five miles away when the attack occurred 
in morrilton ark henk knipscheer program manager for winrock 
international on wednesday said gregory was involved in winrocks 
program to assist agricultural research in developing countries in 
conjunction with the us aid operation 
im extremely disappointed and devastated over the killings 
since we had here a project that was working directly with farmers 
and for the direct benefit of farmers knipscheer said we 
cannot understand how political resistance groups could take 
offense to such activities 
police said the bodies were brought to a morgue late wednesday 
in concepcion a town between aramachay and huancayo 
in the only other us death linked to the guerrilla fight a 
texas woman was among seven passengers killed and 28 wounded when 
guerrillas bombed a tourist train heading for the inca ruins of 
machu picchu in june 1986 
aid has about 20 americans in peru and employs dozens of other 
us and peruvian citizens under contract agreements the lima aid 
office said the agency spends more than 50 million yearly on 
agriculture health and food relief programs officials said 
the shining path guerrillas launched their insurgency in 1980 in 
nearby ayacucho state although the andes remain their stronghold 
the violence has spread through much of the country 
the government says more than 10000 people have been slain in 
the shining paths drive to impose marxist rule based on the ideas 
of chinas maotse tung

foreign trade widened in the first three months of the year to

the imbalance in the countrys current account balance from 
january through march surged by 186 percent from a fourth quarter 
total of 335 billion and served as a stark reminder that the 
countrys trade problems are far from over despite a boom in us

yoshifumi kaneda is very proud of his new honda it 
looks like an ordinary 2door accord except that it was made in 
the united states 
i like it a lot because its unique in japan said kaneda 
36 who works in the tokyo office of a french pharmaceutical 
company 
for one thing it has lefthand drive while japanese domestic 
cars have righthand drive like cars in britain 
i was thinking about buying a bmw first but everyone has bmws 
and mercedes in japan these days kaneda said so instead i 
decided to go for something very different very unique very 
peculiar 
kanedas honda is one of the very first accord coupes made in 
the united states and imported to japan starting in april 
a upsurge in the value of the japanese yen against the dollar by 
more than 50 percent in two years has made japanese products less 
competitive in overseas markets exportbased japanese companies 
wasted no time shifting production bases abroad looking for 
cheaper production and labor costs 
today products made at those overseas factories are beginning 
to flood into japan and the affluent japanese consumers with 
their everstronger yen and a big appetite for distinguished 
products are eagerly buying them up 
in fiscal 1987 japan imported 16 billion worth of products 
from overseas subsidiaries of japanese companies according to the 
ministry of international trade and industry the ministry projects 
that figure will jump to about 25 billion this year 
following the muchscrutinized reimporation of accords from 
hondas ohio factory mazda motor co has decided to begin selling 
its usmade subcompact probe later this month honda also imports 
500 units of 1500cubiccentimeter motorcycles from its us 
factory in marysville ohio 
kirin brewery japans largest beermaker is now selling kirin 
export made for sale in west germany while its rival sapporo 
brewery imports a soft drink called sapporo wow from hansen foods 
based in los angeles 
consumer analysts see the trend as an ideal mix of japanese 
traditional adoration for foreign products and the steadfast 
confidence in domesticmade products 
todays young japanese do not know the days when japanese 
products were notorious for being cheap but poorly made said 
kazuma shindo a chief researcher at the hakuhodo consumer research 
institute their perception of japanese products usually is that 
they are the most reliable in the world in quality but a bit 
boring for them reimported goods satisfies their hunger for 
identity without sacrificing the quality 
the idea of reimportation is not necessarily new for japanese 
companies 
electronics companies most of them heavily exportdependent 
launched their offshore move immediately after the yens 
appreciation began in mid1985 
sony corp often depicted as a symbol of japans exportbased 
economic miracle imported tv tubes from its us subsidiary in 
1985 also fujitsu has been importing computer disks from the 
united states for more than two years 
but analysts said the more recent reimport boom differs from 
that of a few years ago 
geoffrey wilkinson a market analyst for salomon bros 
investment firm in tokyo said the reimport boom began as a means 
of making greater profit taking advantage of currency fluctuations 
however many companies now are reimporting products to protect 
themselves politically from protectionist sentiment in the united 
states and to improve their image he said 
honda officials said they were stunned by the response to their 
reimport drive 
we implemented the measure as part of our efforts to set up a 
global network said hiroshi ohshima spokesman for honda but 
to be honest we did not anticipate such a response 
ohshima said 1500 units have been reserved already and the 
waiting period can be as long as five months honda expects its 
first year target of 5000 units will be cleared easily ohshima 
said by 1991 honda wants to increase the reimports to as many 
50000 units 
but some customers hope the reimported accord will remain a rare 
item in japan 
yoshifumi kaneda said that when he ordered his american accord 
a friend did also but the friend canceled his order when he 
learned of the companys plan to import 5000 units this year 
he was looking for something different said kaneda he 
told me that he couldnt stand the idea that 4999 others own the 
same car as his i am not sure if i would have bought this car if 
hondas plan was 20000 units a year instead of 5000

three decades after breaking the 
allmale tradition in the church of sweden more and more women are 
becoming priests and some think the clergy could become a female 
profession 
the lutheran state church was one of the last bastions of 
conservatism to yield to feminism in this openminded country 
where sexual equality has long been a watchword 
krister stendahl the bishop of stockholm and former dean of the 
harvard divinity school calls it a blessing that a growing number 
of women are wearing the white collar 
one of the exciting things in our times and in theology is 
that women are beginning to think not just equal to men but are 
trying to find whether they have insights which men do not have 
the bishop told swedish radio 
annicka kronberg a former actress ordained in january said she 
found most men in my group at divinity school understood the 
value of having more women and how we can enrich the language the 
forms and behavior in church 
ms kronbergs decision to leave a successful stage career for 
the pulpit has drawn attention to the dramatic change since 1960 
when the first woman was ordained 
in the stockholm diocese which sponsors special feminist 
services nearly half of the 481 priests are women women 
comprise about 20 percent of the 4913 priests throughout the 
country 
last year 43 women were among the 96 graduates of the 
theological institute of uppsala university the female enrolment 
was 53 percent up from 38 percent 10 years ago and the school has 
introduced a course on feminine theology 
the question is now whether women priests are not actually 
becoming the majority said eva brunne 34 a church official 
whose work includes promoting feminist views in the church service 
a predominance of women has pitfalls said ms brunne it 
would mean that the priesthood would become more and more of a 
nursing profession and the authoritative father image of the 
priest might be lost she said 
both men and women are needed she said and a 5050 division 
would be best 
the 400yearold lutheran evangelical church of sweden is 
administered by parliament and its bishops are appointed by the 
government parish priests are chosen by local church councils and 
are approved by the government in swedish the word priest is used 
for catholic and protestant clergymen 
the church is financed by an ecclesiastical tax totalling about 
800 million included in the income tax bill nonchurch members 
are exempt from 70 percent of the church tax 
most christians in sweden belong to the state church except 
those who sign a declaration leaving it the church counts as 
members 92 percent of the population of 84 million though only 
about 10 percent are regular churchgoers 
thirtysix other religious groups are recognized in sweden 
including catholics moslems jews and various protestant 
denominations some of which broke away from the established church 
over the last century 
a few churchmen still resist the female influx in the diocese 
of goteborg bishop bertil gartners refusal to ordain women has 
blown up into a national issue over the churchs ecclesiastic 
independence 
civil minister bo holmberg who oversees church affairs for the 
government has urged the bishop to reverse his policy but the 
churchman said he would follow his conscience the central 
committee of womens organizations has demanded his resignation 
birgitta vidman of the theological institute believes one reason 
for the rising number of women priests is the diminishing status of 
the priesthood as a profession and the low salaries 
it seems that men to a higher degree than women look for the 
money and prestige that goes with a job she said 
real power also is being stripped from the clergy as other 
state institutions take over secular responsibilities traditionally 
administered by the church such as registering births and deaths 
i dont think women deep down are so power hungry and 
sensitive to prestige said ms kronberg 
ms kronberg is still listed as an employee of one of 
stockholms leading theaters and says she may consider an 
occasional role in the future 
the gap between acting and preaching is not necessarily wide 
she said recalling that her first mass was much worse than a 
premier both professions probe questions like the relationship 
between people how we live and should live how we make our 
choices 
she said her decison 10 years ago to study for the priesthood 
dismayed some of her family and may have contributed toward her 
divorce she said my son told me dont become a priest mum 
its so boring in church

whatever else it may have accomplished the 
deregulation movement of the past 10 years in american business and 
finance has certainly complicated many peoples lives 
crazyquilt airline fares ninepage telephone bills the 
bewildering array of mortgage choices open to home buyers the 
evidence of deregulations handiwork abounds 
some of the benefits of increased competition innovation and 
opportunity have come through as promised for example 
deregulation has helped open up air travel to people who couldnt 
afford it before 
but while it has created many new opportunities it also has 
brought down some established enterprises and cost the jobs of a 
good many people who thought they were working in secure longterm 
careers 
when you venture into backtonature economics it turns out 
you find that its a jungle out there 
though deregulation got its first big boosts in the carter 
administration the campaign has come to be closely identified with 
president reagan over his two terms in office 
the outcome of the presidential election this fall will 
doubtless be read by pundits as a verdict on how the public feels 
about the results of deregulation and whether it wants to keep 
heading in the same direction 
but with all its disruptive influences deregulation has 
actually served to stabilize the national economy in some 
significant ways one analyst argues 
michael drury at boston company economic advisors inc compared 
the volatility of several key elements of the economy for the 
10year periods before and after 1978 when the federal reserve 
took the important step of declaring an end to ceilings on bank 
interest rates 
stock prices for example were three times more volatile in 
197887 than they had been in 196877 he reported interest rates 
were twice as volatile using new bond issues by corporations as a 
gauge 
but drury found that real interest rates the nominal rate 
minus the rate of inflation have been more stable since 
deregulation this probably is a result of fixedincome markets 
reacting to inflation faster and more efficiently in the 1980s 
he said 
wages of production workers were three times more volatile in 
the latter decade than in the earlier one but the unemployment 
rate varied less 
while there was a period of great volatility in housing starts 
in the early 1980s as financial deregulation first took hold 
over the past five years singlefamily housing has been far more 
stable due to the wider use of adjustable rate mortgages and larger 
secondary markets for mortgage securities drury observed 
with ceilings lifted on interest rates he added the economy is 
no longer as vulnerable as it once was to periods in which the 
supply of credit for mortgages and construction loans dries up 
creating a credit crunch 
meanwhile the gross national product the output of all goods 
and services in the economy has grown at a steadier pace in the 
past decade than in the previous one drury said 
over the past 10 years he concluded the us economy in 
its broadest measure has been relatively more stable than in the 
decade before 
though it has been by no means the only major influence on 
trends in business activity he argued deregulation has played a 
prominent part in making things happen that way 
participants in any marketplace are subject to much greater 
stress in a free market needing to adjust continually to new 
conditions he said yet the apparent payoff for the increased 
variability in each individual market is greater stability in the 
overall economy

when steve sohmer began writing his novel 
favorite son gary hart was a promising presidential aspirant 
and the irancontra scandal was still a dark secret 
when sohmer finished his tale of a leading presidential 
candidate whos wounded on the capitol steps in the assassination 
of a top contra leader and who is eventually undone by his deep 
involvement with a woman he had a political thriller combining 
elements of washingtons hottest headlines 
nbcs miniseries based on the novel will be televised before the 
november presidential election 
it began as an idea for a feature motion picture when i was 
president of columbia pictures said sohmer also a former 
executive at nbc and cbs i suggested it to a producer who 
shall be nameless and he said steve thats a terrible idea i 
got huffy and said id write it myself 
sohmer completed the book in november 1986 before either big 
news story broke he showed the manuscript to his old boss brandon 
tartikoff president of nbc entertainment who bought it as a 
miniseries 
although the senator appears to be the leading character sohmer 
said its really his staff assistant sally crain played by linda 
kozlowski of the crocodile dundee movies 
shes smart as hell highly motivated a role model he 
said but she has a pretty disorganized love life after the 
first draft i knew i had sally right artistically but i didnt 
understand her i took the book to toni grant who counsels career 
women she told me that many have to be like men in their 
professional lives and they end up being victimized by the men 
they associate with 
crain becomes involved with a young fbi agent played by lance 
guest who is assigned to investigate the assassination 
the sixhour miniseries also stars harry hamlin as the senator 
robert loggia as a tough old fbi agent james whitmore as the 
president ken mcmillan as head of the fbi ronnie cox as head of 
the cia and stepfanie kramer as sallys assistant 
the show is also serving as a back door pilot for a possible 
series starring loggia as nick mancuso the cynical fbi 
investigator 
i give nbc a lot of credit for doing this show in an election 
year said sohmer who is also serving as executive producer 
it takes a tough look at the role of television in an election 
it addresses the question of a candidates image on television as 
contrasted with reality gary hart gave us a big lesson in that 
sohmer is familiar with television images at cbs and nbc he was 
in charge of promotion his promotional campaigns at cbs helped 
return the network to first place in the ratings in the 197980 
season 
asked about his familiarity with washington he said i used 
to do marketing research for the washington post i spent a lot of 
time in washington i spent a lot of time staying up late at 
night drinking beer and eating pizza and listening to war stories 
from the washington correspondents you get a sense of the 
manipulation that goes on on both sides 
sohmer describes himself as a writer in waiting during his 
years as a television and movie executive he was born in savannah 
ga and studied at yale and columbia he was a doubleday fellow in 
creative writing at columbia and at the age of 25 had a collection 
of short stories published with the title of the way it was 
hes making up for lost time he has two more books in the 
works one is a complex thriller about the strategic arms 
limitations talks and the other is a murder mystery both involve 
women women lead more interesting lives said sohmer and 
its tension that drives a thriller im also doing this because 
there arent enough good parts in movies for women 
hes also writing a romantic comedyadventure for linda evans 
for cbs and another miniseries 
im 46 said sohmer at nbc i looked around one day and at 
43 i was the oldest guy there i said i had to have a career where 
no one could discriminate against me because of my age i was 
briefly at columbia pictures that persuaded me i didnt want to 
work in the movies thats when i became a writer

some of their colleagues on wall street call it 
crazy but some ivy league economists believe they have found an 
oddson way to make money in the bond market 
the professors say investors should buy longterm bonds when 
their yield rises to a big premium over the rates available on 
shortterm instruments 
in late may for example investors could have locked in a yield 
of 935 percent on 30year bonds at a time when threemonth 
treasury bills were yielding a meager 624 percent 
it wont work every time but usually buying in the long end of 
the market at times of wide interestrate differentials will put an 
investor well ahead of someone who sticks to the short end of the 
market the professors say 
these are not riskfree strategies but on average you do 
better going to the higheryielding instruments n gregory 
mankiw a harvard university economist said in an interview this 
week 
wall street economists say its not that simple they say when 
longterm rates are much higher its because people are expecting 
an increase in inflation which will erode the price of the bonds 
and wash out the gains from the higher yields 
in short wall streeters say the attractive yields on longterm 
bonds are only there to make up for the risk of inflation let the 
buyer beware they say the spread could get even wider 
but people like harvards mankiw yale universitys robert 
shiller and princeton universitys john campbell say the 
conventional wisdom has it backwards 
most of the time they say a big spread between long and 
shortterm rates is a signal that longterm rates are going to fall 
not rise as the wall streeters say 
when longterm rates fall prices of bonds go up that means the 
smart investor who bought bonds when the yield spread was big is 
doubly blessed by both high yield and capital appreciation 
from 1961 through 1984 the yield spread between the 30year 
bond and the threemonth treasury bill averaged about 12 
percentage points mankiw has calculated spreads tend to narrow if 
they get much bigger than that 
according to mankiws calculations if the spread widens to as 
much as 3 percentage points an investor has a twothirds chance of 
making a profit by taking money out of shortterm bills and putting 
it in longterm bonds 
a twothirds probability isnt a guarantee but its better than 
most other bets available on the sunny side of the securities laws 
even now mankiw says the spread is wide enough about 23 
percentage points to justify shifting to longterm bonds 
why would such a straightforward strategy have escaped the 
notice of sharpeyed economists on wall street the wall streeters 
say the strategy is wrong 
robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc said 
history is not a reliable guide to the likely normal yield 
spread between long and shortterm rates 
investors are demanding bigger spreads on longterm bonds these 
days because they are fearful of inflation and that fear is likely 
to persist he said 
during the 70s bond investors were burned and burned again 
by inflation the steep yield curve tells me that people have 
learned something he said 
lacy hunt chief economist of cmampm group investment firm said 
anyone who followed the academic theory would have missed the 
greatest buying opportunity of this decade and in fact the entire 
20th century 
that was in late 1981 he said when longterm rates briefly 
fell below shortterm rates the long bonds yield of 15 percent 
seemed relatively unattractive at the time but it proved 
astronomical in light of the recession that followed 
of course the academics do not claim the idea will work every 
time also yales shiller said its possible that the normal 
spread has risen above its historical average making it harder to 
know when the differential is advantageous 
still it seems as if the yieldspread notion may be an idea 
whose time has come princetons campbell said wells fargo 
investment advisers for one has an asset allocation model based 
on it 
if too many people start exploiting the spread it will snap 
shut and the opportunity will be lost the academics say for now 
they say there is money to be made they have even dabbled around 
the edges themselves 
its always attractive to think that peple on wall street are 
smart and have figured everything out but thats not always 
true shiller said

vietnam trampled by colonizers scourged by an 
ugly 20th century war and now ruled by a communist government is 
getting new attention as a prolific producer of saints 
pope john paul ii was scheduled to canonize 117 vietnamese 
martyrs this weekend apparently making that small country rank 
fourth in the world for the number of catholic saints 
it has had none up to now but the national catholic weekly 
america reports the largescale canonizations june 19 will give 
vietnam more saints than all but three other countries 
they are italy spain and france 
there is an obvious and awesome reason for vietnams standing 
in this glorious competition writes the rev george w hunt the 
magazines editorinchief 
in untroubled times holy people often remain anonymous 
persecution makes them known by making them martyrs 
the catholic church says it has in 455 years in vietnam 
suffered persecution during 240 of those years with the number of 
christian martyrs in that time estimated at between 130000 and 
300000 
most of the 117 were slain under rule of mandarins who saw the 
christian gospel as undermining their authority in the 50 years 
before 1883 when vietnam became a french protectorate 
ninetyseven were beheaded or hanged 11 died by fire or were 
cut to pieces the rest by other violence one a little girl 
trampled by a raiders elephant 
of the 117 96 were vietnamese 40 of them priests and 56 laity 
l6 of them lay teachers while the others were 11 spanish priests 
and l0 french priests they represented all vietnam before its 
temporary modern division now ended 
the rev michael vietanh of new orleans executive director of 
the us national committee for the canonization said the 
ceremonies will be the churchs largest simultaneous making of 
saints 
it is the first time in church history for 117 to be elevated at 
one time he said 
they were beatified early in this century in successive batches 
under previous popes as first steps toward sainthood 
vietanh said about 2000 vietnamese from the united states were 
expected to make the pilgrimage to rome for the occasion with 
probably l0000 attending from europe and elsewhere 
of vietnams 63 million people most are buddhist but there are 
about 5 million catholics led by archbishop nguyen kim dien of hue 
and other bishops and about 200000 protestants 
so far the archbishop kept under virtual house arrest has 
been refused permission to make the trip to rome for the 
canonization america reports and its unlikely many people in 
vietnam will be allowed to go 
most pilgrims were expected to be from among the more than a 
million vietnamese who have fled that country since saigon fell to 
the communists in 1975 about 200000 now in the united states 
vietnams communist authorities have objected to the vatican 
canonization plan claiming it has anticommunist purposes and 
linking the 19th century victims to european imperialism 
however the vietnam government lately has called for an end to 
discrimination against christians freed dozens of priests from 
reeducation camps and allowed opening of catholic and protestant 
seminaries 
many other clergy however remain confined in that country 
where life often has been hard as it was for the 117

hes a bachelor who long ago traded the 
solitary life for 15 loads of wash every day a fourfigure grocery 
bill every month and enough sons and daughters to fill a classroom 
35 in all 
meet kojo odo adoptive father tenacious fighter a man who 
takes in children no one else wants the abused the abandoned the 
sickly the scarred it doesnt matter odo finds a place for each 
in his heart 
in his private life odo gives unwanted kids a home and hope in 
his public life he urges others to do the same 
as ohios administrator for special adoptions odo works to find 
homes for children especially those hard to place he needed no 
training for this job his life is his resume 
in 15 years odo has almost singlehandedly raised 35 children 
seven sons now live on their own the 21 sons and seven daughters 
who share his 10bedroom home range from 6 years old to 22 
theyll be together fathers day but its just another day 
odo said there may be handmade gifts but the gifts he treasures 
most are his children 
the kids are my dreams he said they bring me a level of 
satisfaction and achievement you can take my life my money 
my car you can burn down my house you cant take away whatever i 
helped my kids achieve 
the achievements for some of the children include walking with 
crutches after doctors predicted lifetimes in wheelchairs or 
living when they were supposed to die 
if this seems like a miracle it isnt odo says love and 
stability are allimportant if it sounds inspirational it is 
if you have the capacity to raise and deal with all those 
children youre definitely a credible individual said coworker 
carol hectorharris someone who lives it as well as works it 
theyre believable 
odo says he is proof people neednt be mainstream america to 
adopt a child 
in a gray flannel world of buttondown bureaucrats odo 48 
favors kneehigh boots a knit skull cap and thick clanging silver 
bracelets ten golden earrings circle one ear a gold ring pierces 
a nostril and a jeweled stud sits smack dab at the center of his 
chin 
odo former civil rights activist and teacher originally 
planned to adopt children once he married when he was ready 
however he was still single and adoption posed many obstacles for 
a single black man 
after a long investigation odo received his first child a 
7yearold onearmed boy he had had seven placements in seven 
years he recalled he was emotionally scarred right to the 
heart but a survivor 
once when odo hoisted up his son up to a mirror the boy broke 
into tears odo thought he was hurting him then he found the 
problem 
he had always been told he would grow an arm odo said 
when he didnt grow an arm he stopped looking in the mirror 
that boy became odos pride he grew and made you grow too 
he recalled at 16 he played football and basketball had 
girlfriends and took college entrance exams 
but in 1982 an assailant stabbed the boy to death in new york 
cityim still in mourning for my son odo said his eyes 
filling with tears nothing hurt me like that 
yet he added he made it possible to take some of the 
others 
some of kojos kids have visible scars a boy whose legs were 
burned when he was dunked in boiling water a nearly blind 
hyperactive child a boy with deformed ears a cleft palate 
dislocated hips and a heart murmur a boy with spina bifida a girl 
with syphilis of the spine 
others have emotional scars one son saw his mothers boyfriend 
beat his younger brother to death he was like an animal odo 
said they couldnt put him in a house they put him in an 
institution 
his childrens abilities vary some earn as and bs at school 
others never finish some help with the cooking and watch the 
younger children others are limited to simpler tasks such as 
sweeping floors 
odo had reservations as his family grew 
up to 12 or 15 kids after every kid id say no more id 
reach a at where the kid had adjusted id think god there are 
so many kids out there weve gotten the routine down well i can 
take one more 
odo adopts sight unseen he reviews their records but says 
there is no way you can fabricate a meeting without the kid 
knowing youre shopping 
some of odos children had families unwilling or unable to care 
for them 11 of the children are siblings from five families 
others came from institutions 
odo never calls his children handicapped i consider labels to 
be cages he said if i say challenged the skys the limit 
that attitude motivates 
he was the first man who opened my world said son konata 
28 a social worker and freelance artist who lives in new york 
he was to me the ideal man successful very articulate 
he loved people he loved kids 
but odos no pushover 
he expects a lot from us said his 17yearold son 
kefentse he taught me selfrespect he taught me how to love 
you have to look at the person and see what they need hes 
broadened my horizons hes made a future for me 
the children share a tradition african names beginning with 
k odo composes a list of choices after they tell me what they 
want their names to say about them or their potential 
kojos kids live in a rambling whiteframe former retirement 
home assigned chores are listed on a kitchen wall the children 
rise and go to bed in shifts allowance varies according to age 
odo is father mother teacher and friend after work he 
ignores the ringing of video games and the tv and maneuvers around 
wheelchairs and braces cluttering the hallway reprimanding one son 
for acting up in school a daughter for wearing a short skirt 
people have told me i should have help he said i want 
the children to feel its a family not an institution 
odo wakes up about 530 am and stuffs the first load of 
laundry into the machine he spends about 1600 a month to feed 
his huge family every three months he buys a cow for slaughter 
odo supports his family with his salary money from speaking 
engagements and government subsidies paid for his children 
i think every kid has the potential to do more than they have 
done he said if we give them the vehicle thats all ive 
been theyll make use of it some will be doing it better than 
others some will be doing it quicker than others all of them do 
it

type of cruel and unusual punishment banned by the constitution 
the case along with three other deathpenalty disputes the high 
court is studying gives the justices their latest chance to 
finetune the administration of capital punishment 
it is hard to find a broadbased constitutional challenge to 
the death penalty today said henry schwarzchild of the 
proabolition american civil liberties unions capital punishment 
project im not aware of any in the works that are national in 
scope 
he added the supreme court isnt going to make any major 
changes in the administration of capital punishment until the 
american culture wants major changes and right now the culture is 
in an extraordinarily macho mood 
the number of prisoners executed since the supreme courts 
ruling in 1976 that allowed states to resume capital punishment 
reached 100 last week with the death of convicted murder edward r 
byrne in louisiana on tuesday 
leigh dingerson of the national coalition to abolish the death 
penalty is one of those closely following the oklahoma case 
the court has the opportunity to bring us out of the depths of 
being among the few countries that execute kids she said 
oklahoma assistant attorney general david w lee told the 
justices however that chronological age is an inherently poor 
criterion for determining which convicted killers should be 
executed 
how the court decides the fate of william wayne thompson now 
21 will affect only 30 of the more than 2100 death row inmates 
nationwide but the case of thompson vs oklahoma nevertheless has 
captured worldwide attention 
three other death penalty issues are expected to be decided by 
the high court by july 
in ross vs oklahoma the convicted killer of an oklahoma 
policeman is arguing that he is entitled to a new trial because his 
was tainted by a juryselection error 
during jury selection at bobby lynn ross trial a potential 
juror said he would vote to impose the death penalty and would 
not even consider a life sentence if ross were convicted 
the judge refused to diqualify the person for cause and 
ross lawyer used one of nine peremptory challenges to oust the 
potential juror ross says the judges error tainted the jurys 
makeup in a way that made a fair trial impossible 
a case that could affect a significant number of the some 260 
death row inmates in texas is franklin vs lynaugh 
convicted killer donald gene franklin argues that texas capital 
punishment law as interpreted by the states courts stacks the 
deck in favor of death over life in prison 
texas courts say judges are not required to tell jurors about 
the relevance or importance of mitigating evidence that which 
points to life in prison rather than death as the punishment 
franklin wanted his jury to be told it must consider his 
character prison record and capacity for rehabilitation when 
assessing his future dangerousness 
in johnson vs mississippi samuel bice johnsons sentencing 
jury was told about his 1963 conviction for assault in new york 
the prior conviction was considered an aggravating circumstance but 
that conviction subsequently was set aside by new york courts 
mississippis courts however refused to conduct a new 
sentencing trial for johnson 
the justices already have ruled in five death penalty cases 
during their current term none of which is expected to carry much 
impact beyond the respective states involved

new yorkers who introduced the electric 
chair to the world nearly a century ago only talk about the death 
penalty these days 
a 12year struggle between a legislature which believes in the 
death penalty and two governors who dont has prevented new york 
from adding to the list of 695 convicts it executed between 1890 
when william kemmler became the first person to die in the electric 
chair and 1963 when willie lee mays was the last to die in the 
state 
because of the opposition of govs hugh carey and mario cuomo 
both democrats new york is the largest of the 13 states that 
havent enacted capital punishment statutes since 1976 
every year since 1977 the legislature has annually approved 
bills to restore the death penalty carey vetoed the measures the 
last six years he was in office and cuomo has done the same for the 
first six years of his tenure 
the legislature never has been able to muster the twothirds 
majority needed to override those vetoes though it has come close 
whenever you get exasperated if youre unable to find a 
solution to these terrible terrible problems you go to the death 
penalty cuomo said tuesday just hours after louisiana conducted 
the 100th execution since the us supreme court ruling in 1976 
that restored capital punishment 
it sums up your rage and indignation i understand that 
cuomo said it doesnt work it never did not only doesnt it 
make things better i suspect it makes them worse 
arguing against the supposed deterrent effect of executions 
cuomo noted that nine states have higher murder rates than does new 
york and eight have restored capital punishment 
the refusal of the two new york governors to sign death penalty 
legislation is important symbolically says henry schwarzchild of 
the anticapital punishment american civil liberties union 
though polls conducted by legislators routinely show more than 
70 percent of new york residents favor restoring the death penalty 
new yorkers overwhelmingly elected carey in 1978 gave cuomo a slim 
victory in 1982 and a recordsetting reelection in 1986 the two 
democrats each time defeated republicans who supported the death 
penalty 
voters respect governors who take a moral stand on the death 
penalty schwarzchild said 
in other words it is not the single fatal noose that 
political leaders put their heads in though a great many of them 
claim that thats the reason they follow the popular call for it 
he said 
the state senates chief death penalty advocate republican dale 
volker says new yorks inability to restore the death penalty is 
sending another message nationwide 
its an embarrassment in some ways said volker a former 
police officer from the buffalo area when new york overrides the 
death penalty it will send reverberations not only in our state but 
across the country we must send a signal to the streets 
volker predicted the new york legislature may get enough votes 
to override a cuomo veto within two or three years most capital 
punishment advocates concede cuomos veto will stand again this 
year 
the latest death penalty bill would apply to the murder of 
onduty police officers or prison guards murderforhire cases and 
murders committed along with other violent felonies such as rape or 
kidnapping 
according to donald savage an aide to volker about 500 murders 
in new york each year onefourth of the total fall within those 
categories 
while prodeath penalty legislators blast cuomo he assails them 
over their refusal to approve his legislation to provide new york 
judges with a lifewithoutparole sentence for some murderers 
volker said such a sentence would be an economic strain and 
create a class of inmates whod be impossible to control because 
they have nothing to lose 
in the meantime the battle continues over whether the death 
penalty reduces murders cuomo called it the statistical game 
several new york legislators say they have listened to a decade of 
debates and still have no idea whether capital punishment deters 
potential murderers 
volker argues that crime statistics show that not having the 
death penalty hurts new yorks murder rate in 1963 the year of 
its last execution was 42 per 100000 population or lower than 
the national average that year of 46 
in 1986 new yorks murder rate was nearly 11 per 100000 or 
about 25 percent higher than the national average of 86 as 
reported by the fbis uniform crime reporting section more than 
41000 people have been murdered in new york since 1963 according 
to the states division of criminal justice services 
i cant believe theres anybody in the state even the 
opponents of the death penalty who would say that life is safer 
today since the death penalty was abolished volker said weve 
tried just about everything and nothing has worked very well

death row in connecticut is just one 
prisoner separated by a cinderblock wall from an inoperable 
electric chair 
the chair known as old sparky hasnt worked since 1960 when 
it was in another prison and state officials arent sure the 
electrical system in somers state prison is up to delivering the 
2000volt shock 
if the wheels grind through the state will do what it has to 
do said lt james burke a correction officer at somers 
michael b ross who was convicted of raping and murdering six 
young women may be years away from an execution date 
last summer ross became the first and still the only person 
sentenced to die under connecticuts 1980 law which rules out the 
death penalty if there is any mitigating factor such as emotional 
distress jurors must also find an aggravating factor such as a a 
particularly heinous crime 
the law prescribes an automatic appeal a process which state 
officials say could take as long as eight years 
connecticut is one of 37 states that have death penalty laws 
one of 34 in which a prisoner is under sentence and the only state 
with a single condemned prisoner 
the states electric chair which was installed in the 
maximumsecurity prison in wethersfield in 1937 was used in 18 
executions the last was joseph mad dog taborsky who was put 
to death may 17 1960 after being convicted of six murders the 
wethersfield prison has since been demolished 
correction department spokeswoman connie wilks said it has been 
estimated that it would cost at least 10000 to hook up the chair 
at somers 
the state doesnt have an executioner and would be required to 
find a master electrician if a prisoner should be put to death 
burke added 
ross 29 lives next to the chair in a 6by10 foot cell that 
was designed as the final holding area for inmates on their way to 
the death chamber 
he was arrested in 1984 on charges he killed six women between 
ages 14 to 23 he pleaded no contest to two of the murders in june 
1985 and was sentenced to 120 years in prison 
last year he was convicted of kidnapping raping and strangling 
two women aged 17 and 19 and of kidnapping and murdering two 
14yearolds 
testimony by friends family and psychiatric experts portrayed 
him as a sick man whose drive to rape and kill was rooted in a 
tormented childhood but the jury rejected that as a mitigating 
factor 
a gangly sixfooter with wirerim glasses ross spends his time 
writing and reading the cornell university graduate is separated 
from other inmates by a wall but he can hear their banter through 
a doorway that is usually kept open ross has a string tied to the 
knob so that he can close the metal door when he wants quiet 
outside the door are seven other cells designed as death row but 
now used as a segregation unit for unruly or dangerous inmates 
i understand why im being held in the death cell the theory 
being why empty out death row and lose seven cells for one inmate 
especially with the sytem overcrowding at present ross said in a 
letter responding to questions from the associated press 
however while i understand it im not sure it is the correct 
action to take 
a camera outside his cell monitors ross continuously 
even though the camera is always there and always watching it 
is less obtrusive than a guard and can for the most part be 
ignored ross wrote however it does occasionally get lonely 
down here and i do have more trouble getting those things that im 
entitled to 
he said he would like a desk shelves and a window in his cell 
he is allowed one visit per week plus one other visit every 
other weekend 
some prosecutors have complained that connecticut law makes the 
death penalty too difficult to impose because it is nullified by 
any mitigating circumstance 
the sharp division on death penalty laws was apparent last year 
when the state house narrowly voted down a bill to abolish the 
death penalty then approved another which would make capital 
punishment easier to impose that bill died in the senate 
this year capital punishment was not a significant issue in the 
legislature 
a poll last year of 500 adult residents of connecticut found 
that 69 percent supported the death penalty although a majority 
expressed a preference for lethal injection rather than 
electrocution 
diane randall of the connecticut network against the death 
penalty said the ross case is a tough one for death penalty 
opponents there is no question of guilt and there is no question 
of racial bias both killer and victims were white 
those kinds of cases mass murderers or horrendous things 
like that are hard to combat she said 
one of the things we have talked about is how can we be 
sensitive to people who have suffered and yet say that the 
response to that pain is not to inflict more inhumanity

mitterrand reelected last month to his second sevenyear term 
as president has been a major figure in french politics since the 
end of world war ii 
mitterrand 71 was elected may 10 1981 in a socialist 
landslide that first carried him over incumbent centerright 
president valery giscard destaing the socialists gained a 
majority in the national assembly a month later 
in his first two years in office mitterrand implemented some 
longheld socialist ideas described as a rupture with 
capitalism 
but the wholesale nationalizations the decrees raising wages 
and reducing working hours and other steps were an economic 
disaster and mitterrand was forced to reverse course and institute 
austerity 
his popularity slumped but rebounded after a centerright 
coalition won control of the national assembly in march 1986 
for two years mitterrand shared power with conservative premier 
jacques chirac the president remained mostly above the daytoday 
political battles occasionally noting his disagreement with 
chiracs policies and he gradually rebounded in opinion polls 
in the runoff election last may 8 mitterrand got 54 percent of 
the vote to defeat chirac 
mitterrands foreign policy stands have changed less than his 
domestic programs he favors greater action to aid third world 
development and believes conventional weapons rather than nuclear 
forces should be the next focus of disarmament talks 
mitterrand escaped from a german prisoner of war camp during 
world war ii returned to france and created a resistance network 
which he refused to link to gen charles de gaulles group 
during the chaotic postwar fourth republic mitterrand held 11 
cabinet posts in the early 1970s he took the moribund socialist 
party and built it up until it overtook the communists as the major 
force in the french left 
mitterrand has run for president four times losing in 1965 and 
1974 before his victories in 1981 and 1988

the name masks the purpose american engineering 
co inc is in the business of death 
lethal injection machines electric chairs gallows and gas 
chambers form the catalog of equipment designed and built by the 
company owned by a boston entrepreneur his wife and an engineer 
american engineering is believed to be the only company in the 
united states that makes nothing but execution equipment four 
years ago it designed and built the first computercontrolled 
machine to regulate the flow of drugs in a lethal injection 
five states have bought the 30000 device company president 
norbert c lynch said 
this is the most humane way we know of today to carry out 
lethal injection lynch said if theyre going to carry it out 
they should do it in the most humane possible way 
however none of american engineerings equipment has been used 
in any of the 100 executions in the united states since 1976 
lynch runs american engineering and a financial consulting firm 
from a storefront in the citys charlestown neighborhood down the 
block from the bunker hill monument 
in 1983 lynch said an engineer friend heard a disc jockey 
mocking new jersey because it advertised for executioners the idea 
was planted how to automate lethal injection 
the methodology thats used in the lethal injection on a 
manual system is barbaric lynch said 
the basic complications in lethal injection lynch said are 
ruptured veins inaccurate dosages and failure to immediately 
induce unconsciousness 
of the 37 states which have capital punishment 16 prescribe 
death by lethal injection 
delaware contracted for a lethal injection machine last year 
after the state changed its method of execution from hanging said 
h brooke laggner chief of administration and operational support 
for the states department of correction 
it takes away the element that you dont have any hippocratic 
oath problems because all you need is someone to set up an iv 
laggner said referring to the potential conflict of using medical 
skills to cause death 
delaware which has six prisoners under death sentence but has 
had no executions since the 1976 supreme court ruling paid 60000 
for the injection equipment and an execution trailer also designed 
by american engineering 
death penalty opponents bristle at american engineerings 
business saying there is no ethical justification in making 
executions easier or more efficient 
the worst sin of all is to do that well which shouldnt be 
done at all said henry schwarzschild director of the american 
civil liberties unions capital punishment project the notion 
that a homicide becomes nicer if you do it nicely is morally 
outrageous 
the injection machine a 3by4foot gray box with a row of 
switches and red lights is mounted to the wall above the inmates 
gurney five to 6 feet of intravenous tubing inserted by a medical 
technician into the inmates right arm run through the wall to a 
computerized control module 
two executioners each push a button to start the machine 
neither knows who actually activates the pistons that inject 10 to 
15 cubic centimeters of drugs 
a dosage of sodium pentathol renders the inmate unconscious the 
second drug is pancuronium bromide or pavulon which in large 
doses paralyzes body functions the third potassium chloride 
stops the heart 
the execution should take four to six minutes lynch said as 
opposed to 25 minutes to a half an hour 
the prisoner is going to be sedated first while he is under 
we are going to cause respiratory arrest leading to brain death 
he said is he going to feel it no hes going to go out and 
thats the end of it over and out 
american engineering has assets of about 100000 and the market 
for its wares is limited but lynch feels the condition of the 
nations execution devices and the lack of competition could mean 
more contracts 
for states that dont use lethal injection american engineering 
also designs electric chairs gas chambers and gallows 
lynch said he has sold three electric helmets at 5000 apiece 
and three sets of leg stocks at 2000 each and redesigned one 
gallows for 15000 citing the confidentiality of his clients 
lynch refused to identify the states does business with 
gas chambers inspected by the company would leak if used lynch 
claimed american engineering is rebuilding one at a cost of 
200000 the company also has repaired four electric chairs and 
condemned two others but he said the states refused to renovate or 
replace the devices 
lynch said he opposes capital punishment but adds if its 
going to be done it should be done right 
if were going to hang this person then we should be using the 
proper rope lynch said and you cant blame the ropemaker for 
the hanging

market relief that the latest opec meeting ended 
without producing a price war has sent oil futures rebounding 
following three days of losses 
on the new york mercantile exchange the july contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil rose 40 cents 
tuesday to settle at 1683 per barrel the contract had dropped 90 
cents over the preceding three sessions amid skepticism that the 
cartel would take any substantial steps to help boost prices 
among refined products traded on the exchange unleaded gasoline 
rose 102 cents a gallon to 4953 cents and home heating oil 
declined rose 057 cent to close at 4432 cents a gallon 
members of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries ended their meeting in vienna austria after agreeing to 
extend their existing production accord for six months 
traders who sensed animosity among the various factions within 
opec were relieved when the gathering concluded said richard 
redoglia a trader with merrill lynch energy futures 
the people were very very nervous that these guys would come 
out with a fullblown price war redoglia said when that 
animosity abated then the market was able to rally 
opecs inability to come up with a new production agreement had 
been digested by the market on monday analysts said 
the cartel has been divided into two main camps the majority 
led by venezuela wanted to cut production to boost prices closer 
to the target level a minority led by powerful saudi arabia 
opecs largest producer wanted to increase production to take 
advantage of a expected increase in demand during the rest of the 
year and to maintain market share 
the agreement extended tuesday calls for production quotas for 
the 12 opec members other than iraq totaling 1506 million barrels 
a day 
iraq has refused to sign the accord because it wants a quota 
equal to irans the two countries have been at war since 1980 
current opec production is estimated at 185 million barrels a 
day

both parties in the sale of a huge block of 
texaco inc shares remain unidentified as the proxy fight between 
texaco and carl c icahn its largest shareholder moves closer to 
a showdown 
the sale late tuesday morning consisted of 7696300 shares 
representing 32 percent of texacos 243 million outstanding 
shares at 5025 per share according to new york stock exchange 
officials 
speculation was rife among marketwatchers that the investment 
firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co known to have had a 49 
percent stake in the company probably did the selling with icahn 
or allied parties as the likely buyer or buyers 
icahns last report to the government said he held 148 percent 
of texacos stock 
last month he offered to pay 60 per share for the outstanding 
texaco shares he does not already own after texaco rejected that 
offer he began campaigning with four allies for seats on texacos 
14member board in order to pressure the company into putting his 
buyout offer to a shareholder vote 
the board election will conclude with the end of texacos annual 
meeting friday in tulsa okla 
texaco was the most actively traded issue on the new york stock 
exchange closing down 12 cents at 5037 a share 
wall street has shown skepticism about icahns ability to 
finance a takeover bid keeping the price of texaco stock well 
below his 60 offer 
that led some analysts to speculate kohlberg kravis was the 
seller 
michael young an oil analyst at smith barney harris upham amp 
co took that view and said he believed icahn was the other party 
if it was kkr it went into someone elses hands just as tight 
and just as aggressive that sounds like only one person to me 
but well have to wait until icahn files with the sec to find 
out said young 
young was referring to a securities and exchange commission rule 
that a shareholder who acquires more than 5 percent of a companys 
stock must report all subsequent transactions in the companys 
stock 
he also noted that texacos share price remained unchanged after 
its volume had surpassed 12 million shares a sign that whoever 
they sold it to it did not go into loose hands 
there has been much speculation on wall street over whether 
kohlberg kravis a highly successful leveraged buyout firm 
intended to bid for texaco 
icahn said monday that one of the firms partners henry kravis 
had told him it might make a bid if icahns offer was put before 
texacos shareholders giving a deposition for a lawsuit icahn 
quoted kravis as saying he might be willing to pay more than 
60 a share the wall street journal and the new york times said 
tom daly a spokesman for kohlberg kravis said the firm had no 
comment on the matter a woman at icahns office said he had no 
comment 
lois johnston a spokeswoman at texacos headquarters in white 
plains ny said the company had a policy of not commenting on 
market activity

oil prices jumped higher following opecs 
decision to extend its current output ceiling but experts say the 
cartels failure to resolve key production disagreements makes it 
unclear whether the buoyant effect will last 
you can almost toss a coin as to what this will mean for the 
market said paul mcdonald an independent londonbased oil 
consultant 
the deeplydivided organization of petroleum exporting countries 
as expected announced tuesday it would extend through the end of 
this year its accord to limit daily output to 1506 million 
barrels even though it expects oil demand to grow 
the limit is intended to control supplies and help push oil 
prices to the cartels target price of 18 a barrel 
opec actually produces 185 million barrels daily partly 
because of cheating by individual nations and partly because the 
ceiling which the cartel last december had extended through june 
30 excludes iraq 
iraq refuses to sign the accord because it wants a quota 
equalling that of iran its war enemy since 1980 
news of the extension reached at the cartels regular midyear 
meeting immediately buoyed the oil markets 
the july contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude oil rose 40 cents to close at 1683 a barrel tuesday 
on the new york mercantile exchange 
the contract had dropped 90 cents over the preceding three 
sessions amid skepticism that the cartel would take any 
substantial steps to help boost prices and jitters of a potential 
price war 
but analysts were divided about what the meetings outcome would 
mean for oil prices in coming months 
paul mlotok an oil analyst with the new york investment firm 
salomon brothers inc said the meeting came out pretty much as 
you would have expected 
philip morgan an oil analyst with the london investment firm 
warburg securties said the factions were just too divided to 
come to any conclusion other than this 
both analysts indicated many market watchers were relieved that 
the cartel was able simply to agree on the extension given its 
internal frictions 
there was the possibility for serious trouble mlotok said 
opec has split into two key factions with the majority led by 
venezuela pressing to cut production to boost prices closer to the 
target level 
a minority led by powerful saudi arabia opecs largest 
producer has wanted to increase production to take advantage of an 
expected increase in demand during the rest of the year and to 
maintain market share 
rilwanu lukman the nigerian oil minister who serves as cartel 
president said at the meetings conclusion that the expected 
increase in demand made opec optimistic that oil prices would 
increase to 18 a barrel by years end 
citing that anticipated demand increase mlotok and morgan said 
they expected oil prices to hold in a range of 16 a barrel to 18 
a barrel over the next few months 
mcdonald said the output pact extension will keep them limping 
along at 15 a barrel until the next meeting which the ministers 
scheduled for nov 21 
but john toalster an oil analyst with the london investment 
firm hoare govett ltd said the meetings outcome was kind of a 
fudged issue because there had been no commitment to cut 
production 
saudi arabia views the target price as a ceiling and sees 14 a 
barrel as a floor price toalster said 
those factors plus the cartels overproduction during a period 
of high oil stock levels will depress prices to below 14 a barrel 
in the near term toalster speculated 
it really will be a testing time in the next few weeks 
toalster said 
opecs members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab

early june brought a slight lull in domestic car 
and light trucks sales which declined 41 percent from a year ago 
but industry analysts said the dip stemmed from onetime rather 
than economic factors 
theres no reason to think that underlying demand just for 
these 10 days has gotten slower kathleen heaney analyst with 
nikko securities international in new york said tuesday 
nothings different in the economy for consumers all of a 
sudden 
domestic car sales in the nine selling days from june 1 to june 
10 were down 48 percent from the same period a year earlier and 
domestic light truck sales were down 27 percent 
the eight companies that build passenger vehicles in the united 
states sold 198647 domestic cars and 112945 domestic light trucks 
in early june down from 208699 cars and 116000 trucks a year 
earlier 
industry analysts said sales were higher in early june 1987 
because a new round of buyer incentives had just been launched 
they noted that 1988 spring sales have held steady and consumer 
confidence remains strong 
car sales were down during the period for all domestic makers 
except toyota motor corp which was just beginning us production 
last year and mazda motor corp which began us production last 
september 
the last 10 days of may were very strong and may have borrowed 
some sales that normally would have occurred in the first 10 days 
of june said michael luckey president of luckey consulting 
group in cresskill nj 
luckey predicted sales will be higher during the rest of the 
month the consumer remains in a buying mood he said 
general motors corp sold 62 percent fewer domestic cars and 
45 percent fewer domestic light trucks than in early june 1987 
gms combined car and light truck sales were down 57 percent from 
a year earlier 
ford motor cos domestic cars sales were down 32 percent and 
its domestic light truck sales lagged 69 percent behind 
yearearlier sales fords combined domestic car and light truck 
sales were down 47 percent from a year earlier 
chrysler corps domestic car sales fell 64 percent but its 
domestic truck sales which include the hotselling jeep lineup 
rose 2 percent from early june 1987 chryslers combined domestic 
sales were down 25 percent from a year earlier 
gm the industry leader held 456 percent of the combined 
domestic market slightly less than its 468 percent share a year 
ago fords share held nearly steady at 312 percent while 
chryslers rose to 175 percent from 163 percent a year ago 
honda motor cos domestic car sales fell 03 percent 
volkswagen of americas sales were down 8 percent and nissan motor 
cos sales fell 276 percent from early june 1987 
nissans sales of domestically built trucks jumped 838 percent 
reflecting the companys decision earlier this year to build more 
trucks than cars at its assembly plant in smyrna tenn

the warning labels on cigarette packages 
provide enough information to educate people about the dangers of 
smoking a federal appeals court has ruled in rejecting a tennessee 
couples 107 million claim against rj reynolds tobacco co 
tuesdays ruling by a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit 
court of appeals upheld a lower court decision against the claims 
brought by floyd f roysdon and his wife ruth ann of oneida tenn 
the roysdons had sued rj reynolds on the grounds that the 
companys camel and winston brands of cigarettes were dangerous 
roysdon said he became addicted to smoking and that addiction 
caused the vascular disease which resulted in amputation of his 
left leg below the knee almost five years ago 
roysdon 55 accused the cigarette maker of failing to warn him 
of the risk of vascular disease and of selling cigarettes that were 
defective and dangerous he said he began smoking camels in 1946 at 
age 13 later switched to winstons and was unable to quit smoking 
despite repeated attempts to do so 
the appeals court panel unanimously upheld a lower courts 
conclusion that the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act 
which was enacted in 1965 to require warning labels on cigarettes 
preempts roysdons claim that reynolds failed to warn him 
the court also upheld a previous decision of us district judge 
thomas hull in tennessee to direct a verdict in favor of reynolds 
on roysdons claim that the company sold a defective dangerous 
product 
hull ruled the roysdons failed to establish a jury case as to 
whether the cigarettes were unreasonably dangerous hull had ruled 
that roysdon could make a case only for harm he allegedly suffered 
during the 10 years he had smoked before filing his product 
liability lawsuit in july 1984 
on monday a federal jury in newark nj found liggett group 
inc had failed to warn the public about smokings dangers and 
violated a promise or express warranty in advertisements that 
cigarettes were safe 
the verdict was the first loss by a tobacco company in a 
cigarette liability case the jury found the cigarette maker partly 
responsible for a smokers lung cancer and awarded 400000 in 
damages to her widower 
however the sixmember jury cleared lorillard inc philip 
morris inc and liggett of conspiring to mislead the public about 
the risks of smoking

a bull market in grain futures and options also 
has been bullish for job hunters on the chicago board of trade 
last month alone between 800 and 1000 more clerks and brokers 
assistants were working on the exchange floor compared with a year 
ago according to raymond carmichael an exchange spokesman 
he said member firms have hired more assistants to help handle 
the activity at the board of trade where the volume is up 15 
percent so far this year compared with the same period in 1987 
prices have soared for grains and soybean futures due to a 
strong global demand for us farm products caused by the dollars 
drop in value declining stockpiles and a recent drought in the 
midwest 
its a perfect time to get a job as a runner said another

consecutive weak report the figures are not adjusted to take 
inflation into account 
most economists had been expecting a slightly stronger 04 
percent gain initial sales statistics are revised heavily in 
subsequent months however and the may increase could prove to be 
stronger 
analysts said the preliminary may report evidence of weak 
consumer demand could somewhat ease the fears of those who believe 
inflationary pressures are building in the economy 
the may increase followed a 04 percent decline in april 
revised upward from the previously reported 06 percent drop and 
strong gains of 16 percent in march and 11 percent in february 
lackluster sales in april had been attributed to the fact that 
easter fell early in the month than usual pushing holiday buying 
back into march 
sales in may were held back by a 12 percent fall in automotive 
sales to 293 billion that followed a 08 percent drop in april 
excluding autos sales rose 05 percent in may following a 03 
percent decline

in april and a 66 million rate in march 
with the latest growth overall industrial production now stands

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade widened unexpectedly in the first three months of the year as 
a gain in merchandise trade was offset by the countrys first 
deficit in investment earnings in 30 years the commerce department 
reported today 
the 398 billion deficit in the current account which had 
narrowed to 335 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987 jumped a 
sharp 186 percent from january through march in something of a 
surprise to analysts who had been expecting further improvement in 
this trade measurement 
the current account is the most important of all the trade 
statistics released by the government because it covers not only 
trade in merchandise but also trade in the services category which 
reflects primarily the flow of investment earnings between 
countries 
for 16 of the last 17 years the country has run deficits in the 
merchandise trade category but the current account registered a 
surplus as recently as 1981 because americans earnings on overseas 
investments were enough to offset the merchandise deficits 
in this decade however americans have handed over billions of 
dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods transforming 
the country from the worlds largest creditor a distinction it 
held in 1982 to the worlds largest debtor nation 
that means that foreigners now own more in us investments than 
americans hold in foreign investments while america became a net 
debtor in 1985 it had still managed over the last two years to 
have a surplus in the investment category of the current account 
because many of the us investments had a higher rate of return 
than newer foreign investments in this country 
however todays report showed that the country suffered a 655 
million deficit in the investment category in the first quarter 
the first time this has occurred since 1958 
while the deficit in investment earnings is small analysts said 
it was an ominous although not unexpected development it means 
that american wealth must now be transferred overseas to service 
its debt and the only way the total debt will be reduced is for the 
country to start running surpluses in the merchandise account 
which experts do not expect to occur anytime soon 
many economists have warned that the debt service burden will 
eventually lower americans standard of living and is the price the 
united states will have to pay for living beyond its means in the 
1980s 
but the reagan administration has sought to play down the shift 
to a net debtor saying the costs of servicing the debt are still a 
small percentage of the countrys overall economic activity 
in the first quarter the merchandise trade deficit shrank by 
127 percent to 3595 billion the biggest improvement in five 
years 
however the change in the investment category from a surplus to 
a deficit added 655 million to the countrys overall trade 
imbalance also adding to the trade imbalance were payments of 
315 billion in the category of us foreign aid and pensions for 
americans living overseas 
these added up to the total deficit of 3975 billion for the 
first quarter 
for all of 1987 the current account deficit totaled a record 
15396 billion even with the deterioration in investment income 
analysts expect that deficit will show improvement this year 
because of the turnaround that is occurring in the merchandise 
trade deficit 
the optimism on merchandise trade was fueled tuesday by a report 
showing that the mercahdise trade deficit for april shrank to 989 
billion the lowest monthly deficit in more than three years 
the reagan administration immediately hailed the report as proof 
that its policy begun in september 1985 of lowering the exchange 
value of the dollar was finally bearing fruit 
a weaker dollar by making us goods more competitive on 
overseas markets boosts export sales export sales have been 
hitting a string of record highs gains which have provided much of 
the strength for the overall economy this year 
however the weaker dollar was also supposed to curb americans 
appetite for foreign goods and that has not happened so far while 
imports did drop by 65 percent in april analysts said the overall 
trend is still for rising import sales in part because foreigners 
have been slashing profit margins rather than lose their share of 
the lucrative american market 
because imports have remained at stubbornly high levels 
economists are cautioning that the improvements in the us trade 
deficit while they will come will occur at a slow pace 
although an improvement in our current account deficit is 
clearly under way the ultimate extent and pace of the improvement 
are still far from certain federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan said in a speech tuesday night they depend on 
developments in exchange markets and in economic policies here and 
abroad 
greenspan said one problem the country faces is that further 
gains in export sales could be limited as us factories already 
operating at high levels find they can not meet further demand 
but private analysts said the string of better trade numbers 
virtually assured that president reagan would win his veto battle 
with congress over trade legislation 
the argument for protectionism is fast disappearing as our 
trade deficit improves said frank mccormick senior economist 
with bank of america 
tuesdays trade numbers were greeted with enthusiasm on wall 
street sending the dow jones industrial average up by 2507 points 
to close at 212447 its highest level since the october stock 
market crash 
the good news on the us trade balance is coming at an 
auspicious time for president reagan who leaves sunday for his 
eighth and final economic summit in toronto 
the administration hopes to use the summit as a forum to promote 
reagans freemarket philosophy and cement gains made in the past 
three years on closer international cooperation

farmers in ohio prayed for rain and their counterparts in 
illinois feared a 30 percent drop in crop yield as recordhigh 
temperatures aggravated the drought in the nations midsection 
about 225 people gathered tuesday night in a field at the farm 
of gerald and joanne lowery south of fostoria in northwest ohio for 
a special church service 
the rev william martin of st wendelin roman catholic church 
conducted the interdenominational service as the congregation sat 
in lawn chairs 
we think right away whos the one who gives us the rain so we 
go to the mass for god he said 
martin shook holy water at the crops in all four directions as 
he gave a blessing of the field 
paul sheeley 48 who raises corn soybeans and wheat north of 
tiffin ohio said the service shows that man upstairs were 
interested in whats going on 
this many people getting together helps its like a little 
petition you might say i cant afford to lose what i planted 
sheeley said 
sheeley said onethird of his corn crops did not break through 
the ground because of a lack of moisture 
the next two weeks are considered a critical growing period for 
midwestern crops and without rainfall approaching its normal 4 
inches in june crop yields will suffer farm experts say 
farm yields could drop up to 30 percent in illinois if the 
3weekold drought there continues said terry francl an economist 
with the american farm bureau in park ridge ill 
that in turn could drive up grocery prices in the coming 
months after crops are delivered to food processors said evelina 
trainer senior economist at the first national bank of chicago 
she said bread cereal margarine mayonnaise and vegetable oil 
are among the products expected to rise in price 
the anticipation of smaller harvests already is boosting prices 
and trading volume on the commodity exchanges in chicago grain and 
soybean prices closed sharply higher tuesday on the chicago board 
of trade with corn futures reaching their daily price limit 
the options pits are going crazy said clerk patrick q 
sweeny the traders are playing weatherman trying to forecast 
rain ahead of time 
peoria county ill farmer joe vonk said he already has written 
off his wheat crop farmers said the hay fields in the area likely 
will be cut only once this summer instead of the usual three times 
and farmers on poorer soil fear their corn and soybean crops will 
be the next victims 
in michigan farmers cursed the cloudless blue skies 
theyre just shrinking up rochester mich farmer dennis 
fogler said of his crops im just hoping like heck we get some 
water before its too late 
in washington agriculture secretary richard e lyng said 
tuesday the drought could well be a catastrophe 
damage already has been done to wheat fields in montana and the 
dakotas he said and additional weeks of scorching temperatures 
and no rain could cause severe damage in the corn belt and across 
the south he told lawmakers 
corn and soybeans are drawing on moisture stored in soil and 
remain viable he said he added that july weather is more critical 
and good rainfall from now on could do much to revitalize the crops 
temperatures soared into the 90s in many parts of the nation 
tuesday and the heat was forecast to continue today 
the national weather service predicted showers for parts of 
parched indiana illinois missouri and minnesota today but said 
the relief should be shortlived 
it doesnt look like it would be more than a day or so that 
the rain will fall weather service meteorologist hugh crowther in 
kansas city mo said this morning

bank of new york co today boosted its bid for 
rival irving bank corp by slightly raising the stock portion of 
the offer and adding other shareholder incentives including a 
special cash dividend 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady valued the revised offer 
for all of irvings 185 million shares outstanding at about 14 
billion or 7653 per share its existing tender offer is valued 
at around 11 billion or 64 a share 
irving said its board of directors would consider the offer at 
its next meeting june 21 the bid was presented during a 40minute 
meeting today between irving chairman joseph rice and bank of new 
york chairm j carter bacot 
the meeting was scheduled after new york state supreme court 
justice herman cahn suggested the two banks attempt to bridge their 
differences bank of new york has gone to court to overturn the 
results of a proxy battle for control of irvings board and to 
invalidate irvings antitakeover poison pill 
irving management has consistently rejected bank of new yorks 
takeover propoals favoring instead a friendly merger with banca 
commerciale italiana spa italys secondlargest bank 
banca commerciale is offering 80 a share for 95 million irving 
shares or about 51 percent valued at 760 million in addition 
it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price 
from may 31 until the deal closes 
the proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring plan 
that includes among other things sale of irving assets 
costcutting measures and a special cash dividend 
bacot said bank of new yorks new bid is clearly superior to 
the banca commerciale offer which has a blended value of as much 
as 7653 per share 
wall street also acted postively to the offer in midday trading 
on the new york stock exchange irivng jumped 312 a share to 
6937 while bank of new york fell 875 cents to 3287 
bank of new york said its new offer includes 15 in cash 1675 
shares of its stock a onetime 250 cash dividend and securities 
valued at up to 250 per share the securities promise to disburse 
profits from the sale of irvings wall street headquarters 
the existing tender offer which expires later this month is 
for 15 in cash and 1575 shares of bank of new york stock 
bank of new york said the offer was subject to the approval of 
irvings board and redemption of its poison pill which would make 
an unsolicited merger prohibitedly expensive

the supreme court today allowed americans who 
sue foreign corporations to notify those corporations through their 
us subsidiaries 
the court voted unanimously to let survive a wrongfuldeath 
lawsuit against volkswagenwerk aktiengensellschaft vwag a west 
germanybased corporation growing out of a 1983 traffic accident 
in illinois 
at issue was whether an international agreement dealing with how 
defendants are informed about pending litigation against them 
what lawyers call service precludes state laws allowing other 
methods 
the hague service convention ratified by both the united states 
and west germany provides methods for transmitting judicial and 
other documents for service abroad 
but writing for the high court today justice sandra day 
oconnor said the hague service convention does not apply when as 
in illinois a state law makes a foreign corporations subsidiary 
the legal recipient of service 
where service on a domestic agent is valid and complete under 
both state law and the constitutions due process clause our 
inquiry ends and the convention has no further implications 
oconnor said 
she added contrary to vwags assertion the due process 
clause does not require an official transmittal of documents abroad 
every time there is service on a foreign national 
herwig schlunk sued the west german car manufacturer in 1984 
over the dec 17 1983 death of his parents franz and slyvia 
schlunk in a cook county traffic accident 
the schlunks were driving a 1978 vw rabbit when a negligently 
driven car collided headon with theirs their sons suit alleged 
that the vws design contributed to their deaths 
schlunks lawyers sought to deliver a summons and a copy of the 
complaint to vwag through the registered illinois agent of 
volkswagen of america inc the wholly owned subsidiary of vwag 
lawyers for vwag contended that an illinois state courts 
jurisdiction over it could be invoked only after service was 
perfected in accordance with the international agreement 
that argument was rejected by the justices today and the case 
will proceed in the illinois state court 
the case is volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft vs schlunk

expected to decline for the remainder of 1988 because of its 25 
billion acquisition of lucky stores american stores chairman ls 
skaggs told the companys annual meeting 
but skaggs said at tuesdays gathering he expected the 
supermarket companys earnings to improve in 1989 
we have chosen to operate the company not for the shortterm 
gain but rather the good of our shareholders over the long term 
he said the reason for our acquisition of lucky was to create 
longterm value for our shareholders our past history has shown 
that this strategy has been successful

lucky and now head of americans new alpha betalucky subsidiary 
said combining the two companies operations in california and 
nevada will give american 600 stores with annual sales of about 8 
billion

supermarket chain designed for the efficient shopper which he 
said is one who values shopping time but wants low food prices and 
quality products 
recognizing the value of our customers time we also will 
institute various lucky service programs in all the alpha beta 
stores he said he referred to luckys checkout system that 
allows shoppers to pay for their groceries with an automatic teller 
machine card and also receive as much as 200 in cash 
lillie said that before the acquisition by american stores 
lucky began working on a plan called the california strategy 
this continues to move ahead the strategy is for us to 
dispose our stores in arizona and in florida we will become a 
company that serves markets only in california and nevada he 
said 
lucky already has sold its arizona stores and it will move 
ahead shortly to sell its florida stores he said 
our california strategy will allow us to become totally 
focused on maximizing the value of our strong market position in 
california where the combined operation will have full market share 
well in excess of 20 percent said lillie

considered its sales for the year to be below expectation

gustavus ober is an image maker for those who 
already have it 
money clothes looks personality probably in that order 
for a minimum 10500 per sixmonth season ober sees that his 
personal clients are launched into social orbit he makes sure they 
are invited to new yorks proper parties that they sit at 
influential tables at glamorous galas and have dazzling guest lists 
for their own soirees 
getting ober to take you on is no small social coup 
i dont take on anybody who i dont think has it he says 
simply 
seated on an overstuffed magenta couch behind a coffee table 
ladened with copies of vanity fair and gourmet magazines ober 
describes himself as one of a handful of personal publicists in 
the big apple who can do in six months what it would take someone 
even with the most vibrant qualities six years to accomplish on the 
social circuit 
its expensive he admits you have to have the clothes 
especially if youre a woman a few terribly expensive 
sensational dresses are just the core of the necessary wardrobe 
he said 
and you have to be willing to entertain and willing to buy 
tickets to charity benefits among the more popular grazing 
grounds of the wantless 
ober even will try to persuade architectural digest to feature a 
clients apartment if the apartment is up to it and if the client 
is willing to live with the risks that go along with the general 
public knowing just how many ming vases are sitting on the 
mantlepiece 
while reluctant to disclose his client list the rotund 
over50yearold ober said many are wealthy newcomers to the 
city 
the reason they seek him out ober says is that people are 
looking for recognition from their peers as well as the working 
class guy riding the subway who invariably will read about them in 
the gossip columns of the daily tabloids 
much ink goes to what ober calls nouvelle society the 
likes of real estate devloper donald trump and his czechborn wife 
ivana 
you cant pick up a paper without the daily press release on 
the trumps he sniffed 
new york is a different animal of a city attributes like 
nice and intelligent may suffice elsewhere but in new york 
the operative characteristic is to be amusing 
society is a surface scene so you have to have the right 
qualities in particular to be amusing ober said to be 
interesting to anybody here you have to have a serious interest 
he said citing two cosmetic queens 
elizabeth arden had her horses and helena rubenstein had her 
art he noted ironically investor asher edelman considered by 
some to have amassed the most impressive private art collection in 
the city typically is absent from obers social scene 
ober lived very much the life of many of his clients attending 
the prestigious st pauls boarding school and princeton 
university where he graduated with a degree in english 
he worked five years as a reporter for the baltimore sun 
interrupted by a stint in the army and later traveled the country 
for samph greenstamps before coming to settle in new york with no 
particular game plan 
but society is his element and circulating in it his great 
pleasure ober realized that when he was about 16 years old and 
attended a very glamorous new years eve party at the home of 
mrs evalyn walsh mclean the socialite who bought the hope diamond 
and wore it until she died in 1947 
very few people have the staff to give a party at home 
anymore he said waxing sentimental about a bygone era of maids 
in starchwhite aprons cucumber sandwiches and silver tea trays 
among some of obers observations 
ladies that lunch those eulogized by songwriter stephen 
sondheim have become a dying breed 
playboys are out a lot of people play but the label isnt 
that helpful anymore 
its okay to befriend a few penniless little people as 
long as they are amusing 
safaris in kenya are still in as long as youre there to 
socialize with government officials and wealthy expatriates and not 
to charge after wild game

crammed with the shirts mugs and other items 
the corporate headquarters also known as the family room is 
adorned with photos of the couples three children holly 8 deena 
6 and ari almost 4 the children wander in to use the tv set and 
vcr sometimes they like their parents model the companys 
clothes 
the eckers have parttime help these days enough so that 
notices about workmens compensation and labor laws are posted 
alongside the kids photos 
but the companys tollfree number is generally answered by the 
eckers even if it wakes them up at 2 am 
all of this came of that single baseball cap that ecker received 
five years ago and of the caps popularity 
every time ecker wore it to the beach another belly came up to 
me and asked where i got the hat they wanted it for their 
husbands ecker said 
for ecker who had spent his life selling toilet paper the 
inspiration couldnt have come at a better time toilet paper was 
losing its glamour i used to tell people i was working my way up 
to tissues said ecker 
armed with his sense of humor and marketing skills the eckers 
took their talents to a hidden market the relatives of the 
babytobe and to jazz it up they replaced the be in father 
to be with a yellow bumblebee 
when ecker first took samples of his hats and shirts to 
retailers small maternity shops were his best customers he found 
that the people who bought the items were not men but momstobe 
department stores were uninterested and remain indifferent they 
have no departments for mens maternity items 
eckers road trips and mailorder advertising in maternity 
magazines paid off he abandoned the toilet paper trade in 1984 to 
devote himself to beegotten creations and expanded the family line 
to include grandmas grandpas sisters and brothers 
while relatives provided a fresh market for the eckers novelty 
items the eckers soon realized that the real money was in 
maternity clothes 
so now the garagewarehouse stocks nursing shirts reading 
id rather be sleeping maternity underwear with the slogan 
oh to be thin again and tshirts and nightshirts from prego 
state and camp prego 
the company boasts 54 different items and more to come with a 
new focus on the actual baby shirts bibs and stretchies bearing 
such prophetic sayings as princess to bee trouble to bee 
doctor to bee and extremely complex to bee 
if susan was the center of attention during her pregnancies 
lloyd plays the starring role at beegotten creations hes the 
companys president says susan because its hard to live with a 
6foot4 poutty man 
last year ecker tried to start a new business when a woman 
found out she was pregnant she would call ecker he would don a 
bumblebee outfit and went to the husbands office there 
resplendent in his yellowandblack finery he would announce that 
the husband was a fathertobe 
after a dozen or so such calls the beeman went into 
semiretirement because of cold weather its unclear whether 
summer will witness the revival of the 6foot4 walking insect

tom klimovich paused looked at his boss 
and made sure he wasnt revealing any secrets when he talked about 
his toughest decision since becoming a director at seymour 
specialty wire 
given the goahead klimovich told about his vote approving a 
consultants plan that has resulted in the elimination of 13 jobs 
at the 110yearold mill bought three years ago by its employees 
klimovichs position was the same as that of eight other 
directors but he was more vulnerable to criticism he is president 
of united auto workers local 1827 and as such is trusted with 
protecting the companys bluecollar workers 
when push comes to shove decisions are made for the best 
interest of the company its not easy sometimes said klimovich 
its been onthejob experience from the day we decided to to 
this its been an education 
the companys employees bought the plant from national 
distillers amp chemical corp a little more than three years ago on 
april 17 1985 for a reported 10 million they established an 
employee stock ownership plan or esop under which each employee 
owns a piece of the company 
seymour wire is the largest employeeowned company in 
connecticut and has a management team unlike any other in the 
country according to president carl drescher 
the company is run by nine directors that include the company 
president the union president five elected employees and two 
outside members selected by the other seven 
the arrangement has led to a democratically run company that 
often finds its members wearing more than one hat making some 
difficult choices 
the company has been profitable for its roughly 220 employees 
55 of whom are salaried it doesnt make its finances public but 
it will be free of creditors in about five years 
about 60 percent of the stock is still held by those who loaned 
money for the buyout drescher said from his office overlooking the 
mill and the nearby naugatuck river 
drescher a 58yearold woodbury resident was plant manager 
when the employees made their buyout offer he had been at the 
company for 11 years at the time and fully supported the move 
because the mill was profitable 
national distillers had decided to sell the wire mill simply 
because it wanted out of the metals business 
freed from a corporate parent seymour wire has learned to 
handle its own insurance and pension plans and monitor its 
finances with existing staff said drescher 
we had to put in a computer and take care of all these other 
functions drescher said but the other thing is we are more 
free to do what needs to be done we dont have a hierarchy to go 
through we make up our own minds here 
given its success seymour wire has been visited by people from 
across this country and as far away as china drescher said it can 
be distracting and he tries to limit company tours but he does 
have some advice for others considering a similar course of action 
if its a unionized operation its important that there has 
been good union relations beforehand he said youve also got 
to have a viable operation i think some esops have been tried 
where perhaps they shouldnt have been this was not a lastgasp 
effort to save jobs 
drescher has put his experience at the plant to good use but he 
also continues to gain more business knowhow his most recent 
learning experience was the negotiation of a new threeyear 
contract with the bluecollar employees 
the previous contract had been negotiated when the plant was 
sold and a new one was put in place on the the companys third 
anniversary 
the board is controlled by employees it was a difficult 
position for union officials to be directors drescher said 
they have to represent the interests of the union and 
shareholders 
the contract took about two weeks to negotiate and klimovich 
said it was unique because all employees know the companys 
finances 
i knew what the company could do and it helped said 
klimovich who at age 43 has worked at the plant for 17 years his 
father worked at the plant for more than 40 years 
the unionized workers earn an average of about 25000 a year 
and receive shares of the stock based upon their earnings said 
drescher the company has a turnover of about 12 employees a year 
which helped the company implement the consultants recommendations 
that troubled klimovich 
the consultant said the company needed to reorganize its work 
schedules to become more efficient seymour wire decided to make 
the schedule change and adjust to the subsequent loss of 13 jobs 
through attrition rather than layoffs that process is now nearly 
complete 
drescher and klimovich said the labormanagement problems 
encountered at the company are no different than when it was owned 
by national distillers employees however are more willing to 
voice their opinions and suggestions 
its beneficial for them to say something they point out 
things that need to be addressed drescher said 
the grumblers are grumblers there are people who are going to 
grumble no matter waht you do said klimovich

kansas courts may apply that states laws in a 
natural gas royalties dispute between an oil company and mineral 
rights owners from five states the supreme court ruled today 
the justices by a 62 vote ruled that applying kansas law to 
claims against sun oil co by people in other states is valid 
the decision carried in an opinion by justice antonin scalia 
upheld a kansas supreme court ruling that sun is liable for 
interest on some previously suspended gas royalties 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice sandra day 
oconnor dissented and justice anthony m kennedy did not 
participate 
the controversy began in 1979 when property owners in kansas 
sued sun in state court to recover royalties for higher gas rates 
charged to the companys customers 
some 3100 owners of natural gas leases in texas oklahoma 
louisiana new mexico and mississippi were represented in the class 
action lawsuit 
sun had suspended payment of some royalties while awaiting 
approval of the higher gas rates by the federal power commission 
after the rates were approved the leaseholders sought to 
recover not only the higher royalties but also the interest they 
said they were owed for suns use of their money 
the kansas supreme court ruled last year sun owed interest on 
the increased royalties based on rates prevailing in kansas during 
the time the suit was pending 
the interest rates ranged from 105 percent to 165 percent 
the kansas court also ruled the states statute of limitations 
imposing a fiveyear deadline for filing such suits applied to all 
claims against sun regardless of what state the gas rights are 
located 
the nations highest court agreed last october to hear suns 
appeal and today it ruled against the company 
the case is sun oil vs wortman 87352

the european space agency sent 
three satellites into orbit wednesday on the first ariane 4 a 
powerful new rocket it hopes will provide a competitive edge in the 
race to commercialize space 
ariane 4 blasted off without a hitch into clear skies above the 
space agency center on the north coast of south america at 819 
am officials of arianespace the agencys commercial arm 
proclaimed the inaugural launch a complete success 
president francois mitterrand of france sent a telegram saying 
this new step in the space program assures the lasting presence 
of europe in the world launch competition that will be more and 
more difficult 
arianespace already hauls half the worlds commercial payloads 
and has 67 launch contracts worth 34 billion it counts on 
wednesdays launch to demonstrate the space readiness and 
reliability of the ariane 4 europes biggest and most versatile 
rocket ever 
firststage boosters fired 66 seconds after liftoff and the 
final thirdstage rockets fired at 5 minutes 49 seconds into the 
flight the rocket reached orbit in 12 minutes 46 seconds with its 
international payload the european meteosat p2 and amsat 3c and 
the american pas 1 
technicians at the space center said the boosters fired and 
orbit was achieved precisely as planned frederic dallest 
chairman of arianespace called the launch a milestone in the 
development of the european space effort 
europe developed the ariane over six years at a cost of 575 
million and will compete in the coming decade with commercial 
launch programs in the united states soviet union china and 
japan by 1992 the international commercial launch market is 
expected to be worth 1 billion a year 
the us space program has been stalled since the shuttle 
challenger blew up in january 1986 killing all seven astronauts 
aboard 
ariane 4 will be europes workhorse on the world launch 
services market until the end of this century according to a 
statement by arianespace officials it can lift 46 tons into orbit 
compared with 28 tons for ariane 3 its predecessor 
the next rocket ariane 5 is not expected to begin service 
until 1995 
in addition to providing increased power the ariane 4 design 
allows engineers to use different configurations of solid and 
liquid boosters tailoring the vehicle to a clients specific 
budget and needs the agency said 
on wednesday it used two liquid and two solid boosters 
meteostatp2 will furnish weather data to 16 european countries 
the 1559pound satellite will monitor weather over most of europe 
africa the middle east and the eastern half of south america it 
replaces the meteostat f2 launched in 1981 which until recently 
sent back pictures every half hour 
amsat 3c a 330pound satellite known by the nickname oscar 13 
will serve the amateur radio operators around the world 
the american satellite pas 1 owned by the american 
telecommunications company pan american satellite is to provide 
telecommuncations service at moderate cost among latin america the 
united states and europe

americas overall trade deficit widened unexpectedly in the 
first quarter of the year the government said today in an ominous 
report about the us economic future 
the commerce department release came one day after stocks and 
bonds rallied powerfully in reaction to another report that the 
april merchandise trade deficit shrank to 989 billion the best 
showing in more than three years 
but the department said today the broadest measure of us 
trade which includes services and investment earnings as well as 
merchandise showed a 398 billion deficit in the first quarter 
vs a 335 billion deficit the previous quarter the rise was from 
a decline in investment earnings abroad 
this figure is considered important because it is a key 
reflection of how the united states has been transformed from the 
worlds largest creditor nation six years ago into the worlds 
largest debtor now 
it means americas wealth must now be transferred abroad to 
service its debt and the only way the total debt will be reduced is 
for the country to start running surpluses in merchandise which 
experts do not expect soon 
many economists have warned the debt service burden will 
eventually lower americans standard of living the price the 
united states will have to pay for living beyond its means in the 
1980s 
the latest trade news and fear of a midwestern drought combined 
to have a sobering effect on wall street the dow jones average of 
30 industrial stocks which surged 25 points to a postcrash high 
tuesday was off 587 points at 211860 by midday bond prices 
also eased after a strong showing tuesday 
other government reports released today suggested a mixed 
picture of the economy 
the commerce department said retail sales restrained by lagging 
car purchases rose a scant 01 percent in may evidence of weak 
consumer demand and a possible economic slowdown 
on the other hand the federal reserve said production at the 
nations factories mines and utilities rose a moderate 04 percent 
in may the eighth consecutive month without a decline 
with the latest growth overall industrial production now stands 
61 percent higher than it was a year ago a further sign of the 
resurgence of the us manufacturing sector 
in other news tuesday oil prices rose after the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries decided to prolong an 
outputrestraint pact until the end of the year 
on the new york mercantile exchange the july contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil rose 40 cents to 
settle at 1683 per barrel 
elsewhere major automakers said sales of domestically built 
cars and light trucks fell 41 percent in early june from last 
years levels for the same period but industry analysts attributed 
the decline largely to buying incentives that inflated sales in the 
yearearlier period 
car sales were down for all domestic makers except toyota motor 
corp which was just beginning us production last year and 
mazda motor corp which began us production in september

a jury has rejected a 48 million suit filed 
by a couple who said their audi 5000 car surged forward and killed 
their 6yearold son 
the federal jury deliberated three hours tuesday before finding 
in favor of audi ag of west germany and its parent volkswagen of 
america in one of numerous suits alleging audis are subject to 
sudden unintended acceleration 
john and kristi bradosky of jackson township near canton had 
said their son joshua was pinned between the car and their garage 
wall in 1986 
mrs bradosky said the engine was running and that she had 
shifted from park into drive and gently placed her foot on the 
accelerator when the car surged forward and would not stop despite 
pressure on the brake pedal 
the family sought 24 million in compensatory damages each from 
audi and volkswagen they also asked for 36 million in punitive 
damages from volkswagen but us district judge david dowd had 
barred such an award 
the judge had instructed the jurors to find for the defendants 
if they were unable to name a defect that caused the accident 
the jury found no defect in the vehicle said ian ceresney 
an attorney for audi i think it vindicates our case it 
demonstrated that the jury found the vehicle did not cause the 
accident 
bradosky said he had not decided whether to appeal i think 
the jury has made a decision and we think it was a wrong 
decision he said they made a critical error in judgment 
the center for auto safety a consumer group based in 
washington contends at least 1646 accidents resulting in 402 
injuries and five deaths have been linked to sudden acceleration 
when the audi 5000 was shifted into gear 
investigators have been unable to find any defect common to the 
vehicles that would cause the problem 
audi last week offered to settle a classaction lawsuit in 
chicago that could affect as many as 300000 audi owners 
nationwide under the proposed settlement the company would pay up 
to 2000 to past and current owners of audi 5000s who buy a new 
audi the automaker did not admit fault

the working mother has made the transition 
from novelty to national norm with more than half of new mothers 
remaining in the job market for the first time the census bureau 
reported wednesday 
every time a statistic approaches the 50 percent mark of the 
labor force its not an oddity anymore its a way of life said 
martin oconnell chief of the bureaus fertility statistics branch 
the labor force participation rate for new mothers climbed to 
508 percent last year from 498 percent in 1986 marking the first 
time a majority of women reported they were working or actively 
seeking employment within a year of giving birth 
by comparison only 31 percent of new mothers were counted in 
the labor force in 1976 the first year the census bureau sought to 
calculate this rate 
oconnell noted that the share of new mothers remaining in the 
workforce has grown steadily over the last decade a result of 
womens increasing propensity to delay marriage and childbearing in 
favor of jobs and education 
women who accumulate more years of schooling and work experience 
before having children have greater financial resources to enable 
them once they have a child to obtain childcare services and get 
back to the labor force much quicker oconnell explained in a 
telephone interview 
in addition they have increased career commitment and 
increased cost of staying out of the labor force compared to an 
18 or 19yearold who had a child earlier in life he said 
oconnell pointed to findings that 68 percent of women who had 
their first child at age 30 or over remained in the job market 
compared with 54 percent of those age 18 to 24 
for new mothers with college degrees the job rate was 63 
percent well above the 38 percent rate for those whose education 
ended during high school 
the new study fertility of american women june 1987 also 
disclosed a substantial increase in the number of twoearner 
families with children it concentrated on women age 18 to 44 the 
normal childbearing ages 
the increasing share of mothers returning to jobs led to a total 
of 134 million twoworker families with children last year up 
from 83 million in 1976 
the number of childless couples with both husband and wife 
employed and the wife of childbearing age increased from 30 
million to 43 million over the 11year period 
a lot has been said about dinks dualincome nokids 
families and given the attention one would be led to think 
there are many more than there actually are oconnell said 
the real story is the number of dualemployed couples where 
they have a child thats the big nesws thats been happening 
the last 10 years said oconnell 
at 134 million dualearner couples with children make up more 
than 40 percent of all married couples in the childbearing ages 
oconnell pointed out 
that he added means that american businesses will have to pay 
close attention to the needs of these workers and families 
oconnell addressed the topic last year in a separate privately 
published analysis juggling jobs and babies americas child 
care challenge 
that report which he said remains valid warned that smaller 
numbers of people born in recent years means fewer workers 
available making it harder for business to replace experienced 
women who have children 
the result will be a need to cope with the needs of working 
mothers including such possibilities as flexible work schedules 
employersponsored child care flexible benefit plans and other new 
approaches he wrote 
other findings of the new census bureau study included 
the national birth rate for the 12 months ended in june 1987 
was 71 births per 1000 women age 18 to 44 up slightly from the 
rate of 703 per 1000 a year earlier the rate was 685 for white 
women 832 for black women and 958 for hispanic women it was 
950 for married women 381 for single women and 235 for women 
who were widowed or divorced 
labor force participation among new mothers was 53 percent for 
blacks 51 percent for whites and 36 percent for hispanics 
widowed divorced and separated mothers were most likely to be 
working at 66 percent married women were second at 498 percent 
followed by single mothers at 495 percent

if 1987 was an off year for the nations 
retailers 1988 bears the earmarks of disaster 
storeowners whose sales have run at a sluggish pace since early 
last year have seen their results deteriorate further in recent 
months and are being forced to tighten their belts 
theyre watching their expenses carefully theyve cut back on 
new stores they open said fred wintzer a retail industry 
analyst with the investment firm alex brown amp sons inc in 
baltimore 
robert buchanan an analyst with ag edwards amp sons inc in st 
louis estimated overall retail sales have risen 1 to 2 percent so 
far this year compared with the same period in 1987 
thats probably 2 percent below where retailers would have 
liked to be well below their plan he said 
buchanans assessment is based on what the retail industry calls 
samestore sales those from stores open for at least 12 months 
analysts say these sales provide a more accurate scale for 
comparing a stores yeartoyear performance than do figures that 
include sales from newer stores 
individual results from some of the biggest retailers support 
buchanans estimate the nations largest retailer sears roebuck 
and co said its samestore sales through the end of may were up 
11 percent while no 2 k mart corp reported a 17 percent 
increase jc penney co inc had a 15 percent gain as did 
dayton hudson corp 
some retailers reported declines may department stores co 
sales fell 03 percent and the apparel retailer limited inc 
suffered a 5 percent drop 
walmart stores inc with a 12 percent gain is one of the rare 
exceptions to the rule analysts attribute the discounters 
enviable performance to its aggressive price discounts 
but overall with sales increases of 2 percent or less the 
industry is losing profits firstquarter results were generally 
disappointing and losing ground to inflation 
through may wholesale prices rose 34 percent while consumer 
prices jumped 45 percent through april according to us labor 
department figures 
a couple of points must be kept in mind no one neither 
analysts nor the stores themselves expected 1988 to be a banner 
year and the first half of any year is not as important to 
retailers as the second half which includes the backtoschool and 
holiday seasons 
that aside 1988 has been terrible analysts say consumers have 
spent gingerly while they pay off high installment debt levels 
the year was projected to be bad and turned out worse said 
wintzer of alex brown 
the head counts going into the stores havent changed people 
are spending less said joseph ronning an analyst with brown 
brothers harriman inc instead of buying two items youre buying 
one 
the problem is compounded in the womens clothing sector where 
sales have been slowed by boredom as much as frugality consumers 
who grew disenchanted with the fashions last fall are equally 
unenthused about spring and summer wear 
whats in the stores is competing primarily with whats in 
womens closets and the closets are winning said william smith 
an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
after last years disappointing sales many retailers went into 
1988 with already conservative plans for instance deb shops inc 
a chain of nearly 279 womens apparel stores decided to open fewer 
locations this year than last year president marvin rounick said 
but some retailers are cutting back even further making 
adjustments in expansion programs and buying operations 
building plans and store additions are being tapered down 
said buchanan of ag edwards 
the retailers tended to downplay any cutbacks while 
acknowledging that times are difficult 
zayre corp has trimmed its plans to open approximately 100 new 
stores by one or two stores said vice president and treasurer 
steven wishner 
we have not made any significant changes to our store opening 
plan he said but added we are constantly reviewing the 
situation 
the sales decline has also made retailers take a harder look 
before signing real estate contracts 
when sales get soft like this it seems prudent to take a 
waitandsee attitude said matt miller a senior vice president 
at petrie stores corp which operates more than 1600 specialty 
stores 
weve postponed making certain deals until we get a better 
feel for the real estate outlook miller said 
charming shoppes inc with more than 850 apparel stores has 
had to consider slumping sales when deciding whether a particular 
location was affordable said vice president bernard brodsky 
we turned down a bigger percentage of the real estate deals 
that were shown to us brodsky said 
like many other retailers charming shoppes has kept its 
inventory low and delayed buying for the coming seasons brodsky 
said 
if things had turned about in the spring we would have been 
more positive about our buying in the fall he said when we 
see things are doing well we will then finish up the remainder of 
our buying 
whether business will pick up is a matter for debate among the 
analysts in part because a hopedfor autumn recovery in apparel 
sales may not materialize monroe h greenstein an analyst with 
bear stearns amp co said fashions being testmarketed have failed 
to excite consumers 
it looks like for the fall there may not be any strong 
fashion trend he said 
smith the analyst at smith barney was very pessimistic if i 
had to guess id say we write off 88 he said 
more upbeat was walter loeb an analyst with morgan stanley amp 
co the second half will be much stronger 
i dont think the fashion message will be very strong but it 
will be enough of an incentive to bring customers back into the 
stores loeb said 
if nothing else industry observers say last years results 
will make the secondhalf performance appear more robust 
youre going to have easier comparisons said ronning of 
brown brothers

rally touched off a bout of profittaking 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which surged 25 points

but alfred goldman director of technical market analysis at 
ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis said traders used the

whenever the market gets overbought traders look for an 
excuse to take profits he said 
most observers remain optimistic that the market is just taking 
a breather after the dows 200point runup over the past two weeks 
were overdue for a pretty nice correction jensen said 
any setback would be the normal thing to expect

the financial liability of promoters of 
business deals that turn sour was expanded wednesday by the supreme 
court 
the justices also ruled the government does not have to place 
restrictions on imported uranium to help protect domestic producers 
of the nuclear fuel 
in the business deal promotion case the court ruled a texas 
oilman might not have to bear full financial liability for selling 
unregistered oil and gas leases the court said a promoter of the 
deal who also bought the securities himself might be forced to 
share liability 
the court in a 71 decision overturned a ruling that favored 
the promoter and it ordered further lower court study of the case 
the securities and exchange commission had argued that promoters 
who are not themselves sellers of securities should not be immune 
from penalties in such cases 
billy bj pinter head of black gold oil co had sold oil 
and gas rights in texas and oklahoma to a group of investors in 
1981 maurice dahl a california real estate broker helped put the 
deal together 
dahl thought the leases would be lucrative and promoted their 
sale to his friends and family members when the leases proved 
worthless the investors including dahl sued pinter 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1986 that pinter 
violated federal law by failing to register the securities the 
appeals court upheld a federal judges ruling that pinter must 
reimburse the investors for their losses plus interest 
pinter argued that dahl because he promoted the investment was 
himself a seller of securities who should be forced to share 
the cost of reimbursement 
the 5th circuit court noting that dahl did not receive a 
commission for promoting the deal said he was more a buyer than a 
seller 
but the supreme court ordered further hearings to explore that 
issue 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said there 
must be further study to determine whether dahl bears at least 
substantially equal responsibility for the failure to register the 
oil and gas interests or to distribute the securities in a manner 
that conformed with federal law 
he said there was conflicting evidence about dahls role in the 
deal 
a person in dahls position must share financial liability for 
the sale of unregistered securities if his role was more as a 
promoter than as an investor blackmun said 
in the import case the court overturned by unanimous vote a 
decision barring federal officials from enriching foreign uranium 
particularly from canada and australia for import into the united 
states 
adminsitration officials had argued the ban jeopardized us 
trade nuclear cooperation and nonproliferation policies and could 
limit the supply of fuel used to run electric utility company 
nuclear reactors 
the decision reversed a ruling by the 10th us circuit court of 
appeals based in denver which said last year that the department 
of energy must restrict enrichment of foreign uranium to safeguard 
the deteriorating domestic industry 
blackmun again writing for the court said federal law did not 
require the department to restrict enrichment unless it was assured 
such action would maintain a viable domestic uranium industry 
federal officials determined the industry had not been viable 
since 1983 
uranium must be enriched to serve as nuclear fuel because in its 
natural state it lacks an adequate concentration of a fissionable 
material known as isotope u235 
the government has a monopoly in providing enrichment services 
in this country and federal officials said at least 300 million a 
year in fees for enrichment services was at stake in the case 
the justice department said restricting enriched uranium from 
other countries could force up prices of electricity to consumers 
here as supplies of the nuclear fuel dwindled 
the government was opposed by three us uranium producers 
western nuclear inc energy fuels inc and uranium resources inc 
the producers were supported by officials from wyoming new 
mexico colorado utah arizona and nevada they said their state 
economies would be hurt by the collapse of the uranium industry 
in two other rulings the court 
said kansas courts could apply that states laws in a natural 
gas royalties dispute between an oil company and mineral rights 
owners from five states 
allowed americans who sue foreign corporations to notify those 
companies through their us subsidiaries

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed 
dramatically higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade with 
nearly all contracts up their daily trading limits on continuing 
dryweather concerns 
were looking at the potential worst drought the worst 
disaster in history said steve freed an analyst in chicago with 
dean witter reynolds inc 
fears of severe drought damage to corn and soybean crops 
deepened during the trading session as a band of showers moving 
into illinois and indiana weakened and produced only scattered 
sprinkles analysts said 
the drought has begun to take a toll on the corn crop and could 
reduce soybean yields if it continues into july analysts 
suggested oat and spring wheat crops have already suffered 
irreversible damage 
the exchange announced after the close of trading that it was 
raising the daily price limit on corn futures from 10 cents to 15 
cents a bushel 
the higher limit will remain in effect for at least three 
sessions in accordance with exchange rules which require a 150 
percent increase in limits following two consecutive days of 
limitup moves corn futures also traded limitup on tuesday 
at the close wheat was 14 cents to 20 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 394 a bushel corn was 10 cents 
higher across the board with july at 279 a bushel oats were 10 
cents higher across the board with july at 279 a bushel

the european economic community 
proposed wednesday that steel production quotas in the 12nation 
trading bloc be eliminated on june 30 
the eec commission said an improvement in demand and prices in 
the european steel market would allow the quotas to be dropped 
after eight years the quota system was set up in 1980 to allow the 
steel companies time to restructure their operations in face of a 
worldwide surplus in steel production capacity 
despite the upturn in the steel industry the commission said 
its plan to return the steel sector to free competition would lead 
to the loss of about 55000 jobs over the next three years 
the commissions proposal which is to be discussed by industry 
ministers on june 24 followed an informal agreement in may that 
quotas for hotrolled coil which is used in the automobile 
industry and coldrolled sheet should be abolished 
the commission went further in proposing to also scrap quotas 
for heavy plate used mainly in shipbuilding and for heavy 
sections sold to the construction industry 
the quotas now prop up prices for about 40 percent of the blocs 
steel output which amounted to 1265 million metric tons in 1987 
the commission said its plan to end the quotas also was in 
response to the failure of the european steel industry to come 
forward with cuts in production capacity amounting to about 15 
million metric tons 
last december the trade bloc extended the quotas for at least 
six months on the condition steel companies make firm commitments 
to shut down excess production capacity 
the commission said the industry had not made any major 
commitments to close 75 million tons of capacity for production of 
hotrolled coil and coldrolled sheet as decided last december 
this implied there was not a crisis in these sectors the 
commission said noting that eec steel mills were operating at a 
high 77 percent of capacity and that prices were rising regularly 
in the other two sectors heavy plate and heavy sections 
commitments to close capacity fell far short of the 69 million 
tons earmarked in december the commission said 
however it said capacity cuts in those two sectors were still 
necessary as mills operated at a low 60 percent despite a rise in 
prices

prime minister noboru takeshita said wednesday 
japan has now gained the status of an economic power and it is his 
responsibility to assert that role at the upcoming economic summit 
in toronto 
takeshita said his goals at the summit which begins next week 
are to discuss cooperation on trade resolving the problems of 
international debt and restoring selfsustained growth to 
developing countries 
in advance of the meeting which president reagan and leaders of 
five other nations will attend takeshita sounded unconcerned about 
trade problems with the united states and ongoing talks to resolve 
them the prime minister said it is natural for the two countries 
to occasionally disagree 
we have come to share this deep relationship bilaterally and 
it is natural that we should face a greater number of frictions 
he said as friction arises we should address and resolve those 
problems jointly 
however he said all countries concerned ourselves as well as 
our trade partners should be careful so that individual issues 
will not lead to an unreasonable nationalism 
us and japanese officials have been haggling for months on 
trade issues including a prolonged dispute over opening japanese 
markets to more imports of american beef and oranges 
the united states wants the total removal of the beef and citrus 
import quotas it had accepted in a 1984 agreement that expired in 
march japan has balked at the demand 
nearly two weeks ago during a reagantakeshita meeting in 
london us officials praised japan for the progress the country 
has made in opening up its markets to american goods and boosting 
domestic demand in its economy to narrow its trade surplus 
the prime minister said wednesday he is pleased with japans 
growth rate and noted that unemployment and inflation have been 
kept down 
seen from the international perspective its fit that japan 
has gained the status of an economic power takeshita said 
adding it is my responsibility to assert that strength at the 
toronto meeting 
leaders from west germany canada britain france and italy 
also will be at the summit 
takeshita said that at the gathering he wants to discuss his 
concerns about asias newly industrialized economies hong kong 
singapore taiwan and south korea and regional problems such as 
cambodia and the philippines 
he said japan is considering further debt relief to 
underdeveloped countries and would like to improve cooperation with 
international financial institutions 
japan is the worlds largest donor of overseas economic aid in 
the fiscal year ended march 31 it gave 74 billion to developing 
countries 
foreign minister sosuke uno said last week the government would 
increase overseas aid if other nations need it

workers at zenith electronics corps 
springfield television manufacturing plant want to buy the factory 
but zenith is blocking their bid the employees union charged 
wednesday 
zenith is actively talking with other bidders including 
foreign firms but so far refuses even to provide its employees 
with the financial information necessary to structure a bid said 
jj barry president of the international brotherhood of 
electrical workers 
zenith spokesman john taylor reached by telephone at company 
headquarters in glenview ill said he was aware of the ibews 
charges but had no further comment he would not confirm that the 
springfield plant is for sale 
the management of zenith has known of the employeess interest 
in buying the plant since the beginning of april barry said 
now they have informed us that if allowed to bid we will be 
given less than one week to prepare an offer 
barry said corporate bidders have been negotiating with zenith 
since may he asked zenith to give the union more time to prepare 
its own bid or a joint bid with another party 
the employees should be given a fair opportunity to 
participate in a process that will have an enormous effect on their 
lives and welfare barry said 
the springfield plant is the only american manufacturer of 
television sets it employs more than 1600 hourly workers 
zenith has suffered losses as a result of heavy foreign 
competition in an effort to save the springfield plant last year

bank of new york co sweetened its offer for 
rival irving bank corp on wednesday slightly raising the stock 
portion of the bid and adding other shareholder incentives 
including a special cash dividend 
but some banking analysts predicted irving management would 
continue to snub its persistent suitor in favor of a friendly 
merger with the staterun banca commerciale italiana spa italys 
secondlargest bank 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady valued the revised bid for 
all of irvings 185 million shares outstanding at around 14 
billion about 25 percent higher than the existing hostile 11 
billion tender offer which remains in place 
the new proposal is subject to approval from irvings board of 
directors and redemption of its antitakeover poison pill 
which would make an unsolicited merger prohibitively expensive 
irving had no comment on the latest bid except to say that its 
board of directors would consider it at its next meeting june 21 
the bid was presented during a 40minute meeting wednesday morning 
between irving chairman joseph rice and bank of new york chairm j 
carter bacot 
the meeting was scheduled after new york state supreme court 
justice herman cahn suggested the two banks attempt to bridge their 
differences bank of new york has gone to court to invalidate 
irvings poison pill and overturn the results of a proxy battle in 
which shareholders recently chose irvings incumbent board over 
bank of new yorks nominees 
bacot maintained that bank of new yorks new bid is clearly 
superior to the banca commerciale offer which has a blended 
value of as much as much as 7650 per share 
wall street also acted positively in trading on the new york 
stock exchange irving jumped 387 a share to 7012 while bank 
of new york fell 75 cents to 33 
bank of new york said its new offer worth around 76 a share 
includes 15 in cash 1675 shares of its stock a onetime 250 
cash dividend and securities valued at up to 250 per share the 
securities promise to disburse profits from the sale of irvings 
wall street headquarters 
the existing tender offer which expires later this month is 
for 15 in cash and 1575 shares of bank of new york stock or 
around 64 a share 
banca commerciale is offering 80 a share for 51 percent of 
irving or about 760 million the proposal is part of a complex 
defensive restructuring plan that includes among other things 
sale of irving assets costcutting measures and a special cash 
dividend 
analysts werent surprised bank of new york upped the stakes in 
the 9monthold takeover saga since its existing hostile bid was 
having little success with shareholders and management but some 
questioned whether it would do any good 
just reading through the lines the fact that irvings formal 
response was that its board of directors would meet next week seems 
to indicate theyre somewhat cool to the offer said michael 
starr of duff amp phelps inc in chicago if they were truly 
interested they would have looked into it much sooner than that 
virginia adair of merrill amp lynch co agreed that irving 
remained committed to keeping its current management intact which 
would happen through a merger with banca commerciale not bank of 
new york 
i think irving will be hoping bci will raise its offer she 
said 
but starr said at this point in time i dont see any reason 
for bci to increase its offer however if some of those court 
cases are won by bank of new york bci would have to increase its 
offer to remain competitive 
he said on the surface bank of new yorks bid appears slightly 
more attractive because it offers shareholders tax advantages that 
banca commerciale doesnt and already has received regulatory 
approval

grain and soybean prices shot up the daily maximum wednesday 
while livestock and meat futures fell their limits as the drought 
continued to weigh heavily on the nations commodities markets 
worries about crops shortfalls spurred the latest rise in grain 
prices while livestock traders feared their market could be 
flooded if herds had to be reduced extensively because of feed 
shortages 
on other markets cotton futures soared energy futures slumped 
precious metals advanced and stockindex futures rose slightly 
nearly all contracts for future delivery of grains soybeans and 
soybean products shot up their daily limits early in the session on 
the chicago board of trade 
fears of drought damage to corn and soybean crops deepened as a 
band of showers moving into illinois and indiana weakened and 
produced only scattered sprinkles analysts said 
the drought has begun to take a toll on the corn crop and could 
reduce soybean yields if it continues into july analysts said oat 
and spring wheat crops already have suffered irreversible damage 
im having a little trouble quantifying the worst drought in 
60 years im only 30 years old said steve freed an analyst 
with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago were looking at the 
potential worst drought the worst disaster in history 
after the close the national weather service issued a new 6to 
10day forecast calling for belownormal rainfall in the grain belt 
in the middle and latter portions of next week 
the board of trade announced after the close that it was raising 
the daily price limit on corn futures from 10 cents to 15 cents a 
bushel 
the higher limit will remain in effect for at least three 
sessions in accordance with exchange rules which require a 50 
percent increase in limits following two consecutive days of 
maximum price moves corn futures also rose the maximum on tuesday 
wheat settled 12 cents to 20 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 394 a bushel corn was 10 cents higher across 
the board with july at 279 a bushel oats also were 10 cents 
higher in all contracts with july at 279 a bushel and soybeans 
were 27 cents to 30 cents higher with july at 920 a bushel 
many livestock and meat futures plunged their daily limits on 
the chicago mercantile exchange where traders feared the high cost 
of feed grains would prompt widespread liquidation of cattle and 
hog herds if the dry weather continued 
livestock producers already have begun reducing their herds by 
sending more animals to market which increases the supply of meat 
said chuck levitt an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
chicago 
but widespread herd liquidation this year would be followed by 
tight supplies of meat and sharply higher prices next year 
because of a corresponding drop in births levitt said 
the factors that are driving the grain and soybean complex 
higher are the same exact factors forcing the livestock markets 
lower he said you are creating a catastrophic situation as 
far as the herd is concerned by continuing this drought 
cattle and hog futures are limited to daily moves of 1 cents a 
pound while frozen pork belly futures have a 2cent limit 
live cattle settled 150 cents lower to 05 cent higher with 
the june delivery contract at 7030 cents a pound feeder cattle 
were 150 cents lower across the board with august at 7177 cents 
a pound hogs were 150 cents lower to 55 cent higher with june 
at 4915 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 172 cents to 
2 cents lower with july at 4447 cents a pound 
dryweather fears also propelled most cotton futures up the 
daily limit of 2 cents a pound on the new york cotton exchange 
july cotton settled 2 cents higher at 6891 cents a pound 
energy futures fell sharply on the new york mercantile exchange 
in a reversal of tuesdays gains 
analyst robert baker of prudentialbache securities inc said 
the swing reflected uncertainty whether opec members would abide by 
their crudeoil production quotas 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 30 cents to 35 cents 
lower with the july contract at 1653 a barrel heating oil was 
54 cent to 106 cents lower with july at 4342 cents a gallon 
and unleaded gasoline was 30 cent to 95 cent lower with july at 
4923 cents a gallon 
gold and silver futures advanced on new yorks commodity 
exchange in reaction to the soaring grain prices but gains were 
limited by the drop in crudeoil prices the strength of the dollar 
and a smaller than expected rise in retail sales last month 
analysts said 
gold settled 120 to 150 higher with the august contract at 
45580 a troy ounce and silver was 85 cents to 89 cents higher 
with july at 7155 a troy ounce 
stockindex futures rose slightly on the chicago mercantile 
exchange the contract for june delivery of the standard amp poors 
500 index settled 20 point higher at 27480

frank borman a former astronaut and eastern 
airlines president on wednesday was named chairman and chief 
executive officer of patlex corp a hightechnology manufacturer 
and laser company 
borman 60 was appointed as patlex announced plans to spin off 
its manufacturing operations into a new company borman who flew 
gemini and apollo missions for nasa and went on to head eastern 
until its sale to texas air corp two years ago has been a member 
of the patlex board of directors 
patlex has a 64 percent interest in laser patents held by its 
vice president gordon gould inventor of the technology those 
patent rights gained through litigation begun in 1979 cover a 
significant percentage of the lasers used in the united states the 
company said 
to be spun off are oram electric industries ltd which makes 
transformers for the telecommunications defense and computer 
industries reshef defense technologies ltd which produces 
electronic gear for the military and apollo lasers inc which 
makes scientific and small systems lasers 
the manufacturing group had 13 million in sales last year 
while laser royalties brought in 45 million said yaron eitan 
patlex executive vice president 
patlex shareholders would receive one share of stock in the new 
company for each two shares of patlex stock they hold 
the spinoff is intended to separate the laser patent licensing 
activity from the manufacturing business which requires additional 
capital to finance growth said richard samuel the former patlex 
chairman and chief executive officer who will be chairman of the 
new company samuel will be patlex president

the belzberg familys financial company 
violated federal securities law in its unsuccessful bid to take 
control of ashland oil co and must forfeit 27 million in stock 
profits a judge ruled wednesday 
us district judge barrington d parker held that first city 
financial corp ltd with an excess of boldness deliberately 
violated federal securities law by failing to make timely 
disclosures that it had purchased 5 percent of ashlands stock 
parker found that first city through a subsidiary headed by 
marc belzberg circumvented the disclosure requirement by arranging 
to acquire the bulk of its 14 million ashland shares by 
parking its stock with the brokerage firm bear stearns amp co 
inc 
the judge said he would grant an injunction barring belzberg and 
his familys canadianbased company from engaging in further 
stock parking arrangements to conceal ownership of securities 
he also ordered first city to give up 27 million in profits it 
made in the stock transactions that violated section 13 d of the 
1934 securities exchange act 
the decision was hailed as a significant victory by the 
securities and exchange commission which contends that stock 
parking should be treated as a serious problem despite 
contentions by many on wall street that it is only a minor 
technical violation 
parker said first citys surreptitious effort to accumulate a 
block of shares in ashland is the precise type of evil section 
13d was directed to prevent 
the requirement is designed to prevent companies involved in 
takeovers from continuing to acquire shares of a companys stock at 
artificially low prices by concealing large purchases from other 
investors 
we regard it as a terrific victory said thomas c newkirk 
the secs chief litigation counsel its importance goes beyond 
the facts of this particular case because it shows the seriousness 
with which judge parker treated the violations which we proved 
he said 
newkirk said the judgment marked the first time the sec had 
taken enforcement action under the disclosure provision of the 1934 
law 
the decision is also significant because of the secs 
investigation of drexel burnham lambert inc one focus of the 
drexel probe is the allegation that the investment firms junk bond 
chief michael milken engaged in a stock parking scheme with 
former speculator and insidertrader ivan boesky 
milken is represented by paul weiss rifkind wharton amp 
garrison the same new york law firm that defended mark belzberg in 
the trial before parker last year in us district court belzberg 
was represented by arthur l liman counsel to the senate 
irancontra committee 
the judge rejected belzbergs testimony that a bear stearns 
executive misunderstood a march 4 1986 conversation which led to 
the immediate purchase of 20500 shares of ashland on behalf of 
first city the broker testified that he undertood he had been 
directed to purchase the stock for belzberg and continued to do so 
following that purchase first city owned more than 5 percent of 
ashland oil and had 10 days to make that disclosure 
but parker found that bear stearns which was not charged with 
wrongdoing continued to purchase more shares of ashland stock for 
first city which did not disclose its 5 percent interest in the 
oil company until march 26 12 days after the legal deadline for 
making the report 
first city headed by marc belzbergs father canadian 
businessman samuel belzberg dropped its bid to take over ashland 
but made a 154 million profit when it sold its shares back to the 
oil company 
parker calculated that first city should forfeit 27 million in 
profits on the 890000 shares it purchased during the period when 
its 5 percent stake in ashland should have been public knowledge 
we are obviously deeply disappointed by the courts decision 
we fought because we believed the sec was wrong in the facts and 
the law we still believe that and we intend to appeal the 
company said in a statement issued by its toronto office 
in april first city agreed to pay a 400000 fine to settle a 
federal trade commission complaint that its ashland bid had 
violated the hartscottrodino antitrust law the ftc complaint 
alleged that first city failed to notify the agency of ashland 
stock purchases exceeding 15 million

retail sales grew a lackluster 01 percent in 
may the government said wednesday in a report analysts predicted 
should help ease fears of inflationary pressures in the economy 
the commerce department said sales by retailers which represent 
about onethird of us economic activity edged up a scant 01 
percent in may to 1319 billion after a 04 percent drop in april 
much of the slowdown came from two successive drops in auto 
sales but other categories including department store sales also 
were anemic 
if you put the two months together there is not much evidence 
of strength said sandra shaber an economist with the futures 
group a washingtonbased consulting firm department store 
sales which are a major barometer continue to be very weak 
but shaber and other analysts said slack consumer spending 
while bad for retailers is good for the economy as a whole because 
it should calm the inflation jitters that had troubled financial 
markets earlier this year 
economists have been looking toward rising export sales as a 
cure for the swollen us trade deficit however retail sales 
jumps of 16 percent in march and 11 percent in february fueled 
concern that prices would rise as manufacturers found it difficult 
to meet demand from both forign and american consumers 
following the february and march surge retail sales have 
settled into a comfortable tempo this should allay fears that 
americans are indulging in an orgy of overconsumption which will 
make it impossible to drive down the trade deficit richard w 
rahn chief economist of the us chamber of commerce said in a 
statement 
two other reports issued wednesday fit the pattern of a shift 
from consumerled growth to an exportdriven economy 
the federal reserve board said production at the nations 
factories mines and utilities rose a moderate 04 percent in may 
the eighth consecutive month without a decline 
economists said the increase was evidence that manufacturers 
continue to produce more goods for export production of business 
equipment was particularly robust the fed said as part of the 
export boom businesses are spending more to modernize and expand 
their factories 
meanwhile the commerce department said a 98 percent climb in 
exports in the first three months of 1988 from the previous quarter 
helped shrink the merchandise trade deficit by 127 percent to 
359 billion 
however the current account the broadest measure of us 
transactions with other nations widened by a sharp 186 percent 
to 3975 billion as the united states recorded its first quarterly 
deficit in investment earnings in 30 years 
on wall street stock prices rose as the dow jones average of 30 
industrials edged up 693 to 213140 its second postoctober 
crash high in as many days the dollar was mixed and bond prices 
edged lower 
the retail sales report is painting a picture of a slowdown in 
consumption from the first quarter but this is something that is 
good for the economy said tom megan senior financial economist 
with evans economics in washington as the current account 
numbers point out we have to reorient the economy from consuming 
to exporting 
it was the sixth increase in retail sales in seven months but 
it was the second consecutive weak report 
and because the figures are not adjusted for inflation megan 
said strong sales totals in two categories food and specialty 
clothing likely reflect price increases rather than actual gains 
in sales volume 
sales in may were held back by a 12 percent fall in automotive 
sales to 293 billion that followed a 08 percent drop in april 
excluding autos sales rose 05 percent in may following a 03 
percent decline 
sales of durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years were down 06 percent in may while 
nondurable goods were up 05 percent 
the commerce department offered these details of may sales 
department and other general merchandise stores down 01 
percent after a 12 drop in april 
hardware and garden supply stores up 02 percent after no 
change in april 
furniture and appliance stores down 02 percent following a 
strong 13 percent jump a month earlier 
food and grocery stores up 13 percent after a 01 percent 
drop 
gasoline up 06 percent after a 07 percent decline 
specialty clothing stores up 17 percent restaurants and 
bars down 05 percent and drug stores up 04 percent

iowa cattle farmers mowed roadside ditches for feed wednesday 
and hundreds of mississippi river barges backed up in low water at 
greenville miss as the drought in the nations midsection pushed 
prices skyward on commodity exchanges 
rain fell in kansas missouri and illinois but the national 
weather service said it wouldnt be enough to make up for weeks of 
dry weather temperatures remained in the high 80s and 90s across 
much of the nation 
were not looking for a great deal of shower activity not 
enough to significantly alleviate the drought situation said 
weather service meteorologist lyle alexander in kansas city mo 
tinderdry conditions in some areas of wisconsin prompted 
officials to impose a strict burning ban while residents of a 
northern ohio community hired a sioux indian medicine man to 
perform a rain dance for withering fields 
with the drought threatening farm yields ohio state university 
agricultural economist scott erwin said food prices would likely 
rise faster this year than in any of the previous five years he 
predicted a 45 percent to 55 percent increase later this year and 
even larger price boosts in 1989 if the drought persists 
us agriculture secretary richard e lyngs gloomy assessment 
of the drought on tuesday sparked buying interest wednesday on the 
chicago board of trade prices for future delivery of soybeans 
corn and oats rocketed to their limits for daily trading within 
seconds of the opening bell 
lyng told lawmakers that the drought could turn into a national 
disaster he said damage had already been done to wheat fields in 
montana and the dakotas and that additional weeks of scorching 
temperatures and no rain could cause severe damage in the corn belt 
and across the south 
those statements by lyng were on traders minds said walter 
spilka an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york theres just a general bullishness in the grain markets 
and no one wants to miss it 
in iowa a dry winter followed by a dry spring has already 
created a crisis for livestock farmers who are sending pregnant 
cows to slaughter 
for cattle producers things are critical as far as the corn 
and bean crop its kind of borderline right now were probably 
looking at a reduction in yields said peter brent who operates 
a hot line for troubled farmers that was started during the farm 
debt crisis of the 1980s 
pastures have yielded little feed because of the drought and 
iowa gov terry branstad ordered the state highway department to 
allow farmers to mow ditches along roads near their property and 
feed the hay to livestock 
across illinois parched communities have imposed wateruse 
restrictions 
over hundreds and hundreds of miles the ground is very very 
dry said peter lamb of the illinois state water survey so 
what the sun is doing is heating the ground and the ground is 
heating the air 
cd besadny secretary of the wisconsin department of natural 
resources said an emergency burning order would ban all outside 
fires including cigarette smoking in parts of the state 
beginning saturday 
it wont be lifted until we get sufficient rain besadny 
said this is the driest ive seen the state in a long long 
time 
dry conditions caused 87 fires that burned 250 acres in 
wisconsin on tuesday another state official said 
florist cliff doebel of the northern ohio community of clyde 
said he had persuaded leonard crow dog from the rosebud indians 
reservation in south dakota to come to his town to perform a rain 
dance ceremony beginning sunday 
crow dog will use prayers and offerings to appeal to the four 
winds of the earth to bring the rain to sandusky county doebel 
said 
ohio was also the site of a prayer service in a parched farm 
field on tuesday about 225 people gathered at the farm of gerald 
and joanne lowery south of fostoria in the northwest part of the 
state for the interdenominational service 
the rev william martin of st wendelin roman catholic shook 
holy water at the crops in all four directions as he gave a 
blessing of the field 
the next two weeks are considered a critical growing period for 
midwestern crops and without rainfall approaching its normal 4 
inches in june crop yields will suffer farm experts say 
near greenville miss aabout 750 barges were backed up on the 
mississippi river on wednesday because of low water and the army 
corps of engineers said twice as many could be stranded by the 
weekend 
the barges began backing up after one ran aground monday and 
others decided to wait for a dredge to arrive thursday to deepen 
the channel 
they are skittish about using it because one messup costs 
lots of dollars said michael logue spokesman for the corps 
vicksburg district 
ron goldman chief of water control management for the vicksburg 
district said the mississippi is at its lowest point for this time 
of year since records were first kept in 1872 
he said the vicksburg gauge read 25 feet on tuesday the lowest 
level on record is minus 7 feet in february 1940 when much of the

the senate voted wednesday to extend for one 
year a ban on savings and loan associations leaving the financially 
threatened federal savings and loan insurance corp 
by a voice vote senators approved legislation aimed at blocking 
healthy savings and loan associations from converting to savings 
banks in order to escape the premiums assessed by fslic the 
current moratorium is due to expire aug 10 
the extension was attached to a bill directing the treasury 
department to mint commemorative coins celebrating the 200th 
anniversary of congress in 1989 the 50 million that the sale of 
those coins is estimated to yield would be used to renovate the 
capitol 
the bill was approved 960 
also attached to the bill were amendments 
requiring the treasury department to mint a new series of coins 
for general circulation to replace existing designs sen william 
armstrong rcolo sponsor of the amendment cited estimates that 
the sale of the new coins would produce a 200 million profit over 
the next several years which would be used to reduce the federal 
deficit 
directing the minting of a new 1 coin to mark the 100th 
anniversary of the birth of the late president dwight d eisenhower 
authorizing the minting of 350000 5 coins to honor six states 
north dakota south dakota montana washington idaho and 
wyoming that will celebrate their centennials next year 
the federal home loan bank board had asked for an extension of 
the moratorium on conversions of savings and loan associations 
following the collapse of large institutions in texas and 
california 
a similar bill is pending in the house 
financial experts have expressed fear that a rush by healthy 
institutions to leave fslic could result in taxpayers having to pay 
50 billion or more over the next few years to rescue remaining 
savings and loan associations 
by an 8015 vote the senate killed an amendment by sen bob 
graham dfla to require fslic to base its premiums on risks 
faced by individual savings and loan associations

a federal judge on wednesday took under 
advisement a request to delay a proposed 276 million settlement of 
a giant lawsuit resulting from the washington public power supply 
systems default on 225 billion in bonds 
us district judge william browning took the matter under 
advisement after hearing arguments from an attorney representing 
investors holding more than 40 million in bonds that the proposal 
failed to show how the settlement would be divided 
its not unnatural for a holder to wonder what a holder is 
going to obtain in a settlement said ann acker of chicago 
representing two institutional investors and a bank holding the 
bonds issued to finance two abandoned nuclear plants 
but other attorneys for plaintiffs and defendants said the 
proposed settlement was fair and would provide 27000 bondholders 
and claimants a payoff after years of waiting while allowing 
defendants to escape further litigation 
we hope to buy peace said herbert wachtell of new york 
representing bond underwriters who would pay 92 million of the 
276 million 
ms acker of the law firm of chapman and cutler told the court 
that a delay was proper because there had been no discussion on how 
the settlement proceeds would be allocated among the different 
classes of plaintiffs including original investors and speculators 
who bought bonds at reduced rates after the 1983 default or how 
much legal fees would be 
defendants tentatively settling so far include more than 50 
utilities underwriters a legal adviser to wppss and wppss 
directors 
trial against the remaining defendants is scheduled to begin 
sept 7 in tucson ariz and could last two years remaining 
defendants include utilities holding 80 percent interest in the 
plants engineers wppss advisers and the supply system itself 
though the defaulted bonds totaled 225 billion in value 
claims by bondholders and by former bondholders with fraud claims 
cover only about 15 billion of the bonds 
ms acker representing kemper financial services continental 
assurance and first midwest bancorp was the only attorney arguing 
against the partial settlement 
paul bernstein of new york a lead counsel for plaintiffs said 
the settlement was fair he said browning could decide on legal 
fees when lawyers submitted their proposed bills to him 
browning has ruled that under state securities law the plaintiff 
attorneys must prove defendants intended to defraud investors and 
were not simply negligent 
however the judge also has said plaintiffs would be allowed to 
claim fraud and negligent misrepresentation a lesser standard of 
proof under state common law 
the supply system attempted to build five nuclear power plants 
in the 1970s including the two abandoned plants 
one operating plant started up in late 1984 while two others 
were mothballed while only partially complete those three plants 
are being paid for through regional power rates levied by the 
federal bonneville power administration 
the abandoned plants over which the suits were filed were not 
included in the financial arrangement with bpa
