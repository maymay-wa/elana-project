the pilot of united airlines flight 232 
said he had almost no control over his dc10 in the final 34 
minutes before the jumbo jets fiery crash the national 
transportation safety board said thursday 
ntsb officials revealed a host of problems that plagued the 
illfated aircraft including the loss of fluid in the planes 
hydraulic system and holes in the tails horizontal stablizer 
at least 76 people were killed and up to 43 others were missing 
and believed dead in wednesdaysspectacular crash 
rescuers said many of those unaccounted for probably were 
trapped in a large silver and redstriped section of the charred 
fuselage that sat amid rows of corn 4 feet tall 
the dc10s hydraulic system which allow pilots to manipulate 
wing and tail controls contained no fluid as capt al c haynes 
tried to bring the plane into sioux gateway airport ntsb board 
member jim burnett told a news conference thursday night 
haynes notified federal aviation administration air traffic 
controllers in minneapolis at 324 pm cdt that he had almost no 
control over the aircraft burnett said 
the aircraft could only be turned to the right he said 
they made three 360degree turns the plane crashed at 358 pm 
the entire fanrotor system for one engine was missing burnett 
told a nighttime news conference thats the first time for this 
type of engine that weve ever seen 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said there was a 
10inchby12inch hole and three or four smaller ones in the 
horizontal stabilizer the small horizontal wing on the tail 
section the rear engine sits just above the stabilizer 
lopatkiewicz said the holes were projectile penetrations 
but declined to be more specific such holes in the horizontal 
stabilizer could be caused by pieces of metal spewed like shrapnel 
from a disintegrating engine 
ntsb officials refused to answer questions about how any of the 
damage or failure of the hydraulic system would have contributed to 
the accident 
officials gave conflicting reports thursday on the number of 
survivors and the number of people aboard the aircraft with the 
number of survivors ranging from 174 to 197 
united later scaled back the high figure to 183 explaining that 
the flight crew had been mistakenly counted twice and that two 
people counted as survivors were now missing 
united and other officials said earlier there were 293 people 
aboard the dc10 but burnett said thursday night there were 295 
people on the aircraft he said there were four people in the 
cockpit instead of three including an offduty pilot asked about 
burnetts report united stuck by its figure of 293 
earlier thursday rescuers and survivors spoke of miracles and 
investigators swept inch by inch through a cornfield in the 
search for the crashs cause 
some survivors just walked away from the wreckage 
beginning at daybreak national guardsman began collecting 
pieces of wreckage and carrying body bags to ambulances and 
refrigerated trailers 
the plane crippled by the loss of hydraulic power pitched 
violently to its right just a few feet from the ground scraped its 
right wing cartwheeled into a ball of fire and broke into pieces 
during an emergency landing about 4 pm on a closed runway at the 
sioux gateway airport 
survivor garry priest 23 of northglenn colo said those who 
got out of the plane saw what looked like a war zone bodies 
trash magazines luggage and pieces of bodies littered the area 
it was the worst thing ive ever seen 
we could not believe anybody could walk away from it said 
dr david greco director of emergency services for the marian 
health center and one of the first physicians on the scene 
greco lauded the passengers and crew for maintaining calm and 
said the nature of the breakup of the plane largely determined the 
pattern of deaths and injuries 
the three members of the cockpit crew survived the crash but 
greco said the firstclass section was devastated passengers in 
rows nine through 19 suffered no injuries or minor ones he added 
but there was nothing left of the rear half of the aircraft 
one section was thrown so far so fast that it never got 
involved in the fire he said 
tales of heroism abounded beginning with praise for haynes a 
33year united veteran 
gov terry branstad visited haynes bedside and said at a news 
conference he was quite emotional about the situation and tears 
came to his eyes when he talked about the number of people who lost 
their lives i told him he did a valiant job 
in washington president bush extended his sympathy thursday to 
victims families and friends and praised the extraordinary 
efforts of rescuers at the crash site 
flight 232 from denver to philadelphia via chicago carried 11 
crew members and 282 passengers including three infants united 
spokesman lawrence nagin said earlier thursday the plane has a 
capacity of 287 passengers 
rachel halterman spokeswoman from the national transportation 
safety board said agency investigators met with emergency medical 
teams from the city county and state and representatives of the 
airline the planes manufacturer and the pilots union to maximize 
the search for victims and clues from the crash 
even the investigators cant say why so many people 
survived she said and there hasnt been time for 
speculation 
the search of the crash site roughly the length of three 
football fields will be an inchbyinch thing ms halterman 
said from the ntsbs makeshift command center in the sioux city 
convention center 
the flight recorder will be going back to washington sometime 
today and well start interviewing the crew and the survivors 
eyewitnesses and everybody we can who has firsthand knowledge of 
the accident she said were also collecting maintenance 
records on the plane 
two flight recorders which were not damaged in the crash were 
opened later in washington 
the flight voice recorder has the final 30 minutes of 
conversation from the dc10s cockpit and the data recorder 
contains several hours of information about the plane its speed 
compass heading and other data recorded every few seconds 
the recorder and tapes were in good condition said ntsb 
aeronautical engineer thomas jacky their contents are not likely 
to be made public for several weeks 
before the crash the pilot radioed to report that the 
15yearold jumbo jet experienced complete hydraulic failure 
federal aviation administration spokesman fred farrar said parts 
of the plane were found 50 miles away 
the tail engine failed which may have caused hydraulic failure 
said bob raynesford another faa spokesman the planes three 
independent hydraulic systems are routed to the tail section 
since the plane was not in one piece burnett said 
investigators could not say with certainty that the damaged engine 
was the one that the pilot had reported trouble with 
a modern jet engine works with a propellorlike fan encased in 
the engine housing the fan revolving at thousands of revolutions 
per minute draws in cold air to circulate around the combustion 
chamber and mix with hot exhaust gases in the rear of the engine 
for more use of fuel and a quieter engine 
inside the combustion chamber is a turbine which also has 
blades these blades are subject to far higher stresses and it is 
not uncommon for them to break 
the crash left a swath of charred runway and scattered bits of 
peoples lives over the wide expanse two sets of golf clubs a 
wallet photo of a brunette in her prom dress a reebok tennis shoe 
a purple hairdryer one black highheeled shoe and a collection of 
marilyn monroe photographs 
four people near alta 55 miles east of sioux city discovered a 
piece of the plane 6 to 7 feet high and 6 feet long in a 
cornfield 
virginia jane murray a flight attendant survived by crawling 
out of an opening in the burning wreckage 
she said she was tumbling said her father don murray of 
chester sc the walls were coming in she said a hole opened up 
and the sunlight came in and she climbed out the hole she said she 
knew the lord opened up that hole 
nineyearold yisroel brownstein suffered a broken arm and 
bruises but his parents who flew from denver to sioux city 
regarded the injuries almost joyously i feel like he was born 
all over again today said his father avrohom 
he wanted a broken arm like his friends he said now hes 
got one 
survivor mark michaelson of denver said that during the last 30 
minutes of the flight attendants drilled passengers on emergency 
procedures and told them to put their heads between their knees 
many survivors reported that the passengers were mostly calm as 
they prepared themselves for what they expected would be an 
extremely rough landing 
city manager hank sinda put the number of survivors at 174 
which with his count of 76 confirmed dead would put the number 
unaccounted for at 43 
uniteds count of the number of people who survived the crash 
fluctuated widely thursday by late evening the carrier scaled 
back its estimate of 185 survivors to 183 saying two people 
reported earlier as survivors were now unaccountedfor 
at one point airline spokesman russell mack put the number as 
high as 197 he later explained that the figure of 197 was a 
mistake he said he had been told the number had risen to 187 and 
including only passengers and that he added the flight crew to 
that figure

the crash of a united widebodied jet in sioux 
city iowa demonstrates a problem already highlighted in two other 
major dc10 accidents loss of pilot control with damage to flight 
control systems 
other incidents prior to wednesdays dc10 crash in which 119 
people were either dead or missing have a common thread in the 
loss of pilot control after a failure that would not ordinarily 
affect flight controls such as loss of an engine or a cargo door 
some of the cases did not cause heavy loss of life but each has 
added to concern among government and aviation authorities over 
design of the dc10 which the government grounded for more than a 
month in 1979 
a mcdonnell douglas spokesman said thursday the 
outofproduction dc10 is as fit as any other airliner and has 
flown 745 million passengers safely more than 7 billion miles 
douglas officials declined to comment on evidence that the 
planes hydraulic systems failed in the sioux city crash except to 
say that the manufacturer was cooperating in the federal 
investigation to determine cause 
but spokesman don hanson said dc10s have three independent 
hydraulic systems routed through the aircraft so they are as far 
apart from each other as possible 
the airplane is so designed that the loss of any one hydraulic 
system will not affect control of the airplane hanson said even 
if two systems failed a pilot still should be able to land safely 
he said and the system has an additional airdriven backup for one 
of the systems 
although investigators were looking at explosive failure of the 
planes tail engine as the initial incident in the crash of united 
flight 232 in sioux city they also were concerned about apparent 
collapse of the planes hydraulic systems as its pilot was 
attempting an emergency landing on a denverphiladelphia flight 
the hydraulic systems link the pilot with wing flaps tail 
elevators rudders brakes and other devices that guide the 
airliner in takeoff during flight in landing and on the runway 
federal aviation administration authorities said the dc10s 
pilot first reported uncontained engine failure which means 
parts shot out of the engine possibly damaging other systems and 
causing what the pilot later described as complete hydraulic 
failure 
in 1974 loss of a cargo door caused decompression in a turkish 
airlines dc10 over france the planes floor buckled snapping 
control cables and the airliner went out of control killing 346 
people at least two previous incidents had pointed to a cargo door 
problem but the problem was not ordered corrected by the faa until 
after the turkish crash 
on may 25 1979 in chicago the engine of an american airlines 
dc10 broke loose and catapulted over the wing during takeoff 
breaking hydraulic cables and causing a crash that killed 275 
people investigators blamed faulty maintenance but also 
recommended a design review 
mcdonnell douglas spokesman david eastman said he knew of only 
one design change that had occurred in the dc10 since the chicago 
crash involving instrumentation that would warn the pilot when 
wing slats were improperly positioned 
the two incidents and the latest crash point to serious problems 
with design of the dc10 said john galipault of the aviation 
safety institute a nonprofit group that pushes for safer planes 
he said the common element in several dc10 crashes has been 
loss of the pilots ability to control the aircraft after a 
catastrophic failure in a single system 
when that happens the pilot becomes a passenger he said 
it reinforces my concern about the airplane its too bad but it 
has a terrible safety record 
according to a national transportation safety board analysis of 
the chicago crash the dc10 has three hydraulic systems each 
powered by two enginedriven pumps it also has two electric 
auxiliary pumps further backup is provided by an airdriven system 
which includes a propeller dependent only upon movement of the 
aircraft through the air 
problems with the pumps design was found early in the 
19yearold history of the dc10 and corrected the board said 
but as accidents occurred controversy over effectiveness of the 
dc10s hydraulic system and its backups increased 
in 1982 mcdonnell douglas discussed possible design changes 
after an air florida dc10 in miami aborted its takeoff without 
injuries after a malfunctioning engine hurled fan blades into the 
wing and caused hydraulic problems 
in july 1974 failure in a wing engine on a dc10 en route from 
miami to los angeles caused loss of hydraulic fluid because of 
damage to the wing 
after a march 1976 accident in which a flock of birds flew into 
a dc10 rear engine causing it to disintegrate the safety board 
concluded that the engine could not safely tolerate such a massive 
ingestion of foreign objects 
airliners can fly with one engine out but there is concern with 
the dc10 that failure of any engine which involves it coming apart 
endangers the hydraulic system 
other widebodied jets such as the boeing 747 have differently 
configured hydraulic and engine systems also with builtin 
redundant backups a boeing spokesman david jimenez declined to 
discuss any differences between the aircrafts saying it would be 
like comparing apples and oranges

nothing not a soup spill a burned filet 
mignon or a cockroach crawling through the salad turns a 
restaurant meal into a disaster quite like a nasty headwaiter says 
professional diner john campbell 
his advice dont take it sitting down complain to the manager 
or simply walk out 
the degree of humiliation to which a repulsive maitre d 
subjects his patrons and their guests can be the most unforgettable 
part of the dining experience says campbell unfortunately it 
happens in some of our better restaurants 
campbell has been rating lodgings and restaurants for the 
american automobile association for the past 15 years he says 
restaurants in new york doubtless are the worst for sneering 
snarling headwaiters whose unlucky customers forgot to slip them a 
sawbuck 
the bearded australianborn campbell 52 says the hapless 
victims of sadistic headwaiters can just get up and leave if 
theyve been seated next to the kitchen door insulted and 
forgotten 
you dont have to eat bad food and you dont have to be stuck 
suffering this selfpunishment he said in an interview 
when the atmosphere turns brutish campbell takes the offending 
headwaiter aside and asks what seems to be going wrong here 
what is my problem and what is your problem 
if the situation cant be resolved through quiet reasoning he 
says i would leave but dont forget to complain to the 
restaurants owner or manager 
he has a desperate interest in the health of his property and 
he will listen campbell said if you tell him you had an 
unpleasant experience with monsieur jacques hes likely to say 
really and monsieur jacques might not be there next time 
campbell who is based in new york is one of 60 fulltime 
professionally trained field representatives who are rating 
restaurants for aaa the 30millionmember motoring and travel 
service organization based in suburban falls church va 
at a news conference thursday aaa officials announced they are 
going nationwide with their diamond rating service which 
awards five diamonds for the highestranked luxury restaurants to a 
single diamond for informal familystyle eateries serving good 
but unpretentious dishes 
no fewer than 72 rating guidelines developed with the help of 
cornell universitys school of hotel management will be applied to 
nearly 7000 restaurants annually in the united states canada 
mexico and the caribbean for inclusion in aaas 1990 tour books 
officials said that means campbell and his colleagues will eat 
an average of 10 to 12 meals in different restaurants every week 
each will be scored on everything from parking lots to table 
flowers from the taste of the hors doeuvres to how discreetly the 
waiter delivers the bill 
it is one of the most onerous jobs in the world dining out 
for a living said thomas r crosby the aaas managing director 
for national travel 
campbell interviewed over lunch at a fivediamond french 
restaurant in downtown washington agrees that all that eating and 
drinking can be a health hazard when time came for dessert he 
passed up the chocolate mousse for a dish of strawberries 
some of his fellow judges have quit because of gustatory 
burnout he says and one turned into an alcoholic after eight 
years on the restaurant circuit 
you can drink so much and eat so much good food and bad food 
that you become poisoned and your health starts to 
deteriorate campbell said 
you have to jog a lot and swim a lot you have to be picky 
you learn to stop eating after one bite you dont have to clean 
your plate no matter what your mother said about all those 
starving children in china

when organization of american states foreign 
ministers were scouting around last month for a date to meet in 
washington they settled on july 19 partly because secretary of 
state james a baker iii would be in town 
but when the delegates convened here wednesday to talk about the 
panama situation baker was occupied by other matters and stayed 
away 
other foreign ministers from the hemisphere had traveled up to 
6000 miles to attend the meeting but baker didnt make the 
fiveblock trip over to oas headquarters from the state department 
the story was much the same in june ministers from around the 
hemisphere turned up in washington for a meeting on panama but 
baker had other issues on his agenda and sent subordinates over to 
the oas 
this does not go unnoticed by other governments which have the 
clear impression baker is much more oriented toward europe and asia 
than he is toward latin america 
indeed just two weeks before baker was a noshow at oas 
headquarters on wednesday he had traveled halfway around the world 
to attend a meeting of the sixmember association of southeast 
asian nations in brunei the oas has 31 members 
shortly after taking office in january he took off on a visit 
to each of the european members of nato and has been back to europe 
several times since then 
bakers aides acknowledge he may be gravitating toward europe 
and asia because the economic and political changes there are 
generally favorable to the united states especially in contrast to 
latin america where the outlook is far bleaker 
while the democratic trend in latin america is a source of 
encouragement to us officials the economic situation in many 
countries is disastrous and the problem of coping with drug flows 
from south of the border seems insurmountable 
beyond that as this weeks oas meeting on panama demonstrated 
once again americans and latin americans just dont see things the 
same way 
a comparison between that meeting and an oas meeting on cuba 25 
years ago this week offers convincing evidence of just how far us 
influence in the hemisphere has declined over the past generation 
prodded by the johnson administration a quartercentury ago the 
oas imposed mandatory economic and diplomatic sanctions against 
cuba after concluding that cuba was responsible for fomenting 
subversion in venezuela 
those were the days when anticommunist military dictators 
dominated latin american political life they were only too willing 
to lend strategic support to washingtons cold war ventures 
nowadays democracy is ascendant in the hemisphere and the 
anticommunist consensus has long since unraveled the reagan 
administration looked high and low for latin american support for 
the nicaraguan contras but almost always came up emptyhanded 
the bush administration is somewhat isolated on what to do about 
the situation in panama gen manuel noriega is not a popular 
figure in the hemisphere but only washington seems to have any 
appetite for confronting him 
the disappointment among us officials was palpable wednesday 
night when the best the oas could do on panama was a declaration 
which although it calls for a transfer of power in panama was 
so bland and ambiguous that even noriegas representative didnt 
oppose it 
that is not the only issue on which the bush administration has 
been isolated politically from its hemispheric neighbors 
in contrast to the situation 25 years ago when cuba was 
virtually friendless in the hemisphere president fidel castro now 
enjoys widespread acceptance one exception is washington 
in less than a year castro has attended presidential inaugurals 
in ecuador venezuela and mexico much to washingtons chagrin the 
united nations has selected cuba as the site for a conference on 
crime next year 
baker has not ignored hemispheric affairs completely one early 
achievement was the bipartisan agreement he reached with congress 
governing future policy toward central america 
in time he may find hemispheric issues more appealing one test 
will come on aug 23 the date of the next oas foreign ministers 
meeting on panama

catastrophic health coverage for older 
americans under heavy attack by some of its beneficiaries is 
facing new challenges from house taxwriters despite a tentative 
vote to keep it alive 
awaiting action before the ways and means committee is a 
proposal to sharply reduce catastrophic coverage of prescription 
drugs and use the money to cut the surtax that pays most of the 
cost of the program also pending is an amendment that would allow 
medicare recipients to accept or reject catastrophic coverage 
another hot issue whether to cut the tax on capital gains 
remains unresolved supporters of the cut claim enough votes for 
victory despite the opposition of chairman dan rostenkowski 
dill and house speaker thomas s foley president bush wants a 
reduction 
aides said rostenkowski is unlikely to allow a vote until after 
he and foley get a last chance to make their case before the caucus 
of all house democrats next week the two leaders oppose a cut 
because threequarters of the benefits would go to those with 
incomes over 100000 a year 
by a 2313 margin the committee rejected a motion that would 
have put the committee on record for repeal of the yearold program 
that helps older americans bear the expense of catastrophic 
illness most democrats voted against repeal and most republicans 
favored repeal five from each party voted with the other side 
some of the 23 votes against repeal came from those who think 
the program should be continued as it is others were cast by those 
who want to end the program but know that would raise the federal 
deficit by about 6 billion next year that is because the 
catastrophic tax is bringing in money faster than benefits are 
being paid 
although the vote was on a procedural motion committee aides 
said it showed the panel is unlikely to recommend repeal 
i just dont see how you can fix it to the satisfaction of the 
beneficiaries said rep brian donnelly dmass chief sponsor 
of the repeal amendment i dont think the status quo can survive 
politically 
catastrophic coverage is financed principally by a 15 percent 
surtax on retirees who owe at least 150 in income tax the maximum 
surtax this year is 800 per person eligible for medicare benefits 
those who have to pay that surtax have complained loudly and 
demanded that congress change the financing method so that the 
program is funded by taxpayers of all ages 
the committee is debating catastrophic and capital gains as part 
of a bill whose chief aim is to raise 53 billion in new revenues 
for deficit reduction next year 
on thursday the committee added to the bill provisions 
extending eight tax benefits that have expired or will expire at 
years end with a total cost of 135 billion over five years 
they are 
renewing through 1991 a tax exclusion of up to 5250 a year in 
employerfinanced education assistance 
a twoyear extension of the targetedjobs tax credit which 
goes to employers who hire disadvantaged young adults 
a twoyear extension of mortgage revenue bonds which benefit 
lowerincome families buying their first home 
a twoyear extension of a tax exemption for small issues of 
bonds benefiting manufacturing plants and farmers 
twoyear renewal of a special credit for business purchase of 
geothermalenergy equipment the committee voted to end the credit 
for solar energy

chairman alan greenspan confirms the federal 
reserve reversed its yearlong campaign of pushing interest rates 
higher but that doesnt mean the central bank is soft on 
inflation economists say 
greenspan said in his twiceayear report to congress thursday 
that the balance of risks may have shifted somewhat away from 
greater inflation and what we seek to avoid is an unnecessary 
and destructive recession 
but in the same breath greenspan told the house banking 
subcommittee on domestic monetary policy inflation remains high 
clearly above our objective 
private economists are interpreting his remarks as a signal that 
the central bank which controls the nations money supply and thus 
the direction of its economy will continue cautiously nudging 
interest rates lower 
the tilt in policy will be toward ease but his easing moves 
will come later rather than sooner and they will continue to be 
small moves said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp 
co a government securities dealer in new york 
greenspan would not respond directly when asked by panel members 
whether interest rates would continue to decline but he indicated 
he did not foresee another shift in policy soon 
it is not desirable to do too many wiggles he said 
he confirmed the fed loosened its grip on credit twice once in 
early june and again early in july and that the effects of lower 
interest rates are just now beginning to be felt 
greenspan said the fed was gratified by the governments two 
most recent inflation reports for june showing a modest 02 
percent rise in the consumer price index and a 01 percent decline 
in wholesale prices 
but he cautioned its clearly premature with one months 
data to suggest that inflation pressures are behind us certainly 
they are not 
fed policymakers are not quite sure that inflation is as dead 
as it looks now as long as theyre not theyre going to move as 
slowly as they can get away with said economist david wyss of 
data resources inc a lexington mass forecasting firm 
meanwhile michael boskin president bushs chief economic 
adviser praised the feds recent action to lower interest rates 
but declined to say what he thought the central banks next move 
should be 
i dont like to preach to the fed in public he told the 
joint economic committee 
greenspan also released a revised economic forecast which showed 
the central bank still hopes to achieve a socalled soft landing in 
which growth will slow enough to cool inflationary pressures but 
not decline so much that the country is thrown into a recession 
the fed predicted modest economic growth as measured by the 
gross national product of between 2 percent and 25 percent this 
year slowing to 15 percent to 2 percent in 1990 that compares 
with the bush administrations more optimistic projection of 27 
percent in 1989 and 26 percent in 1990 
the congressional budget office on thursday forecast a 24 
percent rate of growth this year slowing to 2 percent in 1990 
the central bank forecast that consumer prices would rise by 
between 5 percent and 55 percent this year up from last years 
44 percent increase and slowing to between 45 percent and 5 
percent in 1990 
the administration meanwhile is looking for a 5 percent rise 
in consumer prices this year and 41 percent next year the cbo is 
looking for inflation a half point higher than the administration 
in the upper range of the feds 1989 projection

now that president bush has endorsed a 
journey into tomorrow a tomorrow that includes people living 
and working on the moon and mars congress will first have to give 
nasa a space haven closer to home 
its called space station freedom an orbiting laboratory that 
was to have become a reality in 1992 but will be lucky to be built 
in time to greet the 21st century 
only a few hours after bush spoke thursday the station survived 
another financial cliffhanger in the house of representatives one 
of a long series 
when president ronald reagan proposed the station in 1984 the 
cost for that single component of a moonmars future was estimated 
to be 8 billion todays guess is 30 billion and some experts say 
even that wont come close 
returning to the moon and going on from there to mars would cost 
untold billions more and would require a buildup of nasa engineers 
and industrial machinery not unlike the apollo days of the 1960s 
more than 400000 people worked on the moon program today nasa 
and its civilian contractors employ fewer than 150000 
one of the presidents chief aides budget director richard 
darman was the only administration official to say what bushs 
vision might cost 
our current estimates are roughly very very roughly that 
if you went to mars by the year 2020 and did so first establishing 
a lunar base and then going from the moon the pricetag over this 
30year period would be on the order of 400 billion he told 
reporters the figure he said is in todays dollars not figuring 
in inflation 
i know it seems like a very large number but you have to 
remember that it is over a 30year period darman said 
obviously it puts the system to the test it is a question of 
how much one cares about the future 
bush in a speech that commemorated the 20th anniversary of the 
first landing on the moon said pointedly that it is up to congress 
to make the space dreams a reality 
it is in the congress he said where the future of the space 
station and our future as a spacefaring nation will be decided 
bush called the space station an essential bridge to the 
moonmars proposals for the 21st century 
members of congress criticized bushs omission of a timetable 
and estimated costs but the house readily turned back an attempt by 
rep charles schumer dny to transfer 714 million from next 
years budget for the space station to programs for veterans 
medical care pollution control and lowincome and elderly housing 
if the schumer amendment had passed it probably would have 
killed the space station said rep bill nelson dfla chairman 
of the house space subcommittee 
nelson who once rode on the space shuttle and is a strong 
advocate of bushs proposals said that nasa cant meet those goals 
on its present budget level of about 10 billion a year 
it will have to be a 30 billion a year nasa to carry this 
out he said that would represent more than 2 percent of the 
national budget but still far less than the 4 percentplus 
required to send apollo to the moon 
at a white house news conference on thursday nasa administrator 
richard truly said that even if the money were made available nasa 
today could not do the job 
we have a full plate with space shuttle flights and space 
station freedom he said to take on extra programs we would 
need extra help technicians and engineers and facilities but 
nasa has the underlying structure and given the money we could 
flesh out 
nasa would have to tackle the problems of long duration flights 
on humans but that would be done on the space station while it 
only takes three days to go to the moon 250000 miles away a 
roundtrip journey to mars at least 35 million miles away would 
take a minimum of 14 months 
the space station orbiting 250 miles high would be used as a 
facility to deliver assemble refuel maintain and service lunar 
and interplanetary vehicles the station also would be used to 
transfer huge amounts of rocket fuel arriving from earth and serve 
as a way station for crews going to and returning from deep space 
a nuclearpowered space truck would have to be developed to 
shuttle up and down from the moon and mars to an arriving vehicle 
technology is needed to mine and process moon rocks and soil for 
the minerals needed to build moon structures and to extract oxygen 
needed for breathing and for rocket fuel 
before embarking for mars robot spacecraft would have to be 
sent to the red planet to scout potential landing sites 
why the moon why mars the president asked as he extolled 
the accomplishments of 20 years ago he answered his own question 
because it is humanitys destiny to strive to seek to find 
and because it is americas destiny to lead

nearly a year after a truce ended eight 
years of bloodshed iran and iraq are dealing in vastly different 
ways with the prospect of peace and the indelible reminders of war 
both are rebuilding the battered cities along their ravaged 
border both have sent home thousands of soldiers who survived one 
of the centurys longest conflicts 
each remains suspicious of the aug 20 ceasefire keeping 
hundreds of thousands of troops at the ready in case the fragile 
truce abruptly collapses 
but despite these similarities the bitter persian gulf rivals 
are experiencing strikingly different postwar periods 
the iraqis are ridding themselves with visible haste of any 
reminders of the war rebuilding shattered cities more quickly than 
iran promising political reforms which appear more cosmetic than 
real and reviving their regional ambitions 
the iranians uncertain of their political future still cling 
to memories of a war that killed an estimated 1 million people 
for them the war had been a convenient way of cementing the 
1979 islamic revolution then ayatollah ruhollah khomeini abruptly 
accepted the ceasefire and less than a year later died 
today tehran still extols the virtues of martyrdom and the 
horrendous sacrifices of the war its leaders warn their countrymen 
almost daily stay vigilant iraq cannot be trusted we cannot 
afford to relax 
every wednesday the martyrs program on the state 
television network takes viewers into the home of a soldier killed 
in the war to praise the virtue of dying for the islamic revolution 
mothers and fathers proudly tell of their sons honorable 
death 
the brother of 18yearold hamid behzad killed several years 
ago recounted the young mans brief life in one recent program 
in the parlor of the familys tehran home the camera panned 
over a blackandwhite portrait of behzad on the mantle beside it 
was a photo of khomeini in whose name he and thousands of his 
generation perished authorities give every martyrs family one 
a narrator somberly read a poem written by hamid before he left 
for the front 
if god grants me martyrdom 
know that i have gone from this world content 
know that i have gone to someone to whom all shall go 
mother grieve not for this transaction 
what transaction better than man going to see his god 
the television monitored in nicosia shows violent war movies 
in which the iranians are rugged cleancut heroes and the iraqis 
are invariably portrayed as sadistic and inept 
one shown recently was a ramboesque adventure called behind 
enemy lines it showed three iranian commandos parachuting into 
iraq on a sabotage mission and fighting their way home 
every night the television still shows actual war footage with 
a soundtrack of patriotic songs 
in iraq authorities are seeking to expunge as many reminders of 
the war as they can the culture ministry has ordered its theater 
groups to stage comedies and official television has switched from 
gloomy waroriented programs to us sitcoms arabic soap operas 
and family movies 
concrete antiblast blocks have been removed from all government 
buildings and officials ordered to don civilian clothes instead of 
the tan uniforms they wore during the war to show solidarity with 
the men at the front 
in iranian cities schoolboys parade in the streets in 
militarystyle fatigues copying teenage siblings for whom the 
camouflaged garb has become revolutionary chic 
both governments have to cope with hundreds of thousands of 
refugees widows and orphans 
in irans tightly controlled maledominated society it is hard 
for a widow to make a living and bring up a family 
the government has set a minimum monthly stipend of 45000 rials 
45 at the unofficial exchange rate and a maximum of 70000 
rials 70 
that is barely enough in irans hyperinflated economy but its 
helped by subsidized housing and food for families of the war dead 
nonethless the recent arrest of a young war widow for 
prostitution which can carry the death sentence in iran caused a 
national scandal the woman declared she would go on selling her 
body because it was the only way her family could afford to live 
both sides have sought to aid the hundreds of thousands of 
disabled veterans 
iran provides scholarships and government jobs for those who are 
70 percent disabled vets also get priority in housing and 
medical care despite severe economic restraints 
in baghdad iraqs capital housewife ammal abdul karim said she 
has finally told her daughter and two sons that their father was 
killed defending the southern port of basra in early 1987 after 
explaining his absence by saying he was travelling abroad 
she said in an interview that she told her children what 
happened to their father because theyre big enough now to 
understand that he was a hero and that they should be proud of 
him 
like other iraqi families who lost men at the front the 
government has given her a car and grants to build their own home 
im now the man of the family so i have to do everything 
she said

they still have titles like tender conquest 
prince of fire and the lions lady but the characters of 
romance novels have undergone a subtle transformation say the 
women who create them 
heroines once repressed virginal and more likely to surrender 
to sex than initiate it are now likely to be more assertive on the 
job and in the bedroom 
even more alarming for those who like their women meek and 
virtuous and their men roughandready is the unmistakable 
sensitivity creeping into what was once the brooding dangerous 
hero of the past 
the men used to be misogynistic sadistic types now theyre 
sometimes sweet nice guys who own hardware stores said romance 
writer anne stuart ohlrogge 41 of greensboro vt who has 
published 32 titles in 15 years 
exhaustively descriptive sex taboo in the romance novels of the 
1940s and 50s is said to have peaked in 1986 predictions for the 
1990s hold that such novels will return to gentler feelings and 
familial values 
but traditionalists can take heart according to some of the 
nearly 1000 romance writers editors agents and booksellers who 
were gathering in boston today for the ninth annual romance writers 
of america national conference 
some staples of romance book fare they say will never change 
couples will always live happily ever after said laura 
parker 40 of dallas who has published 16 books 
the only concession to more complex times is that there are 
some loose ends that dont get tied up ohlrogge said 
and the love scenes are as likely to contain as many smoldering 
looks heaving bosoms and ripped bodices as before 
graphic flaming love sex is always a turnon and once the 
characters start theres nothing an author can do to stop them 
said helen mittermeyer 59 of rochester ny who sold the first 
of her 34 books in 1980 
mittermayer said her career flourished during the reagan era 
although it was a time when reagan stifled everything and work 
and careers took precedence over matters of the heart 
i think we have to push against the tide said mittermayer 
were not going to be smothered theres been this macho bogus 
career attitude but theres real feeling under all that 
some writers at the convention said they have to ignore politics 
and reality to concentrate on creating the kind of characters they 
want 
i didnt want to read women who love too much said 
ohlrogge referring to a recent selfhelp book for women i was 
afraid it might hurt the way i write 
romance book editors at the convention said the industry has 
changed along with its authors and books 
hilary ross associate executive editor of new american library 
remembers the years when gothics were big and we had all those 
student nurse books and i can recall when we couldnt write about 
australia or the middle ages now the middle ages are in 
gothics are now out and heroines are more likely to be 
doctors than nurses ross said 
ten years ago we had heroines who would faint said ross 
now theyre much more feisty

cattle producers have a bigger stake than 
usual in this years corn crop fearing if its too much on the 
skimpy side the costs of feed will rise again and discourage 
profitable expansion in 1990 and possibly beyond 
right now according to agriculture department projections this 
falls corn harvest could be around 745 billion bushels up 
sharply from the droughtshriveled 1988 output of 492 billion 
but that would barely be enough corn to meet demands in the 
198990 marketing year that will begin sept 1 according to the 
usda projections a year later on sept 1 1990 the us corn 
stockpile would be only slightly larger 
corn prices with a harvest of 745 billion bushels would 
probably average around 175 to 225 per bushel down from 250 
to 260 now forecast for the current marketing year 
the projections are based on yield trends and other factors 
including weather conditions the usdas first corn and soybean 
estimates based on actual field surveys will be issued aug 10 
j tom brink research analyst for cattlefax says in the 
latest newsletter of the national cattlemens association that a 
continued small volume of surplus stocks would leave feed grain 
markets vulnerable to any hint of adverse weather during the 1990 
growing season 
according to brinks analysis a corn crop of 8 billion bushels 
this year would be just what cattle producers need production 
large enough to restore corn inventories somewhat and to reduce 
grain prices from levels of the past year 
if the 1989 corn crop reaches only 7 billion bushels we would 
actually be in a worse situation than last year he said corn 
feed use and exports would have to be reduced supply rationing 
would occur due to higher average prices feeder cattle and calf 
prices would be hurt while already tight feeding margins could be 
further squeezed 
at usda livestock economists say poor pasture and range 
conditions in the northern and central plains led to a larger 
number of slaughter of beef cows than had been expected 
also in the second quarter beef production rose more than 4 
percent from last winter largely because of more cattle sold out 
of feedlots most of the increase came in may and june 
with higher feed costs and rising prices of feeder cattle many 
feedlot operators had profits wiped out or squeezed tightly new 
placements were cut back 
short term the possibility of reducing recent feedlot losses 
seems minimal because seasonally higher fed cattle slaughter is 
expected through much of august says the departments economic 
research service this likely will be keep a lid on further price 
increases below the low 70s per hundredweight 
the agency forecasts in a new outlook report that omaha neb 
prices of choicegrade steers will average in the range of 69 to 
73 per 100 pounds during the third quarter compared with nearly 
74 per hundredweight in the first and second quarters of this year 
however when smaller feedlot placements this spring begin to 
show up as lower slaughter numbers this fall weekly slaughter 
rates should again decline and higher prices will result the 
report said even lower cow slaughter is possible and could 
further reduce beef supplies resulting in even higher slaughter 
cattle prices 
the report said that rains have allayed immediate fears of 
last year when drought ravaged crop yields and sent prices up 
but usda economists warned that corn and soybean crops and future 
prices will be strongly influenced by weather patterns over 
the next few weeks and months

the agriculture department has sold 3964 
metric tons of surplus butteroil a dairy product that costs 
american taxpayers 145 million to mexico for 85 million 
the deal also included a threeyear commercial credit package 
for compania nacional de subsistancias populares conasupo a 
mexican government trading company undersecretary richard t 
crowder said thursday 
deliveries are scheduled in august and october he said the 
butteroil was sold to mexico for 2140 per ton to be delivered to 
rail cars at the usmexico border that is equal to 97 cents per 
pound a metric ton is about 2205 pounds 
according to recent figures by the departments commodity credit 
corp which handles commodity surpluses it costs taxpayers about 
166 per pound or 3660 per ton to acquire surplus butteroil 
under the agencys dairy price support program 
the sales at lower prices which reflect world markets were 
ordered by congress in 1985 farm law and under last years hunger 
relief act a total of 150000 tons of dairy products a year must 
be sold for export through 1990 
some 33241 tons have been sold so far this year to foreign

democrats in congress are praising president 
bushs call for an expanded us space program but want to know how 
he expects to pay for it 
several pointed to domestic programs gutted by budget cutting 
and said the costly space ventures of the 1960s may not be 
affordable in the 1990s 
bush marked the 20th anniversary thursday of the first lunar 
landing by proposing that the united states establish a base on the 
moon in the 21st century as a stepping stone for manned mission to 
mars 
the party of john kennedy and lyndon johnson applauds the 
decision of president bush to recommit america to space 
exploration said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
but the real test of presidential leadership is not whether he 
can marshal the words but the resources to restore americas 
preeminence in space in sum mr president theres no such thing 
as a free launch added gephardt 
sen al gore dtenn said bush offered the country not a 
challenge to inspire us but a daydream to briefly entertain us 
in making his proposal with no money no timetable and no plan 
sen james sasser dtenn noted the administration itself had 
reduced nasas planned request for 140 million next year for the 
pathfinder development program a preparation for a manned mars 
mission down to 93 million 
funding for a space station also was debated as the house 
approved by voice vote a 651 billion fiscal year 1990 
appropriation for the veterans administration the department of 
housing and urban development and 18 other independent agencies 
including nasa 
the space station is not the way to go to space it is the b2 
bomber of the space program said rep charles schumer dny 
he was defeated in his attempt to transfer 714 million from 
funding for the space station to programs for veterans medical 
care pollution control and lowincome and elderly housing 
schumer estimated the lunar space station and a manned trip to 
mars would cost 400 billion 
i am a believer in space technology said schumer but you 
cant have everything as we reach for the stars let us not forget 
those who live underneath them 
rep david obey dwis suggested some space money could better 
be used to eliminate lousy housing inadequate education and 
schools loaded with asbestos 
for most people their universe will be for all of their lives 
right here on earth he said 
but rep robert roe dnj argued that expanded space 
exploration including completion of a lunar space station was 
essential to national security and satellite communications 
development 
the myth we have to shatter is that space is a luxury said 
roe 
the house appropriations bill earmarks 165 billion of nasas 
122 billion budget for the space station the bill is 1 billion 
less than the bush administration requested

up to 600 members of two rival navajo 
indian factions and tribal police clashed thursday night resulting 
in the shooting death of one man and injuries to 10 other people 
witnesses and officials said 
two hundred to 300 supporters of suspended tribal chairman peter 
macdonald occupied the tribes business and finance building late 
thursday after a promacdonald rally that turned violent 
authorities said 
the violence in this tribal capital near the arizonanew mexico 
line was the latest episode in the struggle for power on the navajo 
reservation with 200000 members the navajos are the nations 
largest indian tribe 
a federal bureau of indian affairs tactical team was working 
with tribal police and the fbi was expected to arrive at the remote 
reservation friday morning said steve goldstein a spokesman for 
interior secretary manuel lujan jr in washington 
jimmy dixon of indian wells ariz died at the us public 
health service hospital in nearby fort defiance said willie keeto 
jr and howard bitsuie copresidents of macdonalds group the 
prodineh voters 
six people suffered gunshot wounds and six others suffered other 
injuries officials said 
hospital workers and tribal police refused to confirm the report 
of a fatal shooting 
however goldstein said officials had been notified that one 
person had been killed and three wounded 
according to goldstein tribal police chief george john was in 
washington and promacdonald forces were to trying to reinstate 
former police chief wilbur kellogg 
there was a march to police headquarters the spokesman said 
around 545 pm members of the promacdonald crowd of 200 to 
300 people attacked and beat tribal poliice lt daniel hawkins 
police said they said someone in the crowd took hawkins gun and 
shot two other officers 
witnesses said dixon shot tribal police sgt daniel lee of 
window rock with a police revolver taken from an officer during the 
fracas another officer then shot dixon witnesses said 
lee was in critical condition at the fort defiance hospital 
where he dixon and three other navajos were taken according to 
prodineh officials and others 
tribal spokeswoman lenora begay identified the other wounded as 
tribal policeman emerson jake of kayenta ariz and demonstrators 
arnold begay and ashkie bahe 
jake was beaten and handcuffed when he approached the 
promacdonald rally said lenora began who is not related to 
arnold begay 
members of the promacdonald crowd used clubs to break into the 
business office and were holding off a similarsize crowd outside 
witnesses said 
the business and finance building and another building were 
close at noon thursday because of threats of an attack on the 
buildings officials said 
the macdonald supporters had been camped just outside of town 
all day witnesses said 
dineh is a navajo word meaning the people 
macdonald issued an order instructing kellogg to take over as 
police chief and restore law and order on the reservation 
macdonalds whereabouts could not be determined thursday night 
the situation in window rock has been volatile since the 
88member tribal council began its winter meeting in midfebruary 
dissidents who had seen macdonald accused during televised us 
senate hearings of official corruption and misconduct went into the 
meeting vowing to remove him from office 
late feb 13 a 49member council majority voted to place 
macdonald on administrative leave 
macdonald who has denied any wrongdoing balked at leaving 
office after the council refused to consider paying his legal fees 
throughout march and april he continued to act as chairman for a 
dwindling group of supporters 
on march 10 the council appointed leonard haskie interim

aids patients may have up to 1000 times more 
diseased blood cells than previously believed making it even 
harder to stamp out the virus that causes the fatal disease 
according to a national institutes of health study published today 
in a study led by steven m schnittman of the national institute 
of allergy and infectious diseases researchers discovered that in 
a patient with active aids the virus that causes the disease can 
infect up to 1 percent 1 of every 100 of a blood cell known as 
the t4 lymphocyte 
schnittman said in an interview that previous studies which 
used indirect measurements of the infection rate had calculated 
that only 1 in every 10000 to 100000 of the t4 lymphocytes in 
such a patient were infected 
the higher rate of infection a factor that doctors call virus 
load suggests that it will be more difficult to develop a 
therapy to find and eliminate each and every pocket of the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes aids 
the quantity of the virus found in the study was a lot 
higher than previously expected schnittman there are more 
cells infected a greater proportion than we knew before 
schnittman said the study showed that a new research procedure 
called polymerase chain reaction or pcr may be used to monitor 
the level of aids infection as a patient progresses from a point of 
showing no symptoms to where the disease becomes lifethreatening 
with pcr he said researchers could measure precisely the 
effects of drugs being tested to control or kill the aids virus 
a research report authored by schnittman and eight other 
scientists was published today in the journal science 
schnittman said he and his colleagues used blood samples from 
patients with active aids to conduct the pcr search for the virus 
researchers first separated from the samples the t4 lymphocytes 
these immunity cells are thought to be the primary target of the 
hiv virus 
blood studies in the past counted the number of cells infected 
with the aids virus by measuring proteins triggered by an active 
hiv virus thus the level of infection was inferred instead of 
directly measured 
but schnittman said the pcr technique detects the genetic 
pattern of the aids virus while it is within a cell in this way 
he said the researchers could find infected cells even when the 
aids virus is inactive 
the pcr survey which was developed only about a year ago he 
said is an important new tool to help scientists understand the 
life cycle of the highly complex aids virus and perhaps find a 
weak point where the killer disease could be attacked with drugs 
schnittman said the pcr study also showed that the aids virus 
does not readily infect another type of immunity cell the 
monocyte which also circulates in the blood this finding is a 
surprise he said because a monocyte matures into an immune cell 
called macrophage studies have shown that macrophages in the 
brain liver and lymph nodes can be heavily loaded with aids 
the real trojan horse in the body is the t4 cells and not the 
monocytes said schnittman this shows the importance of 
focusing therapies on the t4 lymphocyte cells 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks immune cells in the 
body and renders them unable to resist disease the hiv virus 
which causes aids is spread most often through sexual intercourse 
with infected persons or through needles shared by intravenous drug 
users 
as of may 31 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 97193 americans 
of whom more than half or 56468 have died since june 1 1981 
according to the centers for disease control no one is known to 
have recovered from aids 
schnittmans coauthors in the study were h clifford lane 
ferdinand massari cecil h fox and tony fauci all of nih 
miltiades c psallidopoulos louis thompson and normal p salzman

a law that allows rival newspapers to share 
business operations is weakening american journalism and should be 
repealed critics say 
never have so many given so much to so few for no good reason 
at all bruce b brugmann editor and publisher of the 
70000circulation weekly san francisco bay guardian told a house 
judiciary subcommittee hearing thursday 
brugmanns testimony came 20 years after he first opposed the 
newspaper preservation act he said thursday that the only people 
who have benefited from joint operating agreements are rich 
publishers who have become richer 
the agreement between the two san francisco dailies the 
examiner and the chronicle brugmann said has led to less 
competitive journalism 
noncompetitive journalism breeds dull irrelevant newspapers 
that few people want to read he said 
the law allows newspapers in the same city to merge business 
operations when one of the papers is in danger of failing news 
gathering operations remain separate 
in 1970 the act was hailed as a necessary means of preventing 
daily newspapers from falling victim to fierce market forces 
said subcommittee chairman rep jack brooks dtexas yet since 
passage of the act some estimate that over 200 papers have ceased 
operation 
jerry friedheim president of the american newspaper publishers 
association testified that the act helped the marketplace evolve 
and prosper 
anpa is an international trade association of more than 1400 
newspapers which represent 90 percent of the total daily and 
sunday newspaper circulation in the united states 
no newspaper executives i know of would roll back either the 
law or the decisions made in good faith during its existence 
friedheim said 
w edward wendover editor and publisher of the weekly community 
crier in plymouthcanton mich said the act has encouraged 
concentration of newspaper ownership peculiar competitive 
practices and lessened the vigor and quality of newspapering 
the principle of a free press cannot be maintained when the 
biggest newspaper chains enjoy unregulated monopoly status 
wendover said calling on congress to repeal the law 
wendover testified for michigan citizens for an independent 
press a group of 1400 readers advertisers and employees of the 
detroit news and detroit free press the group filed a lawsuit in 
august to block a joint operating agreement between the two papers 
gannett co inc which owns the detroit news and knightridder 
inc owner of the detroit free press say the agreement is needed 
to allow the free press to survive 
the us supreme court is scheduled to hear arguments on the 
case this fall there are 18 active joint operating agreements in 
the united states 
brooks said his economic and commercial law subcommittee will 
study the testimony and decide whether further hearings are needed

advocacy groups for the elderly say the 
american medical association is putting wealth for doctors ahead of 
health for seniors in its campaign against a congressional proposal 
to restrain rising medicare costs 
a coalition of senior citizen organizations thursday said the 
ama was using scare tactics and distortions in suggesting health 
care for older americans could be rationed under legislation that 
would set annual goals for medicare reimbursements to doctors 
newspaper ads run by the ama depict a frail elderly woman and 
warn she could become an expenditure target and that services 
would have to be reduced if the proposed spending targets were 
exceeded 
the ad is aimed at legislation approved by the house ways and 
means committee that would set yearly expenditure goals for 
medicare physicians costs nationwide to discourage doctors from 
padding profits by performing unneeded procedures 
if spending exceeded the target medicareapproved doctor fees 
would not rise as rapidly in the following year as they would 
otherwise a similar proposal is under consideration in the senate 
the proposed spending targets are part of a broader package 
designed to cut down rising medicare costs the legislation also 
would revise the fees paid to doctors for various services to more 
accurately reflect the skill training and time involved it also 
would limit the amount that doctors could charge medicare patients 
on top of the government reimbursement rate 
theresa mckenna director of information for the national 
council of senior citizens said the spending targets would help 
put a stop to price gouging by americas physicians 
ronald pollack executive director of villers advocacy 
associates said the ama campaign against the targets was designed 
to protect the wealth of doctors at the expense of the health of 
seniors 
the ama is conducting a slick and dishonest media campaign to 
protect their control of medicares golden goose while pretending 
to be acting for older americans who are in fact being squeezed by 
skyrocketing doctor charges he said 
the ama responded that its ads and lobbying campaign contained 
no distortions and were designed to alert people to a danger of 
medical service cutbacks 
that is our point of view and we will argue with anyone who 
wishes to engage us the association said in a statement what 
is going on is nothing more nor less than a closedown of service 
among the groups represented at thursdays press conference were 
the older womens league gray panthers national council on the 
aging aflcio afscme retiree program and the national caucus and 
center on black aged

a move by congress to speed the return of 
wolves to yellowstone park is clearly premature says the head 
of the national park service 
parks director james ridenour told a house panel thursday that 
the bill introduced by rep wayne owens dutah would interfere 
with studies under way to find out if wolves can be returned to the 
popular park without hurting the many interests involved 
battle lines are clearly drawn between environmentalists and 
sportsmen in the controversy over whether to restore the only 
indigenous species still missing from the yellowstone area 
those pushing for return of the animals say that under the 
endangered species act and the national environmental policy act 
wolves must be returned to restore the wilderness areas to their 
original state 
sportsmen who hunt elk which are the prey of wolves and 
domestic livestock owners want to keep the wolves out they are 
supported by several western lawmakers 
rupert cutler president of the defenders of wildlife told the 
interior subcommittee on national parks and public lands the wolf 
was the crown jewel of the countrys most famous natural 
monument yellowstone park 
but rep don young ralaska disdained that opinion saying 
ive lived through the romanticizing of the wolf 
he said the wolf is without any doubt second to man in his 
ability as a predator against the clovefooted animal 
rep ron marlenee rmont called the bill blatantly 
antisportsman 
rep larry craig ridaho said livestock owners will kill the 
wolves to defend their animals and i would support that we 
do not need this legislation 
however rep bruce vento dminn chairman of the 
subcommittee said the legislation was needed because the interior 
department has stalled in its responsibility to return wolves to 
yellowstone 
ridenour said the park service goal is to return the area to its 
natural state barring mitigating conditions 
he said the interior department of which the park service is a 
part wants to first determine if the wolf population could be 
controlled once returned as well as ascertain the effect wolves 
would have on wildlife in and around the park and on grizzly bears 
owens bill calls for an environmental impact statement and 
action by the interior secretary after the statement is completed 
but ridenour said park managers want to avoid a headlong 
rush to return the wolves 
let me reemphasize the need to let the process work he 
said the requirements of this bill are clearly premature 
david mech a wolf expert with the fish and wildlife service 
said each wolf eats the equivalent of three adult elks a year 
which should not endanger the population of about 35000 elk in the 
yellowstone area 
mech said the elk that died last year of bad weather would have 
been the likely prey of wolves

the portrait of leona helmsley emerging in a 
manhattan courtroom bears little resemblance to the smiling queen 
whose finicky attention to detail is trumpeted in slick magazine 
ads for her helmsley palace hotel 
sure both leonas would demand the best but the queen would pay 
for it and the queens english would be a bit more majestic 
you expletive youre not my partner you dont tell me how 
to spend my money mrs helmsley once said according to a former 
underling who was a prosecution witness at her federal trial on 
extortion and tax fraud charges 
the witness former helmsley executive jeremiah mccarthy 
testified that mrs helmsley screamed at him when he refused to 
sign a phony voucher that billed work performed at her mansion to 
the helmsley business 
mrs helmsley and two former employees allegedly engaged in a 
falseinvoice scheme and used company money to pay for 4 million 
in work on the helmsleys 28room estate in greenwich conn she 
also is accused of taking payoffs from helmsley suppliers 
sometimes in cashplump envelopes 
her 80yearold husband harry was severed from the case 
because of a loss of memory caused by a series of slight strokes 
thus far the jury has heard only the prosecution case the 
trial in its third week is expected to last two more months and 
there is no indication of whether mrs helmsley will take the stand 
she would have a lot to rebut each day observers have been 
regaled by stories starring the 69yearold queen of a 5 billion 
real estate empire 
mrs helmsley never the peoples choice in a town where rents 
have skyrocketed has become the peoples pariah everette dennis 
head of the gannett center for media studies said mrs helmsley 
has become a person of singular unpopularity in new york 
impeccably dressed and coiffed she sits in the courtroom 
generally stoic but sometimes laughing shaking her head or crying 
as witness after witness describes her as an overbearing abusive 
capricious employer 
there has been so much negative testimony regarding mrs 
helmsleys personality that us district court judge john walker 
has called for a moratorium i think this case would move much 
more quickly if we concentrated on the evidence rather than the 
personality issue he said 
but the jury had already gotten an earful 
mccarthy testified that mrs helmsley once refused to pay a 
13000 bill to a contractor who had constructed a barbecue pit 
mccarthy pleaded the contractors case the man had six kids he 
said 
why didnt he keep his pants on he wouldnt have so many 
problems mrs helmsley said according to the testimony 
elizabeth baum a former housekeeper at the mansion recalled 
remarking to mrs helmsley that the helmsleys must pay a lot of 
taxes she recalled mrs helmsleys response we dont pay taxes 
only the little people pay taxes 
mrs helmsley told steven chang a helmsley engineer to 
duplicate at the estate an underground sound system she had seen at 
disney world chang said she charged the 57000 cost to the 
business and then fired him because the hidden speakers were not 
hidden enough and they once went on at 430 am 
her lawyer gerald a feffer has done little to challenge the 
unpleasant portrait of his client except to point out that the 
helmsleys did pay 58 million in taxes from 1983 to 1985 
in fact feffer has gone out of his way to underscore mrs 
helmsleys churlishness in his opening statement feffer referred 
to her as a tough bitch who was abrasive and demanding 
because of the pressures applied to a woman who fought to make it 
in a mans world 
in the united states we dont put people in jail for being 
unpopular feffer told the jury 
under crossexamination john struck a former employee agreed 
when feffer suggested that employees working to build a pool 
enclosure at the estate labored in terror what kind of explosion 
would be forthcoming if they failed to finish in time for a july 
fourth party 
god forbid right asked feffer 
thats for sure replied struck

antiabortion forces in congress are preparing 
to battle a house panels decision to lift abortion funding 
restrictions for the district of columbia 
the house appropriations district of columbia subcommittee voted 
thursday to allow the city to use its own money to pay for 
medicaidfunded abortions 
the district had financed abortions from 1980 until last year 
when congressmen attached an amendment to the city budget banning 
the use of federal or local money for abortions 
abortion opponents quickly said thursday they will try to 
restore the ban when the citys budget reaches the house floor 
we have an amendment already drafted and we are ready to go 
with that again said brian bennett a spokesman for rep robert 
dornan rcalif were hoping to have this one battle and move on 
to the senate version of the budget 
city officials who have called the antiabortion measure an 
intrusion on their right to selfgovernance said they will fight 
efforts to renew it 
we will just dig in and prevail on this point of home rule 
that has been restored to us said lurma rackley a spokeswoman 
for mayor marion barry jr we should be able to decide how to 
spend our money 
rep julian dixon dcalif said he favored lifting the 
restriction in light of the recent supreme court ruling that 
provides states greater latitude in drafting abortion laws 
it will be interesting to see we dont know what the 
attitude will be on the floor of the house dixon said 
last year dornan and reps william dannemeyer rcalif and 
henry hyde rill led the fight to prevent the city from spending 
public money on abortions 
congress which has review power over all city laws and the city 
budget is free to attach amendments or make changes in the laws 
before approving them 
the bill is scheduled for a vote by the full committee aug 3 
and committee officials said it will likely reach the house floor 
after the house returns from summer recess on sept 5

the environmental protection agency is 
crafting a proposal aimed at easing public concern about food 
safety by allowing earlier action to ban potentially dangerous farm 
chemicals 
the proposal which must be approved by the congress was 
inspired partly by public alarm over alar a chemical used on 
apples that remained on the market long after its health risks were 
brought into question epa officials said thursday 
the american public looked at the alar situation and said 
something is not altogether right here said bill jordan 
director of the agencys office of policy and special projects 
we think there really is a need to fix the system 
groups representing farmers and chemical suppliers said they had 
not seen all details of the epa proposal but they expressed mixed 
feelings about some key provisions 
the agency proposal calls for streamlining the procedures for 
banning chemicals suspected of causing cancer or other diseases 
jordan said the new system would allow the agency to cancel use of 
a compound in less than two years the process under current law 
typically lasts a few years sometimes much longer 
the epa also wants authority to remove a suspected dangerous 
chemical from the market before it has fully investigated its 
potential health risks current law requires firm evidence of a 
serious health threat before sales may be suspended 
farmers and chemical manufacturers have resisted the idea of 
making it easier to remove agricultural chemicals from the market 
on an interim basis but an official of the american farm bureau 
federation said his groups members are willing to accept a speedup 
of epa procedures for imposing permanent bans 
mark maslyn assistant director of the farm groups washington 
office said the industry has agreed not to resist the speedier 
procedure but it will fight attempts to give epa authority to 
remove chemicals on a temporary basis 
ive not been shown a very compelling case where that 
authority is needed now he said adding that once the use of a 
compound is suspended it will continue to have a black eye even 
if later evidence shows it is not harmful 
jay vroom executive vice president of the national agricultural 
chemicals association said his group sees a clear need to 
alleviate public concern that the federal government cannot move 
quickly enough to permanently ban dangerous chemicals 
but vroom said there is no need to expand the epas power to 
make interim suspensions 
its bad for agriculture its certainly bad for consumers 
he said 
jordan said efforts to streamline the banning process began in 
spring when the public became alarmed over alar 
we were not happy with our inability to deal with the alar 
situation he said in a telephone interview 
the epa plans to seek removal of a judicial appeals process that 
chemical makers could use to delay agency efforts to ban suspected 
compounds 
another proposed change would narrow the circumstances under 
which chemical residues that pose more than a negligible health 
risk would be permitted on food products 
legislation is expected to be sent to capitol hill by early 
august agency officials said they said they had no estimates of 
how much the changes would cost

franklin d roosevelt had the new deal john 
f kennedy the new frontier lyndon johnson had the great society 
if budget director richard darman has his way the catchphrase for 
the bush years will be the new balance 
darman who is considered one of the administrations top 
political strategists said the term sums up what george bush has 
brought to the presidency 
there is new balance one sees it in the tone and style of 
bipartisan approaches to the budget and foreign policy darman 
said thursday in a speech to the national press club 
the budget director said it also was evident in what he called 
the administrations balanced proposals on the savings and loan 
crisis cleaning up air pollution and scaling back defense spending 
all areas where bush has sought compromise in place of staking 
out unwavering ideological positions as reagan did 
maybe its time to assert that not all approaches to public 
policymaking should soar with winged feet that from time to time 
america may benefit from leadership with its feet close to the 
ground and with strides suited for the longer race darman said 
darman also used his first major policy address since taking 
over as the administrations point man on the budget last january 
to attack what he called cultural nownowism 
he said that was a shorthand label for our collective 
shortsightedness our obsession with the here and now our 
reluctance adequately to address the future 
darman said one difficulty politicians face in trying to take a 
longterm approach to problems is that voters and lobbyists for 
the present are far better represented than the voters of the 
future 
he called the federal budget deficit a prime example of the 
countrys philosophy of buy now and let others pay later 
while the deficits soared during the reagan years darman 
sidestepped questions about whether the prior administration in 
which he also served should be held responsible for failing to 
achieve solutions to the deficit and other longterm problems 
reagan brought us back our national pride and optimism 
darman said in response to a question after the speech the next 
job for bush is to build on that 
by adopting the new balance as a catchphrase darman said the 
administration could answer critics who carp about bushs lack of 
the vision thing 
we have come to demand drama and catchphrases as if they were 
constitutionally protected rights darman said its as if each 
new white house communications director were a national account 
manager obliged to outdo the creative talents who brought prior 
generations the political equivalent of new tide new cheer and new 
dawn 
darman did concede one problem with using new balance as the 
administrations slogan its also the name of a popular running 
shoe

a former prisoner of war in vietnam says 
changing the constitution to ban flag desecration would start a 
wave of amendments which the united states would not survive as a 
free nation 
james warner a marine flight officer who spent 5 years in a 
north vietnamese prison camp and vietnam war medal of honor winner 
gordon roberts urged congress thursday to resist the political 
pressure to change the bill of rights to outlaw burning of the 
american flag 
president bush is supporting an effort in congress to use an 
amendment to undo the supreme courts ruling last month that flag 
burning was a protected form of political expression 
more than a dozen republican lawmakers demonstrated their 
enthusiasm for the amendment at a demonstration thursday where 
congressmen drenched an effigy of a flagburner on the steps of the 
supreme court 
testifying to the house judiciary constitutional law 
subcommittee warner said if this amendment be issued by this 
house and ratified by this nation there will come a deluge 
against the bill of rights 
our bill of rights has served as a legal restraint upon our 
government for 200 years said warner who is a lawyer if 
these restraints be removed we shall not survive as a free 
nation 
roberts who served with the army in vietnam said the flag has 
a special place in his heart but said men do not serve this 
country for the flag alone 
each of us that has worn the uniform of this country are fully 
aware that the pledge of allegiance ends in the words and justice 
for all he said 
roberts recalled that on a recent visit to the vietnam veterans 
memorial he saw the flag reflected on the granite wall etched with 
the names of the dead they were as much a part of the flag as 
the cloth and stitching said roberts 
he also warned that an amendment would spark competition among 
state legislators politicians for who could then enact the toughest 
penalty for flag burning 
the attractiveness of such oneupmanship was demonstrated before 
a crush of television cameras in front of the high court where the 
republican congressmen carried fire extinguishers and a bucket of 
water to show how intended to deal with flag burners 
the legislators reacting to rumors that a flagburning was 
going to take place cheered and shouted as some of them sprayed 
and splashed their water at a stuffedclothing effigy of gregory 
lee johnson whose 1984 texas flagburning led to the court 
decision 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif said republicans were showing 
americans how to deal with flag burnings 
if they dont have a bucket of water i hope they take care of 
business however they can rohrabacher said 
johnson in a building across the street said he never intended 
to burn a flag as rumored 
im not going to like fall into this silly trap he said

the pilot who guided a crippled jetliner 
to a crash landing showed superior airmanship and ought to be 
elected to the aviation hall of fame according to a flight 
engineer familiar with dc10s 
if he lost all three hydraulic systems then the world ought 
to be thankful that as many people survived that did said joe 
sullivan of richardson texas retired flight engineer for american 
airlines without hydraulic youre out of business 
a united airlines dc10 bound from denver to chicago crash 
landed at sioux gateway airport on wednesday after pilot ac 
haynes a 33year united veteran radioed that he had a complete 
hydraulic failure 
at least 76 people died but 174 or more survived the crash 
haynes was hospitalized but he and the other two cockpit crew 
members were among the survivors 
if all the hydraulics were out he ought to be elected to the 
aviation hall of fame sullivan said he had to call on every 
bit of his airmanship and it had to be superior not just good i 
think it was a major miracle 
jim burnett a national transportation safety board member told 
a news conference thursday night that the dc10s hydraulic system 
which allow pilots to manipulate wing and tail controls contained 
no fluid as haynes tried to land the plane 
earlier bob raynesford a spokesman for the faa regional office 
in kansas city said the aircraft may have lost some hydraulic 
power but some must have remained 
we were in constant contact with the crew for about 40 
minutes and the aircraft became more and more difficult to control 
as it got closer to sioux city raynesford said we are hearing 
about total hydraulic failure but it is way too premature to say 
for sure 
john nance a pilot and aviation writer in seattle interviewed 
by the ap news network agreed the jumbo jet had to have some 
hydraulic pressure to stay airborne 
i think we can say that we have a flight control problem but 
we did not repeat did not have an airplane that was totally out 
of hydraulics or he wouldnt have been flying at all 
the pilot probably relied on a backup source of hydraulic power 
called the ram air turbine that would have made it increasingly 
difficult to control the aircraft as it approached the airport 
nance said 
the ram air turbine operates some control surfaces by directing 
the rushing outside air as the airplane slows for a landing the 
forced air pressure would be reduced thus making the surfaces 
harder to control 
if all youve got powering your hydraulic systems is a ram air 
turbine then as you slow down it will slow down and then there 
will be less hydraulic pressure available and thus less control 
over the airplane nance said 
ill tell you what ill bet that damn thing hasnt been used 
twice in the history of the aircraft said sullivan its an 
absolute last resort its not going to save you 
ken plunkett a researcher for the aviation safety institute of 
columbus ohio said the dc10 has three separate hydraulic systems 
that control virtually every function of the airplane 
it controls the wing flaps the tail elevators the rudders 
the brakes the steering everything he said if you lose it 
you lose most of your control over the plane that seems to be what 
happened here 
on small planes control surfaces are small and can be operated 
by direct linkages from the control panel but on large planes the 
hydraulic system provides a power assist if it fails there are no 
alternative manual controls 
the dc10 has redundant hydraulics said maury seitz a 
retired delta airlines pilot who now lives in hurst texas its 
set up so that if you lose one you wont lose all of your 
hydraulic fluid and if you lose one system you still have other 
systems 
seitz speculated that the pilot lost rudder control just as he 
approached the runway 
from the looks of it he had that baby under control but then 
he got into a roll situation he said

nevadas booming gambling industry is helping 
the state lead the nation in the growth of nonfarm income the 
government says 
the commerce department reporting nonfarm income growth during 
the 12 months ending march 30 said thursday that nevada led the 
nation with a 15 percent increase 
wyoming trailed the other states showing the only income growth 
that was below the 59 percent rate of inflation for the 12month 
period the department said 
nationwide nonfarm income increased 94 percent although 
there were wide differences between the states 
construction of more hotels and casinos as well as the mining 
industry helped push nevada ahead of the rest of the nation 
according to department analyst rudolph e depass 
also showing sharp increases were florida whose nonfarm income 
was up 121 percent nevadas neighbor california 107 percent 
vermont 105 percent and virginia 105 percent 
depass said wyomings poor 57 percent increase was partly due 
to declines in the construction and services industries 
other states at the low end of the rankings were west virginia 
up 63 percent north dakota 64 percent oklahoma 69 percent 
and alaska 72 percent 
by region the far west with nevada and california led the 
nation with nonfarm income growth of 105 percent this was 
followed by the southeast up 99 percent and new england up 96 
percent 
other regions and their income growth rates were great lakes 9 
percent mideast 89 percent plains 88 percent southwest 86 
percent and rocky mountains 82 percent 
differences between coastal and interior regions in nonfarm 
growth continued to narrow from the first quarter of 1988 to the 
first quarter of 1989 depass said although coastal growth did 
continue to outpace the inland areas 
the commerce department focuses on changes in nonfarm income as 
a better indication of a regions prosperity because of the often 
erratic nature of farm incomes

fans who appear to be asking for more than a 
signature or a photo in letters they dash off to celebrities may 
get an unwanted response from a federal agent 
tuesdays slaying of actress rebecca schaeffer who was sent at 
least one letter by her alleged attacker and a lawsuit filed by 
actor michael j fox against a voracious letter writer have 
heightened concerns about communications between stars and fans 
fan mail is carefully scrutinized in hollywood by celebrity 
agents publicists and representatives who look for threats 
obvious or veiled 
if we get a threatening letter the first thing we do is make 
the client and additional representatives aware of it said david 
brokaw who handles many highprofile movie stars if its 
something we feel concerns us we go to the authorities and report 
it 
during his 18 years in the business his office has received 
just three or four that have concerned me ive always called the 
fbi 
john robert bardo 19 charged in the slaying of miss schaeffer 
who starred in the sitcom my sister sam with pam dawber wrote 
her a love letter los angeles police said 
it was affectionate and a bit rambling but not threatening 
said detective dan andrews 
a 26yearold camarillo woman pleaded innocent in los angeles 
superior court this week to charges of sending thousands of 
threatening letters and rabbit droppings to fox the star of the 
former hit series family ties 
but a judge refused on monday to release tina marieledbetter 
who was being held without bail at the sybil brand institute for 
women 
fox testified that he feared for his safety and that of his 
family he said he received lifethreatening letters over the 
course of a year but 800 of them arrived last july when he married 
actress tracy pollan 
fbi spokesman jim neilson said the fbi investigates any kind of 
extortion if it goes through the mail he declined to comment on 
celebrity mail 
most fan letters are addressed to the production studio where 
the actors last worked or the public relations office representing 
them fan magazines frequently publish such addresses 
we get several hundred pieces of fan mail a week said dick 
grant whose clients include joan rivers larry hagman and richard 
dreyfuss we have people who read through it if its regular 
mail it goes to a fan mail service for photos if its personal a 
letter about a terminally ill child who wants to meet a star its 
referred to the stars office if its threatening it goes to the 
fbi 
the tone of a threatening letter usually determines how 
seriously its contents are taken 
you have to look at the way it is written said dale olsen 
who represents stars like dyan cannon shirley maclaine and sally 
kirkland 
if its very intelligently written grammatically correct and 
appears to come from someone who has a clear idea then it can be 
dangerous olsen said 
if the letter is from someone who is less educated i think 
more often than not its just a fantasy and you dont react to it 
maryann ridini head of publicity advertising and promotion at 
stephen j cannell productions makers of 21 jump street 
wiseguy and hunter said she takes every threatening letter 
seriously 
if it is threatening we immediately take it to our security 
person ridini said we dont mess around with it they deal 
with it and take it to the proper authorities 
we dont take anything lightly if its a threat it needs to 
be investigated properly

israels supreme court is hearing an appeal by 
four peace activists convicted of meeting with plo officials a 
politically charged case that mirrors the debate over a possible 
plo role in any peace settlement 
the court arguments are legal ones but they focus on the wider 
issue of whether dealing with the plo can hasten peace or only give 
credibility to what the government considers a terrorist 
organization bent on israels destruction 
attorney avigdor feldman says his clients the first people 
convicted under an amendment to israels antiterrorist law met 
with plo officials to help end the long arabisraeli conflict 
they were trying to stop the bloodshed in the occupied 
territories feldman said their meeting was for the purpose of 
peace 
on thursday prosecutor ariyeh romanoff argued that the peace 
activistss meeting with 15 plo representatives held in romania in 
1986 was a dangerous act of protest 
we are talking about a demonstration against the law and not 
activities on behalf of peace romanoff said 
he added they commited an ideological crime as serious as 
murder and other criminal violations in the context of the 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
the 19month revolt in which 572 palestinians and 37 israelis 
have died is also at the heart of the national debate 
the rebellion is widely credited with leading to plo chief 
yasser arafats recognition of israel and some leftist israeli 
politicians and dovish members of the mainstream labor party see 
arafats moderation as an opening for israel to talk to the plo 
prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign minister moshe arens 
argue that any contact with the plo hinders attempts to reach a 
settlement with nonplo palestinians in the occupied territories 
abba eban a senior statesman of the centerleft labor party 
ridiculed that stand in sundays jerusalem post we refuse to 
negotiate with those who are willing and are ready to negotiate 
with those who dont exist he wrote 
the arguments are likely to rage on longer than the supreme 
court case but after hearing the appeal thursday the judges gave 
one of the defendants permission to take a months trip abroad 
hinting their judgment may take a while 
the four defendants latif dori yael lotan eliezer feiler and 
reuven kaminer were convicted last year of violating a 1986 law 
that made contacts with the plo a misdemeanor 
they were sentenced to six months in jail each along with 
oneyear suspended sentences but the jail terms later were 
commuted to community service each was also ordered to pay a 
2000 fine 
the outcome of their appeal is likely to affect several other 
cases 
peace activist abie nathan also has been charged with violating 
the antiterrorist law by meeting last year with arafat but his 
trial was postponed until september pending the outcome of the 
court appeal 
last month rightwing members of the knesset or parliament 
demanded that attorney general yosef harish press charges against 
four leftwing legislators for also meeting with arafat harish 
said he intended to press charges 
during a recess in thursdays appeal one of the defendants 
kaminer said he would turn to the knesset to change the law 
against meeting with the plo if the court did not overturn it 
the paradox here is not only are we not guilty of this we 
opposed terrorism in our meeting he said the antiterror law 
was not meant to put people who oppose terrorism in jail

a young man accused of stalking and killing 
actress rebecca schaeffer in los angeles plans to fight extradition 
to california his lawyer said 
robert john bardo 19 was ordered held on 1 million bond 
thursday he appeared from the pima county jail via closedcircuit 
television before superior court judge pro tem walter u weber on a 
california murder fugitive warrant 
weber set the bond which los angeles authorities had requested 
and scheduled an aug 18 hearing to review the status of 
californias extradition efforts 
bardo who was being held in the jails mental health unit under 
a suicide watch gave no audible reply and did not speak during the 
proceeding 
lori lefferts the public defender appointed to represent bardo 
said she advised bardo to not waive extradition 
earlier ms lefferts said bardos mental competency could be at 
issue 
bardo was arrested wednesday by tucson police for running in and 
out of traffic on interstate 10 
after his arrest detectives said bardo gave tucson police 
statements related to ms schaeffer that prompted them to notify 
authorities in los angeles where miss schaeffer costar of the 
defunct my sister sam was shot to death tuesday 
i dont want to say he confessed but he implicated himself 
for sure said los angeles police detective dan andrews 
a female friend of bardos living in tennessee also called los 
angeles police headquarters wednesday to tell police of his 
obsession with miss schaeffer the woman told authorities bardo had 
a video collection of her television shows and an autographed 
publicity photo los angeles police detective dan andrews said 
andrews said bardo had written miss schaeffer an affectionate 
love letter that was a bit rambling 
andrews said the friend also told authorities that bardo said 
he was going to harm miss schaeffer but investigators do not 
know why he might have wanted to do so 
miss schaeffer who appeared in the current film scenes from 
the class struggle in beverly hills was shot once in the chest 
tuesday at the door of her apartment building 
the weapon has not been found tucson sgt paul hallums said 
officers who searched the bardo familys tucson home wednesday 
night and seized several bundles including papers and a telephone 
directory but did not find a gun 
los angeles detectives said bardo is believed to have traveled 
the 480 miles to los angeles by bus and to have returned to tucson 
late tuesday andrews said bardo apparently had gone to california 
several times in the past year and had called miss schaeffers 
agency 
bardo told tucson magistrate clifford hofmann he quit a job last 
week at a fastfood restaurant where he was a custodian bardo 
appeared before hofmann also via closedcircuit television on a 
misdemeanor count of obstructing a street or freeway

us health officials say an aids testing and 
counseling program in boston set up to serve an estimated 14000 
intravenous drug abusers shows promise in reaching that highrisk 
group 
in its first year project trust served 688 clients 
administering tests to 635 for infection with hiv the virus which 
causes aids the national centers for disease control reported 
thursday trust is an acronym for teaching referral 
understanding support and testing 
project trusts 635 testing clients compared with just 473 who 
the cdc said came for anomymous testing at other test sites and 
clinics in the boston area and 79 percent or 503 of project 
trusts 635 testing clients returned to learn the results and seek 
counseling 
for anonymous testing thats very high said cdc researcher 
dr charles s rabkin adding that some aids testing and counseling 
programs have seen as few as 10 percent of clients return for 
results and followup 
cdc officials attributed the programs success to its location 
in a heavy druguse neighborhood promotion through pamphlets and 
word of mouth and to the fact that several of the outreach workers 
were recovering drug addicts 
the cdc said intravenous drug abusers made up onethird of all 
us aids cases reported last year 
its worthwhile to have services directed for intravenous drug 
users rabkin said services specially tailored for them can be 
successful 
the high percentage who returned for their test results 
indicates that hiv prevention measures can be effectively 
provided to intravenous drug abusers if services are tailored 
to the specific needs and circumstances of this highrisk group 
the atlantabased cdc said in its weekly report 
meanwhile the cdc said thursday that 28 states require 
reporting of hiv infections to public health authorities those 
states account for 45 percent of the us population and 24 percent 
of the nearly 100000 aids cases reported through last month 
such reporting the cdc said is useful in directing patient 
counseling and sexpartner notification efforts eighteen of the 28 
hivreporting states require reports by name the cdc said but 
reporting should be accompanied by appropriate safeguards for 
confidentiality 
all states require the reporting of actual aids cases to public 
health authorities

the senates defeat of a determined effort to 
curb the us dialogue with the palestine liberation organization 
hands president bushs mideast policy a significant boost from 
congress 
in a separate action on thursday the senate also voted 5939 to 
open the door to possible us military aid to noncommunist 
resistance forces in cambodia 
supporters of the aid amendment offered by sen charles robb 
dva called it an essential step to help the administrations 
efforts to prevent a return to power of the khmer rouge which was 
blamed for the deaths of more than a million cambodians during 
their fouryear reign in the late 1970s 
opponents said the united states should not aid any faction in 
southeast asia in light of the us involvement in the vietnam war 
sen robert c byrd dwva said the senate was moving too 
quickly approving the possible provision of military aid in the 
middle of the night and without proper consideration and debate 
i stood on this floor when we slid into the war in vietnam 
byrd said i think we should let history give us some guidance 
before we take sudden action here and write a blank check for the 
president 
the senate by voice vote early today late approved the overall 
bill authorizing 46 billion for the operation of the state 
department and allied agencies in the 1990 fiscal year 
the senate shelved 7523 an amendment by sen jesse helms 
rnc which would have halted the talks unless the president 
certified none of the plo participants had any link with an act of 
terrorism that had resulted in the murder injury or kidnapping of 
an american citizen 
bush sent a strongly worded letter defending the talks calling 
helms measure a formula for ending the dialogue and damaging if 
not destroying the us role in the mideast peace process he said 
it was an unconstitutional assault on his powers to conduct us 
foreign policy 
the senate approved 971 a compromise that would stop the 
dialogue only if the president actually knew that one of the plo 
negotiators was a direct participant in an act of terrorism and 
advised the congress 
helms the only senator to vote no called that nothing 
but a fig leaf to permit the state department to continue to do 
what theyve been doing 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said it is my 
understanding that if the president knows of such facts he will 
advise the congress thus cutting off the talks 
helms however said the senate had a clear choice 
are we or are we not going to reward terrorists he asked 
are we or are we not going to bestow respectability upon them 
helms introduced the amendment after two unannounced meetings 
between robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia and 
plo representative saleh khalaf also known as abu iyad 
khalaf is accused of masterminding the massacre of israeli 
athletes at the 1972 olympic games in munich and is a suspect in 
the 1973 assassination of the us ambassador to the sudan cleo 
noel jr 
the united states opened talks with the plo in december after 
chairman yasser arafat publicly renounced terrorism and accepted 
israels right to exist 
the senate also voted 5642 to adopt another helms amendment 
which could make it difficult or impossible for the soviet union 
ever to occupy its new embassy here 
the new us embassy in moscow cannot be occupied because it is 
riddled with soviet eavesdropping devices no decision has been 
made on how to replace it

the city that neil armstrong and edwin buzz 
aldrin put on the map 20 years ago planned no official festivities 
to mark the 20th anniversary of the astronauts moon walk 
residents there are still trying to explain where they live 
before the moon walk moon va was little more than a post 
office and a bump in the road in mathews county near the chesapeake 
bay 
you couldnt even find moon on a virginia road map 
today the community of about 100 families isnt much bigger 
but at least its on the map the attention moon attracted in 1969 
when the eagle landed on its celestial cousin apparently encouraged 
the virginia department of transportation to put it on the official 
state map 
sometimes even maps dont help 
pat chalkley a former mechanicsville resident and relative 
newcomer to moon said she sent her new address to a friend who 
replied with a note where in the hell is moon 
almost heaven to hear mrs chalkley and others describe their 
community 
ive heard people say that once youve seen a full moon over 
the chesapeake bay you never want to leave said mrs chalkley 
whose husband blanton commutes 90 minutes to richmond to work 
i was sitting there the other night looked up and saw this 
absolutely gorgeous big ol orange moon

its been 20 years since neil armstrong 
put his historic footprint on the moons surface and moonville 
residents say theyve waited that long for their adopted son to 
visit them 
moonville adopted armstrong as an honorary resident just before 
he made his famous moon walk in 1969 and residents even had a 
parade for him 
but selfproclaimed mayor sam peckinpaugh said the astronaut has 
never been to this town listed as moonville on state maps and 
called moonsville by the 550 people who live here 
if armstrong did come john gunter would be the one to call 
in 1969 gunter then a radio celebrity told a joke about his 
hometown that got out of hand 
theyre getting ready for the annual fourth of july parade in 
my hometown of moonsville he told listeners before signing off 
it consists of a 1950 buick with a sparkler on top 
more than 50 people called the station asking how to enter cars 
and floats in moonvilles fourth of july parade 
i got a call saying moonsville has to have a parade gunter 
recalled 
so the community did and the timing was perfect 
it was the month armstrong was to lead the apollo 11 mission on 
the moon 
organizers decided to capitalize on the towns name and make 
armstrong an adopted son 
gunter served as grand marshal and neil armstrongs brother 
dean armstrong rode in the buick with gunter 
dean armstrong told the crowd that after the moon landing he 
thought his brother neil might come for a visit 
moonville residents are still waiting and hoping for that 
visit

here is a list of other major plane crashes involving the 
mcdonnelldouglas dc10 
 
march 3 1974 a turkish airlines dc10 crashes near paris 
killing all 346 people aboard after a rear cargo door blows out 
the loss of the door led to decompression that buckled the floor 
of the passenger cabin which in turn severed hydraulic lines 
essential to taking off steering and landing 
the crash was blamed on faulty cargo door design which was 
eventually altered after the crash and other nonfatal incidents of 
door blowouts also as a result of the crash floors in 
widebodied jets were strengthened and hydraulic lines rerouted 
 
may 25 1979 in the united states worst air disaster an 
american airlines dc10 crashes near chicagos ohare airport 
killing 273 people the airliner had just taken off when the engine 
on its left wing tore away the plane rolled into a severe left 
bank and nosed over into the ground 
investigators said faulty maintenance caused the engine to come 
loose and somersault over the wing taking with it essential 
hydraulic lines and control cables 
the final accident report found the crash was caused primarily 
by mistakes made by american airlines maintenance crews but also 
cited mcdonnelldouglas for defects in the design that made the 
plane vulnerable to such damage 
 
oct 31 1979 a western airlines dc10 crashes at the 
fogshrouded mexico city airport killing 71 of the 88 people 
aboard and three people on the ground the plane mistakenly landed

the senate judiciary committee has narrowly 
approved a threeyear ban on sales of nine militarystyle assault 
weapons despite heavy pressure from gun owners organizations 
its designed to deny drug dealers the use of these types of 
weapons sen dennis deconcini dariz said thursday following 
the 76 approval 
the measure would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assault 
weapons five already covered by the bush administrations import 
ban and four others that are produced domestically 
the bill also would provide for up to 10 years of additional 
prison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms 
critics called the measure too restrictive although it was 
modest in comparison with a flurry of bills introduced in february 
following a mass slaying in a california schoolyard with a 
semiautomatic assault rifle 
i think it does a great deal of damage to the right of the 
people to keep and bear arms sen orrin hatch rutah told the 
committee sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said the bill headed 
in the right direction but should be stronger in banning assault 
weapons 
frankly it is a letdown to the law enforcement groups in 
america metzenbaum said

rolex watch was probably held as collateral by banks owed 
substantial sums after the wealthy brothers silverbuying binge 
ended with the silver price collapse of march 1980 
hunt said he and his brothers were thrown into a 
straightjacket situation after their silverbuying spree that 
began in 1973 culminated on silver thursday the day in late march 
1980 when silver prices fell from about 50 an ounce to around 10 
an ounce 
once a billionaire bunker hunt is in us tax court challenging 
155 million in 1982 taxes the internal revenue service says he 
owes from the dissolution of a partnership set up to repay his 
debts from the silver price collapse 
since then bunker and william herbert hunt have filed for 
reorganization under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code as has 
their familys flagship company placid oil co founded by their 
father legendary wildcatter hl hunt

chinas worsening crime problem has been getting 
a more attention in the official press since troops crushed the 
studentled protests for greater freedoms 
in the nearly two months since communist authorities suppressed 
the prodemocracy movement the number of reported arrests for 
embezzlement bribetaking smuggling armed robbery and other 
common crimes has multiplied 
the government is apparently trying to satisfy popular 
discontent over official corruption a chief target of 
prodemocracy protesters 
reports of arrests of protesters by contrast have trickled 
nearly to a halt perhaps to avoid further international 
condemnation 
although chinas crime rate still is one of the lowest in the 
world in recent years the leadership has noted its rapid rise with 
alarm 
the government said early this year that the number of people 
sentenced for crimes in 1988 was up 13 percent from the previous 
year at nearly 368800 
rarely have the media devoted so much space and energy to crime 
reports 
in recent weeks it has not been unusual to find three or four 
reports of crime and corruption at all levels of government and in 
all sectors of society in each of the nations leading newspapers 
sometimes all on the front page 
the number of cases and range of people involved from private 
entrepreneurs to factory managers to highranking officials hints 
at how pervasive crime and corruption is in chinese society 
on thursday the frontpage of the peoples daily the communist 
party newspaper carried two such reports 
one said shanghai authorities have in the years first half 
investigated 134 cases of economic crime involving more than 10000 
yuan 2700 each an amount 100 times the average monthly salary 
sixtyfour people have been arrested and 62 ounces of gold and 
682300 in yuan and various foreign currencies confiscated the 
paper said 
the other much briefer report said that guizhou provincial 
authorities had uncovered a batch of large important criminal 
cases it called for a thorough investigation but gave no details 
on an inside page the newspaper reported that two judicial 
department workers were sentenced one to eight and the other to 
nine years for seeking and accepting bribes totaling about 7200 
in cash and appliances 
many reports are careful to point out that investigations began 
months before the studentled prodemocracy movement which 
authorities crushed june 4 when the army killed hundreds of unarmed 
civilians in running protesters out of central beijing

were wheeled into emergency wards a dozen at a time said dr david 
greco chief of the emergency department at marian health center 
he said people turned out in such numbers to give blood wednesday 
night that less than a third of it was needed for injured 
passengers 
i think there was a tremendous feeling of people wanting to do 
something said les horrell jr chamber of commerce president 
sioux city a beef pork and grain processing center is a town 
of 82000 that sits on the east bank of a giant bend in the 
missouri river 
our chief of staff chartered an airplane and flew home from

lukes medical center 
we had offers of help from doctors and nurses at hospitals in 
three states she said several hospital burn units also 
offered to send nurses or treat our patients 
at marian vice president andrew allen said supplies arrived

got five months of inventory inside of three hours he said 
nurses were handing out emotional support along with bandages

a bash for 10000 past and present 
nasa employees had the same open bar and mob scene as the parties 
that followed apollo missions 20 years ago 
the only thing missing was the splashdown 
then they threw everybody in the pool said cookie 
leisenring a retired national aeronautics and space administration 
employee who was trying to take pictures of the honored guests at 
thursdays party at the johnson space center apollo 11 astronauts 
neil armstrong and edwin buzz aldrin and michael collins who 
marked the 20th anniversary of the first moonwalk 
leisenring recalled with pleasure the informal parties that 
followed the apollo splashdowns of the 60s and 70s 
you knew everybody the cars were parked on the medians and 
you had to work to get up to the bar mrs leisenring said all 
the contractors had open bars at the hotels and you just walked up 
and tried to make your way to get a drink the parties were 
everywhere 
one big party activity throwing others into the hotel swimming 
pools wasnt possible thursday the robert r gilruth recreation 
facility has no pool 
separate outdoor areas of the party were designated for 
different departments such as engineering and development and 
recovery crew inside a band played in a gymsized room decorated 
with starshaped ballons and blue balloons with the us flag on 
them 
beer and soft drinks were free but partygoers had to pay for 
hot dogs 
the crowds were so dense when the astronauts arrived at the 
party that space center director aaron cohen had to board a van 
carrying the astronauts to officially greet them hans mark a 
former director also greeted the astronauts 
twenty years ago i sat in mission control when these guys 
came down and i wouldnt miss this for the world said mark now 
the chancellor for the university of texas system 
collins aldrin and armstrong who earlier thursday ate a 
barbecue lunch with president bush in washington dc exited the 
van to loud cheers and then went separate ways to mingle with the 
crowd 
it is exciting to get to see all these guys that figured out 
how to go to the moon in the first place said ken schultz an 
engineer for lockheed engineering amp science co inc im just 
sitting here and going wow 
on july 20 1969 armstrong and aldrin planted their footsteps 
on the moon while collins circled above in the spacecraft that 
carried the three back to earth 
president bush proposed thursday to establish a us moon base 
early in the next century and then mount a manned mars mission his 
proposal is likely to ignite a national debate in a budgetminded 
congress and among those who believe federal dollars should not be 
spent on costly space endeavors but on solving more earthly 
problems 
after the splashdown party the three former astronauts attended 
a private party at a nearby hotel where they watched a fireworks 
display that began at 956 pm the moment armstrong stepped on 
the moon two decades ago

with a man linked to a cult ring that allegedly smuggled marijuana 
and killed at least 15 people in rituals intended to magically 
protect its operations 
serafin hernandez rivera 45 pleaded guilty thursday to 
possession with intent to distribute 113 pounds of marijuana seized

charges against hernandez along with a firearms indictment in 
exchange for hernandez cooperation said assistant us attorney 
john crews

a man described in news reports as the sailor 
who may have set off the uss iowa blast in which he and 46 
shipmates were killed said in letters to his girlfriend that the 
navy was his life 
in a dec 1 letter to charlene meter gunners mate clayton 
hartwig 25 said he was not seeking a commitment from her because 
of their different lifestyles and because he planned to reenlist 
i feel like an outsider a visitor when i come home he 
wrote i dont know anyone but my family i have no friends in 
cleveland their all in the navy 
copies of 11 of hartwigs letters were made available to the 
associated press by his sister kathy kubicina of cleveland ten 
of the letters were to ms meter and one was to hartwigs parents 
an unreleased navy report says hartwig 25 may have set off the 
april 19 gun turret blast that killed him and 46 others on the 
battleship nbc news and the new york times reported this week 
nbc reported tuesday that a navy investigation has ruled out 
mechanical problems accidental detonation or other technical 
causes for the explosion 
the investigators based their findings on an fbi psychological 
profile of hartwig and 228 other exhibits including a threehour 
videotaped statement from an iowa sailor who said he rejected 
hartwigs sexual advances nbc said 
a psychiatric study done by the fbi center for analysis of 
violent crimes found that hartwig was disturbed and under a lot of 
stress virtually insuring some type of reaction in this 
instance it is suicide according to the report 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said the navys report is in 
norfolk va on the desk of vice adm joseph s donnell iii the 
commander of the naval surface forces the spokesman said the 
report must go up the chain of command for review before being 
submitted to defense secretary dick cheney 
navy sources said thursday the report is expected to take 
several more weeks to complete 
ms kubicina has rejected suggestions that the blast may have 
been caused by sabotage by a suicidal hartwig their father earl 
v hartwig of cleveland said there was no way definitely that 
his son was suicidal 
ms kubicina said the letters she released show he was a normal 
serviceman she said that she earlier gave the originals to the 
navy in hopes of clearing his name 
in letters to ms meter hartwig wrote about their different 
lifestyles and mentioned feelings of loneliness 
for the last 6 yrs all ive known is the navy im military 
through and through and at times its hard for me to get along with 
civilians he wrote in a nov 8 letter written from a ship off 
guantanamo bay cuba 
i guess its like this i have no idea what goes on in your 
life in college he continued your problems from day to day 
your frustrations the people you cant stand what you do its 
the same for you with me theres no way you could understand what 
its like to live in a cramped ship and be at sea for months at a 
time 
three days before the explosion hartwig again wrote to ms 
meter from the iowa in the caribbean 
i spent a lot of time outside today just watching the water go 
by and thinking its really quite beautiful out hear if you stop 
to notice he wrote we saw some whales swimming along in front 
of the ship the water is a bright royal blue and the sky was 
crystal clear

photojournalist tony obrien six weeks after he was arrested in 
kabul in the company of antigovernment guerrillas who brought him 
into the country 
i want to walk on the street obrien 43 of santa fe 
nm said moments after he was formally handed over to us 
consular officer renny smith who had flown to kabul from new delhi 
i want to thank the people of afghanistan the government of 
the united states and president najibullah said obrien who 
had been on assignment for timelife inc covering the war from 
the pakistan border city of peshawar 
the photographer was arrested at a rebel hideout in the capital 
on june 8 after entering the country without a visa 
but he was never formally charged and the sovietbacked 
government agreed to release him after a personal appeal by plo 
chairman yasser arafat 
he is to fly home via new delhi on saturday 
the afghan government had demanded a formal letter from the 
state department requesting obriens release and authorizing ms 
smith to escort him out of the country ms smith said she 
delivered a letter and another one was sent by telex from 
washington direct to the afghan government 
the contents of the letters were not disclosed 
they got what they wanted she said without elaborating 
diplomatic sources said the government appeared to be using 
obrien as a pawn in an effort to force the united states which 
backs the rebels into issuing a statement that could be construed 
as recognizing najibs government as legitimate 
a french photographer and an italian photojournalist captured by 
government forces were freed last year but only after their 
governments formally requested their release and dispatched senior 
officials to kabul 
the clemency pleas by the french and italian governments were 
widely publicized by kabul as a show of official international 
recognition 
the guerrillas backed by the united states and based in 
pakistan have been fighting to overthrow the sovietsupported 
government for 11 years 
the united states and other western nations closed their 
embassies in kabul in late january and early february shortly 
before soviet troops withdrew from afghanistan ending a nineyear 
military intervention

government records on the united dc10 that 
crashed in iowa are pretty clean with no major problems 
reported in recent years a spokeswoman for the federal aviation 
administration said 
the 15yearold jumbo jet had no accidents or reports of serious 
incidents during the past five years the amount of time covered in 
the agencys current records according to bobbie mardis in the 
faas oklahoma city office 
a separate faa service difficulty report covering 1980 to 1989 
showed two occasions when an engine on the jet flamed out or quit 
during flight no structural damage was evident in either case ms 
mardis said thursday 
connections cannot be immediately made between those engines and 
the ones now on the plane because officials havent identified the 
serial numbers of the engines in iowa ms mardis said 
but she said the engines on the jet most likely are different 
from those that experienced flameouts in 1980 and 1984 because 
they are replacing engines all the time 
she also said it is not uncommon for jets to experience engine 
flameouts and engines do not have to be replaced because of them 
the report looks pretty clean ms mardis said 
officials in sioux city reported late thursday that the planes 
tail engine failed and an engine fanrotor system was lost the 
planes tail wing also sustained several projectile 
penetrations including one hole 10by12 inches they said 
roland herwig a spokesman for the faa center in oklahoma city 
said it is complete hearsay at this point that the plane that 
crashed had problems during an earlier flight wednesday 
a new jersey woman said she took the same dc10 from 
philadelphia to denver wednesday morning and that as the plane 
began to leave the terminal at philadelphia international airport 
shortly after 10 am everything sort of shut off 
the plane taxied back to the terminal where it sat about 15 
minutes for repairs before taking off said ruth dinsmore of mount 
laurel nj flight 232 was making the return trip from denver 
herwig said no official has said there was a problem we dont 
even know if it was the same airplane he said 
united spokeswoman kim thomas in chicago said she could not 
confirm that the dc10 had difficulty earlier in the day and would 
not comment on maintenance records because they are material to 
official investigations 
the faas service difficulty records on the jet show problems 
united has reported to the faa airlines are required to submit 
certain information about failures but sometimes submit more data 
than is required so that the information can be used by others in 
the aviation industry 
the last engine flameout reported was in september 1984 when an 
engine quit with 5500 pounds of fuel in a tank and the aft boost 
light on the report said the problem could not be duplicated in 
subsequent tests 
in november 1980 an engine flamed out at 33500 feet when the 
drive shaft failed the faa records do not indicate how repairs 
were made 
the records also cite some minor landing gear problems 
including a july 1988 incident in which the crew reported the left 
gear red light was on with the gear handle up some landing gear 
position indicator parts had to be replaced the report said 
in january 1987 the flight crew reported it had no indication 
that the landing gear was locked down but the jet landed without 
incident maintenance crews found the landing gear handle sticking 
and lubricated the handle the system checked out after that the 
faa report shows 
in june 1987 a right gear door cable was replaced after the 
right main gear showed both a green and red light

china said today it will not tolerate continued 
support by hong kong residents for the mainlands crushed democracy 
movement and that hong kong will be allowed to remain capitalist 
only if it stops interfering 
the warning was made in a strongly worded commentary in the 
communist party newspaper the peoples daily that apparently was 
written by a highlevel official it immediately triggered 
widespread publicity in the tiny british colony scheduled to 
return to chinese rule in 1997 
we will not allow people to use hong kong as a base for 
subverting the central peoples government this has been the 
chinese governments consistent policy it declared 
the commentary noted that china has promised the enclave can 
remain capitalist for at least 50 years but said not engaging 
in activities to overthrow the chinese government is a 
precondition for allowing hong kong to retain its capitalist 
system 
it also said any participation by hong kong residents in affairs 
of the mainland would have to be in keeping with mainland laws 
hundreds of thousands of usually apolitical hong kong residents 
joined in protest marches and petition drives after the june 34 
army attack on prodemocracy student protesters in beijing and 
other chinese cities 
many said the attack followed by thousands of arrests would 
accelerate emigration from the colony 
chinese leaders have said they want to restore confidence among 
hong kong residents they assured prominent hong kong residents 
invited to beijing that china had not changed its policy of one 
country two systems after 1997 
but the tone of the commentary with its declaration that true 
democracy can only be found under the socialist system was likely 
to have the opposite effect 
this is the time to see how strong our backbone is 
democracy activisit szeto wah who was criticized in the 
commentary said on hong kong radio 
the commentary singled out szetos group the newly formed hong 
kong alliance in support of the patriotic democratic movement in 
china which has pledged 156000 to help fugitives from the 
mainland movement 
without mentioning them by name the commentary accused szeto 
and the vice chairman of the group martin lee of supporting 
independence for hong kong and plotting to overthrow the communist 
government 
szeto denied the charge saying he opposed chinas current 
leaders but not socialism he and lee are members of a joint hong 
kongchinese committee that is drafting a basic law to govern hong 
kong after 1997 
the chinese leaders know that we have popular support and 
this is their way their devious way of persuading people not 
to join us out of fear lee said on hong kong radio 
another alliance leader lee wingtat said the commentary would 
not deter his group from sending funds to chinese fugitives in 
france who have announced plans to form a democratic coalition 
the peoples daily essay was signed by a pseudonym ai zhong 
that sounds the same as the words love china 
several major commentaries have appeared in the peoples daily 
in recent days under pen names apparently the word of toplevel 
officials 
such a practice has not been common since the 196676 cultural 
revolution a violent farleftist campaign that has had eerie 
echoes in the current crackdown on dissent 
another similarity is in the emphasis on ideology over economic 
development which had been the main concern of the past decade 
at a meeting of propaganda officials from around the country 
party general secretary jiang zemin called for 100 percent 
emphasis on ideological work 
other officials called for strict adherence to party 
propaganda discipline speeches from the meeting were blazoned on 
front pages today 
other commentaries emphasized that class struggle has not ended 
and said advocates of westernstyle liberalism are class enemies 
in another development chinas leading dissident fang lizhi 
who is hiding in the us embassy has been expelled from his posts 
in the dialectics research society the official xinhua news agency 
said 
fang an astrophysicist worked in the beijing observatory but 
repeated phone calls to determine if he had been fired as well were 
not answered

destroy the military and revive anarchy in the country

troops had surrounded ms suu kyis house in a suburb of the

with death sentences 
on wednesday hundreds of students defied martial law to hold

14yearold drug law that deems a trafficker to be anyone carrying 
more than a half ounce of heroin 
authorities ignored pleas from british diplomats that he be 
spared 
gregory clutched the photo of his daughter tara through the 
night until he was marched to the gallows early today authorities 
said 
gregory 39 had not seen his daughter since she was an infant 
he was arrested in 1982 at a malaysian airport with the heroin 
hidden in his boots at the trial the court in penang was told 
gregory had 14 packets of the drug in his boots and four packets in 
his underwear he was arrested just before he planned to board a 
plane for singapore en route to los angeles 
his wife divorced him soon after he was sentenced to death in 
1987 
gregory of middlesex england was turned down in his final 
appeal for clemency by the penang states pardons board last week

magistrate were present at todays hanging 
gregory had sent letters to queen elizabeth asking her to 
intercede but british diplomats said it was not common practice 
for the queen to interfere in such matters 
however the first secretary at the british embassy in kuala 
lumpur ashe wyndham said his government had hoped that the 
representation made at all levels to the malaysian authorities 
making a plea for commutation of the death sentence on humanitarian 
grounds would succeed

twelve former tamil guerrillas took 
their seats in parliament today ending a fivemonth boycott by 
disavowing a separatist campaign to divide this troubled island 
nation 
we come here today in the hope of using parliament as a forum 
to propagate on behalf of the tamil people although we do not 
think parliament can resolve the ethnic problems of this country 
said eliyathamby ratnasabapathy of the eelam revolutionary 
organization of students 
tamil rebels have been fighting the sinhalesedominated 
government for six years violence by sinhalese radicals opposed to 
a plan to grant regional autonomy to tamils has left more than 470 
people dead in recent weeks the government said thursday 
ratnasabapathy was among 13 members of the opposition party 
elected to the 225seat parliament the 13th did not attend todays 
session colleagues said because he could not arrive on time they 
did not elaborate 
the opposition party known as eros won its seats in the feb 
15 general election the legislators boycotted the session 
demanding the government release tamil political prisoners hold 
peace talks with the most militant guerrillas and abolish an 
amendment to the constitution requiring lawmakers to take an oath 
disavowing the division of the island along ethnic lines 
ratnasabapathy said the group was satisfied the government met 
most of its demands 
president ranasinghe premadasas government opened peace talks 
with the tamil tigers on may 4 the first direct contact since the 
insurgency began six years ago and ordered the release of hundreds 
of tamil political prisoners the constitutional amendment 
however was not abolished 
eros is widely believed to be closely linked with the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam the largest and most militant of the tamil 
groups waging a campaign for a separate nation in the north and 
east 
ratnasabapathy and the other eros members joined parliament as 
it was debating whether to extend the state of emergency imposed a 
month ago to try to curb ethnic violence emergency laws are not 
going to solve any problems of the people the government will have 
to use democratic methods to bring about a solution he said 
the emergency laws had been in effect from 1983 until january 
1989 when premadasa took office and lifted the state of emergency 
but the killings continued and the emergency was reimposed june 20 
sinhalese radicals trying to overthrow the government killed 472 
people in recent weeks despite a tough new crackdown by security 
forces an official said vincent perrera minister for 
parliamentary affairs said thursday that the killings occurred 
from june 21 to july 15 
most deaths since july 6 had not been previously reported 
because of government censorship of news reports in addition to 
censorship the government gave security forces sweeping powers 
including shootonsight orders to quell the radical movement 
perrera also said that 70 people were killed in the 
tamildominated north and east during the same period he did not 
name the suspected assailants 
sinhalese militants operate mainly in the center and south of 
the island 
tamil rebels began fighting for a separate country in 1983 
prompting the start of the emergency laws 
in 1987 the sinhalesedominated government offered the rebels 
limited autonomy in exchange for a surrender of arms but the 
tigers rejected the plan and began fighting indian soldiers who had 
been sent to enforce it 
the agreement also caused a backlash from sinhalese hardliners 
who began attacking the government saying it was giving too many 
concessions to the minority tamils the two conflicts have left at 
least 15000 people dead

police arrested three thai fishermen 
who confessed they killed 56 vietnamese boat people by attacking 
them with knives sticks and axes and throwing them into the sea 
an officer said today 
the men were arrested tuesday after they were identified by the 
only two survivors of the march 26 attack said lt col prakob 
benjapong of marine police in the southern fishing port of songkhla 
boat captain boonrub ruangdit 27 and vichoke wongkan 29 and 
amnuay saenghiran 19 then made confessions said prakob 
according to prakob the fishermen said they robbed the 
vietnamese then transferred 10 women to their boat 
they called the vietnamese men onto the deck one by one struck 
them in the head and legs and threw them overboard prakob said 
they later killed the women in a similar fashion 
prakob said the fishermen towed the vietnamese boat from the 
area and sailed around for an hour to make sure all the victims 
died 
the survivors pham hgoc van 33 and do hoa 14 reached a 
refugee camp in malaysia 
police are seeking about six other fishermen believed involved 
in the attack said prakob 
attacks on vietnamese boat people who sometimes flee with gold 
and other valuables have become increasingly violent in the past 
year and have left scores if not hundreds dead this year 
last month police said four other thai fishermen were arrested 
and confessed to killing 130 vietnamese refugees on april 16 off 
the malaysian coast 
the threat of pirates prisonlike refugee camps and days at 
sea without food and water have not discouraged the exodus of 
vietnamese more than 15 million have left their homeland since 
the communist takeover in april 1975 
nations such as hong kong that are overwhelmed by the exodus say 
most of the refugees now are fleeing economic hardship not 
political persecution

the military in somalia summarily executed 
46 men after 400 people were killed in clashes that began when 
troops fired on moslem worshipers there a human rights group and 
independent sources said today 
the executed men were among an estimated 2000 people arrested 
in housetohouse searches after the disturbances one week ago in 
the somali capital mogadishu said the human rights group africa 
watch 
the group said the men were rounded up two days after the 
unrest taken to a beach just outside mogadishu and shot to death 
africa watch and other sources put the number killed during the 
july 14 violence at around 400 somalias government previously 
said 23 people died and 59 were injured in the unrest which it 
blamed on troublemakers 
africa watch and the other sources said many of those who were 
slain died when military vehicles armed with 50caliber machine 
guns opened fire on houses in heavily populated residential 
districts 
the human rights group said more than 1000 people were injured 
africa watch with offices in london and washington released 
its statement in nairobi the independent sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisals 
mogadishu residents contacted by telephone said that aside from 
isolated gunfire that continued a day after the riots there had 
been no further violence in mogadishu 
africa watch and the independent sources said the violence broke 
out after the july 13 arrests of four moslem leaders and an 
unspecified number of civilians they said armed detachments 
surrounded mogadishus major mosques in anticipation of protests 
and tried to disperse worshipers as they left the mosques following 
prayers 
soldiers then opened fire on the worshipers who fought back 
mainly with rocks and stones the human rights group said in at 
least one neighborhood worshipers who outnumbered security forces 
seized their weapons and returned fire the rights group said 
the army moved into the city with tanks and took over major 
government buildings and stategic roads according to africa watch 
witnesses reached by telephone said that at one point a mob 
screaming allahu akbar arabic for god is great made log 
roadblocks to stop military vehicles mounted with machine guns and 
firing at random in city streets 
throughout that evening and the next night soldiers went from 
house to house arresting men raping women and looting property 
witnesses said 
the violence also appeared linked to the slaying of mogadishus 
roman catholic bishop salvatore colombo on july 9 by an 
unidentified gunman the bishop was an italian citizen who had 
lived in somalia for more than 40 years 
africa watch reported widespread suspicion in mogadishu that 
colombos death was ordered by government forces who suspected him 
of relaying information about human rights abuses to foreign 
governments 
moslem leaders are said to have been angry the government 
offered a 13000 reward for information about his killing because 
they felt officials generally showed little concern for the welfare 
of somalis africa watch reported 
some residents reported a recent upsurge in antichristian and 
antiwhite feeling in the capital and said colombo was suspected of 
trying to convert moslem youth 
the reports were difficult to verify because the government has 
barred journalists from visiting somalia since heavy fighting broke 
out between government forces and the northern rebel somali 
national movement in may 1988 
islam is the state religion in the poor pastoral east african 
nation of 6 million there are about 2000 catholics 
the autocratic president mohamed siad barre has ruled somalia as 
a oneparty state since 1969

100 greek cypriot women protesting the 15year turkish occupation 
of northern cyprus said today that riot police beat demonstrators 
and poked them with electric prods 
it was such a madhouse there with the horrible turkish army 
hordes charging at us with their batons and rifles said hetty 
lubberding a correspondent for dutch radio their behavior 
was brutal 
she also said organizers of the protest by hundreds of women 
were partly responsible for provoking the turkish response 
wednesday night she said the organizers chose a highly sensitive 
area to enter the buffer zone between the wardivided sections of 
the capital and that they displayed the greek flag 
in ankara today the turkish government said the un 
peacekeeping force watching the zone did not do enough to prevent 
protesters from knocking down barbed wire barricades and occupying 
a destroyed school and church in the zone 
we have difficulty understanding the failure of the 
peacekeeping force to take the necessary measures and the 
unprecedented tolerance shown to the violation of the buffer 
zone a turkish foreign ministry statement said 
ms lubberding said police used electric prods on demonstrators 
beat and slapped them and pulled their hair 
turkish cypriot police arrested 111 people in the protest three

the family of pilot thomas root hopes 
extensive medical and psychological tests will help solve the 
mystery of his 800mile odyssey which may be linked to a prior 
blackout roots brother said 
we would like a full medical evaluation todd root said 
thursday we want to make sure theres not more to this than just 
an accident our family is interested in only one thing getting to 
the bottom of what may have caused this and getting my brother the 
proper treatment 
thomas root a 36yearold communications lawyer in washington 
dc blacked out in his office in march but doctors could not 
find an explanation after three days of tests his brother said 
maybe there is some link from that incident to this one he 
said 
thomas root has said he blacked out two hours after taking off 
from washington national airport en route to rocky mount nc 
july 13 
his flight continued on autopilot while military rescue planes 
followed until he ditched in bahamian waters it was then 
discovered that he had been shot in the abdomen with a 32caliber 
pistol he claims it discharged by itself from the planes glove 
box 
i want to believe its an accident todd root told 
reporters yet i know the circumstances surrounding this are so 
mysterious that its hard for the general public and anyone not to 
believe there might be more to it 
todd root said his brother was running a fever and was advised 
by doctors and relatives not to meet with reporters 
hospital spokeswoman linda hamlin refused to comment on 
scheduled tests for root 
tom roots brother made statements about the test said ms 
hamlin he is an intelligent man and seemed to know what he is 
talking about 
in miami a spokeswoman for us attorney dexter lehtinen 
confirmed that lehtinen requested reports on the fbi interrogation 
of root 
a source close to the investigation said it probably would 
examine whether root filed false information about his flight or is 
liable for search and rescue expenses

organization of american states foreign 
ministers are asking gen manuel antonio noriega to arrange a 
transfer of power over the next six weeks as part of a plan to 
restore democratic rule in panama 
a declaration approved by the ministers thursday was a 
masterpiece of diplomatic evenhandedness earning the support of 
both the us delegate and noriegas representative 
specifically the declaration said the proposed transfer of 
power on sept 1 and subsequent free elections are to be carried 
out through democratic means and in conformity with existing 
internal panamanian procedures 
the declaration lacks an enforcement mechanism and does not 
specifically ask for noriega to step down advocates of a stronger 
statement expressed concern that he might try to rig the process in 
a way that enables him to maintain control from his power base as 
commander of the panamanian defense force 
privately us officials expressed dismay with the outcome but 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger indicated in brief 
remarks that the declaration has enough teeth to warrant us 
backing 
addressing delegates from the 31member body assembled at the 
ornate oas headquarters eagleburger said the transfer of power 
envisioned in the declaration must reflect the will of the 
panamanian people 
in addition the new democratic elections called for must not be 
held in one two or three years but as soon as possible 
consistent with the wording of the declaration he said 
general noriega must go eagleburger added 
the united states has called for the oas to exert maximum 
pressure on noriega who has been accused by two florida grand 
juries of drug smuggling activities 
the ministers also extendeduntil aug 23 the mandate of an oas 
mediating team which has been trying to facilitate an end to the 
twomonth old political crisis in panama 
panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter pledged his 
governments full cooperation with the mediating team which is 
comprised of the foreign ministers of ecuador guatemala and 
trinidad and which has received the cooperation of oas secretary 
general joao baena soares 
according to the panamanian constitution a new president is to 
be installed sept 1 the bush administration had hoped the oas 
would push for the installation as president of the opposition 
candidate in the may 7 national elections 
the results of that balloting were thrown out by panamas 
electoral tribunal amid widespread claims that guillermo endara 
the candidate opposed to noriega had won in a landslide 
by calling for another round of elections after sept 1 the 
oas in effect accepted as permanent the annulment of the may 7 
balloting 
the reference to the need to abide by existing internal 
panamanian procedures also was seen as a concession to noriega

investigators probing the destruction of 
united flight 232 focused today on the planes tail section and 
rear engine which apparently exploded in flight 
a severe engine explosion may have destroyed the hydraulic 
system that powers primary control mechanisms on the triplejet 
dc10 that crashed wednesday at sioux city iowa james burnett of 
the national transportation safety board said on cbs this 
morning 
but he said on nbcs today show we have to assemble a 
lot more information before well even get close to the cause of 
this accident 
there was a severe explosion enough that the flight 
attendants fell to the floor burnett told a news conference late 
thursday there was severe vibration of the aircraft the chief 
flight attendant went into the cockpit found the flight crew 
struggling with the controls 
the crew then began preparing the passengers for an emergency 
land he said 
ntsb investigators were attempting to recover remaining pieces 
of the engine whose parts were flung up to 60 miles ahead of the 
emergency landing site 
burnett said on abcs good morning america that eight groups 
of investigators were working in sioux city with others traveling 
to minneapolis to interview air traffic controllers who 
communicated with the flight and to san francisco to look at 
maintenance records for the aircraft 
in washington safety board engineers and scientists were going 
over tapes from the cockpit voice recorder and the planes digital 
data recorder which aeronautical engineer thomas jackey said were 
recovered in good condition from the tail section both were 
encased in apparently undamaged orange metal boxes 
the data recorder contains several hours of information about 
the plane its speed compass heading and other data recorded 
digitally every few seconds 
the voice recorder has the last half hour of conversation in the 
cockpit but a transcript is not expected to be released for 
several weeks investigators also were interviewing witnesses 
including the three cockpit crew members who survived the crash 
along with about twothirds of the nearly 300 passengers 
officials were still trying to get a final count on the number 
of dead and the number who struggled free from the wreckage 
investigators and aviation experts speculated that several 
factors aided those passengers who survived the tumbling of the 
plane which had the effect of lessening the impact the fact that 
the pilot had time to prepare passengers for a crash landing the 
quick breakup of the plane that opened up wide exits and the fact 
that a large section was thrown free of the fireball that engulfed 
parts of the aircraft 
a safety board official who discussed the investigation on 
condition of anonymity said the investigative agency was focusing 
initially on the tail section because that was the location of the 
engine whose explosive failure apparently started the problem 
the dc10s three independent hydraulic systems come together at 
their closest point in the same area of the plane 
douglas aircraft spokesman don hanson said the systems which 
are essential to control flight takeoff and landing are designed 
so that the plane can fly even if two of the three fail but ntsb 
member burnett said late thursday that all fluid had drained from 
the systems 
design of the dc10 has long been controversial with some 
aviation safety activists declaring it unsafe 
john galipault of the aviation safety institute a nonprofit 
group that pushes for safer planes said the crash underscores 
serious problems in dc10 design 
he said the common element in several dc10 crashes and 
incidents has been loss of some or all of the pilots ability to 
control the aircraft after a catastrophic failure in a single 
system 
when that happens the pilot becomes a passenger he said 
it reinforces my concern about the airplane its too bad but it 
has a terrible safety record 
in 1974 loss of a cargo door caused decompression in a turkish 
airlines dc10 over france the planes floor buckled snapping 
control cables and the airliner went out of control killing 346 
people 
on may 25 1979 in chicago the engine of an american airlines 
dc10 broke loose and catapulted over the wing during takeoff 
breaking hydraulic cables and causing a crash that killed 275 
people investigators blamed faulty maintenance but recommended a 
design review 
mcdonnell douglas spokesman david eastman said he knew of only 
one design change that has occurred in the dc10 since the chicago 
crash involving instrumentation that would warn the pilot when 
wing slats were improperly positioned

eighteen employees of a chinafunded newspaper 
in hong kong announced their resignations today to protest the 
firing of a publisher who criticized the chinese crackdown on 
prodemocracy protesters 
the resignations came the same day china said it will not 
tolerate support by hong kong residents for the mainlands 
democracy movement and that hong kong will be allowed to remain 
capitalist only if it stops interfering 
china is scheduled to take control of the british colony in 1997 
but has pledged to let it remain capitalist for at least 50 years 
the publisher of the wen wei po newspaper lee tzechung was 
fired saturday by the chinese communist government which pays for 
the paper the government acted through its official xinhua news 
agency 
the newspaper had long supported china but joined other hong 
kong publications in denouncing the june 34 military crackdown in 
beijing 
today i cant be an accomplice to the murderers anymore 
lee said in a television interview after the crackdown 
in a statement sent by facsimile to the associated press 18 
reporters and other employees of the newspaper announced their 
resignation saying they could not accept the dismissal of lee 
they said that under all sorts of pressure the correct 
position taken by lee no longer can be maintained we deeply 
regret this 
earlier in the week a senior manager at the paper who is among 
those who resigned told reporters from other news organizations it 
was pointless to stay because we cannot do anything 
the manager who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed 
reporters who sympathized with lee were being verbally harassed and 
that management was trying to brainwash the staff to back lees 
firing 
wen wei po will be another peoples daily the source said 
referring to the chinese communist partys official newspaper 
published in beijing 
todays warning about hong kongs backing of chinese protesters 
came in a strongly worded commentary in the peoples daily the 
commentary was apparently written by a highlevel government 
official 
while noting chinas promise to let hong kong remain capitalist 
for at least 50 years the commentary said not engaging in 
activities to overthrow the chinese government is a precondition 
for allowing hong kong to retain its capitalist system 
it was not immediately clear how the resignations would affect 
the hong kong newspaper which had about 300 employees a woman 
answering a telephone call to the paper today said there was nobody 
available to comment

the government plans to test beef from 
the united states and other countries for alar and other suspected 
cancercausing substances a news report said today 
meanwhile consumers remained wary of us grapefruit after an 
alar scare based on a false interpretation of a chemical test 
in taiwan consumers were shunning us cherries even though 
health officials say the fears of alar in that fruit are unfounded 
importers said 
yonhap the south korean news agency said this countrys 
agriculture forestry and fisheries ministry will oversee meat 
testing and return beef imports if the tests turn up the smallest 
traces of daminozide known commercially as alar or other 
chemicals 
south korea imports beef from the united states canada 
australia and new zealand 
a ministry spokesman said he could not confirm the news report 
but he said the matter was under study the spokesman said 
officials were concerned about a us report published may 24 that 
found alar residues in meat 
the study by alars manufacturer uniroyal chemical co found 
20 parts per million of alar in unspecified meat the 
environmental protection agency said however it found no reason 
to restrict the use of alar in any food except apples where it 
found alar levels of 10 parts per million 
epas mention of the study in the federal register did not 
explicitly say where the alar in meat came from however it 
suggested the chemical came from animals feeding on fruit or other 
products treated with alar 
alar leaped into the international picture in february when a 
us consumer group the natural resources defense council said in 
a report that eating apples treated with alar increased cancer risk 
in children 
the us environmental protection agency and the food and drug 
administration disputed the groups report as a major exaggeration 
of the risk but apple sales fell immediately 
despite its criticism of the report the epa plans to ban the 
use of alar next spring the manufacturer has withdrawn alar from 
the us market 
alar is used to make apples redder and enhance their shelf life 
korean consumers began boycotting us grapefruit last month 
after a government laboratory appeared to have detected traces of 
alar in florida grapefruit the report later proved to be mistaken 
but consumers remained skeptical and a campaign to ban alar and 
other chemicals from food products has grown south korea about a 
dozen consumer groups claiming 2 million members 
in washington on thursday lawmakers from grapefruitgrowing 
states blamed the chemical scare on the seoul government and said 
unfair trade charges should be filed against south korea for using 
scare tactics for protectionism 
washington has pushed seoul to open its markets to more us 
farm products south korean farmers have protested claiming the 
imports undercut domestic prices however consumer groups in south 
korea say their worries center on harmful chemicals not trade 
issues 
us rep tom lewis rfla said the boycott has left 60000 
boxes of american citrus rotting in south korea a spokesman for 
the citrus industry in seoul said he was unaware of any losses but 
he conceded that if the fruit is left in cold storage will not last 
long 
in taipei taiwan the governments health department announced 
thursday that cherries were safe to eat after laboratory tests 
showed the imported us fruit carried no residue of alar 
the tests were conducted following reports from south korea that 
alar was found in cherries imported from the united states 
one importer hsieh chienchih said people were still shying 
away from the cherries people are confused by the contradictory 
reports and they feel it is safer to eat taiwan watermelons or 
guavas instead the importer said 
people say they can be killed after eating the fruit the 
market is over for cherries this year the importer said 
taipei fruit trade association officials said cherry sales had 
dropped more than 60 percent since the south korean test results 
were published this month 
in yakima wash brent heinemann of the washington state 
department of agriculture said two 1700box containers of 
washington cherries were sitting at the port of inchon west of 
seoul unable to clear customs 
trade industry officials in seoul confirmed a cherry shipment 
was stalled at customs but said it was held up over a claim of 
improper handling by the shipper

cuellar said today that south african officials have rejected his 
request for the dismissal of more than 2000 namibian police

however the un chief predicted that namibia will hold 
elections as scheduled nov 6 to establish an independent

i want to totally remove the shadow of koevoet he told a 
news conference at the end of his threeday visit to namibia 
perez de cuellar said former members of koevoet known for its 
often brutal tactics in the territorys 23year bush war had 
created an atmosphere of mistrust in northern namibia where 
most of the fighting took place 
he said namibias south african administrator louis pienaar 
rejected his request to dismiss all former koevoet members from the 
police force which is responsible for law and order during the 
transition to independence 
pienaar met with perez de cuellar on wednesday and announced 
that former koevoet members would be moved away from northcentral 
namibia into less tense regions he said he will dismiss policemen 
only if it can be proved they engaged in misconduct 
im sorry to say im not totally satisfied the un chief 
said elimination of koevoet would create a better situation 
he indicated he would discuss the matter further with south 
africas foreign affairs minister pik botha 
koevoet was officially disbanded this year but more than 2000 
of its members were integrated into the regular police force 
koevoets founder and former leader gen hans dreyer is the 
police commander in northern namibia 
the southwest africa peoples organization which waged the war 
against south african rule and is favored in the november 
elections alleges that former koevoet members continue to harass 
its supporters 
during namibias war koevoet members traditionally went on 
weeklong patrols through isolated villages and bush territory in 
armored vehicles mounted with machine guns they were accused of 
dozens of atrocities against both civilians and guerrillas

the justice department will file an 
affidavit which could kill at least one criminal charge against a 
former cia station chief in the irancontra case and might even 
scuttle the trial a prosecutor said today 
associate independent counsel laurence shtasel told a court 
hearing the affidavit will bar the use of classified information 
concerning various cia programs in the trial of joseph fernandez on 
four criminal charges 
fernandez the former cia station chief in costa rica is 
scheduled to go on trial monday on two counts of obstruction and 
two counts of making false statements 
the justice department notified the independent counsels office 
thursday night that it would file an affidavit addressing 
classified information that fernandez would be prohibited from 
using shtasel told us district court judge claude hilton 
shtasel said the classified information at issue concerns cia 
programs and may also include data about various cia stations 
shtasel who will prosecute the case against fernandez said if 
the affidavit is limited to information concerning cia programs 
the case could be saved by dropping one of the false statement 
counts 
if the affidavit is more broadly worded however it would 
have more drastic consequences shtasel said a broadly worded 
affidavit leaves greater doubt whether the case against 
fernandez can go to trial he said 
officials from various federal agencies were meeting late today 
to discuss the scope of the affidavit expected to be filed monday 
shtasel said 
the justice departments action will mark the first time the 
government has taken the step of filing an affidavit to bar the use 
of classified information in a criminal case under federal law 
once the judge receives such an affidavit he has no choice but to 
prohibit the use of the classified information in a trial if that 
information is critical to a defendants case the judge must 
dismiss the case 
by now everybody should have a clear idea of what information 
they want released said the judge who was clearly unhappy with 
the lastminute intervention by the us intelligence community 
shtasel suggested that fernandez irancontra trial be delayed 
but the judge said he will not reschedule the case again he 
already has granted one twoweek delay in the case 
fernandez attorney thomas wilson said the filing of a justice 
department affidavit leaves the court little choice but to drop the 
charges 
this defendant is on a rack wilson said the lawyer 
suggested that the case be thrown out but hilton denied that 
request 
there are various options that are being debated justice 
department spokesman david runkel said thursday when asked about 
the fernandez case 
asked if the options include a move by the department that would 
scrap the case runkel said thats not a decision that we would 
ever make 
mary belcher a spokeswoman for independent counsel lawrence 
walshs office said only there are very serious matters being 
discussed with respect to the fernandez case and the discussions 
are ongoing 
fernandez is charged with two counts of obstruction and two 
counts of making false statements to irancontra investigators from 
the cia and the tower commission in 1987 
the indictment says he falsely told the cia inspector generals 
office a secret airstrip construction project that was to be part 
of the contra supply network was initiated by the costa rican 
government 
in congressional testimony that cannot be used against him at 
his trial fernandez admitted that former national security council 
aide oliver north and others in the us government initiated the 
project 
fernandez falsely told the tower commission he did not know for 
a fact that north was assisting the contra resupply operation 
according to the indictment 
fernandez is accused in a bill of particulars filed by 
prosecutors of making 19 additional statements that were so 
misleading they obstructed the tower commission and cia inspector 
general offices inquiries into the irancontra scandal

three of four people who won vans in a drawing 
held by kraft usa as an alternative to a botched contest have opted 
to take 17000 each in cash instead of vehicles the company says 
only a 35yearold mother of two from suburban norridge decided 
to take a van in the rerun of the kraft singles cheese contest that 
last month mistakenly produced thousands of winners instead of only 
one the glenviewbased company said 
its good timing mary braun the only winner who opted for 
a dodge van said thursday my car just broke down the sunday 
before the drawing my cars almost nine years old and we were 
looking at vans anyway 
krafts ready to roll contest offered through chicago and 
houston area newspapers on june 11 was canceled the next day when 
the company learned a printing error had produced nearly 10000 
winners of vans 
to compensate for the foulup kraft sent 250 to wouldbe van 
winners who mailed in the faulty winning game pieces by june 16 
and the company said it would give away four vans in a drawing from 
a pool of vehicle winners in the first game the company also gave 
cash awards to winners of lesser prizes such as bicycles and 
skateboards 
kraft still faces a classaction lawsuit filed on behalf of 
thousands of wouldbe winners 
in the drawing held friday kraft gave away 400 bicyles 2000 
skateboards and 32000 coupons for free packages of kraft singles 
in addition to the vans each category contained four times as many

interim repairs to the disabled exxon valdez 
will begin offshore as soon as ocean conditions allow divers to 
assess the task of removing damaged hull plates under water 
officials said 
exxon shipping co received permission thursday to begin 
removing the plates from the ship that struck a reef in alaskas 
prince william sound march 24 dumping 11 million gallons of crude 
oil in the nations worst spill 
it was towed to san diego for repairs this month at the shipyard 
where it was built but cant navigate the shallow san diego harbor 
channel until the hanging plates are cut off 
the coast guard granted permission to begin repairs after repair 
crews conducted a pollution containment drill at sea said a 
spokeswoman petty officer elizabeth neely 
as far as were concerned it was a satisfactory drill and the 
coast guard has no objections to letting exxon begin plate removal 
operations neely said 
at least six plates that peeled away from the ships hull during 
its 2500mile journey from alaska must be removed so the vessel 
can navigate the shallow san diego harbor channel without scraping 
the bottom 
ocean swells of three feet to four feet so far have kept divers 
from starting the work they will begin cutting off the plates when 
the swells subside said exxon spokeswoman jan cool 
the work described as dangerous because it is being conducted 
in open waters is expected to take about a week a barge carrying 
a crane and a salvage vessel will help retrieve the multiton steel 
plates after they are removed 
exxon plans to use a 110footdeep sheltered anchorage just off 
navyowned san clemente island to do some of the work once company 
officials receive state permission to move the valdez into 
california waters 
the ship is in a holding pattern about 10 miles northeast of san 
clemente island and 50 miles off san diego 
state officials demand that exxon meet stringent environmental 
conditions before they will allow the ship to enter california 
waters which extend three miles from shore 
the two sides are getting closer to an agreement but none has 
been reached yet cool said 
meanwhile a coast guard observer aboard the valdez reported no 
signs of oil leakage or other discharges for a fourth straight day 
neely said the ship was described as completely cleaned out before 
it left alaska but it unexpectedly leaked a small amount of oil as 
it approached the san diego area

prime minister yitzhak shamir has met twice in 
the last two weeks with palestinians from the occupied territories 
in an effort to promote his peace plan a spokesman said today 
shamirs rival in the rightwing likud bloc trade minister 
ariel sharon claimed he had blocked plo approval of the plan 
shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir confirmed israeli news reports 
that since sharon pushed through restrictions on the plan two weeks 
ago the prime minister had met twice with leading palestinians to 
discuss it he gave no details on the meetings or the palestinian 
participants 
the plan calls for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip of palestinian representatives to negotiate an autonomy plan 
for the territories later negotiations would be held on the final 
status of the territories 
sharon succeeded in imposing limitations that would postpone any 
elections until the palestinian uprising ends and would reject 
creation of a palestinian state in the occupied lands 
the jerusalem post reported today that before the restrictions 
were added the palestine liberation organization was about to 
accept the election under certain conditions it did not spell out 
those conditions 
it said the plo had put together a delegation including four 
plo members to work out details of the elections and had proposed 
israeli officials meet with the delegation the report did not say 
if the meeting was one of the conditions for acceptance 
israel refuses to talk with the plo which it considers a 
terrorist organization 
sharon was quoted in the yediot newspaper as saying his move 
blocked plo acceptance a spokesman for sharon moshe behegaon 
agreed 
if it were not because of the limitations of the likud it 
seems that arafat would have accepted the elections plan 
behegaon said today sharon says the limitations are like a stone 
caught the wheel of a cart about to veer out of control 
there have been newspaper reports that shamir intends to dismiss 
sharon from the government at a cabinet meeting sunday because of 
the split on the election issue shamirs spokesman denied this 
if sharon continues his divisive ways and causes problems in 
the likud it may be possible that there will be no choice but to 
fire him ahimeir said but now it is not practical 
israeli newspapers reported that two leading likud figures 
housing minister david levy and economics minister yitzhak modai 
met shamir on thursday and threatened to resign if sharon is 
dismissed 
in the occupied west bank today a 30yearold palestinian woman 
accused of collaborating with israeli authorities was stabbed by 
masked arab youths in qalqiliya arab reports said she was brought 
to an israeli hospital in critical condition 
also today a court extended for 15 days the custody of a 
palestinian accused of killing 16 people two weeks ago by forcing 
the bus they were in to veer off the road 
the bus attack was the worst assault against israelis in the 
19month palestinian uprising against israeli rule of the west bank 
and gaza strip a total of 572 palestinians and 37 israelies have 
been killed in the uprising 
israel radio reported that the accused mahdi abdel hadi ghanem 
shouted i want to die as he was was wheeled into the 
jerusalem courthouse handcuffed to his wheelchair 
ghanem was injured in the crash which occurred after he 
allegedly grabbed the bus steering wheel and forced it off the 
road he has not been charged 
under israeli law courts often extend the custody of suspects 
until formal charges are filed

the city treasurer put 2 million in 
taxpayers money in a bank that employed mayor tom bradley as an 
adviser without seeking competitive bids for the deposit an audit 
found 
city treasurer leonard rittenberg then tried to cover up the 
transaction by creating documents showing other banks competing for 
the deposits put in far east national bank according to the audit 
report released thursday 
the audit is the latest in a series of blows to bradley who 
recently was elected to his fifth term in office despite criticism 
of his financial dealings 
a secretary in rittenbergs city office said he wasnt in early 
friday to comment his home telephone number isnt listed in the 
los angeles directory 
bradley refused to comment but sent a letter to city attorney 
james k hahn and personnel chief john j driscoll requesting an 
investigation to determine if any city ordinances were broken 
rittenberg told the city council the deposit had been subject to 
competitive bids the audit said city law requires such bids on 
many transactions to avoid preferential treatment of businesses and 
to ensure taxpayers get the best deal 
the deposits in far east were made a day after bradley asked 
rittenberg about the citys relationship with the bank the audit 
showed 
the treasurers office also violated the bidding procedure in 
depositing hundreds of millions of dollars in several other banks 
according to the audit more than 200000 in deposits went to 
gibraltar savings and loan after bradley invested 100000 of his 
own money through the ailing thrift in bonds unavailable to the 
public the audit said 
city councilman zev yaroslavsky who chairs the councils 
finance and review committee and council president john ferraro 
called for immediate hearings for rittenberg and his senior aides 
comrie said copies of the audit were given to the police

aids activists are heaping praise on president 
bush for his two appointments to a new aids commission that will 
help plan a national strategy to fight the epidemic 
the presidents selection of a homemaker with aids and a 
prominent medical professor for the 15member commission is an 
indication that bush will be responsive to aids issues and to 
victims of the deadly disease activists say 
these appointments show that bush agrees with the principle 
that people with aids should be part of the decisionmaking process 
and that there is a great need to adapt our health care system 
to the needs of such an epidemic said mathilde krim founding 
cochairwoman of the american foundation for aids research 
bush on thursday named to the national commission on acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
belinda ann mason a young mother of two infected during a 
blood transfusion who went on to become president of the national 
association of people with aids and a crusading educator about the 
disease 
dr david e rogers a professor of medicine at cornell 
university medical college in new york and former president of the 
robert wood johnson foundation who has an interest in health care 
delivery 
praise for bushs selections overshadowed the criticism he has 
received for a delay in making the appointments and letting the 
panel begin its work 
in sharp contrast to a previous aids panel set up by president 
reagan that was embroiled in turmoil from its inception the new 
commission created by congress is considered wellbalanced and its 
members sensitive to the crisis that has claimed nearly 57000 
american lives 
there are really no rightwing ideologues on the commission 
said robert bray a spokesman for the human rights campaign fund 
we believe this is an indication that finally a responsible and 
nonpunitive aids policy is taking hold 
the panel also has a member who is openly homosexual larry 
kessler executive director of the boston aids action committee 
mason 30 is a former newspaper reporter and onetime kentucky 
state public information officer who was diagnosed as carrying the 
aids virus in january 1987 while living in rural hartford ky she 
contracted the virus from a transfusion during childbirth 
its really the first time a president and administration has 
recognized people with aids as part of the solution and not part of 
the problem said tom sheridan director of public policy for the 
aids action council 
last year the panel chaired by retired adm james watkins 
called for a major escalation of federal efforts to treat cure and 
prevent aids as well as legislation to protect aids victims 
against discrimination 
three cabinet officers also will serve on the commission dr 
louis sullivan secretary of health and human services defense 
secretary richard cheney and veterans affairs secretary edward 
derwinski 
the commission also includes rep roy rowland dga a 
physician diane ahrens head of the ramsey county minn board of 
commissioners scott allen a baptist minister and coordinator of 
the aids interfaith network in dallas dr don c des jarlais a 
new york state coordinator of aids research and donald s goldman 
a livingston nj attorney 
also dr june osborn dean of the school of public health at 
the university of michigan harry dalton a yale university law 
professor dr charles konigsbert a kansas state health official 
and eunice diaz director of community affairs at white memorial 
medical center in los angeles 
the commission members will select their own chairman

comedian harry worth who had his 
own popular bbctv series in the 1960s and made a comeback on bbc 
radio last year has died at the age of 71 
worth who died thursday suffered from cancer 
he often complained humorously that he had difficulty getting 
people to take him seriously in real life because of the bumbling 
comedy character he played 
born near the coal mining town of barnsley in northern england 
he was the youngest of 11 children his father a miner was killed 
in a mine accident when he was 5 months old the comedy star 
himself began work in the mines at age 14 but decided it was not 
for him 
he broke into show business as a ventriloquist but soon got rid 
of the dummy to switch to a oneman comedy routine 
he made 104 situation comedy tv shows starting with a series 
called heres harry 
but his gentle selfmocking humor was later overtaken by a 
switch in public taste for the wilder comedy of such shows as 
monty pythons flying circus 
his comedy was so gentle it was like an oasis in a desert of 
aggressive rude and outrageous comedy said comedian roy hudd 
i think harrys success was due to his style of underplaying 
everything he never used jokes as such he was just a very funny 
man 
worth is survived by his wife kay

chinas media back in the hands of government 
propagandists after exercising a degree of freedom this spring now 
gives confusing contradictory news coverage as it tries to depict 
life returning to normal 
all the major newspapers covered the prodemocracy student 
movement for several weeks in may giving accuarate colorful and 
enthusiastic reports rarely seen in the chinese press 
but since the military crackdown on june 34 during which 
hundreds perhaps thousands of students and their supporters 
were killed the media has reverted to being a tool of the state 
the result is often confused reports that sometimes turn out to 
be old news and a litany of the communist party line as 
broadcasters read wordforword commentaries and editorials from 
the party newspaper the peoples daily 
the government has said it was forced to crack down on the 
popular student movement because it was disrupting social order to 
the point of anarchy the ubiquitous reports about production 
always are prefaced with a statement about the hardworking 
employees trying to recover the losses suffered during the 
student movement that developed into counterrevolutionary 
rebellion 
but the reports continue by quoting factory managers as saying 
their employees didnt join in the popular movement instead they 
reported for work every day even if it meant bicycling or walking 
for hours because buses had stopped running and the factory didnt 
miss a day of production 
even peasants in remote areas untouched by the events in the 
capital are depicted by the reports as striving to recover the 
losses caused by the turmoil 
the news also reports chinas top leaders performing their 
regular duties including meeting with visiting foreign 
delegations to show that international relations have not 
suffered but almost all the visitors are lowlevel officials or 
nongovernment personages 
on wednesday vice premier tian jiyun was shown on staterun tv 
meeting with the soviet unions fisheries minister premier li peng 
has met among others the former mayor of cerritos calif and 
the chairman of the economic research institute of japans daiwa 
securities co ltd 
in an effort to show that even the foreign businessmen who fled 
during the turmoil are convinced that everything is fine 
newspapers often report the signing of new contracts or the start 
of new projects 
this month the official china daily reported in its lead 
business story that the united states motorola corp planned to 
set up a 100 million electronics plant in tianjin saying 
motorola recently confirmed its plan but company officials in 
chicago said the project has been on hold since the crackdown and 
nothing is likely to be decided this year 
the beijing review reported this week the german partners of the 
shanghai volkswagen automotive co had decided to reinvest their 
dividends from last year and expand production the article said 
the decision was made at a recent board meeting and quoted a 
german official as saying the recent unrest had not affected their 
partnership 
another company official revealed however that the board 
decision was made in april before the crackdown and said that it 
received little if any press coverage at the time 
the official xinhua news agency reported two weeks ago that 
france had agreed to provide a government loan of 130 million but 
the french embassy said the agreement was reached in april 
its a sort of trick its not a new loan signed by the two 
governments said an embassy spokesman france has in fact frozen 
relations with china at all levels 
last month the finnish foreign ministry took the unusual step 
of clarifying that a 22 million loan to china was agreed upon two 
weeks before the june 34 crackdown not after as implied in a 
china daily report 
such tactics are not lost on chinese citizens some of whom say 
they have stopped reading the papers or watching tv news

on budapests busy liberation square 
passersby browse at a stand stacked with books and pamphlets 
chronicling the soviet suppression of the 1956 antikremlin 
uprising in hungary 
at a nearby staterun bookstore the gulag archipelago the 
chilling account of stalinist repression by alexander solzhenitsyn 
the exiled soviet nobel prizewinning novelist is on prominent 
display along with the works of hungarys most gifted opposition 
writers 
a year ago we would have been hauled to the police station 
interrogated beaten and fined for this said zoltan kurdi a 
dissidentturnedpublisher who operates a small book stand on 
liberation square 
his selection contains memoirs of those who fought in the 
streets in the 1956 uprising works critical of hungarys ruling 
communist party and western accounts of life and politics in 
eastern europe 
buoyed by a new law that virtually eliminates all forms of press 
and book censorship hungarys underground publishers have 
abandoned their basements and attics for the streets and 
storefronts 
they are being joined by an increasing number of private 
entrepreneurs trying to cash in on a new and unfettered market 
with official publishing houses also eager to compete 
even staterun firms freely tout interpretations of the 1956 
revolt against stalinism that contradict the longheld official 
view that it was a counterrevolution 
instead of smuggling them in from the west hungarians need only 
walk to their neighborhood bookstore for copies of george orwells 
1984 or animal farm and the works of distinguished 
hungarians that were published only abroad for decades 
even an essay by the founder of socialist ideology karl marx 
has returned to the shelves freed from a ban imposed because it 
stridently condemned censorship 
after 40 years of a controlled book culture we are rapidly 
entering an era of open and free book publishing said peter 
inkei general director of the ministry of education and cultures 
publishing division 
two years ago all this seemed like something that could only 
happen in the very distant future added inkei whose office once 
was responsible for redflagging potentially troublesome 
manuscripts for central committee censors 
the changes like the bold overall reforms that made them 
possible have brought new challenges 
for years the people who published underground literature 
were risking their freedom to fight cultural repression says 
kurdi 24 whose group this year formed a limited publishing 
partnership 
now our biggest problem is to find ways of dealing with 
unscrupulous publishers and making sound business decisions to stay 
afloat 
the publication of solzhenitsyns gulag archipelago has 
caused the most headaches for government officials and fledgling 
private publishers 
the hungarian translation is a pirate edition published 
privately without the authors permission and in violation of 
international copyright laws 
these people the pirate publishers are only motivated by 
greed fumed kurdi who said he and his friends had risked prison 
for years to bring out similar books at or below cost when there 
was no other legal outlet 
inkei said publication of gulag archipelago put the 
government in a quandary 
if we had tried to ban it at first we would have been accused 
of trying to suppress it said inkei whose office is moving to 
prohibit sale of the book because it violates hungarian marketing 
laws 
inkei said his staff gets criticized by the 30 staterun 
publishing houses for allegedly favoring the 100 or so new private 
publishers who in turn have not forgotten that his office was once 
responsible for sniffing out trouble in submitted manuscripts 
we are now on the castles ramparts defending ourselves from 
all sides he said 
in the old days he said most books that intellectuals wanted 
to read were unavailable 
often he said proposed books were withdrawn quietly after his 
office informed publishers that manuscripts had been earmarked for 
consultations with the policysetting central committee 
inkei said his staff devotes its time to advising the government 
on publishing and tax laws and evaluating grant applications from 
governmentowned and private publishers 
all could use the money 
right now were operating in the red kurdi said surveying 
the array of onceoutlawed books at his book stall 
we overestimated the demand for books on the 1956 revolt 
he added the markets glutted now and theyre not moving very 
fast 
warm summer weather also was hurting business he said people 
are looking for light reading right now

coal miners in siberia ended their 
strike today after exacting promises of better food housing and 
working conditions but the wave of unrest they launched continued 
in other key coal regions 
some of the 150000 miners who went on strike last week in 
siberias kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work thursday and 
the rest went back today strike leaders and the official tass news 
agency said 
despite announcements that president mikhail s gorbachevs 
sweeping concessions including granting miners greater control 
over their industry apply nationwide hundreds of thousands of 
miners stayed off the job elsewhere 
in the largest coal region the donetsk coal basin of the 
ukraine more than 300000 miners were on strike the deputy 
minister of the coal industry alexander p fisun told izvestia 
in the karaganda region of the southern republic of kazakhstan 
the soviet unions thirdbiggest coalproducing area all 26 mines 
were at a standstill and miners made more than 70 demands 
izvestia said 
strikes were also reported in the pechora coal basin in the 
russian republic and chervonograd in the western ukraine official 
media said 
the labor unrest is the soviet unions worst in six decades 
gorbachev has expressed sympathy for the strikers and placed 
much of the blame for the miners deteriorating working and living 
conditions on leaders of the officially sanctioned trade unions 
still he and other communist leaders have warned that if the 
strikes dont end quickly coal shortages will shut down much of 
the countrys industry 
on wednesday the kuznetsk strike committee and members of a 
highlevel government commission signed an agreement meeting many 
demands 
the workers were promised higher wages increased deliveries of 
meat sugar soap clothes furniture and other consumer goods 
more housing construction and most important a greater voice in 
running their industry 
its a victory over the system that weve had in the soviet 
union for the last 70 years a system in which we work hard but get 
little in return said pyotr a menayev an engineer at the 
taldinski severny open pit mine on the outskirts of prokopyevsk 
strike committee member vyacheslav g akulov stressed that the 
miners had agreed to interrupt the strike not to end it 
he said the miners would hold the government to its word if 
the government doesnt keep its promises we will go back on 
strike 
the 26member strike committee met today with a halfdozen 
representatives to the national parliament and called for municipal 
elections to be advanced from the spring to the first half of 
november 
the last local elections in kuznetsk were held two years ago 
before gorbachevs reforms made elections more democratic by 
offering multiple candidates 
the strike wave began 11 days ago in kuznetsk the countrys 
secondlargest coal field 
tass said late thursday that strikes had ended at six mines in 
the donetsk region but that most mines in the area remained on 
strike 
miners at three shafts in chervonograd near the polish border 
joined the walkout thursday night said anatoly m dotsenko a 
spokesman for the ukrainian helsinki watch group 
the coal industry employs more than 1 million workers 
tass today quoted coal minister mikhail i shchadov as saying 
the government agreed to make all soviet coal operations 
economically and legally independent 
he said authorities had agreed to additional payments for night 
and evening shifts and to give workers sundays off 
beginning aug 1 mines and other industries in the coal 
mining complex will gain the right to sell for negotiated prices 
in the ussr and abroad products which they make over and above the 
state plan tass quoted the agreement as stipulating 
it said local managers will be able to raise coal prices to 
reflect actual production costs 
gorbachev is trying to end the longtime soviet practice of 
setting prices for goods that bear no relation to their freemarket 
value and encourage and end to central control of the economy 
akulov said that beginning jan 1 the kuznetzk coal basin will 
become economically autonomous 
the coal mining ministry will continue to run the mines but 
the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels 
and allocating the profits he said 
our politics have gotten freer under perestroika akulov 
said of gorbachevs economic reform program but our living 
conditions have not improved 
until gorbachev rose to power in 1985 strikes were not 
tolerated

president bush stepped up his lobbying for the 
b2 stealth bomber today telling republican house members he would 
not accept a plan to build just 13 of the planes while testing 
continued 
rep william l dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the 
house armed services committee said bush insisted at the white 
house meeting that it would be devastating to arms control 
efforts if congress would not authorize the b2 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the armed services 
committee had said thursday that congress needs more information 
on the costly radarevading plane before deciding whether to kill 
it or spend more money 
rep john g rowland rconn said he was unconvinced by bushs 
argument for full financing and suggested a compromise that would 
allow 13 planes to be built while testing continued through 1993 
he said bush rejected the offer 
i was not convinced by the presidents remarks rowland 
said adding there are a small number of republicans and 
hopefully a large number of democrats who believe testing should 
be completed before a commitment is made to build the 132 planes 
that the administration wants 
by 1993 we will have purchased 44 planes at a cost of 40 
billion rowland said adding it is a better idea to build 13 
fly them around develop them and then make a determination 
bush began his personal involvement in the administrations 
defense push thursday calling aspin and other members of the house 
armed services and appropriations committees to the white house 
he pressed them to back his budget proposals for the b2 as 
well as the strategic defense initiative the mx missile and the 
midgetman missile 
the house and senate are scheduled to vote next week on those 
programs and a package of pentagon cuts the administration proposed 
to meet a 10 billion reduction target in the defense budget agreed 
to by congressional and administration negotiators 
bush told lawmakers the package and the weapons systems are 
essential to the nations deterrent capability and to the us 
strategy at the arms reduction talks in geneva said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater 
defense secretary dick cheney meanwhile pressed the b2s case 
to house republicans who are divided on the issue 
the pentagon hopes to buy 132 planes at a cost of about 70 
billion 
in fiscal 1990 the defense department has proposed spending 
47 billion for the b2 but last month the house armed services 
panel cut 800 million from the budget 
aspin told reporters after the white house meeting he could not 
predict which way congress would go on the pentagon spending bill 
i say give the opponents of the b2 an upordown vote if 
the congress is willing to step up to this issue this year i say 
lets do it aspin said 
if other efforts to limit production of the plane fail aspin 
said he will propose funding production of only two bombers in 1990 
and 1991 when the administration wants eight bombers his 
amendment would meet the full request for research and development 
work over that period 
he called his amendment a cold turkey fence of the procurement 
money until congress acts again 
aspin said his plan shuts down the program but it gives the 
administration a chance to come up with another program thats 
politically more acceptable financially

chinas media back in the hands of government 
propagandists after exercising a degree of freedom this spring now 
gives confusing contradictory news coverage as it tries to depict 
life returning to normal 
all the major newspapers covered the prodemocracy student 
movement for several weeks in may giving accuarate colorful and 
enthusiastic reports rarely seen in the chinese press 
but since the military crackdown on june 34 during which 
hundreds perhaps thousands of students and their supporters 
were killed the media has reverted to being a tool of the state 
the result is often confused reports that sometimes turn out to 
be old news and a litany of the communist party line as 
broadcasters read wordforword commentaries and editorials from 
the party newspaper the peoples daily 
the government has said it was forced to crack down on the 
popular student movement because it was disrupting social order to 
the point of anarchy the ubiquitous reports about production 
always are prefaced with a statement about the hardworking 
employees trying to recover the losses suffered during the 
student movement that developed into counterrevolutionary 
rebellion 
but the reports continue by quoting factory managers as saying 
their employees didnt join in the popular movement instead they 
reported for work every day even if it meant bicycling or walking 
for hours because buses had stopped running and the factory didnt 
miss a day of production 
even peasants in remote areas untouched by the events in the 
capital are depicted by the reports as striving to recover the 
losses caused by the turmoil 
the news also reports chinas top leaders performing their 
regular duties including meeting with visiting foreign 
delegations to show that international relations have not 
suffered but almost all the visitors are lowlevel officials or 
nongovernment personages 
on wednesday vice premier tian jiyun was shown on staterun tv 
meeting with the soviet unions fisheries minister premier li peng 
has met among others the former mayor of cerritos calif and 
the chairman of the economic research institute of japans daiwa 
securities co ltd 
in an effort to show that even the foreign businessmen who fled 
during the turmoil are convinced that everything is fine 
newspapers often report the signing of new contracts or the start 
of new projects 
this month the official china daily reported in its lead 
business story that the united states motorola corp planned to 
set up a 100 million electronics plant in tianjin saying 
motorola recently confirmed its plan but company officials in 
chicago said the project has been on hold since the crackdown and 
nothing is likely to be decided this year 
the beijing review reported this week the german partners of the 
shanghai volkswagen automotive co had decided to reinvest their 
dividends from last year and expand production the article said 
the decision was made at a recent board meeting and quoted a 
german official as saying the recent unrest had not affected their 
partnership 
another company official revealed however that the board 
decision was made in april before the crackdown and said that it 
received little if any press coverage at the time 
the official xinhua news agency reported two weeks ago that 
france had agreed to provide a government loan of 130 million but 
the french embassy said the agreement was reached in april 
its a sort of trick its not a new loan signed by the two 
governments said an embassy spokesman france has in fact frozen 
relations with china at all levels 
last month the finnish foreign ministry took the unusual step 
of clarifying that a 22 million loan to china was agreed upon two 
weeks before the june 34 crackdown not after as implied in a 
china daily report 
such tactics are not lost on chinese citizens some of whom say 
they have stopped reading the papers or watching tv news

norfolk naval base on friday for a fiveday goodwill visit that 
will include cookouts sightseeing tours and shopping sprees 
the guidedmissile cruiser marshal ustinov the destroyer 
otlichny and the oiler genrikh gasanov docked at pier 7 about 830 
am after exchanging 21gun salutes with fort monroe at the 
entrance to the hampton roads harbor 
theyre sharp looking the sailors look good said us navy 
lt cmdr john lloyd as he watched from the pier they did an 
impressive job of shiphandling when they reached the pier 
the 1100 soviet sailors will spend much of their time mingling 
with sailors at the base 
theyre going to have barbecues cookouts said capt paul 
w hanley an atlantic fleet spokesman we expect there will be 
quite a lot of persontoperson contact 
the soviet sailors will tour the navy base eat at a pizza 
parlor and mcdonalds visit a shopping mall and grocery and 
hardware stores and take a bus trip to the busch gardens amusement 
park in williamsburg 
the soviets will reciprocate the hospitality by opening two of 
the ships to visitors and offering performances by a song and dance 
troupe 
when the flotilla arrived friday several dozen sailors and 
reporters waited on the pier a navy band on the guidedmissile 
cruiser harry e yarnell played the starspangled banner as the 
ship raised an american flag and the sailors silently saluted 
then the band struck up a march and the sailors turned their 
attention to welcoming their soviet guests a private plane flew 
overhead with a banner that read welcome to norfolk in russian 
the ustinovs band struck up a lively marching tune of its own 
as soviet sailors snapped pictures of americans on the pier and the 
americans got photos of the warship flying the soviets red 
hammerandsickle flag 
the visit to the navys largest base is the second time since 
world war ii that soviet warships have docked in the united states 
three soviet vessels visited boston harbor in 1975 
next month three navy ships will visit the soviet black sea 
port of sevastopol 
the exchange program was arranged last summer when marshal 
sergei akhromeyev the soviet chief of staff visited the united 
states as the guest of adm william j crowe jr chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff 
the soviet embassy in washington released statements attributed 
to enthusiastic crewmen 
the aim is to establish closer relations with american 
seaman said warrant officer valery bronich 25 who leads a 
missile battery crew on the otlichny we need to do away with the 
enemy image and stop seeing each other as potential adversaries

in an unprecedented appearance marshal sergei 
f akhromeyev the soviet unions preeminent military figure told 
a house committee today that us reluctance to negotiate 
reductions in its naval forces is a serious obstacle to arms 
control in all other areas 
akhromeyev said the soviet union suspects the united states is 
interested in large cuts in conventional land forces in europe in 
order to gain overall military superiority over moscow 
specifically he said the kremlin fears that after such a 
conventional arms reduction agreement the united states would 
build up its naval forces without any constraints especially its 
carrier battle groups 
thus he told the house armed services committee the united 
states would gain military superiority in order to dictate its 
will to the ussr from a position of strength 
we regard reaching agreement on starting the talks to reduce 
our naval forces and limit military activities at sea to be a major 
prerequisite for further improvement of sovietamerican relations 
and switching them on to really peaceful rail tracks akhromeyev 
said 
in a lengthy statement read with the aid of an interpreter 
akhromeyev returned to the subject of naval forces several times 
he said the kremlin believes that reducing land forces while 
maintaining the size of naval forces or actually increasing them is 
unjust 
if you follow this line no drastic reductions of the armed 
forces and armaments in the world will be possible the soviet 
marshal said 
he said naval reduction talks should be started first by the 
soviet union and the united states and later by the north atlantic 
treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
conditions should be created for the whole range of armed 
services and armaments of the two sides to become the subject of 
the talks and subsequent talks he said 
akhromeyev who retired last year as chief of the soviet general 
staff is now chief military adviser to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
he was welcomed to the armed services committee by chairman les 
aspin dwis who told him never has so highranking a soviet 
official appeared before a congressional committee through the 
years we have seen many uniforms sit at that table but never one 
like yours 
the soviet marshal his olive brown uniform trimmed with stripes 
of red and more than a dozen rows of military ribbons testified in 
a hearing room decorated with the portraits of former armed 
services committee chairman and flags of the us military services 
aspin invited ahromeyev to testify as one of a series of 
appearances before the committee by soviet military officers and 
defense experts 
some conservative members of the committee and other lawmakers 
have called it inappropriate that the soviets be given such a 
sounding board but aspin has said such witnesses provide a unique 
window into official soviet thinking 
akhromayev received a cordial reception from the committee 
today and no members raised questions over the propriety of his 
appearance 
akhromeyev offered what appeared to be a detailed accounting of 
soviet military spending and troop and weapons strngth 
he said his country will spend 84 percent of its gross national 
product 773 billion rubles on its military forces he said the 
united states will spend 54 percent of its gnp during the same 
period 
as of the middle of 1989 the ussr possesses 1398 icbm 
launchers with a little over 6000 warheads deployed on those 
launchers akhromeyev said 
he also listed 60 submarines with 920 launch tubes for 
sealaunched ballistic missiles 160 heavy bombers and a certain 
number of longrange submarinebased sealaunched cruise 
missiles 
all in all the soviet union possesses 2484 strategic carriers 
with about 10000 warheads deployed on them he said 
as of the beginning of the year akhromeyev said soviet ground 
forces numbered 1596 million troops 
he said that will have been reduced unilaterally by 300000 men 
to about 1296 million troops by the beginning of 1991 
he repeated soviet opposition to the development of a us star 
wars antimissile system but said the soviet union remains 
committed to deep cuts in strategic and conventional arms 
we intend to keep our strategic nuclear forces approximately 
equal to the us strategic offensive forces and we do not intend 
to gain superiority in this field he said 
akhromeyev said at several points that a very favorable 
atmosphere of trust and decreased military tension has developed 
in recent years 
he called for more exchanges between us and soviet military 
officers and for further appearances by soviet officials before 
congress and exchanges between the house armed services committee 
and the defense committee of the supreme soviet the soviet 
parliament

the death toll in the united dc10 crash 
was raised to 109 today with two people unaccounted for and 
investigators reported that repair work had been done on the plane 
the day before the flight 
officials planned to lift one of the wings with a crane today to 
see if there were two more bodies underneath city manager hank 
sinda said at a news conference he said 109 bodies were recovered 
by late thursday 
meanwhile investigators focused on the planes no 2 or rear 
engine which was found to be missing its fan after the crash 
nearby sections of the plane were found to have been sprayed with 
shrapnellike projectiles possibly when part of the engine 
disintegrated 
sinda reported 184 survivors from united airlines flight 232 
which if there are two missing persons would bring the total aboard 
to 295 that figure conforms to the total reported thursday by 
national transportation safety board officials 
united was sticking by its previous figure of 293 people aboard 
united spokesperson ann thoma said today in chicago 
a person may have checked in at the ticket counter gone to 
the lounge and had a glass of beer and missed the plane sinda 
said explaining a possible reason for the twoperson discrepancy 
or they might have got on the plane gotten off to use the 
washroom and missed the plane 
ntsb member jim burnett said the board had examined the last 20 
maintenance writeups for the plane including repair work done on 
the pneumatic system the day before the crash the pneumatic system 
affects air pressure in the engine air conditioning and 
pressurization systems he said 
we know of no connection between the pneumatic system and 
anything that would have could have affected the functioning of 
the engine he said this morning on nbcs today show 
burnett said at a news conference thursday that investigators 
were surprised to discover the entire fanrotor system missing from 
the rear engine the dc10 has three engines one on each wing and 
the tail 
thats the first time for this type of engine that weve ever 
seen he said 
the failure of the tail engine may have caused the hydraulic 
system to fail said bob raynesford a spokesman for the federal 
aviation administraion 
burnett also said two large nuts were found embedded in acoustic 
paneling for the no 2 engine he would not elaborate 
the national guard and medical examiners had asked families for 
dental and medical records and other information that would help 
identify the victims said sinda 
theyre having a hard time identifying the bodies some of 
them are in very poor condition he said 
investigators said capt al c haynes the pilot had virtually 
no control as he struggled to land the dc10 after it lost an 
engine fan and sustained holes in the small wing of the tail 
the jumbo jets hydraulic system which is routed through the 
tail and allows the pilot to manipulate wing and tail controls 
contained no fluid as haynes tried to bring the plane into sioux 
gateway airport ntsb officials said thursday night 
the aircraft could only be turned to the right they made 
three 360degree turns before wednesdays crash landing burnett 
said 
united released the names of survivors thursday but withheld a 
list of casualties while relatives were notified 
as workers continued to search wreckage strewn through a 
cornfield and across a runway investigators released details of 
the harrowing last hour of the flight bound for chicago and 
philadelphia from denver 
the chief flight attendant told the ntsb an explosion rocked the 
jet over western iowa knocking flight attendants to the floor 
burnett said the attendant who was unidentified went into the 
cockpit and found the flight crew struggling to regain control of 
the plane he said 
thirtyfour minutes before the crash landing the pilot told air 
traffic controllers he had almost no control of the aircraft 
burnett said 
eight minutes later the crew expressed serious doubts they 
could reach sioux city and began discussing small airports and 
fourlane highways as possible landing sites he said 
investigators found a 10inchby12inch hole and three or four 
smaller ones in the horizontal stabilizer the small wing on the 
planes tail ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said the rear engine 
sits just above the stabilizer 
lopatkiewicz said the holes were projectile penetrations but 
declined to be more specific such holes could be caused by pieces 
of metal spewed like shrapnel from a disintegrating engine 
the recovery effort centered on a large blackened section of 
fuselage lying in the cornfield alongside the scorched runway the 
section had to be reinforced with large timbers and hoisted off the 
ground with a crane 
its slow going said gary brown director of woodbury 
county disaster services its a hazard for our rescue workers as 
they move through there 
dr david greco director of emergency services for the marian 
health center and one of the first physicians on the scene said 
the planes breakup determined the pattern of deaths and injuries 
the three members of the cockpit crew survived the crash but 
greco said the firstclass section was devastated passengers in 
the ninth through 19th rows suffered no injuries or minor ones he 
added but there was nothing left of the rear half of the 
aircraft 
tales of heroism abounded beginning with praise for haynes a 
33year united veteran 
gov terry branstad visited haynes bedside and said at a news 
conference he was quite emotional about the situation and tears 
came to his eyes when he talked about the number of people who lost 
their lives 
i told him he did a valiant job 
the flight voice and data recorders were taken to washington 
dc and found to be in good condition said ntsb aeronautical 
engineer thomas jacky their contents are unlikely to be made 
public for several weeks 
investigators also collected maintenance records on the 
15yearold aircraft burnett also said toxicology tests given to 
the four people in cockpit were negative 
ge aircraft engines the general electric co subsidiary that 
made the planes cf6 engines dispatched a team to assist in the 
investigation 
the missing fanrotor system includes a rotor disk and fan 
blades the fan is encased in the engine housing and draws in cold 
air to circulate around the combustion chamber and mix with hot 
exhaust gases

it will be at least two months before movie 
fans learn which 25 films a panel of governmentappointed critics 
and the library of congress considers the nations best 
the 13 motion picture experts appointed under the national film 
preservation act had planned to announce 25 nominated titles on 
wednesday 
instead worried that public nominations might prompt studios 
into premature marketing ploys and reveal panelists personal 
biases the panelists decided to send their individual choices in 
secret to librarian james billington 
billington with input from the motion picture division of the 
library of congress then will make the final selection in late 
september said george kirgo president of the writers guild of 
america and a member of the preservation panel 
an attorney for the library of congress and several panelists 
said the meeting was conducted secretly to dispel public confusion 
about the panels work 
when an evaluative meeting like this one is held it is always 
closed because thats the ethical way to conduct it said robert 
rosen a film archivist with the university of california los 
angeles and a member of the preservation panel 
roger mayer president of turner entertainment co attended the 
public portions of the panels meeting at ucla because the 
selections carry so much potential commercial value for his company 
we have a library of more than 3500 pictures so were 
interested in what pictures are chosen said mayer the turner 
film library includes wizard of oz gone with the wind 
citizen kane casablanca and singin in the rain 
the preservation act signed into law last year was drafted by 
congress partly in response to complaints about the practice of 
adding color to old blackandwhite films turner entertainment has 
colored a number of its films 
the act calls for a panel to recommend 25 titles annually 
chosen according to their cultural historical and aesthetic 
interest to be placed by the library of congress on a national 
film register 
the act does not forbid a movies copyright holder from editing 
movies or from using computers to add color but it does require 
that such movies must be labeled as colored or altered without 
the participation of the principal director screenwriter and 
other creators of the original film 
winston tabb the acting deputy librarian of congress said the 
library of congress was concerned that the movie studios would use 
the nominations for commercial profit 
in preliminary polling 57 movies were nominated by at least two 
members of the preservation board 
the leader was the grapes of wrath with eight votes 
casablanca and its a wonderful life drew seven votes each 
the best years of our lives citizen kane and on the 
waterfront each received six votes

the white house today stood by the choice of 
william lucas to be the administrations civil rights enforcer 
despite his loss of support in a stunning aboutface by the 
congressman who introduced him at his confirmation hearing 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush continues 
to support lucas we think hes an excellent candidate 
fitzwater said 
rep john conyers dmich told the senate judiciary committee 
thursday he could no longer support the nominee whom he had 
introduced to the panel earlier in the week when the states 
senators refused to do so 
it obviously hurts the lucas candidacy how much i cant 
quantify sen paul simon dill said after conyers aboutface 
we hope congressman conyers will change his mind fitzwater 
said 
as civil rights leaders renewed criticism of the nominee 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel said he was not satisfied 
with lucas testimony and was inclined to oppose the nominee when 
the committee votes perhaps as early as next thursday 
conyers turnaround came as a political blow to the 
administration which enlisted the michigan lawmaker to stand in 
after the states senators refused to introduce lucas at his 
confirmation hearing senators normally extend that courtesy to 
nominees regardless of party 
it may hurt him some sen strom thurmond rsc the 
ranking committee republican said after thursdays hearing but 
i hope it wont mean much 
lucas 61 a former wayne county mich sheriff and county 
executive is seeking confirmation as assistant attorney general 
for civil rights if confirmed he would head a staff of 151 
attorneys whose duty is to enforce the nations civil rights laws 
through the courts 
although lucas is black many civil rights groups oppose his 
confirmation on grounds that he lacks the experience to do the job 
conyers who also is black and a leader of the civil rights 
cause in the house was viewed as a strong standin for the 
michigan senators 
but on thursday conyers returned to the committee and announced 
with heavy heart that i am withdrawing my support 
in my 15 years on capitol hill ive never seen anything like 
it simon said afterward 
conyers qualified his statement saying he was not asking you 
to reject this nomination i still believe everything i said 
yesterday about bill lucas except one thing 
when he testified here yesterday on the most enormous question 
that is now facing the civil rights movement and the congress the 
seven supreme court civil rights cases i was frankly astounded 
conyers said 
lucas was questioned closely by the committee on seven decisions 
made by the supreme court this year concerning job discrimination 
minority setasides and other civil rights issues 
although civil rights groups have been virtually unanimous in 
condemning the rulings lucas expressed no criticism but promised 
to monitor the effects to determine if additional legislation might 
be needed 
conyers said if he cannot figure out that these cases are 
seriously cutting back the very modest progress that we have made 
on civil rights then there is no point in me waiting for the 
confirmation process to end to express my disagreement with that 
assessment 
lucas on wednesday also defended his actions in 1985 when 
customs inspectors found 8800 worth of undeclared goods in his 
luggage and in making misstatements on a sworn application to be 
admitted to the new york bar in 1981 
biden told a group of civil rights leaders who appeared as 
witnesses he had growing doubts about the lucas nomination 
i was inclined to vote for him until yesterday biden said 
now im inclined to vote against him 
my vote against him doesnt relate to his lack of 
experience biden said but he expressed concern over whether 
youre going to have somebody who is going to fight for civil 
rights 
the nominee did get support thursday from a handful of witnesses 
including members of the law enforcement community he is a former 
new york city policeman fbi agent and wayne county sheriff 
being a black sheriff in 1968 took a lot of intestinal 
fortitude declared charles b meeks executive director of the 
national sheriffs association elsie scott executive director of 
the national organization of black law enforcement executives told 
the panel that as sheriff lucas worked to improve the lot of 
blacks within the law enforcement profession

a judge in the olof palme murder trial 
indicated friday the defendant would be convicted for the 1986 
slaying of the swedish prime minister 
the court said thursday it had finished its deliberations and 
will announced its conclusions a week later it ordered christer 
pettersson to remain in custody indicating a guilty verdict was 
likely 
had pettersson been found innocent he would have been freed 
immediately legal experts said 
on friday judge carlanton spak gave a further indication that 
a conviction was forthcoming when he said the court had reached a 
verdict and not a decision 
its a verdict that the court will come forward with from 
that you can draw your own conclusions spak said 
swedish radio said spaks wording in legal terms virtually 
eliminated the possibility pettersson would be sent for a 
psychiatric examination for possible committal to a mental 
institution which would have required a decision 
he faces a life sentence if found guilty although such 
sentences are commuted 
pettersson who has a long criminal record denied killing 
palme his lawyer said he would appeal a guilty verdict 
he was tried by a panel of two judges and six jurors each with 
an equal vote in deciding guilt or innocence a tie results in 
acquittal 
palme a fourterm prime minister who dominated swedish politics 
for two decades was shot and killed feb 28 1986 on a stocholm 
street after leaving a movie with his wife lisbeth 
the prosecution built a circumstantial case relying on the 
testimony of palmes widow lisbeth who identified pettersson as 
the man she saw standing a few feet away after the shooting 
other witnesses said they saw pettersson earlier outside the 
theater where the palme couple was seeing a movie and following 
them down the street 
the defense questioned the memories of the witnesses more than 
three years after the killing and noted the prosecution had failed 
to produce a motive a murder weapon or other forensic evidence to 
link pettersson with the murder 
pettersson 42 admitted he was in town to pick up drugs that 
night but said he was on his way home at the time of the shooting 
one defense witness whose reliability was questioned by the 
prosecution testified seeing pettersson 17 miles away at a 
suburban train station shortly after palme was shot

half the nations 1 million coal 
miners were on strike friday and dwindling fuel supplies 
threatened the coke and steel production vital to many soviet 
industries 
about 150000 miners returned to the pits friday in western 
siberia where the worst soviet labor unrest in six decades began 
july 11 but the strike continued in other major coalproducing 
areas 
all 26 mines in the karaganda region of the southern republic of 
kazakhstan were shut down and miners made more than 70 demands the 
government newspaper izvestia reported 
alexander p fisun deputy coal industry minister told izvestia 
more than 300000 miners were striking 94 of the 121 mines in the 
the donetsk basin of the eastern ukraine the countrys largest 
coal field 
strikes also were reported in the pechora basin in the far north 
and chervonograd in the western ukraine where izvestia said 
workers at 12 mines were only doing minimum maintenance 
the reports indicated half the industrys 1 million miners were 
involved in the walkout 
izvestia indicated the strikers were not satisfied with an 
agreement reached earlier in the week with strikers in western 
siberias kuznetsk basin for pay increases and greater worker 
control over the industry 
it reported progress in overnight negotiations in donetsk where 
miners made 50 demands but did not give details 
karaganda miners remained skeptical of government promises the 
newspaper said 
in addition to the concessions on pay and control to siberian 
miners the government agreed to meet demands for increased housing 
construction and more meat sugar soap clothing and other 
consumer goods 
its a victory over the system weve had in the soviet union 
for the last 70 years a system in which we work hard but get 
little in return said pyotr a menayev an engineer at the 
taldinski severny open pit mine outside prokopyevsk 
officials have said agreements made with any group of miners 
would apply to all 
a kostenko a strike leader in karaganda told izvestia a 
strike for similar demands last winter caused authorities to make 
a lot of promises but then they didnt fulfill anything 
the newspaper quoted steel workers as saying blast furnaces 
and cokechemical batteries are on the brink of an emergency 
stoppage for lack of coal 
strike leaders in kuznetsk supported the return to work but 
added a demand friday that municipal elections be moved up so they 
can try to remove unsympathetic officials 
members of the 26member kuznetsk strike committee met with half 
a dozen representatives to the national parliament and called for 
the elections to be held in november rather than in spring 1990 
most municipal officials in kuznetsk were said to have backed 
the miners but strike leaders said they were not satisfied 
they supported us but not as actively as they should have 
said vyacheslav g akulov a strike leader 
strike committees in 13 kuznetsk settlements voted on the 
agreement wednesday and some strikers resumed work thursday the 
rest returned at dawn friday according to their leaders and the 
official news agency tass 
as the sun burned early morning fog off the rolling hills 
valery e demski said we got little concrete maybe there will 
be more he was at his job of scooping anthracite coal with a 
giant crane 
it was a victory but it would have been a bigger victory if 
we had continued the strike said viktor n sizikov one of about 
75 miners who gathered at the taldinski severny mine to hear 
alexander s kutlakhmetov their strike committee delegate 
most people in the region which has produced coal for more than 
a century live in small brightly painted wooden houses some of 
the houses lack running water and are located near mounds of slag 
and other mine refuse 
apartment buildings of four and five stories are being built 
and the miners want more of them 
strike leaders said they would continue to press the miners 
demands 
the first question is to see that the first agreement is 
implemented strike committee chairman teimuraz g avaliani said 
at fridays meeting the second question facing us is to work out 
a new agreement with the government to give us more concrete 
benefits 
the miners won the right to sell to domestic and foreign 
customers whatever coal they produce beyond the amount contracted 
to the state akulov said 
we would sell that coal for hard foreign currency if 
possible and use the money to modernize our equipment and that of 
factories in the region he said we also would use it for 
social improvements 
he said japanese businessmen were interested in buying the coal

us and soviet officials will meet in 
stockholm sweden starting july 31 to exchange views on the 
situation in afghanistan and iran the state department said friday 
the meeting is another in a series in which the two sides 
discuss regional issues 
afghanistan has been the subject of previous sessions but the 
agenda of the upcoming twoday meeting will be expanded for the 
first time to include iran 
iran apparently has been included because of the changing 
situation there following the recent death of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini and the subsequent highlevel contacts between soviet and 
iranian authorities 
moscow and washington have long been at odds over afghanistan 
with each side accusing the other of prolonging the civil war in 
that country 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said the us 
delegation to the talks will be headed by the assistant secretary 
of state for near east and south asian affairs john kelly

house speaker thomas s foley suggested friday 
that lawmakers devote themselves to legislation instead of 
staging demonstrations like the one in which several sprayed water 
on the effigy of a flag burner 
responding to rumors of a flag burning thursday a dozen 
republican house members carried fire extinguishers and buckets of 
water to the steps of the supreme court when no flag burner 
showed they demonstrated their feelings anyway for the television 
cameras dousing a stuffed dummy representing such a culprit 
i think it is probably better for members of the house to 
devote themselves to legislation than to maintain peace and order 
in the vicinity of the capitol foley said friday 
but i certainly do not hold with flag burning as i think you 
know he added 
the gop lawmakers support a constitutional amendment to overcome 
the supreme courts 54 ruling last month that flag burning can be 
a protected form of political expression foley however favors 
passage of a regular statute to get around the decision leaving 
the constitution alone 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif told colleagues and onlookers 
at thursdays demonstration that the congessmen were setting an 
example for americans to follow if they witness flag burnings 
if they dont have a bucket of water i hope they take care of 
business however they can he said 
when foley was asked whether the image projected by the event 
was the proper one for members of congress he replied i will 
leave to every member of congress the management of his own image 
or hers 
i think your question raises the question itself about whether 
that is everybodys idea of the appropriate behavior for a member 
of the house of representatives he said but i dont want to 
try to make a judgment for the individual members involved

this report was submitted to a government censor 
who made no changes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the government said friday it would 
consider removing recently imposed censorship restrictions from 
foreign journalists 
censoring the press has never helped agriculture minister 
lalith athulathmudali said if it is extended it becomes 
counterproductive because it helps fuel rumors 
opposition members of parliament said the governments move had 
backfired 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne said officials will reconsider 
the censorship and probably lift it where the foreign media is 
concerned 
wijeratne announced the censorship regulations july 6 as part of 
a campaign against sinhalese militants trying to overthrow the 
government he also announced security forces had orders to shoot 
anyone putting up antigovernment posters or instigating strikes 
despite members criticism of censorship parliament on friday 
approved a government proposal to extend strict emergency laws in 
the country for another month 
the laws were in effect from 1983 until president ransinghe 
premadasa took office and lifted them in january killings 
continued in this indian ocean islands ethnic conflicts however 
and the laws were reimposed on june 20 
minority tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland 
since 1983 
in 1987 the sinhalesedominated government offered the rebels 
limited autonomy in exchange for a surrender of arms but the 
largest tamil militia rejected the plan 
the tamil group then began fighting indian soldiers who were 
sent to enforce the agreement 
the accord also touched off the backlash of sinhalese militants 
who felt it made too many concessions to the tamils 
the two conflicts have left at least 15000 people dead

president bush declaring that every 
american in every city deserves healthy air formally presented 
congress today with clean air legislation assailed by critics as 
inadequate to fix the nations worsening pollution problems 
bush in a white house ceremony said it was time to break the 
gridlock over new clean air legislation that has lasted for a 
decade 
but environmentalists and their congressional supporters 
complained that said the presidents plan would ease an early 
drafts requirements for reducing motor vehicle pollution and 
provide wide government latitude to meet industry concerns 
the president said government must see to it that every 
american in every city in america will breathe clean air and 
added his plan would take the lead in reaching that goal 
sen max baucus dmont chief senate sponsor of cleanair 
legislation said the final language of bushs bill will 
significantly tarnish his image to be the environmental president 
the president stepped up to the problem blinked and stepped 
back baucus said contending the bill would increase motor 
vehicle emissions allow cities too much time to clean air and give 
too much weight to cost in toxic chemical cleanup 
bush at a white house photo session declined to answer a 
reporters question about the criticisms but press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said it was regrettable that the criticisms were 
getting the bill off to a rocky start 
were very proud of this bill we think its a good one and 
we think the environmental community thinks its a good one as well 
overall youll find that their support is very strong he 
said 
fitzwater denied there was any watering down of the bill and 
said it was tougher overall than any current proposals on capitol 
hill 
an environmental protection agency summary of the legislation 
given to members of congress thursday showed the final version was 
changed from a preliminary draft written june 30 
the language compared to the earlier draft would push back new 
emissions standards for cars trucks and buses and would give the 
epa administrator discretion to delay new regulations even further 
other provisions would give the administrator local governments 
and industry flexibility in taking measures to reduce ozone 
pollution acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals in making key 
decisions the epa chief could address industrys costs 
richard ayres head of a coalition of environmental groups said 
the flexibility was a prescription for chicanery and fraud by 
industry he said acid rain components would be reduced less than 
promised and giving weight to economic concerns would reduce the 
effectiveness of provisions to control toxic emissions 
but epa administrator william reilly who would make many key 
decisions under the legislation called the bill faithful in 
every respect to the spirit and letter of the promises he bush 
made to clean the nations air 
rep henry waxman chairman of the house energy and commerce 
environment subcommittee called the final language weaker than 
last months draft which was far weaker than the presidents 
promises 
it undercuts the clean fuel program pushes back compliance 
deadlines and loosens emissions standards the bill actually 
appears to allow emissions from cars and trucks to increase from 
todays levels waxman said 
according to the summary new buses operated in cities with more 
than 1 million population would be required to use cleanburning 
fuel the june 30 draft would have imposed the requirement on all 
cities of 250000 or more 
while the bus program would be phased in over the 1991 through 
1994 model years the epa administrator would have the authority to 
delay the plan for two years for economic reasons 
the epa administrator for economic reasons could revise and 
postpone for two years a cleanfuel program for cars a 
cornerstone of the bush program 
the bill would establish a schedule requiring sale of cleanfuel 
cars beginning in the 1995 model year in the most heavily 
polluted cities one million of these cars would be sold in each of 
the model years 1997 through 2004 
the deadline for all cars to meet new emissions standards for 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides was pushed back from the 1994 
model year in the previous draft to the 1995 models in the final 
version 
the june 30 draft also had tougher emissions standards for light 
and heavy trucks and the deadline for meeting the new requirements 
was pushed back for the light trucks such as pickups from 1993 
to a phasedin period ending with 1995 models 
criminal penalties against auto makers for violating the 
antipollution emission standards were in the draft bill but not 
in the new version 
other provisions in the final bill would 
allow the epa administrator discretion to override deadlines 
for ozone cleanup in cities including doubling the cleanup time 
from 10 to 20 years but such cities would have to show steady 
progress over the longer period of time after receiving the 
extension 
require a 10millionton reduction from 1980 levels of sulfur 
dioxide a key ingredient of acid rain nitrogen oxide the other 
key ingredient would be reduced by 2 million tons from the levels 
that would have been reached by the year 2000 
environmentalists argued the nitrogen oxide figure is not really 
a reduction just a smaller growth rate and they pointed out the 
sulfur dioxide reduction would be only 9 million tons since the 
administration is counting a 1 million ton reduction already 
achieved 
permit auto makers to average the car emissions to achieve new 
antipollution standards a tactic environmentalists said would not 
bring about a reduction the epa contended it would write 
regulations to make the program effective 
permit auto and petroleum companies to propose alternative ways 
to reduce pollution a plan ayres said would be a floating crap 
game that would lead to delay epa officials said they would 
establish tough regulations to prevent industry from stretching 
deadlines 
require maximum available control technology for toxic 
emissions but require that cost the feasibility of installing the 
technology and energy requirements be taken into account 
environmentalists said these considerations negated the technology 
standards but the epa disagreed

leaving hotels restaurants and night spots stuck with the bills

his tab has run into the thousands but this man calling himself 
john frank has never spent a dime hes asked businessmen to send 
the bills to nonexistent companies 
franks victims have described him as short darkhaired and 
dumpy dressed in a sloppy fashion 
the orange county sheriffs department is looking for him 
spokesman jim solomons said friday ms savino has warned film 
offices statewide to be on the lookout 
this town and this community is primed for that right now 
because of the two studios in town and the enthusiasm for the 
film industry ms savino said there are very good people in 
this industry and then there are con artists 
the disneymgm studios theme park and universal studios florida

to disbelieve him said ms pierson 
owner randy sprayberry of the sandwich gallery was out about 
150 worth of sandwiches and drinks the man supposedly bought for 
his film crew 
its almost laughable that i got taken by a movie producer 
your stereotypical con man said sprayberry who agreed to send

valentino a new fashion pavilion and a show down 
the famed spanish steps combined to lift the sagging image of 
romes high fashion week 
sixteen of italys leading designers sent actors and 
international models down the steps in their most beautiful 
creations for the upcoming fall and winter 
the hourlong show thursday night which ended with a fireworks 
display was beamed live thoughout europe and to the soviet union 
for the first time 
grace jones created the biggest splash by frolicking in the 
fountain at the bottom of the steps in a slick black leotard before 
donning a luxurious bluedyed sable fur by fendi 
the top italian designers who also include mila schoen rocco 
barocco galitzine laug lancetti and balestra produce beautiful 
styles enhanced by sumptuous fabrics and artisan detailing but the 
italian couture scene has lost the excitement of the 1960s when the 
fashion creativity of such designers as the fontana sisters 
capucci and shubert went hand in hand with the wild spirit of the 
dolce vita 
romes loss has been paris gain not only have their own 
designers combined to make the made in france label the queen 
of couture but they also have lured some of the best italian talent 
into their fashion net 
valentino who strayed from italy a decade ago to present his 
readytowear collection in paris has a second showing of his 
couture during the french fashion week meaning that the bulk of 
his international customers need not make an extra trip to rome to 
admire his wears 
but valentino swears he wont abandon the italian capital he 
has just restored another wing of his rome headquarters a 16th 
century building in the shadow of the spanish steps and this week 
announced a collaboration agreement with the italian maufacturing 
company gruppo finanziario tessile to produce his high fashion 
collections 
the italian fashion chamber set up a pavilion in villa borghese 
park for the shows 
as his maid of honor for the spanish steps gala valentino chose 
italian actress ornella muti in a red silk gown carroll baker 
famous for creating the scanty pajama vogue after her film baby 
doll had trouble inching her way down in a slinky evening gown 
by sarli 
outfits presented during the week included lancettis rich 
velvet gowns with passementerie trimming inspired by the italian 
renaissance glittery black sequined gowns by rocco barocco 
elegant suits blouses and penthouse party gowns by the late andre 
laug and sexy black evening gowns by mila schoen 
but the winning card of the fashion week was the stunning show 
of the maestro valentino who outdid himself with a fallwinter 
collection inspired by the geometric designs of the vienna liberty 
school at the beginning of the century 
the perfect little black dress in velvet or chiffon or a 
combination of both was the star of the show at times worn under 
an extravagant floorlength white coat with black geometric 
embroidery 
for daytime valentino favors his trademark neat little suit 
adorning it either with velvet geometric detail or colored pompon 
buttons in tufts of wool or silk gleaned from the fabric of the 
suit

resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk said 
friday he supports a role for the communist khmer rouge in a 
cambodian government despite their history of atrocities 
he said that at an international conference starting july 30 
the guerrilla group will sign a guarantee accepting strict controls 
when it becomes part of an interim government made of resistance 
groups and the cambodian regime 
khmer rouge participation in a government is expected to be a 
major sticking point at the conference which represents the most 
serious effort yet to end the 10yearold cambodian war 
speaking at a news conference sihanouk rejected a ceasefire 
proposal supported by vietnam and said resistance guerrillas will 
keep fighting until all vietnamese forces leave cambodia where a 
vietnameseinstalled government is in power 
sihanouk also wants an international peacekeeping force and for 
elections to follow the pullout 
the promised retreat by sept 30 of the remainder of vietnams 
troops estimated to number up to 70000 was a ruse he said he 
said 130000 other vietnamese are hidden in the cambodian army 
and paramilitary 
sihanouks remarks came four days before a scheduled meeting 
with the head of the cambodian government prime minister hun sen 
to be followed by talks between hun sen and the threeparty 
resistance 
the khmer rouge the strongest of the three guerrilla movements 
was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians during a threeyear reign of terror that ended with 
vietnams invasion of cambodia in december 1978 
sihanouk said the khmer rouge will commit themselves in 
writing during the international conference to accept to be 
strictly controlled for several years five years 10 years if need 
be by an international control mechanism and a un peacekeeping 
force 
sihanouk has said he wants controls to prevent any single party 
from monopolizing power but hun sen vietnam and the united states 
oppose any khmer rouge role 
khmer rouge representatives were not available for comment 
the paris conference will be attended by the five permanent 
members of the un security council france the united states 
britain china and the soviet union and members of the 
association of southeast asian nations canada and several other 
countries also will participate 
two recent rounds of peace talks held in jakarta indonesia 
produced a consensus that vietnams pullout must be linked with 
measures to prevent the khmer rouge from returning to power 
in addition there is growing pressure in the united states to 
provide military aid to the noncommunist resistance to lessen 
their reliance on the khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge are seriously committed to respecting the 
spirit of quadripartism sihanouk said referring to his proposal 
for a government that includes the threetiered resistance movement 
and hun sen we cannot let this occasion slip by 
sihanouk who negotiated his countrys independence from france 
in 1953 and was deposed in 1970 denied he was an accomplice of 
the khmer rouge 
they killed five of my children i cannot pardon them 
that he said but if i abandon the resistance i serve ipso 
facto the cause of vietnamese colonialism 
the resistance leader said he was not against the principle of a 
ceasefire proposed by thailand vietnamese foreign minister nguyen 
co thach said wednesday he supported that proposal saying there 
could be no peaceful solution without a ceasefire 
however sihanouk said a ceasefire was not possible while 
vietnamese colonialism continued 
sihanouk made public the resistance movements plan for a 
constitution based on the french model it calls for a president 
elected to a sevenyear term a premier and a twochamber 
parliament the plan specifies the name of the country as cambodia 
a new cambodian flag coat of arms and a national anthem to be 
composed by sihanouk himself 
asean which includes thailand singapore malaysia indonesia 
brunei and the philippines supports a khmer rouge role in an 
interim government

two house members say they are making headway 
in a long battle against congress spending time and money 
commemorating jukeboxes asparagus dairy goats and hundreds of 
other things 
reps dave mccurdy dokla and claudine schneider rri are 
proposing to turn the timeconsuming job of recognizing pet causes 
over to a commission which would pass worthy proposals on to the 
president for action 
in the 100th congress that ended last year lawmakers passed 258 
bills designating commemorative days weeks or months among them 
were national asparagus month national dairy goat awareness week 
and national jukebox week a decade ago the 95th congress passed 
just 34 such measures 
this is clearly a reform initiative that will focus members of 
congress more on substantive legislation schneider said not to 
mention saving some 500000 in printing costs and staff time she 
estimates 
she said commemoratives have proliferated because groups have 
seized upon them as a way of gaining instant credibility and 
members of congress have gone along because its an easy way to 
throw a bone to the home folks 
organizations feel that if you can have a congressional stamp 
of approval to your week of the dandelions or national 
butterfly day or whatever there is more of an establishment aura 
to it she said 
i would not be surprised if there were not many members whose 
only list of accomplishments legislatively might be 
commemoratives she added 
mccurdy has been introducing legislation on the subject since 
1985 but it has never moved primarily because lawmakers are 
reluctant to give up a goody they can pass out to constituents 
but this week mccurdy and schneider met with rep tom sawyer 
dohio chairman of the post office and civil service subcommittee 
that handles commemorative bills and won a promise that for the 
first time a hearing will be held on their idea 
mccurdy called the move a welcome turning point and said his 
proposal for an 11member commission is a commonsense approach 
creating a commission does not add another layer of bureaucracy 
rather it thins out the layer from the involvement of 435 people 
to 11 
the two lawmakers have enlisted a majority of house members in 
support of their legislation which in part prompted sawyers 
decision to hold a hearing the session will be scheduled for 
september after congress returns from its august recess 
in the meantime the beat goes on some 268 commemorative 
measures have been introduced in the first seven months of this 
year 81 have passed either the house or senate and 28 have been 
signed into law 
among proposals still before congress national tap dance day 
sponsored by rep john conyers dmich national duckling month 
proposed by rep bill hefner dnc the decade of the brain 
offered by rep silvio conte rmass and national culinary week 
pushed by rep leon panetta dcalif

david langs wheat field looks green and 
almost lush waving gently in a breeze that provides a momentary 
respite from north dakotas july inferno 
but langs digging fingers find surface soil so dry it runs like 
salt through his fingers deeper where the ground in better times 
would come up in moist dark clumps it is pale almost as hard as 
a nearby fence post 
the wheat stalks hold little promise of developing plump 
healthy kernels in time for the august harvest 
you get down here theres nothing there lang said his 
fingers probing the parched dirt 
this is the second straight drought year for north dakota and 
langs farm about 23 miles east of bismarck is in one of the 
states driest areas 
the drought of 1989 is not as widespread as the previous year 
but it still covers roughly a third of the nation said norton 
strommen chief meteorologist for the us agriculture department 
the main swath cuts northwest from illinois through the dakotas 
parts of kansas and nebraska strommen said 
virtually all of north dakota the nations leading producer of 
spring wheat and durum a wheat variety used for pasta is 
considered to be in a severe to extreme drought he said parts 
of neighboring south dakota and minnesota also have been hurt 
at this time to get back down to near normal it would 
take from 5 to 10 inches of rain strommen said 
but that much rain is unlikely on the 3100acre farm that lang 
43 works with his 78yearold father theodore 
on monday storms dumped as much as 3 inches of rain on some 
parts of the state but said lang it missed us 
the lang farm has gotten only about 4 inches of rain since 
april 1 about half of what the thirsty soil needs 
there isnt any subsoil moisture said theodore lang a 
state representative since 1965 and a lifelong farmer thats 
where the problem is 
the wheat field david lang surveys may yield three or four 
bushels an acre a sixth of its normal yield and barely enough to 
make harvesting worthwhile 
last summer it held on for so long lang said i guess 
thats what kept your optimism up because youd look out in the 
field and it was still green youd think gee if you could just 
get a halfinch of rain on this 
rain was in short supply everywhere in north dakota last year 
when about a third of the states 62 millionacre spring wheat 
crop was abandoned direct crop losses were estimated at more than 
500 million 
north dakota state university researchers have pegged this 
years crop losses at 661 million so far saying the state would 
lose 30 percent of its spring wheat and from 26 percent to 42 
percent of its durum barley and hay 
the 1988 drought ruined langs crop but this spring in hopes 
of plentiful rainfall and prices driven up by grain shortages he 
planted 1500 acres 
now he estimates he may be able to harvest only about 150 acres 
there are some bright spots lang expects to have enough hay to 
feed 150 cattle and the cattle can graze fields that would be 
useless to harvest the farm is not in danger of foreclosure 
wearing jeans and a denim shirt with cutoff sleeves exposing 
popeyesize forearms lang maintains a sunny disposition 
i guess im more of an optimist he says 
but he worries whether the federal government which pumped more 
than 400 million in drought aid into north dakota last year will 
respond again in 1989 when dry conditions are not as widespread 
nationwide 
lang received about 25000 in federal drought aid last year 
that aid along with cropinsurance payments helped keep the wolf 
off our back he said 
i dont want to see a handout im not begging for a 
handout lang said but you look at what disaster money did to 
the economy of north dakota last year some of the areas were 
going to need it to keep things going

the house with unusual ease on friday 
approved a 143 billion foreign aid bill that sends a warning to 
the philippines to improve its management of aid dollars and begins 
president bushs initiatives in hungary and poland to boost private 
development 
with little debate the lawmakers voted 329 to 69 to appove what 
traditionally has been one of the most contentious pieces of 
legislation congress takes up each year the bill one of 13 basic 
money measures that fund the full array of federal programs now 
goes to the senate 
the bill includes 160 million as the us contribution toward 
the multilateral assistance initiative for the philippines an 
effort to bolster the government of president corazon aquino with 
an influx of development aid 
but that amount falls below the 200 million pledged to the 
program by president bush the cut was intended to signal concerns 
that money already flowing to the philippines is not being used or 
is being wasted 
the house appropriations committee report accompanying the bill 
said the panel is deeply concerned about the management crisis in 
the philippine foreign assistance program and added that further 
cuts will follow if improvements are not made 
the measure includes 10 million for poland and 5 million for 
hungary to begin a threeyear 125million plan announced by bush 
last week to encourage private development in those two east bloc 
countries 
the bill has substantially greater emphasis on development aid 
and less on military assistance than the bush administration had 
sought security aid totaled 76 billion a 16billion cut from 
the white house request development aid was boosted from the 53 
billion bush had asked to 6 billion 
other allocations in the bill include 3 billion for israel and 
21 billion for egypt largely a reward for their participation in 
the camp david middle east peace process a maximum of 85 million 
in military aid to the newly elected government of el salvador led 
by alfredo cristiani of the rightwing arena party 65 million for 
the un childrens fund more than double the administrations 
request and a total of 410 million for migration and refugee 
assistance 40 million more than the administration had asked 
also earmarked are 20 million for a program to promote peace in 
northern ireland 230 million in military aid to pakistan 12 
million for the west bank and gaza strip for education health and 
agriculture programs and 164 million for the peace corps

stubby water pipes follow the washboard 
gravel road twisting through the hills of rural mississippi 
bringing people a taste of the 20th century they find as 
significant as the first human steps on the moon 
when youve had to haul water from a creek or collect 
rainwater off the roof all your life having it brought to your 
doorstep is as important to us as when they walked on the moon 
charles savage said this week 
for now however the 36yearold laborers bathroom is still an 
outhouse 
until money can be found to install and hook up indoor plumbing 
savages family and others in the community will have to keep 
drawing water from the new plastic pipes that stick out of the 
ground outside each home 
a federally financed project completed the main line down the 
road two weeks ago and a church group paid to run pipe to each 
home now a charity effort is under way to collect used fixtures 
and the money to install them 
most residents in blue hill named for the forestcovered blue 
clay hills in sparsely populated jefferson county live in poverty 
only a couple families have the luxury of a private well 
unemployment in the southwest mississippi county runs 234 
percent the highest in the state 
for blue hill residents lucky enough to find work its usually 
cutting and hauling pulpwood or jobs associated with the 
mississippi river several miles to the west some get work loading 
barges savage works for a company that lays stabilizing concrete 
mats on the river bank 
a decadeold campaign by a few residents finally paid off when 
rep mike espy dmiss secured 255000 from the farmers home 
administration so the small pattison water system could extend its 
line eight miles to blue hill 
this week marks 20 years since the united states landed a man 
on the moon espy said it will also mark the first time ever 
for many blue hill residents to have running water its time 
for congress to concentrate on moving rural america into modern 
times along with the rest of the country 
janie cole whose family has a well led appeals for donations 
she said a church group in charlotte nc raised 2800 to hire a 
contractor to run water pipes from the main line beside the gravel 
road to the spigots just outside homes 
then members of the providence united methodist church in 
charlotte brought a truckload of used sinks 
weve got enough sinks but were still in need of other 
plumbing fixtures and money to complete the piping mrs cole 
said 
until the money is found people like trenessa moore will do 
things the old way 
i get water for cooking and to wash my baby from that 
barrel moore said as she stood on the porch of the weathered 
shack that is home to her and her 11monthold child they ran 
the water up to the house about a month ago and gave me a sink but 
i dont have any money to bring the water inside 
moore 19 and living on welfare said she hauls water from a 
neighbors well or from the creek to fill the 50gallon drum beside 
her porch 
in a way its like a dream to think i may soon have an indoor 
bathroom moore said that means i wont have to heat water on 
the stove to wash my baby 
mrs cole said she and a few other residents appealed for years 
to federal officials for help but had little success until two 
local legislators helped put her touch with espy 
mary moore who is raising her three sons in a trailer home 
doesnt think people in other parts of the country really 
understand just what it means for her community to get running 
water 
for some there will be the problem of paying the monthly 
water fee but weve overcome so much and we can overcome the 
rest she said i know this sounds crazy but right now if i 
had a milliondollar lottery ticket i would let it go for this 
water

they may play in peoria but a line of logo 
clothes for a local high school wont make it in the rest of the 
country 
a kansas city mo businessman who purchased the rights to use 
the name and insignia of peoria high school has given up his idea 
for a line of clothing 
it was an attempt to create a fad and it didnt happen said 
fred wolferman it was clearly a long shot 
wolferman said he wanted to market the peoria high clothing as 
an alternative to a beverly hills high school line introduced last 
year by twentieth century fox and the great southern clothing co 
of macon ga 
i tried a little test ad in the new yorker and i didnt get 
any response wolferman said i deduced there was minimal 
interest 
the idea of a peoria high line of clothes came from a comment 
made by promoters of the beverly hills clothing 
wolferman said he was offended on behalf of peoria and the 
midwest when a promoter said his clothes were the closest most 
kids in peoria will ever feel theyre a part of the beverly hills 
high school attitude

communist party leaders bemoaning the ideological 
confusion in the party under president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms have called for tight restrictions on the press and a 
clear secondincommand 
the party newspaper pravda on friday published speeches made 
tuesday by party chiefs depicting ruling communist cadres cut loose 
without a party line and drifting in a sea of contradictions 
in answer to a speech by gorbachev encouraging party members to 
further perestroika his economic and political revival program 
leader after leader complained that party activists were confused 
and hampered by opposition forces unleashed by the reforms 
leonid f bobykin party chief in sverdlovsk told the meeting 
things are going not at all the way we expected and the way they 
should 
we dont see a hard line on ideological questions he said 
bobykin said the role of the secretariat of the central 
committee had been weakened and whats needed apparently is a 
second secretary of the central committee no matter what thats 
called officially 
gorbachevs post as general secretary of the central committe 
makes him head of the party but no secondincommand has been 
designated the politburo member in charge of ideology 
traditionally has been viewed as the no 2 party official but 
leaders have said no one fulfills that role since yegor k ligachev 
was replaced as ideology chief last fall 
the 251member central committee is the policymaking body of 
the party its secretariat is charged with daytoday oversight of 
the party apparatus 
at tuesdays meeting ligachev called for tight party control of 
the press and the political arena he did not directly criticize 
gorbachev but implied he was taking too light a hand to counter 
threats to the partys power and national law and order 
ligachev who now oversees the agricultural sector asked how 
gorbachevs july 1 speech appealing for peace among the countrys 
many ethnic groups was received 
in certain areas it was received with clashes with peoples 
deaths he answered 
at least 17 people have been reported killed this month in 
ethnic clashes in the abkhazia region of the southern republic of 
georgia 
ligachev considered a conservative force in the politburo said 
oppositionist antiperestroika political organizations with 
their own publications were gaining strength 
he ruled out the idea of taking control of the press away from 
the party cautioning that in that case the media will turn into 
the dictatorship of certain forces 
bobykin echoed ligachevs criticism of the media as did many of 
tuesdays speakers bobykin said greater press freedom under 
gorbachev leads sometimes not to consolidation but to 
disintegration distorts the line of perestroika 
from literature cinema and television the figure of the 
laborer of the laboring workdays of perestroika has practically 
disappeared he said theyve become filled with legal 
robbers prostitutes drug addicts hooligans and dubious 
supermen 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov said the politburo also 
appeared alienated at times from the reform process 
at last months congress of peoples deputies the legislature 
that is the centerpiece of gorbachevs political reforms the 
politburo ended up over on the side in some kind of isolated 
state as if some paralysis syndrome were at work on it he said 
no one from the politburo made a speech at the congress as is 
well known he remarked i think that was our strategic 
miscalculation 
ryzhkov also called for the division of labor in the politburo 
to be rearranged to let gorbachev devote more attention to his 
party duties 
the rankandfile party members dont understand a lot these 
days said moscow party chief lev n zaikov and that makes 
them unhappy and passive

the government released a jailed 
american on friday after washington complied with a demand to make 
a formal request for his freedom from the regime it does not 
recognize 
wearing blue pajamalike tunic and trousers tony obrien was 
handed over to a us representative at a ceremony before the 
glaring lights of governmentrun television 
he hugged her then threw his hands in the air and shouted i 
want to thank god for my freedom 
afghan security forces arrested obrien on june 8 at a guerrilla 
hideout in the capital after the photographer on assignment for 
timelife inc entered afghanistan without valid travel documents 
and in the company of moslem guerrillas 
obrien 43 of santa fe nm was never charged and the 
sovietbacked government agreed to release him without trial but 
it later demanded a formal letter from the us government 
officially requesting his release and authorizing a state 
department representative to escort him out of the country 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity had said 
the afghan government appeared to be using obrien to try to force 
the united states into issuing a statement that could be construed 
as recognizing president najibs government as legitimate 
the united states does not recognize najibs government and 
closed its embassy in kabul in january before the final withdrawal 
of soviet troops fighting usbacked moslem guerrillas 
they got what they wanted said renny smith the consular 
officer who was sent from the us embassy in new delhi to pick up 
obrien 
ms smith said she personally delivered a letter thursday to 
government officials another letter was sent by telex from 
washington directly to the afghan government she said without 
elaborating 
ms smith made no mention of the afghan government during the 
ceremony 
i am thankful to everyone for what they have done to get tony 
home she said 
rep bill richardson dnm said that after his release 
obrien stayed at the turkish embassy which is handling his 
departure turkey is the only nato country that still maintains an 
embassy in kabul 
the whole issue was that the afghans wanted the state 
department to send somebody official and the state department was 
reluctant because we dont recognize the afghan government he 
said 
obrien said he had been told only an hour earlier he would be 
released 
i want to see my mother i want to tell her im coming home 
soon obrien said 
i want to go home and play baseball but right now i want to 
walk on the streets said obrien who spent most of his 
confinement in a small cell 
obrien was scheduled to fly to new delhi india on saturday 
and then return home 
since his arrest the government said it received appeals for 
obriens release from palestine liberation organization leader 
yasser arafat timelife and several us congressmen 
a french photographer and an italian photographer captured by 
government forces were freed last year but only after their 
governments formally requested their release and dispatched senior 
officials to kabul 
the clemency pleas by the french and italian governments were 
widely publicized by kabul as a show of official international 
recognition 
obrien crossed into afghanistan with the guerrillas he has 
been covering the war from the pakistani frontier city of peshawar 
the guerrillas who are mainly based in neighboring pakistan 
have been fighting for 11 years to overthrow the government 
the united states and other western nations closed their 
embassies in kabul in late january and early february shortly 
before soviet troops withdrew from afghanistan the western allies 
who had been pressing for moscow to end its nineyear military 
intervention cited fears that security would deteriorate after the 
red army left

un chief javier perez de cuellar 
asked government officials friday to dismiss more than 2000 
namibia police from a unit accused of war atrocities and harassing 
civilians 
the un secretary general also said he would investigate south 
africas claims that many political prisoners remain held by the 
southwest africa peoples organization or swapo 
the independence movement began its guerrilla war against south 
african rule of namibia in 1966 but stopped fighting after an 
independence plan was approved last december 
perez de cuellar met with foreign minister pik botha and two 
other cabinet members friday after arriving from a threeday trip 
to namibia while there he said his request for dismissal of the 
controversial police officers was turned town by louis pienaar the 
territorial administrator installed by south africa 
im sorry to say im not totally satisfied with pienaars 
decision the un chief said before leaving namibia also known as 
southwest africa 
despite the dispute botha and the un leader predicted the 
territory would have elections as scheduled nov 6 to establish an 
independent government and end 74 years of south african control 
perez de cuellar said the main threat to fair elections 
concerned charges of intimidation by namibian police who belonged 
to the disbanded paramilitary unit known as koevoet the afrikaans 
word for crowbar 
i want to totally remove the shadow of koevoet he told a 
news conference in namibia 
during that territorys war koevoet members often went on 
weeklong patrols through isolated villages and bush territory in 
armored vehicles mounted with machine guns they were accused of 
dozens of atrocities against civilians and guerrillas 
koevoet was officially disbanded earlier this year but more 
than 2000 of its members were integrated into the regular police 
force swapo says those members are still harassing its supporters 
in lusaka zambia swapo president sam nujoma said south 
africancontrolled namibian troops killed 27 civilians near 
oshakati in northern namibia 
he said villagers reported seeing former koevoet members burying 
the victims corpses after the july 15 killings 
he called the killings a massacre but gave no details 
the people were murdered they koevoet were really caught 
redhanded said nujoma at a news conference 
territorial authorities previously acknowledged burying 11 
guerrillas but dismissed the report of 27 bodies 
nujoma said the killings support swapos demands for an increase 
in the strength of un forces supervising the independence plan 
about 4650 un troops now are stationed in namibia under the plan 
nujoma urged the united nations to send more troops to namibia 
so its forces could be in a position to prevent further south 
african massacres of our people and intimidation of voters 
swapo is favored to win the elections 
pienaar met with perez de cuellar on wednesday and announced 
that former koevoet members would be moved from northcentral 
namibia into less tense regions but he says he will dismiss 
policemen only if misconduct is proved against them individually 
perez de cuellar also said friday he was very much concerned 
by charges that swapo continues to hold large numbers of prisoners 
at camps in angola under terms of the un independence plan 
political prisoners on both sides are to be freed and 24 swapo 
members were released from a namibian prison thursday 
swapo has said it released all 201 detainees it held but 
relatives and the freed detainees have said nearly 2000 prisoners 
were in swapo camps 
the former detainees also say dozens of people were killed in 
the camps 
perez de cuellar said he plans to travel to zambia on saturday 
to confer with president kenneth kaunda and nujoma

the dalai lama said friday that chinas 
crackdown on the democracy movement is only a temporary setback for 
tibets fight for autonomy 
the spiritual leader of tibetans also said the june 34 
crackdown on protesters in beijing should help chinese understand 
the situation in tibet 
the himalayan region annexed by china 40 years ago has been the 
scene of numerous clashes in recent years between tibetan monks 
independence activists and chinese settlers police and soldiers 
the dalai lama concluding a monthlong trip told a news 
conference that for both tibetan and chinese prodemocracy 
activists eventually things will improve the desire for 
democracy and freedom are basic human desires in the human blood 
but he said chinas attitude toward dissent following the 
beijing protests is much more hardline so naturally the 
attitude toward tibet has become harder 
but while the recent events are very sad i feel it is a 
temporary setback 
later friday the dalai lama who fled tibet after an abortive 
1959 uprising against chinese control received the first raul 
wallenberg congressional human rights award it is named after a 
swedish diplomat who helped save tens of thousands of people from 
the holocaust 
the dalai lama has visited costa rica mexico los angeles and 
new york 
rep thomas lantos dcalif said the dalai lama was honored 
because he is the quintessential leader of the global trends 
toward reconciliation nonviolence and peace 
the only difference between chinese suppression of tibetans for 
40 years and its suppression of its own democracy movement in june 
is that the events in tiananmen were carried on tv to hundreds of 
millions of living rooms around the world lantos said 
china says tibet historically has been part of china while 
tibetans claim that despite the regions trade tribute and 
religious links to china it has been fundamentally independent 
the dalai lama said his desire for dialogue with the chinese 
government has not changed despite the crackdown but he said his 
contacts with china through the chinese embassy in new delhi have 
been stalled 
we have made a number of proposals through new delhi but 
there has been no response he said 
the dalai lamas latest proposal calls for tibet to be 
selfgoverning but for china to remain responsible for its defense 
and foreign affairs china rejected the idea 
the dalai lama chosen at birth as a reincarnation of the last 
dalai lama is revered by tibetans as the godking and symbol 
of their motherland 
i am quite popular he said but the system must change 
without change in this dalai lama system democracy would be very 
difficult to achieve and meaningless 
authority for the dalai lama he said should not just come 
naturally but through election he must first be qualified to be 
the spiritual leader before he becomes the dalai lama 
it is nonsense that a young boy not well qualified should be 
chosen as dalai lama to become a spiritual leader 
i never felt that i was the dalai lama he said i am a 
monk no more no less i am just a monk

an evenly divided house ways and means 
committee failed friday in a new effort to decide the fate of 
catastrophic health insurance for older americans 
on an 1818 vote the committee defeated an amendment by rep 
willis gradison rohio that would have allowed a beneficiary to 
avoid paying a tax to finance catastrophic coverage so long as he 
or she also forfeited medicare coverage for physicians fees 
medicare coverage of doctors fees known as part b is heavily 
subsidized by the government although beneficiaries pay a premium 
of 2790 a month part b is voluntary but current law requires 
every person eligible for medicare to enroll in catastrophic 
twelve democrats and six republicans voted for the amendment 11 
democrats and seven republicans voted no 
the committee ended its work for the week without resolving 
another major issue whether to reduce the tax on capital gains 
aides said six democrats and the 13 republicans favor a plan to 
reduce the tax which applies to profits from the sale of stocks 
and other assets 
president bush wants a cut in the rate 
rep dan rostenkowski dill the committee chairman and house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash oppose a reduction because most 
of the benefit would go to those with income of more than 100000 
a year they also fear cutting the rate would be the first step 
toward unraveling the massive 1986 tax overhaul which took away 
any preference for capital gains 
rostenkowski and foley while opposing a rate cut are exploring 
the possibility of cutting capitalgains taxes another way by 
indexing the system so that gains that were caused solely by 
inflation are not taxed 
catastrophic coverage under medicare was enacted a year ago to 
help insulate older americans against having their savings eroded 
by medical expenses it is under attack because twothirds of the 
cost of the program is paid by those 65 and older who have enough 
income that their federal income taxes exceed 150 
in 1989 the maximum catastrophic tax is 800 or 1600 if both 
spouses are eligible for medicare 
some who are having to pay the surtax have been complaining so 
loudly that congressional leaders say the program will have to be 
changed 
a move for outright repeal was rejected by the ways and means 
committee thursday 
in addition to defeating the gradison proposal friday the 
committee beat a proposal by rep hank brown rcolo that would 
have eliminated coverage of drugs under the catastrophic plan and 
used the money saved to cut the surtax the surtax rate now 15 
percent of income taxes over 150 would have been cut to about 2 
percent committee aides said 
the bush administration like rostenkowski would prefer that 
the program be left as is committee aides said the administration 
supported gradisons proposal and could support a rostenkowski 
substitute that would keep the program intact but dump a greater 
share of the cost onto older people with incomes under 25000 a 
year

hundreds of women staged a sitin outside 
un offices friday until they were allowed to present a petition 
demanding freedom for greek cypriots arrested while protesting the 
turkish occupation of northern cyprus 
the women accompanied by a dozen priests sat outside the 
office of the un force in cyprus after they were blocked from 
marching to the home of oscar camilion the un special 
representative in cyprus 
they said they would remain until camilion met with them four 
hours later un soldiers allowed a priest and a demonstrator 
through they walked to the un officials residence about 500 
yards away and handed him the appeal 
the estimated 500 to 600 demonstrators then dispersed 
the petition demanded the release of 108 greek cypriots detained 
wednesday the eve of the 15th anniversary of the turkish invasion 
the detainees 10 men and 98 women appeared in a turkish 
cypriot court friday and were tried and convicted on charges of

1983 is recognized only by turkey 
sentencing was scheduled saturday they face up to 18 months in 
prison 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar called for the 
release of the detainees and criticized both the greek cypriots and 
turkish cypriots for wednesdays incident 
he said that despite previous assurances from greek cypriot 
authorities events marked by violence and the destruction of 
united nations property were allowed to take place 
it is also unacceptable that the turkish cypriot side crossed 
the turkish force ceasefire line and forcibly took demonstrators 
back to their area he said 
turkish cypriot riot police made the arrests after about 1000 
demonstrators broke through un barricades into a buffer zone 
between the greek and turkish sides 
about 60 british paratroopers from the sevennation un force 
in cyprus formed a human barricade to prevent fridays marchers 
from reaching camilions home on the green line that divides the 
island into the turkish and greek sectors 
the women then sat on the ground blocking the entance to the 
un office 
their petition read through a bullhorn by one of the 
protesters accused turkish forces of launching a brutal attack 
against the unarmed women 
it also demanded the withdrawal of 35000 turkish troops and 
50000 mainland settlers from northern cyprus and the return of 
about 200000 greek cypriots who were evicted from northern cyprus 
when the turks invaded 
president george vassiliou conferred with camilion and 
reiterated earlier demands for un action to bring about the 
release of the detainees said government spokesman akis fantis 
vassiliou also conferred eparately with the diplomatic 
representatives of the five permanent members of the un security 
council the united states britain the soviet union france and 
china 
turkeys foreign ministry criticized un peacekeeping troops 
for failing to prevent the demonstrators wednesday from bursting 
into the buffer zone 
the cypriot demonstrators also criticized the un troops 
saying they did nothing to protect the protesters from the turks on 
wednesday

yale nuclear physicist d allan bromley 
president bushs nominee to be white house science adviser said 
friday he supports several big science projects but doesnt 
want to see them funded at the expense of small grants to 
individual researchers 
testifying at his confirmation hearing bromley also said he 
believes there are good chances for an increase in staffing at the 
white house office of science and technology policy which 
sustained substantial budget cuts during the reagan administration 
bromley told the senate commerce committee he had been assured 
by bush that the president wants to enhance the visibility of the 
white house office and to give his science adviser ready access to 
the oval office 
in line with this policy bromley said bush was planning to 
establish and have regular meetings with a new council of science 
and technology advisers intended to bring together the best 
expertise from a wide range of areas 
sen albert gore jr dtenn who chaired the hearing said he 
expects very speedy approval of bromleys nomination by the 
committee and then by the full senate 
bromley said he was committed to supporting the 44 billion 
superconducting super collider a 53mile circumference nuclear 
particle accelerator to be constructed south of dallas texas 
bromley said he also supports a research megaproject in the life 
sciences using advanced computer techniques to map all the genes 
which control heredity comprising the chromosomes within each cell 
but he expressed reservations about moving ahead immediately 
with development of a hypersonic aerospace plane capable of flying 
between new york and tokyo in about two hours 
i happen to believe that the national aerospace plane is an 
important project but at the moment both the national space 
council and secretary of defense dick cheney have agreed that 
that would be slowed down he said 
bromley told the senate panel that we simply cannot afford no 
matter how attractive all these megaprojects we cant afford to 
do them all simultaneously 
he said that was particularly the case because it would be 
suicidal to fund the big science projects by significantly 
cutting funds available for small grants to individual researchers

ten victims of the unrest in soviet 
georgia are being treated in west germany but there were 
conflicting accounts friday as to whether they were exposed to 
poison gas 
the ard television network reported the patients suffered from 
ailments related to an april incident in georgia when troops used 
force to end a proreform demonstration 
preliminary results indicate that the feared chlorine gas of 
world war i was also used in addition to tear and irritant gases 
ard said 
but ingwardt tauchert a spokesman for saarland states health 
ministry said toxicology tests had not determined the kind of gas 
the victims were exposed to 
the tests are still being conducted and it would be premature 
to make any conclusions about what they were exposed to tauchert 
said in an interview 
ard said treatment had been hampered because soviet officials 
have refused to say what kind of gas was used by security forces to 
quell unrest in georgia 
tauchert said many of the patients complained of breathing 
difficulties and cramps which he said could also be caused by 
stress resulting from a traumatic experience 
the 10 soviets arrived in west germany on july 15 and were taken 
to the homburg university clinic 
they are to return home next week the homburg clinic agreed to 
treat the victims as a humanitarian gesture tauchert said 
ard said in its report that some of the patients suffered from 
depression and that others were barely conscious 
tauchert said he could not confirm the ard report 
clinic officials could not be reached for comment on the ard 
report calls to the clinic were referred to the saarland health 
ministry 
ard said west german medical experts are trying to find better 
ways of treating an estimated 4500 people in georgia who were 
injured in the april unrest 
on april 9 20 demonstrators were killed by troops in the 
georgian capital of tbilisi

a judge who reviewed the official investigation of 
the 1985 air crash in newfoundland that killed 256 americans said 
friday it did not find the cause but reopening it would produce 
the same lonely result 
willard estey a retired supreme court justice said the 
evidence did not support the conclusions in the report of the 
canadian aviation safety board about what caused the disaster the 
investigation took three years to complete 
the crash of a chartered arrow air dc8 at gander killed all 248 
american soldiers returning from peacekeeping duty in the middle 
east and the eight american crew members 
estey said it would be unproductive and sad to reopen the 
investigation nearly four years after canadas worst aviation 
disaster 
youll have the same lonely result he said at a news 
conference at which his review was released estey noted that no 
one survived the crash and fire consumed most of the physical 
evidence 
his review found insufficient evidence for the majority 
conclusion that ice on the wings was a probable cause and even less 
for the minority view that an explosion or fire occurred before the 
crash 
five of the safety boards nine members approved the majority 
report released last december and four signed the minority report 
there is nothing in the evidence or the material assembled by 
the board or in any of the studies prepared by or for the board 
which would indicate that any further inquiry into this accident 
almost four years later would determine the cause or causes with 
any greater certainty estey concluded 
he found evidence for some conclusions reached by the majority 
but none for the ultimate one about the cause he added in his 
review there is almost no evidence which supports any of the 
conclusions of the minority 
noting references throughout the report to possible terrorist 
involvement esteys review said surmise and speculation inside 
and outside these proceedings abound factual evidence does not 
nothing indicates any hope of uncovering explanations of this 
accident in those areas 
the federal government appointed estey in february to review the 
aviation safety boards investigation after criticism of its 
conclusions persisted 
kenneth thorneycroft the boards chairman and a supporter of 
the majority opinion said esteys review was very valid very 
forceful 
he said he still believed ice on the wings played a significant 
role in the disaster 
les filotas a board member who signed the minority report said 
circumstances still exist to be investigated outside the four 
corners examined by estey 
a labyrinth has many more than four corners he said its 
very unfortunate that its going to be closed off

one of two taiwanese vessels suspected of 
involvement in the sale of 13 million worth of illegal salmon 
rammed a us ship shadowing it in the north pacific a government 
spokesman said friday 
confirmation of the ramming which did little damage to either 
vessel came as the state department again asked taiwan for 
permission to board and inspect its two vessels 
taiwans refusal of an initial request touched off sharp 
congressional criticsm with some lawmakers demanding that the us 
board the vessels regardless of international repercussions and 
others suggesting an immediate embargo on taiwanese fisheries 
products 
brian gorman a spokesman for the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said that besides the ramming the 
tawianese vessel identified as the tong foong no 11 dropped a net 
in the water in an effort to foul the propeller of the 
following redfin 
the redfin a 180foot refrigeratered freighter that was 
chartered as part of a sixmonth sting operation continued to 
track the tong foong no 11 while the coast guard cutter morgenthau 
followed the other taiwanese vessel 
this is a very sticky situation both logistically and 
diplomatically gorman said of course we are disappointed they 
refused to allow us to board these guys are stealing our fish 
earlier this week federal agents arrested two taiwanese men as 
they emerged from a bank vault in seattle carrying suitcases 
containing more than 1 million in cash that they allegedly 
received as payment for 500 metric tons of illegally caught salmon 
the arrests marked the culmination of the sting operation 
mounted by several federal agencies 
at the same time the arrests were being made the redfin was 
rendezvousing with the taiwanese vessels north of midway island to 
complete the sting operation by receiving the illegally caught fish 
when the captains of the two taiwanese vessels boarded the 
redfin to arrange details of the transfer they were detained but 
their ships fled as the morgenthau approached 
before the vessels fled federal agents were able to obtain 40 
fish under the guise of inspecting them before the transaction was 
completed 
officials of the departments of commerce state justice and 
defense and the coast guard met friday to discuss taiwans initial 
refusal to allow boarding 
a second cable to the taiwanese was sent late in the day and 
congressional sources who asked to remain anonymous said it 
pointed out the possibility that trade sanctions might be imposed 
if taiwan refused to cooperate 
the incident is only the latest in a series that have involved 
the driftnet fleets of taiwan japan and south korea which us 
industry groups say have depleted salmon runs in the pacific 
northwest and alaska because of illegal fishing

soviet marshal sergei f akhromeyev in 
uniform complete with 11 rows of ribbons marched into the house 
armed services committee on friday and said the kremlin has cut 
production of tanks to 1700 this year 
he said that is a 40 percent reduction from previous years 
committee chairman les aspin dwis who initiated the soviet 
military advisers appearance called the tank figures encouraging 
and absolutely new 
akhromeyev telling congress what he thought about military 
subjects also said the united states could block all arms control 
progress if it refuses to negotiate cuts in the size of the us 
navy 
in addition he said that if washington goes ahead with a 
spacebased missile shield it wont make any sense for the 
superpowers to cut back on longrange missiles 
the appearance of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs top 
military adviser at the witness table was unprecedented on capitol 
hill 
in testimony often touched with flashes of humor akhromeyev 
used his opportunity to outline the soviet unions military posture 
and negotiating ideas 
he was asked by rep bob dornan rcalif if us intelligence 
estimates are correct when they peg soviet tank production at more 
than 4000 a year 
completely unrealistic akhromeyev said he said the correct 
figure is 1700 tanks in 1989 and that is a 40 percent cut from 
previous years 
he said tank production will be even lower next year 
the statistics are of interest to the nato alliance because 
tanks are involved in the offensive threat posed by soviet forces 
to western europe 
ask him about some other production figures aspin told 
dornan youve got him on a roll 
aspin said the defense intelligence agency had estimated soviet 
tank production at at least 4200 tanks 
akhromeyev said he had anticipated the tank question but had not 
bought other production figures but he said further figures might 
be forthcoming because everything is possible in the future 
akhromeyev repeatedly said the soviet union suspects the united 
states is interested in large cuts in conventional land forces in 
europe in order to gain overall military superiority over moscow by 
maintaining the size of its navy 
the kremlin fears he said that after such a conventional arms 
reduction agreement the united states would build up its naval 
forces without any constraints especially its carrier battle 
groups 
thus he said the united states would gain military 
superiority in order to dictate its will to the ussr from a 
position of strength 
he reported on soviet military spending and troop strength 
ticked off missile and warhead totals and when askd a question 
that he didnt want to answer said the soviet union and the united 
states both have secrets 
never has so highranking a soviet official appeared before a 
congressional committee said aspin who initiated the appearance 
akhromeyev was chief of the soviet general staff and his 
nations top military officer before retiring last year to become 
gorbachevs military adviser 
through the years we have seen many uniforms sit at that table 
but never one like yours aspin said looking at the soviet 
marshals olivebrown uniform jacket trimed with red 
on the wall behind akhromeyev were the flags of the american 
army navy air force and marine corps and the walls to his right 
and left bore the portraits of former chairmen of the committee 
if one or two of them look a little uncomfortable aspin 
said you will have to understand that these quickly changing 
times take some getting used to 
in his prepared statement read with the help of an interpreter 
akhromeyev spoke of what he called the unjust us refusal to 
negotiate 
if you follow this line no drastic reductions of the armed 
forces and armaments in the world will be possible he said 
offering a detailed accounting of soviet military spending 
akhromeyev got into a lively exchange with aspin on why us 
estimates and soviet figures differ 
the soviet adviser pegged his countrys military spending this 
year at 84 percent of the soviet gross national product or 773 
billion rubles saying the united states will spend 54 percent of 
its gnp for that purpose 
aspin said that even when the difference between dollars and 
rubles is accounted for us experts estimate soviet military 
spending at about twice that much 
akhromeyev had a ready explanation 
the thing is that in the soviet union in such sectors as raw 
materials the costs do not match the real prices that should be 
charged he said 
i do think that its very possible that when prices are 
restructured it may well be you come up with different figures 
he said 
we have to tell you the figures i have given you are real 
figures and they are genuine figures in terms of how we calculate 
prices today he added 
he said his country spent 7 billion on personnel pay this year 
compared with 78 billion for the united states the united 
states is more wealthy than the soviet union he said your 
generals and admirals can demand much higher pay 
rep g v montgomery dmiss asked with a grin whether 
akhromeyev was suggesting cutting the salaries of the american 
officers 
oh god forbid akhromeyev replied i dont want you to get 
me into a fight with american generals and admirals i just started 
becoming friends with them recently 
he was complimented on his sense of humor and replied humor 
is very dangerous for me

the environmental protection agency stopped 
work on a report about oil drilling damage in alaska just before a 
senate committee was to vote on opening the states arctic national 
wildlife refuge to drilling epa officials said friday 
sylvia lowrance director of epas solid waste office said she 
issued a stopwork order on the report about the damages wastes 
from drilling were causing to alaskas north slope because she 
found a preliminary draft poorly written and organized 
the report concluded that oil wastes seeping from drilling pads 
leaking chemical drums and overflowing waste disposal pits were 
seriously damaging the environment in the prudhoe bay area 
although it appeared to contain a good deal of information it 
was difficult to distinguish governmental views from those of other 
sources ms lowrance told the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials 
but the subcommittees chairman rep thomas a luken dohio 
alleged that epa may have suppressed the report because its 
disclosure to the public embarrassed the epa top brass who 
sympathized with the oil industry 
ms lowrance issued the stopwork order on the report on march 6 
a week before the senate energy and natural resources committee 
was to vote on opening up 15 million acres of the arctic national 
wildlife refuge to drilling 
located about 70 miles east of the prudhoe bay field now 
responsible for about 22 percent of the nations oil production 
the area is viewed by petroleum geologists as the last major 
untapped oil field in north america 
the senate panel in midmarch approved a phased program for oil 
and gas leasing in the refuge but the legislative effort quickly 
ground to a halt after the exxon valdez oil tanker spill on march 
24 
epa officials in ms lowrances office said they recommended on 
april 11 that work on the north slope report be resumed it was 
published in june 
both reports concluded there are problems with waste 
management on the north slope ms lowrance said 
but she said the second report cites specific cases of damages 
needed by government regulators to justify crafting any 
regulatory changes judged necessary those specifics were missing 
in the original draft she said 
other epa officials also noted that the second report put more 
emphasis on efforts by state officials in alaska to address the 
problem of hazardous wastes from oil drilling 
the north slope report is the first of nine commissioned by the 
epa to develop guidelines for state regulators on controlling 
wastes from oil and natural gas drilling 
the reports were commissioned after the agency declared last 
summer that drilling wastes do not fall into a hazardous 
category requiring regulation by the federal government 
congress in 1980 specifically exempted the oil gas and mining 
industries from federal hazardous waste regulation but ordered epa 
to study the issue with specific directions to weigh how much it 
would cost them if covered 
epa estimated the cost to the oil industry of meeting hazardous 
waste standards at 200 million to 500 million a year but said 
they could go much higher if drillers also had to pay for cleaning 
up past disposal sites

china said friday it will allow hong kong to 
remain capitalist after reverting to beijing rule in eight years 
only if its residents stop supporting the mainlands crushed 
democracy movement 
china also showed its determination to control its unruly 
student population by announcing a deep cut in the size of the 
nations college freshman class for the fall the cuts were largest 
at schools whose students played leading roles in seven weeks of 
protests for a freer society 
in other developments 
the beijing tourism administration ordered the citys hotels 
to cut employees salaries by up to 25 percent starting this month 
sources at several hotels said hotels have been nearly deserted 
since the crackdown frightened away most tourists 
leading dissident fang lizhi who is hiding in the us 
embassy has been expelled from his posts in the dialectics 
research society an official report said fang an astrophysicist 
worked in the beijing observatory but repeated phone calls to 
determine if he had been fired as well were unanswered 
eighteen employees of a chinafunded newspaper in hong kong 
announced their resignations to protest last saturdays firing of 
the publisher who criticized the crackdown in china the newspaper 
had long supported china but joined other hong kong publications in 
denouncing the crackdown 
hong kong residents have helped smuggle movement activists to 
the west and pledged money to help them oppose the chinese leaders 
who ordered soldiers to attack demonstrators in beijing on june 34 
but a commentary in the communist party newspaper the peoples 
daily accused hong kong activists of sabotaging the 
chinesebritish agreement that calls for the enclave to remain 
capitalist for at least 50 years after it reverts to mainland rule 
in 1997 
we will not allow people to use hong kong as a base for 
subverting the central peoples government it said 
not engaging in activities to overthrow the chinese 
government is a precondition for allowing hong kong to retain 
its capitalist system 
it added hong kong compatriots be vigilant do not allow any 
plot that would sabotage one country two systems to succeed 
hong kong residents already nervous by the mainland crackdown 
were unlikely to be reassured by the commentary which apparently 
was written by a highlevel official it was signed with an obvious 
pseudonym ai zhong two characters that sound the same as the 
words love china 
other major commentaries written under pseudonyms have appeared 
in recent days in a revival of the cultural revolution practice of 
top officials disguising their work 
the peoples daily essay received immediate wide publicity in 
hong kong where it led evening television newscasts 
the force of the wind tests the strength of the grass 
activist szeto wah one of those criticized by peoples daily told 
a news conference in hong kong this is the time to see how 
strong our backbone is 
allen lee a senior member of hong kongs legislative council 
said residents of the colony should not interfere in chinese 
affairs but that china also should get used to us that this is a 
free society 
martin lee who with szeto heads the newly formed hong kong 
alliance in support of the patriotic democratic movement in china 
said china was trying to frighten people from joining the group 
the alliance has pledged 156000 to help fugitives from the 
mainland the peoples daily accused it of seeking to overthrow the 
communist government 
szeto denied the charge saying he opposed chinas current 
leaders but not socialism he and martin lee are members of a joint 
hong kongchinese committee that is drafting a basic law to govern 
hong kong after 1997 
a second committee in charge of gathering public opinion on the 
draft resumed its work thursday after halting it following the june 
34 army attack despite appeals from hong kong for an extension in 
view of the crackdown china insists a final draft must be ready in 
january 
meanwhile chinas state education commission said it was 
cutting the size of the nations college freshman class from the 
planned 640000 to 610000 
it said reasons for the cut announced on staterun tv included 
problems in job placement and weak college management social 
science courses should be revised it said to be in accordance 
with the needs of building socialism and emphasis should be put 
on professional training instead of college education 
college admissions officials put it more bluntly saying the cut 
was ordered because of the student movement beijing university 
chinas most prestigious school and the center of the movement 
will have its freshman class cut from a planned 2100 to 600 
high school graduates took their college entry exams last week 
and results have yet to be announced

the transportation department retreated friday 
from a muchcriticized proposal to regulate anhydrous ammonia as a 
poisonous gas and offered a compromise to change only the labeling 
on tanks of the commonly used fertilizer 
agricultural groups and farmstate lawmakers opposed the 
departments original 1987 proposal to change the regulatory 
classification of anhydrous ammonia saying it would drive up 
prices of the nitrogen fertilizer for farmers by increasing 
shipping and insurance costs 
in the face of those objections the department unveiled a new 
proposal that would continue to classify anhydrous ammonia as a 
nonflammable gas but require tanks and other containers to 
carry an inhalation hazard label the new marking would be in 
addition to the nonflammable gas label currently required 
the original proposal would have required anhydrous ammonia to 
carry a warning placard of inhalation hazard and a white 
diamond sign with a skull and crossbones 
the agency will publish its latest proposal in the federal 
register next week and will open a 90day period for comment a 
final decision on the regulatory rulemaking would be made later 
although there is no deadline according to a department spokesman 
on capitol hill farmstate lawmakers applauded the departments 
compromise 
well live with this said rep pat roberts rkan who 
helped lead congressional opposition to the poisonous gas 
classification we finally got the message through and won a 
little victory 
farmers apply anhydrous ammonia directly to the soil with corn 
and wheat producers among the main farm users 
although there is no dispute that anhydrous ammonia can cause 
injury or even death if it is inhaled at high concentrations 
opponents of the regulatory change argued that the pronounced odor 
of the gas acts as a warning even at low concentrations and helps 
prevent undue exposure in the event of a leak or accident

from thailand and is forecast to import 12 million from all 
sources by the end of the year triple the amount imported in

about 100 us marines staged a mock 
invasion on a beach in this lake superior city on friday and eight 
protesters who entered the area were tackled and arrested 
officials said 
more than 1000 people watched as the marines taking part in an 
annual 21city military recruiting tour of the great lakes used 
amphibious tanks from the uss boulder to reach the beach on 
minnesota point 
the area is a narrow strip of land that separates duluth harbor 
and superior bay from lake superior 
police chief eli miletich said seven people were arrested when 
they broke through a 4foothigh fence as the amphibious vehicles 
were just a few yards from landing an eighth person was arrested 
about a halfhour before the marines landed after she went over 
police barriers he said 
all eight were to be charged with disorderly conduct miletich 
said 
police tackled most of the protesters who broke the barrier 
including an elderly man who tried to dodge police but was 
apprehended in the water as the crafts rode up 
there were no injuries reported 
on the beach the marines crawled forward and fired blanks 
toward the crowd many peace activists feigned death while some 
marine supporters cheered and yelled thank you marines 
at times the two factions of observers got into shouting 
matches 
laveryn mckeever of duluth whose husband served with the 
marines in korea and whose son died as a marine in vietnam said 
controversy over the mock invasion gave her incentive to greet the 
marines 
i vowed that these boys would be welcome she said 
i think its great said ann slaughter of duluth who wore a 
usmc cap it just makes your heart beat 10 times over 
peace activists gathered on the opposite side of the harbor

around midmorning about 100 peace activists began what they 
called a peace walk to a park near the harbor 
as part of its recruiting program the navy has docked a ship in 
duluth annually for years but this is the first time in a decade 
that it has brought the marines along for a mock invasion 
according to sgt stephen frank a marine spokesman in minneapolis 
in early june members of several religious and peace groups and 
city council president joyce benson got the navy to cancel the 
landing then a veterans of foreign wars member in st paul 
suggested dumping duluth from future vfw festivities 
duluth veterans then succeeded in getting the city council to 
ask the navy to stage the recruiting exercise and the navy accepted

the coast guard flight surgeon who first 
treated pilot thomas root said he found an infection in roots 
abdomen suggesting his bullet wound occurred hours before his 
plane crashed 
capt james rahman who accompanied rescuers sent to pluck the 
36yearold lawyer from bahamian waters following an 800mile 
flight down the east coast said the shooting could have occurred 
four to eight hours before the july 13 crash 
rahman based the opinion on the extent of peritonitis an 
infection that can be caused by a ruptured intestine 
root who claims he passed out at the controls and rode on 
autopilot for nearly four hours until the singleengine cessna ran 
out of fuel has not been able to explain how he received the 
bullet wound 
i do not believe that the peritonitis that i observed 
could have developed in less than two hours and most likely has 
been present for somewhat longer say four to eight hours rahman 
wrote in a report to the national transportation safety board 
which is investigating the incident 
root was treated for shock and blood loss by rahman but the 
bullet wound was not detected until he was transferred to memorial 
hospital in hollywood root was listed in satisfactory condition on 
friday 
root is expected to remain hospitalized for at least a week to 
undergo medical and psychological tests requested by his family 
said his brother todd root 
thomas root claims he blacked out about two hours after leaving 
washington national airport en route to rocky mount nc he 
theorizes that a 32caliber smith amp wesson revolver in the cabin 
fired when he crashed 
in miami safety board regional director jorge prellezo said 
investigators are reviewing radar data to account for every 
movement of roots plane from takeoff until his final radio 
transmission in which he reported trouble breathing 
prellezo said there are no plans to salvage the plane which 
sank in miledeep water 
meanwhile the us attorneys office in miami is reviewing 
reports on an fbi interrogation of root 
a source close to the investigation said it probably would 
examine whether root filed false information about his flight or is 
liable for search and rescue expenses 
todd root said his brother was distressed by reports of possible 
drug links 
members of a us drug enforcement administrationled task force 
collected information about root after an april 24 seizure at his 
airport hangar of a can of ether and about three dozen guns all 
but one legally registered no investigation was launched based on 
the facts gathered said dea spokesman mario perez

congress will decide the fate of a proposed 
170 million government guarantee for a loan to help colombia buy 
arms to fight drug traffickers the us exportimport bank said 
friday 
ann frey a press officer for the bank said the loan would be 
the first with the banks support the usual purpose of its loans 
and guarantees is to encourage the sale of us goods in other 
countries 
she said the proposal went to congress on wednesday if no 
objection is raised in 25 days it will go through automatically 
she added 
the banks announcement said that on july 13 the state 
department decided that the arms sought by colombia are primarily 
for use against narcotics and their sale would be in the interest 
of the united states 
the bank used to be barred from helping the sale of arms the 
antidrug abuse act passed last year lifted that ban on sales to 
third world countries this would be the first loan under the new 
law 
colombia is a major source of cocaine and marijuana used in this 
country guerrilla groups fighting the government sometimes ally 
themselves with the drug lords and sometimes oppose them the us 
law authorizes help to the sale of arms if they are to be used 
primarily against the narcotics trade 
a guarantee by the government bank would enable commercial banks 
to provide colombias ministry of defense with a lower interest 
rate to buy 200 million worth of helicopters river patrol boats 
aeronautical transport and communications equipment arms 
ammunition and other military items

the mclaughlin group does not need to 
provide equal time to political candidates whose opponents appear 
on the show in videotaped news clips the federal communications 
commission said friday 
the commission in a 30 vote upheld a decision by the fccs 
mass media bureau that the shows news reporting segments of 
candidates may qualify as newscasts and therefore are exempt from 
the equal opportunity requirements of the 1934 communications act 
oliver productions the shows producer asked in october 1988 
that the commission make such a ruling which follows earlier fcc 
decisions exempting interview shows such as the macneillehrer 
newshour and meet the press from the equal opportunity 
provision 
oliver attorney david liebowitz said were gratified with 
the ruling he said the shows use of clips may be unique and that 
the fccs decision may not apply to other newstalk shows 
on the mclaughlin group host john mclaughlin briefly 
introduces a news reporting segment that uses videotaped news 
clips of candidates oliver told the commission the clips are 
selected on the basis of their news value 
oliver said there was no intent to advance the candidacy of any 
particular individual 
the telecommunications research and action center a 
washingtonbased advocacy group argued that the bureau had 
misinterpreted the strictures of the communications act 
but the commission agreed with the bureaus conclusion that the 
news reporting segments satisfied all the criteria for the 
newscast exemption and therefore that the segments were exempt 
from the equal opportunity provisions of the act 
section 315 of the communications act says that if a broadcaster 
permits a legally qualified candidate for public office to use a 
stations facilities it must give equal opportunities to all other 
candidates for that office 
but congress in 1959 amended the act to exempt newscasts news 
interviews shows documentaries in which the candidates appearance 
is incidental to the subject being covered and onthespot news 
events

a state task force friday conditionally 
approved spending nearly 45 million on the university of utahs 
fledgling coldfusion research program 
the ninemember state fusionenergy council voted unanimously to 
give the university the money once a final linebyline review of 
the schools proposed fusion budget is completed 
once that is done probably in a week or so the proposal will 
go back to the full panel for final approval 
since march when university of utah chemist b stanley pons and 
british colleague martin fleischmann announced theyd achieved a 
sustained nuclear fusion reaction in a laboratory flask scientists 
have attempted to duplicate the experiment with mixed results 
a federal energy panel recommended july 12 against new 
government efforts to verify the research saying there was no 
convincing evidence of a new nuclear fusion process that would be a 
useful source of energy 
despite sharp criticism from the scientific community 
university officials steadfastly have defended the experiments to 
the council which is charged with deciding whether to disburse a 
5 million legislative appropriation toward further research 
as part of its twoyear budget request the university asked 
funding for research laboratory space recruitment of outside 
scientists administration and other costs said james brophy the 
schools vice president for research 
before the vote university president chase peterson urged the 
council to act quickly to keep utah from relinquishing its lead in 
the development of fusion as an energy source and to avoid losing 
potentially lucrative commercial contracts 
utah has an opportunity to become a leader in the nation 
in developing a new science concept he said 
fusion involves the combining of atoms as contrasted with 
fission or the splitting of atoms that is used to produce nuclear 
power 
pons and fleischmann have said their experiments have produced 
up to 150 times the energy put into them generating the excess 
heat that is considered key to fusions potential as an alternative 
energy source

texas oilman nelson bunker hunt blamed his 
bank creditors friday for forcing on him and his brothers a 
partnership to handle the repayment of his enormous silver debts a 
deal now at the heart of a 300 million dispute with the internal 
revenue service 
the irs contends the partnership was a sham 
hunt said the banks pretty much took over for a while and 
dictated his affairs after silver thursday the day in late march 
1980 when silver prices tumbled from a high of 50 an ounce to 10 
an ounce 
the net effect was we didnt have have control over our 
business thats why im sitting here in court because the 
structure the banks put us in hunt told us tax court judge 
jules g korner iii 
you ought to get the money from them hunt told government 
attorney deborah butler 
hunt is contesting 155 million in 1982 taxes the irs claims are 
due from the dissolution of the partnership he and his brothers set 
up after silver thursday to repay as much as 2 billion on their 
soured silver investments 
brother william herbert hunt is contesting more than 158 
million in 1982 taxes while lamar owner of the kansas city chiefs 
football team is contesting 505377 
bunker the first of the brothers to testify in the nonjury 
trial said he could not recall whether the partnership agreement 
between the brothers and the familys flagship firm placid oil 
co was five or 5000 pages long 
if it was 5000 pages i didnt read it in great detail he 
said i wont say i blindly signed it the deal was explained to 
me by the lawyers 
but he does remember walter fraker placids vice president and 
chief financial officer telling him that the banks were calling 
all the shots it was pretty much their party 
he also complained that elvis mason then chairman of the board 
and chief executive officer of what was then first national bank of 
dallas was carrying a heavy stroke he was very dictatorial in 
his actions with regard to the loan 
under a march 14 1980 federal reserve directive banks were 
not allowed to make loans on silver investments 
placid however was able to borrow 11 billion from a 
consortium of banks in a deal that mason helped broker placid 
kicked in 824 million of that loan into the partnership with the 
brothers the hunts in turn contributed their silver holdings 2 
billion tons of north dakota coal reserves gold stocks and other 
assets 
hunt said he thought the silver contributed to the partnersip 
was undervalued at 1405 an ounce but said that while he did the 
best he could i was not in a very strong position 
i felt it was an unfair deal i felt it was loaded in favor of 
placid to my detriment hunt said 
however hunt said his debts were ultimately repaid 
the irs contends the partnership was a sham and that the value 
of the coal was only about 16 million in 1980 compared with the 
hunts claim that it was worth 294 million when the partnership 
dissolved in 1982 the hunts said was worth 262 million the irs 
says it was only worth 67 million

the head of polish carmelite nuns said the entire 
nation opposes moving a convent from the edge of the wartime 
auschwitz death camp despite an agreement with jewish groups to do 
so a magazine reported friday 
in paris a jewish religious leader involved in negotiating the 
agreement more than two years ago said talks with roman catholic 
leaders about the convent would be suspended because he said 
promises had not been kept 
under an agreement signed in february 1987 the nuns were to be 
moved from their convent to an interfaith center to be built 
farther from the camp catholic authorities in poland say there has 
been a delay in constructing a new home for the nuns 
in warsaw the official polish news agency pap said friday that 
work would begin next year on a convent more than onethird of a 
mile from the camp 
the rev dominik wider provincial superior of the carmelites 
said building a new convent might take eight years 
he said in a interview with the catholic monthly 30 giorni 30 
days that his order had accepted the church decision to move the 
convent but it is evident that whoever wants to move the nuns 
must construct another convent adequate for the needs of their 
life 
in poland wider said such a project could take around eight 
years 
the idea of transferring the nuns from the cloistered convent 
of auschwitz faces the opposition of the entire polish society 
which is convinced that the convent doesnt harm anyone and that it 
is in the correct place it is outside the walls of the camp but at 
the same time borders it he said 
the magazine which is to publish the interview in its next 
issue released excerpts friday 
jews consider locating the convent at the former nazi 
concentration camp an intrusion of christian symbols on a site 
where an estimated 25 million jews were put to death 
last week workers beat an american rabbi and six students who 
protested on the ground of the convent where 14 carmelite nuns 
live 
theo klein former president of the representative council of 
jewish institutions of france told reporters in paris he had 
notified cardinal albert decourtray head of the french conference 
of bishops of the decision to cease talks on the convent 
in the letter klein said he considered it impossible to 
pursue the judeocatholic dialogue at the desirable level while 
the concrete facts with which we are confronted are in such 
contradiction with the words 
klein and decourtray played leading roles in negotiating the 
agreement to move the nuns 
church leaders have said the delay was due to difficulties in 
buying land and arranging for construction decourtray issued a 
statement friday apologizing for the delay and saying the church 
remained committed to moving the convent as soon as possible 
in its report friday pap said the first part of the land had 
been bought in early july so that having submitted plans and 
having received permission work can start in the beginning of next 
year

a federal judge ruled friday that a midshipman 
who resigned from us naval academy after acknowledging his 
homosexuality can sue to challenge the schools policy of forcing 
such people out of the academy 
us district judge oliver gasch rejected the defense 
departments attempt to have the suit by joseph c steffan thrown 
out of court 
steffan of warren minn resigned from the academy in march 
1987 six weeks before he was scheduled to graduate he had been 
the subject of an investigation of his alleged homosexuality 
he told academy officials that he was a homosexual and was told 
that service officials would seek his dismissal instead he 
resigned 
steffan is seeking to be readmitted to the naval academy in 
annapolis md his suit seeks to have declared unconstitutional the 
academys regulations barring homosexuals 
gaschs order offered no opinion on the merits of steffans case 
the navy had sought an order from gasch throwing the case out of 
court because the service claimed steffan had voluntarily resigned 
and also had not exhausted all his administrative remedies 
but gasch said the resignation was not truly voluntary because 
steffan resigned in the face of pressure from academy officials 
sandra lowe steffans attorney said i am delighted with the 
ruling because it means we can now argue the case on its merits 
navy officials asked for comment did not immediately return 
telephone calls

the civil rights movement risks losing its 
cordial relationship with attorney general dick thornburgh by 
opposing william lucass nomination to head the justice 
departments antidiscrimination unit the agencys chief spokesman 
said friday 
thornburghs spokesman david runkel also charged that rep 
john conyers dmich buckled under the pressure of civil rights 
lobbyists when he withdrew his endorsement of lucas to be assistant 
attorney general for civil rights 
the pressure on mr conyers from the civil rights community 
was enormous runkel said a day after conyers announced he no 
longer supported lucas a 61yearold black republican from 
michigan 
not so said a conyers spokesman who told a reporter his boss 
had made his decision in the loneliness of his own conscience 
despite the loss of a key lucas supporter and the prospect of a 
close vote on the judiciary committee runkel said i feel 
comfortable we have the votes to get the guy confirmed 
asked if winning a possibly tough senate fight was worth the 
political bloodshed runkel said 
i think you should address it to the civil rights groups they 
are the ones who have the most to lose 
they have stated their views what they have to lose it seems 
to me is a cordial relationship with the attorney general and with 
the head of the civil rights division runkel said when asked if 
his statement could be interpreted as a threat to lucas opponents 
the white house continued to express its support for lucas 
we think hes an excellent candidate said presidential 
press secretary marlin fitzwater 
thornburgh vacationing in new england said in a statement 
issued by his office that during his testimony bill lucas ably 
demonstated his ability to serve as assistant attorney general in 
charge of the civil rights division 
in keeping with president bushs commitment in this area mr 
lucas pledged to serve as the administrations lead official in the 
close monitoring of the impact of recent supreme court decisions on 
civil rights 
thornburgh said lucas accurately reflected my views when he 
said he would lead the charge in seeking legislative changes if 
these cases do in fact hamper effective civil rights 
enforcement 
the vote on lucas nomination in the judiciary committee is 
expected to be very close and along party lines democrats have an 
86 margin on the panel which has not scheduled a vote on the 
nomination 
the committees chairman sen joseph r biden jr ddel said 
thursday he is inclined to vote against lucas after hearing his 
testimony 
lucas defense of a series of supreme court decisions that civil 
rights activists say will make it harder to win discrimination 
suits prompted conyers to return to the judiciary committee on 
thursday to withdraw his support 
runkel said the pressure on conyers to change his position 
began in the hallway outside the hearing room after the 
michigan congressman had urged lucas confirmation on wednesday 
conyers who had introduced lucas as someone deeply committed 
to the vigorous enforcement of the civil rights laws returned to 
the committee thursday and said he was frankly astounded by 
lucas defense of the recent supreme court decisions 
lucas views on the civil rights policy were well known to 
conyers runkel said adding that nobody could expect an 
administration nominee to depart from president bushs policies 
but a spokesman for conyers michael hill said that lucas in 
his discussions with conyers in the months before the hearing 
had never expressed to the congressmen that he thought those 
decisions were sound 
a contention that mr conyers was under intensive or enormous 
pressure from the civil rights community following his testimony is 
just not true hill said that was a decision mr conyers made 
in the loneliness of his own conscience without any pressure from 
anyone 
lucas echoing thornburgh had promised to closely monitor the 
impact of the supreme court decisions on pending discrimination 
cases and press for legislative changes if those rulings hurt the 
cause of civil rights 
the defection of conyers has buoyed lucas opponents 
i think the nomination is in serious trouble based on the 
momentum of the last 48 hours said ralph g neas executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights a coalition 
of groups opposing the nomination

united mine workers presented a proposal 
friday to resolve its 3monthold strike against pittston coal 
group inc but no agreement was reached and the two sides decided 
to recess 
it appears there is nothing new in it pittston spokeswoman 
susan copeland said friday the company will respond to the 
proposal next week she said 
each side said the other asked for a recess until tuesday 
its really frustrating said bruce bratten administrative 
assistant to umw vice president cecil roberts we came in here 
and stated we were willing to stay and continue this on its hard 
to come to an agreement when you cant get someone to sit at a 
table across from you 
a fourperson negotiating team from the union and pittston vice 
president joe farrell spent the day meeting in separate rooms and 
federal mediators shuttled proposals back and forth negotiations 
began about 1030 am and were recessed just after 3 pm bratten 
said 
the union presented two proposals bratten said one was a 
formal request that the two sides meet face to face 
the other proposal would address pittstons need for miners to 
work sundays if pittston would consider the miners need for job 
security bratten said he refused to go into specifics 
i dont know how long this is going to take bratten said 
were not that encouraged by their good faith and sincerity in 
trying to resolve it 
the union also wants assurances from pittston that if new mines 
are opened the jobs will go to some of the approximately 4000 
pittston employees who have been laid off he said 
the umw was disappointed that paul douglas pittstons chairman 
was not at fridays negotiations bratten said while umw president 
richard trumka was not in the meeting room he was present at the 
hotel bratten said 
i dont think anyone expected anything to come out of this to 
begin with said bo givens a umw representative for district 28 
most of the guys you talk to say pittston only went to the table 
because of us district judge glen m williams order to 
resume negotiations 
in his letter last week to trumka and douglas williams 
challenged the two sides to show up 
meantime state police said friday that a state trooper fired in 
selfdefense at a group of people throwing rocks state police 
spokesman charles vaughan said none of the alleged rock throwers 
was hurt in thurdsays incident that occurred while the cruiser 
was following several coal trucks 
authorities said 42 people were charged with conspiracy to 
commit a felony and were released on 5000 bond friday 
by the time state trooper cl helmer fired the shot trooper 
dw wyatt had already been hit a number of times and sustained a 
number of cuts and bruises on his arm vaughan said firing a 
shot is acceptable if you feel your life is in danger vaughan 
said 
of the 42 people charged 39 were from ohio two were from west 
virginia and one was from virginia vaughan said he did not know 
whether they were striking miners he said 
the union has charged that pittston hasnt bargained in good 
faith and the companys proposals would undermine umw members job 
security and hopes of future coal employment

keeping elizabeth morgan behind bars wont 
persuade her to tell where her child is a senator testified 
friday arguing for legislation that would free the woman who has 
been in jail nearly two years in a child custody case 
sen orin hatch rutah is sponsoring a bill that would set a 
12month limit on civil contempt of court jailings in child custody 
cases in the district of columbia 
the bill would apply retroactively to morgan a plastic surgeon 
imprisoned by a judge without a trial in august 1987 after failing 
to produce her daughter for courtordered visits with the girls 
father 
dr morgan has now served almost two years in jail hatch 
told a senate governmental affairs subcommittee that has 
jurisdiction over district matters my answer to that is enough 
is enough 
morgan has alleged that dr eric foretich her exhusband and 
the girls father had sexually abused sevenyearold hilary 
foretich has repeatedly denied that 
the case has become a rallying point for womens rights and 
antichild abuse groups while foretich has received support from a 
number of mens organizations 
my bill takes no position on the merits of the morgan case 
but i believe in child custody cases the contempt power can be 
abused hatch told the committees general services federalism 
and the district of columbia panel were not talking about 
hardened criminals here 
hatchs bill is drawn more narrowly than a similar measure 
passed recently by the house which applies to all civil contempt 
jailings 
in both cases after a year a prosecutor would either bring a 
criminal contempt charge requiring a trial or the person would go 
free 
a spokesman for rep frank wolf author of the house bill said 
wolf was willing to compromise on certain issues including 
restricting the legislation to child custody cases 
a dc court of appeals panel is reviewing superior court judge 
herbert dixons mostrecent decision to keep morgan behind bars 
until she divulges the whereabouts of her daughter

public schools should be forced to compete in 
a free markettype system with losers closing down and winners 
taking over their facilities teachers union leader albert shanker 
said friday 
shanker president of the 710000member american federation of 
teachers laid out his vision in a speech to 3000 aft members 
attending a conference on education reform 
he depicted a competitive model in which teachers play a large 
role in running schools as the only alternative to a host of 
options even less attractive to teachers among them tuition tax 
credits and state and private takeovers of weak schools such as 
boston universitys oversight of the chelsea mass district 
we do not have a choice of keeping what we have now shanker 
said were either going to jump while we feel the water getting 
warm or were going to end up getting boiled 
shanker proposed a highstakes national education competition 
with substantial financial rewards for schools and teachers that 
make marked improvements and shutdowns of schools that cant do the 
job 
integral to the plan would be incentives flexibility 
accountability federal assessments parental freedom to choose 
their childs school and a transfer of money from administrative to 
instructional functions 
shanker suggested that president bush invest 500 million for 
five years to earn interest then offer the money to teachers at 
the schools that have made the most progress 
the goal is to make each school a team trying to bring about 
the maximum possible improvement shanker said he said winners 
would include the same percentage of schools from every level of 
achievement so weaker schools wouldnt have to compete against top 
schools 
shanker also said bush should create an assessment board to 
determine whether students at a school could read a decent book 
write something worthwhile solve a math problem or engage in 
discussion of an important national issue 
bush and education secretary lauro cavazos have been promoting 
competition in education saying it can be achieved by letting 
parents choose their childrens public schools cavazos has said 
repeatedly that bad schools should close down if they cant do the 
job 
but neither has gone as far as shanker who on friday compared 
the current system to the soviet unions planned topdown economy 
any competitive plan would have to be ratified by the local 
union and board of education shanker said and theres no point 
in doing it if the same rules and regulations are in effect you 
have to set the schools free to do it their own way 
ideally this should also have losers shanker added with 
schools that fail shut down and turned over to more successful 
schools 
shanker also proposed a national certificate for students who 
want recognition for academic excellence saying it would help 
educators determine national guidelines for what students ought to 
know in various subject areas 
and he said he will urge employers to consider courses grades 
attendance and teacher recommendations rather than a simple diploma 
when they hire kids out of high school 
we should have a system in which every student who is not 
bound for college knows that his effort habits of work and actual 
accomplishments in school will mean the difference between being 
the first or last to get the job and getting a job that pays 
more and leads to something shanker said 
shanker predicted that if the administration does not entirely 
embrace his competitive plan there will be members of congress 
private foundations school districts governors and businesses who 
will pick up on it 
i very strongly believe that in one form or another in one 
place or another this is going to happen he said

a federal appeals court friday upheld a 
preliminary injunction that bars the government from excluding a 
palestinian man from the united states 
ruling in the case of fouad rafeedie of cleveland the appeals 
court said that us district court judge joyce green must decide 
whether immigration procedures the us government is using against 
rafeedie violate his right to due process under the constitution 
in its 21 ruling the appeals panel said immigration officials 
may proceed against rafeedie under another provision of federal 
law which allows him to be represented by legal counsel to 
present evidence and to challenge witnesses in an open 
administrative hearing 
rafeedie a permanent resident alien who has lived outside 
cleveland for 13 years traveled to syria in 1986 attending the 
meeting of an organization affiliated with the popular front for 
the liberation of palestine a terrorist group immigration 
officials say 
rafeedie who denies he was affiliated with the group was 
questioned by the fbi on his return and in 1987 was charged with 
being excludable from the united states under immigration laws 
the immigration and naturalization service then attempted to 
expel him under the summary exclusion provision of the 
mccarranwalter act 
under that provision the ins gave rafeedie no indication of the 
nature of confidential information on which it sought to exclude 
him and rafeedie isnt entitled to a hearing 
rafeedies lawyer david cole of the center for constitutional 
rights said he is confident the us district court will find that 
the procedure violates due process

the us army friday conducted 
exercises that included parking armored vehicles and deploying 
troops in combat gear in front of gen manuel antonio noriegas 
office 
us officials said they were testing plans for evacuating 
military units and americans living in panama about 600 soldiers 
were involved in the fivehour exercise at fort amador and fort 
clayton near panama city at the southern entrance to the panama 
canal 
noriegas government was not informed of the exercise 
beforehand and it was not known if he was in the office at the 
time 
the us southern command said in a statement that the exercise 
called purple storm was intended to demonstrate its commitment 
to protect us lives and resolve in enforcing us forces 
treaty rights 
under the 1977 treaties the panama canal will be given to 
panama at the end of 1999 but us forces will be in charge of the 
canals defense 
the united states has troop movement rights and us officials 
have said they would exercise them to pressure noriega panamas de 
facto leader to step down as head of the nations defense forces 
on thursday the organization of american states approved a 
resolution calling for a transfer of power on sept 1 to restore 
democracy and subsequent elections 
the opposition which appeared to have won the may 7 
presidential election criticized the resolution saying it 
effectively endorsed the governments annulment of the balloting 
one of the drills at fort amador was carried out around 
noriegas office with us helicopters hovering overhead armored 
vehicles parked around the building and us troops in combat gear 
were deployed 
fort amador includes panamanian military installations a us

panamanian military policeman tried to continue directing traffic 
even though he was hampered by two personnel carriers 
relations between the united states and panama have been tense 
since a federal grand jury in florida indicted noriega on drug 
trafficking in feburary 1988 
the united states since has frozen millions of dollars worth of 
panamanian assets in us banks and embargoed payments from panama 
canal tolls the measures have plunged the nation into an economic 
crisis but have failed to budge noriega

the senate voted to make it easier for soviet 
jews and evangelical christians as well as ukrainians and 
vietnamese to enter the united states as refugees 
sen frank lautenberg dnj who authored the measure said it 
would relieve the backup of more than 4000 soviet refugees who 
were stranded in rome after they were denied entry to the united 
states 
the senate passed the measure thursday night as an amendment to 
a state department authorization bill 
lautenberg said the amendment would reduce the standard of proof 
required of some foreigners seeking to enter the country on grounds 
of persecution 
at the direction of former attorney general edwin meese iii the 
immigration and naturalization service last year began considering 
each refugee application on a casebycase basis the ins revoked 
old rules that had assumed applicants from certain countries were 
persecuted 
under the meese directive the onus was on applicants to prove 
they had a well grounded fear of persecution but meese did not 
specify how this fear could be proven 
lautenbergs bill sets criteria to determine eligibility among 
the criteria the applicant may try to show he or she was denied 
employment entry into educational institutions or prohibited from 
studying or practicing religion 
it doesnt make sense to ignore the historic and continuing 
pattern of persecution faced by most soviet jews evangelical 
christians ukrainians and vietnamese lautenberg said the 
very fact that someone belongs to one of these groups means that 
they have a very real fear of persecution 
the united states should continue to be a safe haven for those 
who are persecuted by their governments for their race religion or 
political beliefs he said 
lautenberg said a study by the congressional general accounting 
office found that denial rates for soviet jews increased from 7 
percent in 1988 to about 38 percent in march and 21 percent in june 
under the changed policy 
the new jersey senators amendment would establish a special 
category for those refugees for 1989 and 1990 and would allow 
reapplication for some of those denied admission since aug 15 
1988 
according to lautenberg aides the bush administration opposes 
house legislation that restores the entitlement to apply based on 
the presumption of persecution however it backs the senate 
compromise fashioned with cooperation from the state department 
aides said

the bush administration in a move to promote 
selfsufficiency for the disabled on friday proposed increasing by 
twothirds the amount a person can earn and still receive federal 
disability benefits 
the change proposed by the department of health and human 
services would take effect in january 1990 
federal programs should not perpetuate dependency said a 
statement issued by president bushs press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
the change would provide an incentive for the 52 million 
workers on the disability rolls to take significant steps toward 
work and economic independence fitzwater said 
the regulation would increase from 300 to 500 per month the 
amount that could be earned by individuals receiving social 
security disability insurance or supplemental security income ssi 
benefits and who are not blind 
the allowed earnings level for blind beneficiaries is set by law 
and is now 740 per month this would not be changed by the 
regulation 
the proposed regulation also would change the trigger for the 
trial work period during which a disability insurance 
recipient continues to receive benefits after returning to work 
currently a recipient enters a trial work period when he earns 
more than 75 per month or works more than 15 hours per week that 
would increase under the regulation to 200 or 40 hours 
an ssi recipients benefits are reduced by 1 for every 2 in 
earnings over 65 per month when the recipients earnings reach 
the current 300 per month substantial gainful activity level 
benefits can continue under certain circumstances under the 
proposed regulation benefits would continue at least until the 
recipients earnings reached 500 per month 
the administration said the change would allow up to 71000 
people to retain or regain benefits under the two programs the 
cost in fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 would be 60 million 
with the cost rising to 197 million in fiscal 1994 
about 3 million blind and disabled workers receive ssi benefits 
the disability insurance program pays benefits to 283 million 
workers and 124 million spouses and children of disabled workers

hemingway and one of hemingways close friends 
yes i think he would be here for all thats been said about 
his feelings for oak park hotchner said it is deeply

a black priest suspended by the roman catholic 
church for starting a breakaway black congregation said friday that 
a major churchrun university has discriminated against blacks 
the rev george a stallings jr said in a statement that there 
are only 20 blacks enrolling as freshmen at washingtons catholic 
university of america next fall in all about 1000 students are 
expected to begin studies there 
stallings also criticized the university for the meager 
representation of 10 blacks among its faculty of about 350 and 
said it lacked courses on black literature music or religion 
such facts not only demonstrate a record of blatant exclusion 
they are a clear example of intellectual dishonesty of the most 
decided kind stallings said 
the university is under the aegis of the archdiocese of 
washington 
stallings 41 was suspended by the archdiocese after he said 
mass in defiance of cardinal james a hickey on july 2 
stallings has said the catholic church has failed its nearly two 
million black parishioners and has charged the church with racism 
catholic university said it is an equal opportunity employer and 
has established special scholarships for minority students 
we are making serious efforts to recruit black faculty members 
and students but as everyone knows applicants with appropriate 
credentials are limited and in great demand by all institutions 
the universitys public affairs office said in a statement 
the university did not dispute stallings figures for black 
students or faculty members 
stallings statement was part of a letter he sent friday to 
bishop john ricard of baltimore ricard was one of the signers of a 
call for unity issued by the nations 13 black bishops a week ago 
the black bishops statement said in part we sincerely hope 
stallings followers are not commingling personal dissapointment 
individually felt frustrations and personal anger under the banner 
of racism racism is a sin which the church must address it is too 
serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish concerns 
stallings responded 
the glaring fact that you seem to ignore is that what 
disappointment or discouragement we feel is due to the reality of 
racism and even more importantly is the result of the churchs 
apparent inability or unwillingness to take radical steps to 
transform an otherwise racist institution into a church that is 
truly inclusive and universal 
stallings maintained that his fourweekold imani temple is not 
separate from the catholic church 
i did not depart from the church nor its mission or mandates 
rather the church abandoned its zeal and energies in the pursuit 
of justice and the transformation of our society stallings wrote 
ricard was out of town and had not seen stallings letter a 
spokeswoman for ricard said

somalias armed forces rounded up 
thousands of people and summarily executed 46 men following moslem 
rioting that left 400 dead a human rights group and independent 
sources said friday 
the government said the reports were sensational propaganda and 
lies 
the human rights group africa watch and other sources said the 
violence occurred july 14 in mogadishu the capital of the east 
african nation following the slaying of a roman catholic bishop 
and the arrests of moslem religious leaders 
africa watch and the sources put the number killed during the 
rioting at about 400 after soldiers opened fire on houses in 
residential districts 
more than 1000 people were injured but many were afraid to go 
to the hospital for fear of arrest said the human rights group in 
a statement released in nairobi the group has offices in 
washington and london 
throughout the evening of the riots and the following night 
witnesses said soldiers went from house to house arresting men 
raping women and looting africa watch said about 2000 people were 
arrested during the searches 
fortysix people arrested two days after the riots were accused 
in military courts of having participated in the violence found 
guilty and taken to a beach outside mogadishu where they were shot 
to death said africa watch 
the government has said 23 people died and 59 were injured in 
violence it blamed on troublemakers 
in washington the state department said it was concerned about 
what it termed credible reports of executions in somalia 
we are very disturbed by these reports said spokesman 
richard boucher we are directing our embassy in mogadishu to 
raise our concern with the somali government and ask it to act to 
ensure that civil liberties and human rights are fully protected 
in september the human rights group amnesty international said 
the government of autocratic president mohamed siad barre executed 
up to 1000 civilians while trying to end an insurgency in the 
north in response the us congress froze 55 million in aid to 
the impoverished nation 
the government has forbidden journalists from visiting somalia 
since heavy fighting broke out between government forces and the 
northern rebel somali national movement in 1988 telecommunications 
with the country are difficult 
the somali embassy in washington relayed a statement issued by 
the foreign ministry in mogadishu that said 
after last weeks events in mogadishu enemies of the somali 
people and their collaborators have been disseminating sensational 
propaganda lies about the true situation in somalia the sources 
of such malicious disinformation are terrorist groups whose 
ultinmate motive is to spread chaos throughout the country 
the ministry of foreign affairs of the somali democratic 
republic wishes to state categorically that the situation in 
mogadishu is normal and in the country as a whole 
independent sources who would not be identified for fear of 
government reprisals corroborated much of the human rights groups 
report including the executions 
the july 14 violence broke out after the arrests the previous 
day of four moslem leaders and an unspecified number of civilians 
according to the sources and africa watch 
armed detachments surrounded mogadishus mosques in anticipation 
of protests and used physical and verbal abuse to disperse 
worshipers as they left the sources and africa watch said 
soldiers then opened fire on the worshipers who fought back 
primarily with rocks and stones in at least one neighborhood of 
western mogadishu worshipers outnumbered security forces seized 
their weapons and returned fire according to africa watch 
the army moved into the city with tanks and took over all major 
government buildings and crossroads and closed all roads from 
mogadishu according to africa watch 
in addition to the arrests of the moslem leaders the violence 
appeared linked to the july 9 slaying of mogadishus roman catholic 
bishop salvatore colombo an italian who had lived in somalia for 
more than 40 years according to africa watch 
the government said colombo was shot by a lone gunman africa 
watch said there was widespread suspicion in mogadishu that colombo 
was killed by government forces who suspected him of passing 
information about human rights abuses to foreign governments 
moslem leaders are said to have been angry that the government 
offered a 13000 reward for information about colombos slaying 
but showed little concern for the welfare of its own people said 
africa watch 
some residents who reported a recent upsurge in antichristian 
and antiwhite feeling in the capital said colombo was suspected 
of trying to convert moslem youth 
scattered incidents of gunfire were reported in mogadishu since 
the riots a dusktodawn curfew ordered after the clashes was 
eased thursday to 9 pm to 5 am 
somalia is populated by an estimated 6 million members of the 
somali tribe which is composed of about half a dozen clans 
islam is the state religion in the impoverished pastoral nation 
which is on the horn of africa and juts into the indian ocean to 
the south and the gulf of aden to the north there are about 2000 
roman catholics in the nation 
barre has ruled somalia as a oneparty state since 1969 the 
country was once allied with the soviet union but switched 
allegiance to the west in 1977

the city will hire 350 specialists to teach 
handicapped students in a plan that settles a fouryear dispute 
between the school board and the us department of education it 
was announced friday 
this settlement brings to an end what can only be described as 
the shameful and disgraceful mistreatment of those children who are 
most vulnerable and in need of special care james w compton 
president of the chicago board of education said at a news 
conference where he was surrounded by 20 handicapped students 
the plan calls for the board to shift money and employees from 
central and district offices to local schools said compton who 
was appointed in a school board shakeup when mayor richard m 
daley took office the plan also creates a new post interim 
associate superintendent to oversee the services to handicapped 
students 
in the course of the dispute the school board was threatened 
with the loss of more than 100 million in annual federal aid and 
4 million in funds for magnetschools which have smaller more 
intensive classes 
the school board allocated 44 million of its 3659 million 
specialeducation budget for the settlement officials said 
donald moore executive director of designs for change a 
chicago childadvocacy organization called the plan one of the 
most significant settlements of its kind in a decade 
we think it is excellent he said it is cutting a lot of 
central office positions and putting that money in the local 
schools where it is needed 
the dispute arose in 1984 when the federal agency investigated 
the delivery of services to handicapped students by the chicago 
public schools 
the 15month probe found that the school system by failing to 
evaluate and place handicapped children promptly was in violation 
of the rehabilitation act of 1973 
the law requires that students believed to have mental 
emotional or physical disabilities be tested and evaluated within 
60 days and if warranted placed in specialeducation programs 
about 3500 chicago students have not been not evaluated a 
backlog dating to 1983 school officials said friday there are 
about 41000 handicapped students in the system which has about 
410000 students 
last august an administrative law judge upheld the governments 
finding and ordered that federal money be withheld from chicago 
schools if the system was not brought into compliance 
moore said the dispute hurt a number of handicapped students 
he said hundreds of parents of handicapped students have come to 
his agency seeking help for children who had not received proper 
placement 
when the handicapped child is sitting in a regular classroom 
and not receiving proper care they tend to deteriorate he said 
plans call for the hiring of additional teachers psychologists 
social workers and counselors 
compton said the school systems special education structure 
would be completely reorganized by the start of the fall semester

comment when reached earlier 
bloch a 30yearcareer employee has been placed on leave his

prime minister herbert blaize on 
friday said he was starting his own political party confronting 
the caribbean island nation with its worst political crisis since 
the 1983 usled invasion 
in a halfhour speech broadcast by state radio and television 
blaize said he broke with the governing new national party that put 
him in power and announced the formation of his own national party 
to continue to sail the ship of state along the road of 
progress 
blaize touched off a crisis thursday by firing james mitchell 
political leader of the new national party from his post as works 
and communications minister 
the two leaders had been at odds since a party convention in 
january when delegates ousted the ailing blaize 71 as the partys 
political leader and elected mitchell to replace him 
the prime minister never acceped being beaten at the 
convention so i have been dismissed for that action mitchell 
said friday 
mitchell said he was fired also because he refused to dismiss 
from the party two executive members who had been supporters of the 
marxist peoples revolutionary government which came to power in 
1979 and was ousted by the usled invasion in october 1983 
blaize has strongly opposed mitchells campaign since january to 
enlist grenadians including members of the former marxist 
government into a broad coalition called the new thrust 
blaize said in his speech that with mitchells new thrust 
campaign we are likely to orbit once more in the 19791983 
period of instability 
we refuse to be part of it he said 
marxist prime minister maurice bishop was killed by hardline 
members of his government provoking the invasion 
mitchell said his ouster as works and communications minister 
has created an atmosphere of terror among government workers 
fearing for their jobs 
it makes me wonder whether this is not a deliberate setup to 
put in train a process for instability and possible violence in the 
country and at the same time claim that other people are doing 
it mitchell said 
the developments have caused confusion and consternation in this 
island of 100000 
blaize had a 96 majority in parliament his dispute with 
mitchell left him with eight seats 
parliament majority members are cabinet ministers so they are 
bound more to the prime minister than to the governing party the 
remaining eight members likely would rally to blaizes new party 
mitchell said he favored calling elections immediately 
elections are due by december 
the country under the present circumstances is not in 
health he said 
as the governing partys political leader mitchell would become 
prime minister if the party wins the elections 
blaize was elected to office in 1984

col moammar gadhafi of libya and president 
hissene habre of chad who have been enemies for years met to 
settle their border dispute friday but the talks broke off without 
an agreement 
the presidents of four other african nations who had been 
mediating the talks left the meeting without comment 
gadhafi and habri also declined to comment to reporters who had 
been waiting in a room decorated with banners honoring the expected 
bamako declaration 
it was not immediately known whether more talks would take place 
the negotiations began on thursday and marked the first meeting 
between gadhafi and habre in seven years 
officials of two of the observer nations initially told 
reporters friday that the signing of the agreement was assured by 
late evening however when the talks continued beyong schedule it 
became clear obstacles had developed 
the sources said habre objected to several points in the 
proposed agreement including a section calling for immediate 
return of war prisoners he also demanded a change of language to 
remove any ambiguity about plans for the international court of 
justice to settle the question of the aouzou border region the 
sources said 
habre was under pressure to accept the agreement without 
changes one official said because it may be difficult to get 
gadhafi to return to a meeting like this again the officials 
delegation is generally favorable to chads position in the 
conflict 
gadhafi habre and the presidents of gabon algeria and mali 
went into a small room friday afternoon tightly guarded by 
soldiers gen ibraham babangida the nigerian president joined 
them later 
under the proposed agreement as drafted by officials of mali 
and algeria chad and libya would try to settle the aouzou border 
issue by political means meaning negotiations within the 
organization of african unity and take it to the international 
court of justice if those attempts failed 
it also calls for a treaty of friendship a pledge by each not 
to attack the other and creation of an oau observer force to 
stabilize a yearold truce 
all prisoners would be repatriated chad is said to hold at 
least 2000 libyans but libya says it has returned all captured 
chadians 
habre has consistently refused to return the prisoners until the

antigovernment groups in chad libyas southern neighbor they 
included habres own faction when he was a guerrilla leader 
after a libyan invasion government troops and allied french 
soldiers drove libyan forces out in 1987 france the colonial 
power until independence in 1960 has about 1500 soldiers in chad 
to support habre 
libya has kept its foothold in the aouzou strip the 
45600squaremile border area thought to be rich in uranium has 
been in dispute for decades 
last month habre accused libya of preparing an attack from 
sudan chads eastern neighbor with chadian dissidents sudan and 
libya denied the charges

president bush formally proposed 
antipollution legislation friday to make clean air the 
birthright of every american critics complained that bush was 
not living up his vow to be the environmental president 
officially signing off on the bill in a rose garden ceremony 
bush said that if approved this piece of legislation will see 
to it that every american in every city in america will breathe 
clean air 
it will stop the degredation thats been caused by acid rain 
by the end of this century and it will cut airborne toxic chemicals 
from major sources by at least 75 percent 
the bill if approved by congress would 
require reductions in emissions that cause acid rain 
set deadlines for cities to comply with ozonereduction 
standards through such measures as the use of alternative fuels 
tighten tailpipe emission standards for cars 
create a regulatory system to crack down on industrial sources 
of airborne toxic chemicals 
but environmental activists congressional critics and even a 
sponsor of the presidents own package said it was not enough 
critics contended that in some areas the proposal would actually 
weaken existing laws 
sen john chafee of rhode island the ranking republican on the 
senate environment committee and the legislator who will sponsor 
the senate version of bushs bill told reporters we dont agree 
with all of it 
chafee said he will push to tighten auto emission standards in 
the bill and would be astounded if a clean air bill could pass by 
years end 
but as environmental groups and members of congress rushed to 
criticize various sections of the package chafee also said such 
comments were unjustified 
sure it doesnt do everything they want but who in this town 
gets everything they want he asked 
for their part the big three auto companies all said they 
thought it would be difficult to meet the requirements of the bush 
proposal a ford motor co statement for example said we 
believe the presidents bill takes the nation in the right 
direction and we support his vision but meeting the specific 
provisions will stretch our technical capabilities to the limits 
william fay head of the clean air working group a utility 
organization said assertions by some that this is a weak bill 
are simply ludicrous 
fay said the acid rain provisions would not only require 
utilities to reduce emissions from their current generating output 
but would force them into even costlier controls if they sought to 
increase capacity and the alternative auto fuel proposals amounted 
to a disincentive to make gasoline burn cleaner 
in light of the attacks bush told the rose garden gathering 
that clean air is too important to be a partisan issue 
he said he had worked to balance a range of concerns 
economic growth job creation environemntal protection 
mobility unfettered commerce 
sen max baucus dmont chief senate sponsor of separate 
cleanair legislation said the language of bushs bill will 
significantly tarnish his image to be the environmental president 
the president stepped up to the problem blinked and stepped 
back baucus said contending that the presidents bill would 
actually increase motor vehicle emissions allow cities too much 
time to clean their air and give too much weight to cost in toxic 
chemical cleanup 
critics claimed bush conceded too much to industry 
they complained that instead of setting rigid standards the 
bill would give the epa excessive discretion on emission standards 
for cars trucks and buses and create too much flexibility for the 
epa administrator local governments and industry in taking 
measures to reduce ozone pollution acid rain and airborne toxic 
chemicals 
in addition the legislation would allow the epa to consider 
industrys economic costs in making key decisions 
chafee and others said they were concerned about a provision to 
allow automakers to meet the tailpipe emission standards for 
hydrocarbons by using a fleet average rather than requiring each 
model to meet the standard 
quite frankly were hearing from local officials who say 
they just wont be able to succeed in cleaning up their cities 
unless some changes are made in the bill to further tighten 
emission standards said joe goffman senior attorney for the 
environmental defense fund 
using the fleetaverage method would allow half of the cars to 
exceed pollution limits so long as the standards are met on the 
average for a manufacturer predicted rep henry a waxman 
dcalif its a shell game 
the epa denied the auto emission section would allow more 
pollution but sen joseph lieberman dconn said that part of 
the bill looks like a relief package for detroit and tokyo

passengers may shun flying united airlines 
briefly but investors are likely to stay aboard the nations 
secondlargest airline accepting accidents as a hazard of the 
industry analysts say 
the deadly crash of united flight 232 in an iowa cornfield 
wednesday followed an 18month period of aggressive recovery by 
united moving boldly to recover its longheld ranking as the 
industry leader 
the dc10 disaster will likely have little impact on the 
resurgence of ual corp uniteds parent analysts said 
usually for a short period of time there is customer avoidance 
of a carrier that has had an incident said robert j joedicke 
an industry analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
this tends to wear off fairly promptly he said 
and united shareholders will be more concerned with the 
tragedy of the crash than about the price of their stock said 
analyst robert decker of duff amp phelps in chicago investors 
realize that a crash is part of the business risk of an airline 
ual stock closed down 125 at 17075 in new york stock 
exchange trading friday the stock lost 150 on thursday 
one day before the accident united chairman stephen wolf 
announced the airline was seeking federal approval for several 
transatlantic routes in a bid to make the carrier with its 
extensive pacific coverage a truly global airline 
that move and wolfs announcement in april that the airline was 
placing a 154 billion order with boeing for new planes marked 
the success of the simple battle plan he outlined when he came 
aboard the troubled carrier in december 1987 quality service would 
lead to improved earnings which would allow the airline to expand 
its fleet and operations 
the past five years brought to uniteds parent company a name 
change that was quickly revoked an identity crisis and a bitter 
monthlong walkout by the airlines pilots and flight attendants 
but the hectic period in uniteds 62year history ended with the 
company under new leadership and proudly opening its homebase 
terminal at ohare international airport a frosted 
glassandsteel showcase 
the price of ual stock has climbed in recent weeks along with 
that of other airlines after the announced takeover of northwest 
airlines parent nwa inc by an international investors group 
analysts say uniteds 80 percent ownership of its 408plane 
fleet the highest rate among major carriers many of whom lease 
their planes enhances its investment appeal 
wolfs announcement that united had placed orders and options 
for as many as 370 planes is central to the airlines bid to 
reclaim its rank as the nations largest domestic carrier a title 
recently assumed by american airlines said united spokeswoman sue 
moss 
wolf also announced firstquarter revenues rose almost 12 
percent to 23 billion and profits from continuing operations more 
than doubled to 654 million our fifth consecutive quarter of 
superb earnings and the best firstquarter of uniteds history 
in contrast for 10 lean years starting in 1977 chicagobased 
ual reported profits just four times and increased its fleet only 
slightly 
they certainly have done an excellent turnaround joedicke 
said theyre moving in a positive direction under the management 
of mr wolf in the year and a half hes been there hes 
achieved great strides 
wolf was brought in after uals brief illfated run as allegis 
corp 
the name change came in february 1987 during the tenure of 
former chairman richard ferris who envisioned a travel services 
conglomerate combining air travel car rental hotels and a 
reservations system but big losses produced pressure for change 
from major shareholders 
ferris resigned four months after the name change and new 
management moved quickly to restore the ual name and dump the 
nonairline businesses 
before ferris departed his expansion plans prompted a 41 
billion bid for united from the union representing its pilots 
the offer still stands though uniteds pilots are pleased 
that the airline is independent once again said hank krakowski 
of the air line pilots association 
united was the target of a bitter 29day walkout by the pilots 
and the association of flight attendants in 1985 the carrier won 
the day imposing twotier contracts with lower pay scales for new 
hires 
the provision is the key obstacle in uniteds onagain 
offagain talks with the flight attendants whose contract expired 
in 1987 and is a major issue for the pilots whose pact expired 
last year

a television news director whose station had 
footage of united airlines fiery crash in sioux city iowa said 
friday he will take action against stations that didnt get 
permission to use the videotape 
for those who didnt ask they are going to get billed 
substantially more than those who did said van carter news 
director at ktivtv if they dont want to pay it then yes we 
may wind up with legal action 
in sioux city rescue officials on friday said they had 
recovered 109 bodies after wednesdays crash more than 180 people 
survived the crash 
ktiv an nbc affiliate intended the exclusive footage of the 
tumbling burning dc10 jet to be used only by nbc nightly news and 
other nbc affiliates carter said 
but it played on stations across the country including rival 
kcau in sioux city after it was transmitted from sioux city to 
nbc in new york via a satellite channel owned by minneapolisbased 
conus communications 
conus a news service that feeds 133 television stations said 
it obtained the footage from wowt of omaha neb one of its 
members ktiv has a reciprocal agreement to share footage with 
wowt which was sent to transmit the footage to nbc news said 
conus spokesman steve blum 
technical and time restraints prompted wowt to use conus 
satellite channel to transmit the video instead of feeding it 
directly to nbc blum said 
after being assured by wowt and a ktiv reporter in the wowt 
truck that the two stations shared videotapes conus made the video 
available to its members through wowt blum said 
conus later talked to a ktiv manager who granted conus the 
rights to the video for 300 blum said 
we werent trying to rip anybody off blum said we got 
permission 
carter said the situation with conus was confusing and that 
conus may not be at fault but he said conus should have checked 
with him not a reporter before releasing the video 
carter said he granted abc permission to use the tape after the 
cat was out of the bag but demanded that abc affiliate kcau be 
excluded from the distribution 
they went ahead and did anyway carter said finally 24 
hours after the fact they stopped using it 
carter said his station obtained the footage of the jet by 
dispatching camera crews to the scene nearly 30 minutes before the 
crash 
the news station was tipped off to the upcoming emergency 
landing by reports on the local police radio

an attachment to the engine that may have 
exploded in flight aboard united airlines flight 232 was repaired a 
day before the plane crashed in iowa but the head investigator 
said friday he had no indication the work was related the engines 
failure 
government records show that dc10s with cf66 engines have had 
six previous engine failures in which damage extended beyond the 
engine 
the builder general electric co and a federal aviation 
administration spokesman said the cf66 which is used only on 
trijet dc10s has a good performance record 
the rear engine that investigators say may have exploded in 
flight and disabled hydraulic flight control systems before the 
united dc10 crashed wednesday at sioux city had been on the 
15yearold plane for about nine months said a spokesman for rep 
james oberstar dminn who heads a house aviation subcommittee 
oberstar obtained information about the plane from a united 
airlines vice president 
airline spokesman herb gardner in chicago said all maintenance 
records concerning the aircraft one of 56 dc10s in uniteds 
fleet had been turned over to the national transportation safety 
board we just simply do not provide any of that information once 
its been given to the board he said 
a spokesman for oberstar said the congressman had not learned 
whether the repair work done on the engine had anything to do with 
the system that failed 
safety board member jim burnett who is supervising 
investigators in sioux city confirmed that unspecified repairs 
were performed on the aircrafts tail engine on tuesday we have 
no indication at this time that that was something that could have 
affected the course of the accident he said 
he said the work was on the planes pneumatic system which uses 
excess air pressure generated by the giant jet engine to power the 
aircrafts airconditioning system the pneumatic system is 
attached to the engine 
burnett acknowledged friday that pieces of metal spewing from a 
disintegrating rear engine could have caused the small holes found 
in the horizontal stabilizer and could have severed hydraulic lines 
in the tail but he said investigators were far from concluding 
what caused the crash 
burnett said preliminary findings showed that the horizontal 
stabilizer the small winglike structures on each side of the 
tail had several holes and the hydraulic system had lost all 
fluid the hydraulic system is routed through the tail and allows 
the pilot to manipulate wing and tail controls 
early friday evening burnett said examination of the hydraulic 
lines showed two were severed cleanly and the third suffered such 
impact damage it was impossible to tell whether it had been cut 
the rear engine was either brand new or newly rebuilt when it 
was installed last october said jim berard oberstars spokesman 
faa spokesman fred farrar said cf66 engines have been the 
subject of seven airworthiness directives since they went into 
service in 1972 this doesnt mean there is a problem but that a 
problem was solved and corrected he said such directives 
ordinarily order airliners to make modifications on the engines or 
in procedures for maintaining them 
the most recent order was in late 1988 and involved replacement 
of an engine shaft after 17600 flights farrar said 
the ge engine originally was built lighter than engines made by 
competitors with relatively thin fan blades but the design was 
changed because the blades tended to break up a united airlines 
official disclosed after a 1979 chicago dc10 crash that killed 274 
people that crash was blamed on faulty maintenance procedures 
farrar said the cf66 engines have a good shutdown record with 
one automatic or pilotdirected shutdown for about every 30000 
flying hours a normal record for such an engine 
airliners must be able to fly with one engine out farrar said 
the threeengined dc10 also could fly with two engine failures but 
if that were necessary the strain on the third engine might damage 
it 
david lane spokesman for general electrics aircraft engine 
division said 469 of the cf66 engines are in service only one 
flight in 2000 has been delayed or cancelled because of a cf66 
problem he said 
thats an admirable record he said 
lane said the company would have no comment on specifics 
involved in the souix city crash investigation

felix s bloch the diplomat being 
investigated by the fbi and the state department as a possible 
soviet spy wrote a recent article warning fellow diplomats that 
the united states has little ability to influence the european 
common market 
blochs article appears in the julyaugust edition of the 
foreign service journal the magazine of the foreign service 
association the professional organization for american diplomats 
his contribution entitled the european community sketches 
what he called the intricate and enigmatic relationships 
emphasizing trade of the united states with the institutions of 
the common market 
he said americans had three common misconceptions about europe 
that trade barriers within europe will be removed in 1992 that the 
community is just a place where member countries meet and has no 
power itself and that the community has no political dimension 
in trade he said both sides seem trapped by their threats 
unable to negotiate without deadlines for carrying out threats 
since it is difficult to get a multimember body to agree on an 
initiative both sides have come to expect the united states 
always to be the initiator of trade negotiations the first to make 
a proposal and the one expected to make the last concession 
it must be recognized that the nature of our relations is to a 
large extent dictated by the state of the evolving community 
bloch wrote 
we can neither force nor delay the pace of european 
unification and can deal with common market institutions only to 
the extent that the community agrees that they should deal with us 
decisions being made in europe are very important to the united 
states but our ability to influence them is small

president bushs final clean air bill is 
sparking stinging criticism from environmentalists because it would 
ease an early drafts requirements for reducing motor vehicle 
pollution and provide wide government latitude to meet industrys 
concerns

was given to members of congress thursday and made available by 
lawmakers to reporters the summary showed the final version to be 
sent to congress today was changed from a preliminary draft that 
was written june 30 
the new language compared to the earlier draft would push back 
new emissions standards for cars trucks and buses and would give 
the epa administrator discretion to delay new regulations even 
further 
other provisions of the final bill some known previously would 
give the administrator local governments and industry flexibility 
in taking measures to reduce ozone pollution acid rain and 
airborne toxic chemicals the epa chief could specifically address

committee chairman joseph biden ddel said he was not satisfied 
with lucas testimony and added he was inclined to oppose the 
nominee when the committee votes perhaps as early as next thursday 
conyers turnaround came as a political blow to the

aids patients may have up to 1000 times more 
diseased blood cells than previously believed making it even 
harder to stamp out the virus that causes the fatal disease 
according to a national institutes of health study published today 
in a study led by steven m schnittman of the national institute 
of allergy and infectious diseases researchers discovered that in 
a patient with active aids the virus that causes the disease can 
infect up to 1 percent 1 of every 100 of a blood cell known as 
the t4 lymphocyte 
schnittman said in an interview that previous studies which 
used indirect measurements of the infection rate had calculated 
that only 1 in every 10000 to 100000 of the t4 lymphocytes in 
such a patient were infected 
the higher rate of infection a factor that doctors call virus 
load suggests that it will be more difficult to develop a 
therapy to find and eliminate each and every pocket of the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes aids

for 12 years dr albert johnston and his 
wife had a secret a secret they kept from friends neighbors 
even their children 
but in 1941 their secret came out each was part black the 
fairskinned johnstons had raised four children and built a life in 
keene and gorham nh while passing as white 
eight years later the whole world knew their story when it was 
presented lightly fictionalized in the 1949 film lost 
boundaries in which mel ferrer el greco war and peace 
made his screen debut 
the doctor is now dead but his family and members of the 
movies cast and crew were to reunite in keene today with a 
screening and small reception to celebrate a revolutionary film and 
friendships that withstood a revelation that was in its time 
shocking 
that was the point of the story the fact that something 
positive happened that there wasnt any problem as a result of 
it recalled albert johnston jr 
albert johnston a chicago native and his blueeyed wife thyra 
baumann born in new orleans had no thought of passing after 
their 1924 marriage when he was a premed student at the university 
of chicago but things changed when he tried to find work as an 
intern hospitals that accepted black interns were full and others 
would not accept him because he was part black 
at last maine general hospital in portland accepted johnston 
without asking his race in 1929 the internship over the family 
moved to gorham nh and johnston went into successful private 
practice 
the family moved to boston in 1937 so johnston could study 
radiology at harvard medical school he returned to gorham a year 
later moving to keene in 1939 it was there just before world war 
ii that the truth came out 
in 1941 he volunteered for the navy and won a lieutenant 
commanders commission in july but a few days later a navy 
intelligence officer visited the doctor and said we understand 
you have colored blood in your veins 
who knows what blood any of us has in his veins johnston 
replied 
about a month later he was notified that his commission had 
been revoked because of an inability to meet naval physical 
requirements he then told his children about their background 
despite the familys fears townspeoples feelings were 
generally unchanged when the news spread which surprised the 
johnstons and many others 
i would say 80 percent of the people didnt care didnt make 
any difference why would it albert jr said from hawaii where 
he and his parents moved in the 1960s 
if youd lived in new hampshire all your life knew all your 
friends theyre going to be surprised theyre going to be 
amazed but theyre still your friends there were of course a 
certain small amount of people who were diehards who would have 
always lived with a sense of bigotry 
in the movie however the family is roundly rejected once their 
secret is revealed 
it was albert jr then a music theory student who got the film 
started by telling the family story to producer louis de rochemont 
who lived in newington at the time the march of time producer 
sent author wl white to write the familys story which was 
printed in readers digest in 1947 
de rochemont now dead fought with mgm over suggested script 
changes and ended up financing the film himself he shot it in new 
hampshire and maine seacoast towns 
when lost boundaries came out premiering in keene on july 
24 1949 it was banned in some cities but it was lauded by life 
and newsweek magazines and the new york times in which critic 
bosley crowther said it had extraordinary courage understanding 
and dramatic power the movie won the best script prize at the 
cannes film festival 
this was a very very radical departure from any kind of 
fiction film anybody was making in the country ferrer said 
noting its documentary style and controversial topic it was a 
picture which broke a tremendous number of shibboleths and it 
established a new freedom in making films 
albert jr said de rochemont deliberately picked unknown white 
actors ferrer and the late beatrice pearson who had been in only 
one film before lost boundaries and who abandoned her career a 
short time later 
though some critics film buffs and historians have criticized 
the movie for casting whites in the lead roles as was done in 
other movies at that time such as show boat and pinky the 
film did feature a few black actors including canada lee and leigh 
whipper 
the movie also has been criticized for creating an unbelievable 
premise that the couple are forced to leave their black community 
because other blacks reject their whiteness at that time well 
before the slogan of black is beautiful permeated society fair 
skin was more acceptable in the black community than dark skin 
keene and gorham were fictionalized as the single keenham 
character names were changed the family became the carters and 
the family reduced to two children in the film directed by alfred 
l werker but most incidents were authentic albert jr said 
lost boundaries fell into obscurity when the company that 
owned it film classics folded its catalog was sold to warner 
bros the chance of rereleasing or televising it now is slim 
because its unclear who owns the distribution rights the movie 
had been shown on television years ago 
i think its the best picture i was ever in as an actor 
said the 71yearold ferrer in a telephone interview from his home 
outside santa barbara calif i still feel that way i 
thought it was a great opportunity for all of us 
ferrer who went on to become a producer and director felt 
strongly enough about the story to go against the advice of his 
booking agency and make his screen debut in the film the move 
could have destroyed his career but all of us had a certain real 
conviction about the theme of the picture and the content of the 
picture and i didnt hesitate 
the johnston family was and is proud that their story was used 
to promote racial understanding said albert jr a 63yearold 
retired department store buyer and composer 
we thought it was quite a historical first and that it 
contributed immensely to the thinking of society he said

the 39yearold former governor of 
one of brazils poorest states has surged to the forefront of the 
nations presidential race overtaking a veteran populist and a 
radical leftist 
fernando collor de mello of alagoas in the impoverished 
northeast is attacting voter attention with a cleangovernment 
platform and probusiness views in a nation deep in debt and 
ravaged by inflation 
he is leading national public opinion polls by a 31 margin 
outscoring two previous frontrunners longtime populist leonel 
brizola of the democratic labor party and unionist luis inacio lula 
da silva of the radical left workers party 
collor de mellos supporters call him a bold reformer capable 
of moralizing brazils bureaucracy 
critics maintain he is a shallow prefabricated candidate with 
hazy ideas and questionable financial dealings as governor of 
alagoas 
but his popularity grows nevertheless 
in midjuly collor de mello got a 41percent rating in a survey 
by one leading poll taker brizola his closest rival had 12 
percent and da silva wound up with 7 percent a gallup poll at the 
same time gave collor de mello 45 percent with brizola remaining 
at 12 and da silva dropping to 5 percent 
i reached this position without the support of any governor 
senator big businessman banker or the military collor de mello 
said after the poll results were released my candidacy was born 
in the sentiment of the nation 
brazilians will choose a successor to president jose sarney on 
nov 15 in the first popular balloting for president in 29 years 
direct presidential elections were banned by a rightwing military 
regime that ruled from 1964 to 1985 
collor de mello presents himself as an independent candidate 
without ties to vested interests he calls himself a christian 
reformer and ideologically left of center 
however his opponents call him the new face of the right 
his probusiness ideas are drawing conservatives to his newly 
formed national reconstruction party 
collor de mello first attracted national attention when as 
governor he refused to pay the exorbitant salaries of an elite 
group of civil servants popularly known as maharajas 
his refusal struck a chord among brazilians who read almost 
daily accounts of official graft and corruption while most workers 
earn close to the minimum wage of about 40 a month 
his cleangovernment crusade has become the heart of his 
presidential campaign 
collor de mello has been a sharp critic of sarney a 59yearold 
rancher and poet who took office in 1985 when the military stepped 
down many blame sarneys government for 1000 percent inflation 
and rampant corruption 
collor de mello was born aug 12 1949 into a wealthy and 
powerful family in alagoas a state dominated by sugar barons and 
known for its bloody political feuds in alagoas he heads the 
family owned gazeta media group which includes a newspaper a tv 
station three radio stations and a publishing house 
his political career began when he joined the military regimes 
social democratic party in the 1970s in 1979 he was appointed 
mayor of maceio the capital of alagoas three years later he was 
elected to congress 
in 1985 collor de mello sided with the military and voted for 
the partys presidential candidate paulo maluf in an electoral 
college election he says it was a question of party loyalty but 
the vote still haunts him 
maluf lost to opposition candidate tancredo neves who died 
before taking office his running mate sarney became president 
in 1986 collor de mello switched to sarneys brazilian 
democratic movement party and was elected governor last year he 
resigned from the party in a split with sarney and began his run 
for president 
as a candidate collor de mello has made crowdpleasing promises 
to sell cabinet ministers mansions in brasilia and to disband the 
feared national intelligence service a secret police operation 
he claims brazils 112 billion foreign debt the largest in the 
third world is unpayable but he adds that he will not stop 
payments on it instead he proposes withdrawing the federal 
governments guarantees on loans for staterun companies and state 
governments 
my proposal is unconventional he says i dont intend to 
welsh or declare a moratorium i want to play within the rules 
withdrawing federal guarantees will send a signal to creditors that 
will promote a broad renegotiation 
a top priority he says is attracting more foreign investment 
we need money we need investment we need development he 
said 
i dont think like some who see in foreign capital the 
presence of the dominator the colonizer thats a mistaken view 
the only way to development is to establish a healthy partnership 
with capital 
he also proposes to eliminate the controversial market 
reserve policy that bars large numbers of foreignmade computers 
from brazil 
this is backwardness clientelism paternalism he said 
if were going to install capitalism here then lets do it all 
the way and this is anything but capitalism 
critics claim collor de mellos record belies his claims as a 
corruption fighter 
as governor collor de mello made a settlement considered overly 
generous in a tax dispute with the states sugar barons and he 
appointed thousands to state jobs on the eve of his resignation to 
run for president 
justice minister oscar dias correa ordered federal police to 
investigate the charges of corruption

chris burke says its very wonderful to 
get to play his character corky on tv this fall in abcs new 
series life goes on 
to become an actor who has downs syndrome i think is very 
great burke said 
burkes character like himself suffers from the birth defect 
that is a cause of mental retardation 
life goes on a realistic family drama is one of the few 
innovations from the networks this fall 
burke plays 18yearold corky the middle child of drew and 
libby thatcher played by bill smitrovich and patti lupone in the 
series corky who has spent his school years in special education 
is just embarking on life in a normal high school 
his younger sister becca kelly martin must cope with going to 
the same school as her brother to complicate matters paige 
monique lanier a grown daughter from drews previous marriage 
has broken up with a boyfriend and moved in 
burke appeared at a news conference with other members of the 
cast and creator and executive producer of life goes on 
michael braverman 
braverman said the series was developed around burke who had 
appeared as a peripheral character in a pilot movie braverman had 
produced 
although abc did not pick up that pilot they loved chris so 
much in it they asked me if i could do something to develop a show 
that featured him the result was life goes on 
braverman said he has been closely involved with downs syndrome 
support groups because he has a relative who suffers from it but 
does not employ a technical adviser on the show 
theres no greater expert than chris if chris says he can do 
something or couldnt do something or wouldnt do something i 
take that prima facie 
burke is not severely retarded and had little difficulty dealing 
with the room full of television critics occasionally blushing and 
giggling in the midst of a lengthy answer braverman said the 
reason burke is an actor is the desire hes had to be one since he 
was 5 
burke himself described wanting to burst into tears when he 
went to one drama workshop and saw the other students performing 
with such ease 
there is a fulltime drama coach on the set for burke braverman 
said adding and it would well serve many other actors as 
well smitrovich leaned forward and asked you talking about 
this show or your other past experiences 
after the news conference smitrovich talked about the joys and 
difficulties of working with someone like chris burke 
it requires a little more patience to be truthful 
smitrovich said you know corkys a very special downs syndrome 
child because corkys not severely retarded but in the 
process of working on a film its a long day you have to maintain 
a certain level of concentration there are a lot of distractions 
and as you might know children with downs syndrome can be 
distracted quite easily but someone once said that downs 
syndrome they have something extra so i look at corky as having 
something extra and he works hard and we get it done and 
sometimes theres a nice subtle variable in his character hes 
able to add nuance to it unlike other actors who are straight and 
playing someone retarded 
abc has scheduled the show on sunday night opposite cbs 
powerhouse 60 minutes 
i dont think anybody expects us to beat 60 minutes said 
braverman were going to play our own game 
someone asked braverman whether it was risky to put on a 
show with a central character who has downs syndrome and suggested 
that perhaps the character played by larry drake on la law 
had made it acceptable for there to be retarded characters on 
network shows 
we didnt feel it was in any way risky because were hoping 
to make you feel good with it said braverman

three years ago investigative reporter elaine 
shannon took a leave from her job withdrew her savings and set out 
to nail down the story of highlevel corruption behind the murder 
of us drug agent enrique camarena in mexico 
it was more than just a whodunit for shannon she found the 
political immorality spread by the drug barons was pervasive in 
mexico and there was a massive coverup 
she also found that the reagan white house and state department 
were equally reluctant to see the murder investigation pursued 
because it was disruptive of american foreign policy some 
courageous officials however resisted pressure and pushed the 
investigation 
camarena an agent of the drug enforcement administration was 
abducted on feb 7 1985 in guadalajara mexico he was tortured 
and murdered by the drug lords he was trying to bring to justice 
shannon tells the whole dirty story in her book desperados 
which has been made into a sixhour nbc miniseries called drug 
wars the camarena story 
the threepart series to be shown this fall stars steven bauer 
as camarena elizabeth pena as his wife mika and craig t nelson 
and treat williams as drug agents michael mann miami vice 
was executive producer 
i traveled in mexico and the southwest particularly 
california and talked to everybody i could find who knew about the 
murder said shannon on a visit to los angeles shannon who is 
expecting her first child next month is married to dan morgan of 
the washington post she spent 10 years covering the department of 
justice for newsweek which she left after beginning the book she 
currently works for time in washington 
this is really about american policy we have agents all over 
the world are they being supported by our embassies and our 
government i talked to mexican officials last i didnt want them 
following me around and seeing who i was talking to 
there is a lot of information out there i didnt have to use 
the freedom of information act at all i talked to a lot of customs 
agents who had seen the explosion of drugs coming in through the 
south cocaine and marijuana comes almost exclusively from latin 
america 
with the help of investigators here and abroad shannon was able 
to put together a picture of the corruption and coverup 
in mexico corruption is a way of life she said its 
essential to the drug traffic whenever corruption is exposed the 
person is usually allowed to quietly resign 
shannon said camarena a very moral and dedicated man 
volunteered for duty in guadalajara because its the only place 
outside of colombia to find the drug lords she said he was killed 
when he got too close to the drug bosses as well as their 
highranking allies in the mexican government and police 
she describes an incident in the book in which american agents 
watched helplessly as a top official of the mexican federal 
judicial police allowed an escape by a suspected drug kingpin 
behind the murder informants told the agents he promised 270000 
to the official 
shannon also tells of opposition from the us state department 
and the white house to the murder investigation 
not because of corruption but because the agents bother 
important people she said the american banking community also 
raised hell when the customs service ordered strict inspection of 
vehicles at the border it effectively shut down the border and the 
bankers complained that it disrupted trade 
shannon said she was pleased that michael mann produced the 
series because drug dealers had been portrayed as villains on 
miami vice 
in so many movies you see the stars taking dope and 
giggling she said mann made these people the bad guys i was 
concerned that the book not be cheap entertainment or lose its 
dignity he was zealous about the realism and respectful of the 
characters 
shannon points out in her book that a number of agents and 
others put their careers on the line to press ahead with the 
investigation and speak out against the corruption 
one of the messages i hope comes through in this is that while 
law enforcement people can take direct action all of us face 
choices she said we can do things to help we can refuse to 
be a part of a lie many people i interviewed did that and i 
greatly admire them

it was raining in queens when two of my friends and i began what 
normally is a twohour drive to bethel ny a spot on the map 
that didnt exist to most people before the early summer of 1969 
its in the middle of the catskills i mentioned knowingly 
having spent most of my childhood summers in that area near 
white lake not far from monticello 
right in a couple of hours wed be jamming with joe cocker 
cruising with crosby stills and nash 
as i headed to the concert that would attract nearly half a 
million people and the attention of the world all i could think 
about was the music the who the airplane janis joplin jimi 
hendrix creedence sly 
the first inkling that this wasnt going to be your normal 
weekend came from the radio as we drove north 
the concert at bethel already is a disaster the newscaster 
said local law enforcement officials are warning people to stay 
away traffic is backed up for miles there arent enough supplies 
at the site tickets are useless because the fences surrounding the 
area have been torn down and the weather forecast calls for heavy 
rain 
time to speed up dont want to miss any of this 
about 90 minutes later we approached the beginning of the 
catskill region we noticed dozens of hitchhikers with backpacks 
coolers even collapsed leantos but no traffic jams no rain 
the exit ramp we needed was uphill you dont see route 17b 
until youre practically on it we never got on it it was blocked 
by state troopers who were detouring all cars away from the 
band richie havens canned heat and arlo guthrie 
damn 
dont worry i said with too much smugness i know the 
back roads 
all roads to bethel are closed blocked by hundreds of cars 
filled with frustrated rock n roll fans the radio man was 
saying with nearly as much smugness as i displayed moments earlier 
not these roads baby i replied 
we drove almost to the foot of the great meadow on max yasgurs 
farm all we needed was to get around a bend that would lead 
directly to the site except there was no road left it had become 
a parking lot so we pulled into a ditch locked up the car and 
minus blankets spare clothes and i guess our senses we headed 
toward the music 
after walking less than a mile it began to rain 
fourandahalf miles further we climbed a short hill and 
people 
and more people 
the music had stopped in deference to the weather but the waves 
of humanity didnt stop within my field of sight 
and nobody was complaining they were soaking wet hungry 
disappointed that the stage was for now empty 
they didnt yell about it they didnt fight they shared what 
they had one group let us crawl underneath a makeshift tent of 
plastic and gave us beer and potato chips which wound up being the 
bill of fare for the weekend 
the storm ended early enough for the concert to resume we were 
at least onequarter mile from the stage back near the concession 
stands that were closed there was a distinct aroma in the air but 
it had nothing to do with barbecues 
late friday night joan baez sang we shall overcome and 
anyone who had something they could light did so 
we found space under one of the closed concessions and slept the 
best we could that afternoon i got my introduction to santana as 
did thousands of others who would make soul sacrifice an anthem 
for woodstock it could have been 200 degrees in the shade and it 
wouldnt have been as hot as the set santana played 
and creedence clearwater revival the group i most wanted to 
hear the fourmember band put a spell on the crowd from beginning 
to end with probably their best live performance ever 
at night there was joplin screaming her way through ballads 
sly getting everyone up to dance to the music and the who 
presenting the rock opera tommy until dawn 
sunday morning and the jefferson airplane was just starting 
its set 
i must have been sleeping when joe cocker got started i had 
heard of him but didnt expect the nearspastic movements the 
gravelly voice the lack of all conventions i loved it 
by now however the lack of substantial meals the squalor of 
the portable bathrooms and the general discomfort were more than 
annoying by early sunday evening a lot of people had left 
as cocker was finishing it began to rain 
a chant of no rain no rain began instead we got more 
rain more rain 
when it stopped we thought of leaving but country joe and the 
fish came on stage the festive mood was long since gone but the 
music wasnt 
later sunday yasgur made a speech and got a tremendous ovation 
the kind you heard when joe namath threw a touchdown pass 
that night crosby stills and nash performed they would become 
megastars but they were awful at woodstock the crowd was getting 
antsy to hear hendrix and go home and the outofsynch vocals of 
this new group were bothersome 
i fell asleep 
i remember waking up and hearing teen angel playing on 
someones radio except there werent any nearby so i walked 
toward the stage and saw these guys dressed in gold lame outfits 
dancing around posturing and singing hits from the 50s sha na 
na somehow they seemed to fit just right 
by the time hendrix appeared the crowd had thinned to a more 
manageable 100000 or so i knew this was the end and for the only 
time i can remember it didnt matter if hendrix played five songs 
or five hours 
as he played the the starspangled banner i took my watch 
from my pocket and looked at it for the first time all weekend 
a few years later i went back with my fiancee jimi was gone 
so was janis it was nothing more than a big lush cow pasture no 
crowds no music 
it didnt seem special then i said it was just a great 
concert 
but if i ever get the chance to go back and relive one 
experience this would be it

every other month cemetery workers tending jimi 
hendrixs grave replace the lawn worn away by fans 
every day they take away the offerings left near his granite 
marker the night before marijuana butts lighters guitar picks 
twenty years after woodstock and 19 years after hendrix 
admirers still come to sit and think about the young man who helped 
define psychedelic rock 
when hendrix cranked up his fender stratocaster the earth 
became the third stone from the sun and a nation of rebellious 
youth grooved to the starspangled banner 
when he hit woodstock in august 1969 his music and his career 
were soaring a year and a month later they crashed 
he died in his sleep sept 18 1970 while on a european tour 
the coroners report said he choked on his own vomit the trace of 
barbituates in his blood was small not enough to kill the coroner 
said 
hendrix was born in seattle in 1942 he left garfield high 
school after his junior year to join the army because he didnt 
want to spend another summer mowing the lawns for his fathers 
landscape business 
he wanted one of those screaming eagles on his shoulder 
said james a al hendrix referring to the patch worn by 
paratroopers from the 101st airborne division 
hendrix served after korea and before vietnam when lyrics from 
his songs would be scribbled on soldiers helmets 
he went by jimmy in those days and was shy his father said the 
shortened name and stage antics such as squirting lighter fluid on 
his burning guitar were just show business he adopted later 
he was a good boy the 70yearold hendrix said he played 
little league football swimming we called him buster til he 
was 9 or 10 then he wanted to be called jimmy 
jimmy and his younger brother leon were raised by their 
father his parents were divorced and his mother died when he was 
10 
the familys console record player filled the rooming house 
where they lived with bb king and muddy waters and young jimmy 
mimicked the records using a broom for a guitar 
i had this old ukelele from one of my jobs said his father 
a former musician in vancouver british columbia i gave it to 
him of course he couldnt get much music out of it 
so al hendrix paid a friend 5 for his acoustic guitar and gave 
it to jimmy the first electric guitar was bought at a music shop 
along with a saxophone for dad when they fell behind on payments 
the sax went back but the electric guitar stayed 
i told him hed go farther with that guitar than i would with 
the sax hendrix said with a laugh i never did get him an amp 
he used to plug into his friends still he got music out of it 
the peter gunn theme was one of the first things i remember him 
playing 
hendrix didnt return to seattle when a back injury from a 
parachute jump ended his military career instead he headed east 
in search of the music scene and played in backup bands for the 
supremes the isley brothers and little richard 
hendrixs guitar playing attracted a record producer who took 
him to england he became jimi mitch mitchell and noel redding 
were added to make the jimi hendrix experience 
the band conquered europe and played at the monterey pop 
festival in 1967 which led to a record contract and a tour with 
the monkees the madefortelevision pop group predictably the 
music styles clashed and the tour was cut short by august 1969 
the experience was finished but hendrixs music was taking off he 
formed the shortlived band of gypsies with buddy miles and billy 
cox whom hed met in the army 
hendrix left behind a rich musical legacy influencing a 
generation of musicians such as prince and eric clapton his 
records still are among the best sellers at many stores the heart 
of his discography remains are you experienced axis bold 
as love and electric ladyland 
seattle has been slow to honor hendrix partly because his 
reputation for drugs and sex didnt seem exemplary for young 
citizens garfield high school put his bust in the secondfloor 
library and when city fathers balked at a plaque in a city park

three million of its people died in the fighting 
to establish bangladesh as a nation 18 years ago and in peace it is 
assailed by death and destruction at the hands of nature and man 
but while tragedy after tragedy befalls bangladesh it survives 
here is a report on the hard luck country of the asian subcontinent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
throughout this impoverished nation 
whose short history has been plagued by some of the worst disasters 
man and nature can devise people struggle from one day to the next 
just to survive 
situated in a stormtossed alley at the head of the bay of 
bengal bangladesh is alternately seared by droughts or awash in 
tidal waves and monsoon floods it is pummeled by tornadoes and 
smashed by cyclones or hurricanes roaring in from the sea 
bangladeshis die by the thousands 
overloaded river ferries capsize with a regularity that tends to 
trivialize the tragedy drowning dozens and sometimes hundreds of 
people at a time 
strikes and riots by political parties trade unions and moslem 
fundamentalists recur virtually every week usually ending in 
confrontations with police in which a score or more protesters are 
wounded and a few die 
but for most of the 110 million bangladeshis life goes on but 
only on the edge 
the average annual income is 160 a year eighty percent of the 
people live below the poverty line which means they cant obtain 
minimum daily nutritional needs at least 70 percent are illiterate 
the plight of mohammad nobu a 25yearold farmer is typical of 
what can happen to a bangladeshi 
his one acre of land at the hamlet of hargaj 25 miles northwest 
of dhaka provided enough rice and vegetables for his family he 
usually kept a cow and some chickens to sell not to eat because 
money lasts longer than meat 
but last fall he lost his rice crop to floods that submerged 
threefourths of the nation and killed an estimated 1400 people 
his next crop winter lentils and vegetables was washed away by 
heavy rains 
in april he lost his spring rice to tornadoes that killed 
another 1400 people including his mother and aunt he said the 
storm also destroyed his tinroofed bamboo hut and blew away a 
big cow that i would have sold for 5000 takas 152 
nobu his wife and two small children now subsist on monthly 
handouts 33 pounds of rice from the government and 66 pounds of 
flour from a private relief organization 
its all right he said we are surviving we are waiting 
for allahs mercy 
in 1970 before it became independent from pakistan a hurricane 
killed a million people in what then was east pakistan in 1985 a 
hurricane and tidal way swept away 20000 lives this past 
november a cyclone killed 1100 
while people like nobu await the mercy of allah the mercy of 
wealthier nations in large part keeps bangladesh going to the tune 
of 2 billion a year an amount equal to the countrys annual 
operating budget 
but bangladeshis and foreigners alike worry about the country 
becoming too dependent on handouts 
we have to prove to the world that bangladesh is something 
more than a poor country president hussain muhammad ershad said 
recently while speaking of his desire to modernize his nation 
in the meantime the former army general who seized power in a 
bloodless coup in 1982 has marshaled wide international support 
western donors are not unhappy with ershad because hes 
provided stability and theres been a vast improvement in human 
rights one foreign observer said speaking on condition he was 
not identified further 
bangladesh has had nine presidents since its 1971 independence 
war with pakistan in which 3 million people died the only two 
presidents who lasted longer than a few months were assassinated 
leaders have never been installed by popular election 
foreign aid officials said bangladesh has become such a popular 
cause that they sometimes try to dissuade their governments from 
pumping more money into an aid pipeline that has a fiveyear 
backlog and a dispersal rate of 18 percent 
sheik hasina the daughter of independence leader sheik mujibur 
rahman and head of his awami league that has been at the forefront 
of the campaign to oust ershad contends that bangladesh must wean 
itself from foreign aid and achieve economic emancipation 
her father bangladeshs first president was assassinated in 
1975 by young army officers in a coup in which his wife three sons 
and other relatives also were slain hasina who says sheik is her 
name and not a title was in india at the time and returned later 
to pick up her fathers political mantle 
the key to bangladeshs problems she said in a recent 
interview is a literacy campaign that would generate a 
betterskilled work force for an exportoriented economy

with liberals flocking to support a law 
against flag burning robert h bork said smiling it might stand 
up in the supreme court for lack of lawyers to challenge it 
he was joking of course bork the conservative whose supreme 
court nomination was rejected by the senate believes that it will 
take a constitutional amendment to reverse the court ruling that 
permits flag burning in the name of free speech 
as lawyers and legislators choose sides on flag measures not 
many are saying that the best thing to do is nothing the issue is 
so flammable that just about everybody wants action or thinks it 
inevitable 
thats the point behind borks banter at a house hearing the 
other day the question has become whether to ban flag desecration 
by act of congress or by amendment to the constitution rather 
than whether it is necessary or desirable to do either 
one exception charles fried another conservative scholar and 
solicitor general in the reagan administration fried said congress 
should show leadership by forgoing any action statute or 
amendment he said no american should be punished for even the most 
offensive and bizarre expressions of dissent 
but fried is a harvard university law professor not a 
politician one way or another congress is going to vote to undo 
the court ruling in the senate there are to be votes on both 
options an amendment and a statute house republicans want the 
same thing we deserve a straight up or down vote on the floor on 
the amendment said rep newt gingrich rga the gop whip 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house panel that 
heard a week of testimony on the flag controversy said he thinks 
frieds counsel was sound but its such a loser 
hes siding with the people who say there ought to be a law not 
an amendment edwards acknowledged that many lawyers agree with 
bork that the court ruling on a constitutional issue cannot be 
undone by statute on our side we have just as many distinguished 
lawyers who say that a statute will work edwards told bork 
the former appeals judge smiled 
all of the people who might have been hired to challenge that 
statute have now testified that its constutitional he said 
so i suppose the statute might stand for that reason 
the court ruled 54 that burning the flag is a constitutionally 
protected form of dissent bork said the decision was plainly 
wrong 
justice anthony m kennedy who holds the seat bork was denied 
by the senate in 1987 voted with the majority that overturned a 
texas statute banning flag burning 
congress will decide in the fall what to do about it president 
bush advocates a constitutional amendment democrats are not going 
to risk inaction the alternative to an amendment is a statute 
redrawn so as to flatly forbid desecration without mentioning that 
flag burning is offensive to others which is what the texas law 
said 
bork says that wont suffice 
on the other side of the debate stood an old foe laurence h 
tribe a constitutional lawyer who testified against borks supreme 
court nomination before the senate judiciary committee bork is 
said to have shunned joint appearances ever since 
tribe spoke at the house flag burning hearing on tuesday a day 
before bork testified and said a constitutional amendment would be 
pointless folly 
on its 200th birthday the bill of rights deserves a better 
present than a confusing and needless amendment tribe told the 
house hearing he argues that the court did not grant a right to 
desecrate the flag but required that government protection of 
the flag be separated from government suppression of detested 
views tribe said a flag desecration law written and enforced 
without regard to any message would be upheld 
bork said it would be idle and dangerous to try to reverse a 
constitutional ruling by passing a new law the matter cannot be 
cured by statute he said 
one way or another there is an attempted cure coming although 
there has been little discussion of the ailment sen robert 
kerrey dneb who won the medal of honor in vietnam noted that 
lack 
there simply is no line of americans outside this building or 
in this nation queuing up to burn our flag he told the senate 
on the face of the evidence at hand it seems to me that there is 
no need for us to do anything

given conventional wisdom robert mosbacher 
should still be wandering the halls of the vast commerce department 
bureaucracy in a daze defeated at every turn by unfamiliar 
government red tape 
how could someone new to the washington power game overshadowed 
by his dazzling socialite wife possibly become a mover and shaker 
the skeptics asked 
perhaps no other member of the bush cabinet took office with 
lower expectations than the presidents choice for commerce 
secretary but in just five months in office george bushs 
longtime friend has run up a string of successes to wit 
he prevailed over determined opposition at the defense 
department in getting a deal to develop the advanced fsx fighter 
with japan renegotiated on terms more favorable to the united 
states 
he persuaded the president to accept his position to put japan 
brazil and india on a trade hit list with the threat of stiff 
sanctions unless the targeted countries agree to drop trade 
barriers 
using blunt talk about the need for a seat at the table 
mosbacher won concessions from the 12nation european community and 
a promise to listen to us concerns as western europe moves toward 
a unified market in 1992 
while impressed by his policy clout detractors contend that 
mosbacher is exhibiting dangerous protectionist tendencies 
trying to cure the countrys massive trade deficits by erecting 
barriers that will hurt american consumers more than they will help 
american producers 
mosbacher dismisses those complaints contending that he learned 
economics well during his school days and fully understands the 
consumer benefits derived from an open global trading system but 
he says economic theory has to be tempered with the reality of 
the world 
the goal is always free trade but you cant have unilateral 
free trade it doesnt work mosbacher said in a recent interview 
in his office where he displays an embroidered pillow with the 
legend free trade ave is a twoway street 
mosbachers early successes have made the commerce department 
long considered a backwater agency with little impact on big 
decisions a player in washington 
mosbacher 62 adopts an awshucks pose saying that in his 40 
years in the oil business he learned that luck beats brains every 
time 
while he never held any government job before joining bushs 
cabinet mosbacher maintains that reaching a consensus in 
government isnt all that different from the hard bargaining that 
goes on in business 
you have to sell your viewpoint when you are trying to get 
somebody to buy your deal or when you are buying someone elses 
deal he said i dont know any business in the world that is 
more based on trading than the oil business 
but another reason for mosbachers rising star in government is 
undoubtedly his tie to bush a friendship that dates back 30 years 
to the time both were starting out in the oil business in houston 
mosbacher and bush both the offspring of wealthy eastern 
families chose to seek their own fortunes in texas mosbacher was 
considerably more successful than bush amassing a net worth 
estimated at more than 150 million making him the wealthiest 
member of the bush cabinet 
mosbacher raised a cool 25 million in large contributions as 
bushs chief campaign fundraiser last year 
on a table in mosbachers ornate office is a photo of a 
triumphant bush arms upraised taken at the 1988 republican 
convention scrawled across the picture is the message bob what 
a night id never have made it here without you gratefully 
george 
mosbacher however objects to any suggestion that he is playing 
on his friendship to score bureaucratic victories 
being an old friend of the presidents hasnt hurt but i am 
not sure even if i wanted to that it would affect his 
decisionmaking to one degree he said 
whatever the reason mosbachers early gains have been a tonic 
for the sprawling 40000employee department he heads composed of 
a hodgepodge of agencies from the census bureau to the national 
weather service commerce has rarely before been at the center of 
policy debates 
but the agency does have the responsibility of administering the 
countrys trade laws not a small task in an era of 
100billionplus trade deficits 
those deficits considered by many to be the biggest economic 
failure of the reagan years have increased worries about americas 
standing in the world and its ability to compete with trade 
powerhouses such as japan 
touching on those concerns in his speeches mosbacher portrays 
the competitiveness issue in almost life and death terms 
if this nation surrenders to complacency if we lose control 
of industries and production of products vital to our defense and 
way of life at stake is not just american jobs and prosperity but 
americas freedom 
but within the administration there is an intense debate over 
the proper role of government in assisting american businesses to 
compete internationally 
one view holds that anything that smacks of an industrial 
policy where government singles out certain industries for 
assistance is anathema to the republican freemarket views on 
economic issues 
but mosbacher has been canpaigning for a much more activist 
approach 
he is careful not to define his proposal as an industrial 
policy but rather an industryled businessgovernment 
partnership 
he has come out in favor of government support in the race to 
develop highdefinition television he favors relaxation of 
antitrust laws to allow hightechnology industries to join forces 
to promote research and development he would like to ease 
government regulations to aid industry 
those views are far from universally held throughout the 
cabinet mosbacher was forced to defend them at the inaugural 
meeting of the administrations new council on competitiveness 
mosbacher says he is undeterred although he was unhappy that 
reports of the internal disagreement found their way into print 
news leaks the timehonored way for opposing forces to sway 
public opinion in washington leave mosbacher horrified 
you go to a meeting with the president of the united states 
and you come out and the next day you read about everything that 
you said and everyone else said if that were my company i would 
fire whoever did that he said 
one other difference that mosbacher has found between government 
service and the busines world is the working hours which he termed 
long and hard much longer than business 
mosbachers day starts before 8 am and often runs late into 
the night 
then you get a briefing book to read before the next 
morning he moans 
but the grind hasnt kept him out of the washington social 
scene where he and his third wife georgette a former model have 
made quite a splash hosting parties not only for washington 
powerbrokers but for new york friends such as the donald trumps 
mosbacher says he even kids his friend the president about 
getting potomac fever and a lust for higher office reminding bush 
of the painting of herbert hoover a former commerce secretary 
prominently displayed over mosbachers office fireplace 
i say you know i look every day at that portrait of herbert 
hoover and he went right from here to the presidency how do you 
feel about that

the rolling stones may be known as the 
bad boys of rock n roll but in this tiny pastoral town in 
connecticuts northwest corner theyve just been good quiet 
neighbors during their brief stay 
no one seems to have seen the legendary and historically 
flamboyant band members mick jagger keith richards charlie 
watts ron wood and bill wyman since they arrived with a 
25member entourage to prepare for their next tour 
and no one except for the few diehard fans who line the 
roadside by the wykeham rise school a former girls boarding 
school rented by the stones for six weeks as practice space and 
those who live right near it seems to have heard them for those 
who did it was only faint strains of guitar and drums and 
indecipherable jagger vocals 
theyre here to work to get a tour together said fran 
cropley manager at dobbers den a local restaurant that would be 
convenient if the stones decide to eat out while in town one of 
the local ladies who lives near the school says shes heard more 
noise when schools in session 
resident state trooper rocky tomlinson who has been patroling 
the grounds around wykeham rise said the stones have soundproofed 
the large dance studio they are using as their rehearsal space 
theyve taken care of the place so theyre not disturbing 
neighbors he said i know they dont want the town to be 
disrupted 
apparently the middleage stones no longer the rabblerousers 
they once were dont want to be disrupted either 
a private security force stands ready to evict any zealot who 
wanders up cordonedoff driveways or through the woods to catch a 
glimpse of the rockers or hear a few strains of music 
while some members of the entourage are staying at the 
washington inn others are staying in private homes rented for the 
sixweek stay which will end in midaugust when they go on tour 
their first in eight years theyre guaranteed 65 million they 
open sept 1 at rich stadium near buffalo ny 
townspeople say the rock stars drive straight to the school for 
practice and so far there have been no reports of them mingling 
locally although richards wife model patti hansen had some film 
developed at parks drug a local hangout near town hall 
george auchincloss an agent at the realty company that arranged 
some of the housing rentals for the band said the stones probably 
chose the area because it is known as a peaceful private place 
where artists have traditionally gone to get away 
authors and writers and interesting people have been here 
forever its always been a retreattype area a second home area 
going back to the old days auchincloss said its a quiet area 
and people dont bother us 
besides its famous residents this summer washington boasts 
singersongwriter james taylor and designer bill blass among its 
homeowners dustin hoffman and arthur miller live in nearby 
roxbury meryl streep lives down the road in salisbury 
many celebrities send their children to boarding schools in the 
area the gunnery and rumsey hall and until it had to close its 
doors in june due to declining enrollment wykeham rise 
the 210yearold town of washington was named after the nations 
first president who used to travel through the area and reputedly 
once ate breakfast at a local tavern 
linn tanzman a spokeswoman for the band said the stones 
considered a few other spots before settling on washington for 
their pretour rehearsal she declined to state specific reasons 
for choosing washington but said it had everything the band needed 
in terms of practice space and living quarters 
nancy shook who works behind the soda fountain in the green 
store and was wearing a pin depicting lips and a protruding tongue 
from the stones tattoo you album said people come to 
washington when they want to be inconspicuous 
people just come here because they know its going to be nice 
and quiet she said they arent going to go screaming and 
raging 
sam herrick a 16yearold student at the gunnery said the 
stones werent really anything new 
its no big deal he said dustin hoffman and james taylor 
people have been up here its just another big guy 
there was some initial skepticism about the arrival of the 
legendary rock group two entrepreneurial residents pierce kearney 
and matt stevens even had tshirts made bearing the unfriendly 
message roll on outa here washington ct 1989 on the back of 
the shirt is the infamous lips and tongue symbol but with a bold 
red notallowed slash through it 
they decided to make the shirts they said because the stones 
are going out on a 65 million tour and we thought wed get a 
little piece of that 
in just a few days of selling the shirts out of his truck 
kearney a carpenter who has lived in washington all his life said 
hes sold more than half of the 100 shirts he and stevens had made 
for 15 each 
despite the high sales rate of the antistones shirts the 
antagonism seems to have faded after about a week of the stones 
quiet presence 
as far as the town is concerned the stones havent made much 
difference auchincloss said nobodys seen them or heard 
them 
meanwhile some residents are wishing they would hear something 
herrick who said he wasnt fazed by the fact that jagger and 
company could stroll by the house hes painting at any time had to 
admit hed be pretty excited if they decided to do an impromptu 
concert 
sometimes they do gratuity concerts that would be awesome 
he said that would be great my dads really into the stones and 
stuff he used to be a dj and everything 
the fact that theyre here in town is no big deal but if i 
saw them he trailed off wistfully 
cropley would like to offer a casual invitation to mick and the 
band to stop by dobbers den for dinner and a drink it would be 
nice to make a contact with them i would like to invite them in to 
have dinner in a very lowkey way 
hed thought of asking the group to do a benefit concert for the 
victims of the tornado that roared through the state including 
parts of litchfield county two weeks ago on second thought 
though he said it might be more of a production than he and the 
town could handle 
besides he said i respect their privacy

who are paying more for everything from gasoline to doctors bills 
from brooklyn to idaho to fayetteville nc people say they

on capitol hill federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
predicted thursday that consumer prices would rise 5 percent to 55 
percent this year less than previously predicted

farmstate senators have asked federal 
regulators to investigate a recent emergency order by the chicago 
board of trade aimed at avoiding a squeeze in the soybean futures 
market 
the lawmakers on thursday sought the review by the commodity 
futures trading commission which regulates the futures markets of 
a soybean selloff order issued last week by the cbot 
we are extremely concerned about the effects which recent 
events have had on agricultural producers and small investors 
the senators wrote in a letter to cftc chairwoman wendy gramm 
furthermore these events raise important questions about whether 
adequate safeguards are in place to prevent unwarranted emergency 
actions 
the letter was written by sen christopher bond rmo and 
signed by several others including sens rudy boschwitz rminn 
mitch mcconnell rky and robert kerry dneb they serve on the 
senate agriculture committee which oversees the futures markets 
and the regulatory agency 
the lawmakers asked the cftc for a full disclosure of the events 
during the last several months that led up to the emergency order 
including identification of all traders holding positions larger 
than 1 million bushels of soybeans during may june and july 
the order by the board forced some traders to sell off part of 
their holdings in july soybeans and was viewed as an effort to 
break an attempt by a foreign firm to corner the market 
soybean futures prices dropped sharply as a result of the order 
ferruzzi spa an italian agricultural and financial firm 
reportedly had contracts to take delivery on 23 million bushels of 
soybeans this month when there were only about 12 million bushels 
in locations for easy delivery to meet those commitments a move by 
the grain trader to take delivery on its contracts could have 
sharply increased soybean prices company officials have denied any 
attempt to corner the market however 
kate hathaway a spokesman for cftc said the agency has a 
formal review of the boards order under way although she had not 
seen a copy of the letter she said some of the senators questions 
appeared to be addressed by the commissions review process 
the commission has a policy of not publicly disclosing 
information about individual traders but hathaway said the agency 
has in the past privately sharedsome of that information with 
members of congress 
among other things the senators asked for an assessment of the 
current delivery system for commodity contracts and what actions 
can be taken to prevent a similar situation with the august soybean 
contract

president bushs chief economic adviser has 
rejected a suggestion the administration is inviting taxincrease 
proposals when it says it would consider such proposals on their 
merits 
chairman michael boskin of the council of economic advisers was 
questioned several times thursday at a congressional joint economic 
committee hearing about the presidents no new taxes pledge 
made during last years campaign 
boskin replied that he fully supports bushs position and that 
the administration does not intend to bring the issue with congress 
when both sides begin negotiations on the fiscal budget for 1991 
then he added 
we will listen and consider any proposal on its merits 
that prompted sen william roth rdel a committee member who 
has raised the taxincrease question at several recent 
congressional hearings to remark 
when you say you would consider a proposal that almost 
invites one 
boskin denied the administration was inviting anyone to bring up 
the issue 
we are reasonable people he said we will listen but we 
dont think we need a tax increase and we dont think one is 
desirable 
committee chairman rep lee h hamilton dind suggested the 
willingness to consider tax proposals appears to be a shift from 
a very hard line position of no new taxes to a position of 
well sit at the table and consider proposals 
boskin replied the administration does not mean to suggest it is 
weakening its position 
hamilton also asked boskin whether the no new tax position 
applies throughout bushs first term 
so far as i know that is the presidents desire boskin 
replied 
in an appearance before the committee on wednesday treasury 
secretary nicholas h brady also repeated the administrations 
intent oppose new taxes in the new budget talks 
but despite prodding by roth he declined to categorically rule 
out the possibility of a tax increase 
certainly the 1990 budget was put together with that in mind 
and thats what happened brady said we would begin with that 
same process in 1991 the presidents position is quite clear and 
that obviously is my position

the developer of an 85 million alcohol 
fuel plant in eastern west virginia says the idea to convert waste 
products into alcohol isnt revolutionary hes just built a 
better mousetrap 
the plant to be built on 300 acres in hampshire county is 
designed to produce ethanol from recycled paper and wood products 
construction is slated to begin within two months and the plant is 
scheduled to be operating by early 1991 
we just take anything that has cellulose in it and break it 
down said richard wells the head of kr biochem in tulsa okla 
you break it down to a sugar component and then you can ferment 
sugar into any kind of product you want 
wells declined to reveal the specific process that will be used 
to produce the alcohol 
one alcohol fuels expert was skeptical about wells plans 
im actually surprised theyre putting in a plant unless 
theyve found some new process said doug gardner assistant 
professor of wood science at west virginia university he said he 
didnt know the process kr biochem would use but that the cost of 
oil usually determines whether an alternative fuels project will be 
successful 
we had the energy crisis and the price of oil got expensive 
prompting several alternative fuel development projects gardner 
said then the oil price dropped 
these processes generally are more expensive than oil so 
the fuel isnt worth doing if the price of fuel goes up then 
these processes might be economically feasible 
wells said the key to his plans is the raw products his plant 
will use 
you must remember were using waste materials he said if 
you use waste materials you normally dont pay much for them except 
maybe cost of freight with the feedstock nearly free it makes it 
costeffective 
thats one of the drawbacks to using ethanol right now is 
producers use grain and its very expensive as a result its 
difficult for ethanol producers to compete with crude oil thats so 
cheap 
if we use waste then we can compete with crude oil no 
matter what the price 
the scrap paper used would come primarily from the east coast 
the operation also would use sawdust from west virginia lumber 
companies 
wells said he chose west virginia for a variety of reasons 
including the states pledge to provide federal employee training 
money and its central location 
gardner said the cellulose found in wood and paper is formed 
from glucose molecules the glucose or sugar can be fermented and 
turned into alcohol 
wells whose said his company has 25 years of experience 
building gas and oil facilities said the tennessee valley 
authority researched the process and last week conducted a 
demonstration 
they just proved that what were doing works he said 
adding that the tva will act as a consultant to kr biochem 
the plant which is to employ 100 workers to start and up to 
2000 in four to six years would be capable of producing 32 
million gallons of ethanol a year he said 
wells said there is a strong national market for ethanol which 
is used to enhance the octane in gasoline 
but he said its real benefit is its a total substitute for 
gasoline it doesnt have the pollution of gasoline and under 
president bushs alternative fuels legislation it calls for 
replacing gasoline with ethanol 
bushs proposal is to have 1 million alternativefuel vehicles 
on the road by 1995 
alcohol is big business already wells said it takes 
about two barrels of oil to equal one barrel of fuelgrade 
alcohol 
several projects to produce ethanolpowered cars such as in 
brazil have been scrapped over the years because of the fuels 
cost but wells is confident he can produce the ethanol more 
cheaply 
wells also said however that his plant wouldnt be limited to 
producing alcohol 
there are probably over 50 products that can be made from this 
plant with minor changes he said ethanol is just one of 
them

the chicago board of trades efforts to erase 
doubts about why it took emergency action in the soybean futures 
market last week has raised even more questions about federal 
regulators actions 
cbot chairman karsten mahlman testified before a house 
subcommittee thursday that the exchange ordered the liquidation of 
large positions in the july soybean futures market last week after 
the commodity futures trading commission took their own 
independent action 
that statement was inconsistent with previous statements by 
the cftc chairwoman wendy gramm noted subcommittee members 
earlier this week ms gramm whose agency is up for 
reauthorization by congress testified that the cftc only consulted 
with the chicago exchange about the emergency order and was now 
reviewing it 
but mahlman said ms gramms agency independent of the 
exchanges action also determined that one major market 
participant wasnt meeting its obligation to liquidate futures 
contracts in an orderly manner 
we were led to believe that the situation took place 
differently said rep david r nagle diowa 
futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods 
such as soybeans or gold at a specified price at a specified time 
in the future most futures traders never take or make delivery 
they enter into futures investments planning to close out their 
positions before delivery date 
liquidation is the sale of futures contracts to offset an 
obligation to take delivery of an equal number of futures contracts 
purchased earlier for the same month 
mahlman would not identify the major market participant at 
which the order was directed but the action was widely perceived 
as a move to prevent italian grain merchant ferruzzi finanziaria 
spa from squeezing or cornering the soybean market a charge 
ferruzzi denies 
there was a real threat of potential default on the contract 
which would have had longterm damaging effects on the soybean 
futures market said mahlman in a statement issued in washington 
and chicago 
he also said the cbot was aware that one entity was acquiring a 
large position in soybean futures because it had been granted an 
exemption by the cftc 
outside the hearing room mahlman would not comment on whether 
the exemption was a good idea 
we hope our strong action in july will not be necessary in 
august mahlman told reporters i think we have dramatically 
enhanced the credibility of the board 
in earlier testimony the head of another chicago exchange the 
chicago mercantile exchange said congress should not ban the 
controversial practice of dual trading in which brokers trade for 
themselves and their customers the statement represented a 
reversal of the mercs earlier position 
critics say dual trading allows brokers to take care of their 
own needs first but banning it outright would be dangerous 
said leo melamed chairman of the mercs executive committee 
mahlman concurred with that position in a statement submitted 
to the subcommittee mahlman chairman of the worlds oldest and 
largest futures exchange said a ban on dual trading will 
adversely affect the liquidity of futures markets particularly 
agricultural markets by increasing the cost of doing business 
ms gramm exasperated committee members tuesday with her 
cautious answers to questions about the agencys consulting role in 
the chicago soybean situation 
ms gramm who also said more study was needed before dual 
trading was banned said her agency was reviewing the cbots 
emergency order but neither directly approved nor disapproved of 
the action 
subcommittee chairman glenn english dokla alluded to his 
frustration with the cftc at the start of the thursday session when 
he said the congressmen present want to get complete answers 
instead of the ones they got tuesday 
the dualtrading bill sponsored by english and the 
subcommittees ranking republican e thomas coleman of missouri 
would allow the practice only in certain circumstances including 
futures issues that have an average daily trading volume of fewer 
than 7000 contracts 
but melamed the chicago merc official said dual trading was 
needed to maintain liquidity when there are few customer orders he 
added that pegging dual trading permissibility to volume ignores 
the monthly idiosyncracies of various markets such as soybeans 
cattle oil or gold 
but robert d josserand president of the national cattlemens 
association advocated the elimination of dual trading to restore 
public confidence

the chicago board of trade has for the first 
time linked italian grain merchant ferruzzi finanziaria spa to 
the exchanges order requiring traders to reduce their holdings in 
soybean futures contracts 
in a statement to exchange members issued thursday after the 
expiration of the july soybean contract the worlds largest 
commodity exchange said it took the emergency action after a 
ferruzzi subsidiary failed to voluntarily reduce its large holdings 
in the july soybean market 
in the statement the exchange said its business conduct 
committee had met with ferruzzi usa inc of belle chasse la in 
early july and asked it to voluntarily reduce its market position 
to ensure the orderly expiration of the july contract 
subsequent to that meeting ferruzzi failed to reduce its 
position the exchange said in the statement as a result the 
businesss conduct committee recommended to the board of directors 
that the board exercise its emergency authority to ensure the 
orderly liquidation of the july soybean contract 
the resulting july 11 order requiring traders to reduce their 
positions in the july soybean market to 1 million bushels was 
widely perceived as a move to prevent ferruzzi from squeezing or 
cornering the soybean market a charge ferruzzi denies 
ferruzzi at the time the order was issued held futures contracts 
representing 23 million bushels of soybeans 
a cbot spokesman said thursday that the exchange took the 
emergency action to ensure that obligations to deliver soybeans did 
not exceed the supply of soybeans meeting the contracts 
specifications 
the board of trade has been heavily criticized by farm groups 
and traders who saw the value of their futures holdings drop when 
soybean futures prices fell sharply on the day after the exchange 
issued the directive 
the contract for july delivery of soybeans expired on a weak 
note thursday bringing an end to trading in the contract but not 
to the controversy surrounding it 
the july soybean contract expired at 1201 pm cdt at 688 a 
bushel down 39 cents from wednesdays settlement price that final 
price is 37 cents per bushel below the price on july 1 when the 
cbot directors issued the emergency order 
the emergency order had to be a great influence on the drop in 
prices said grain trader bud frazier executive vice president 
of balfour maclaine 
some observers said the same pressures that had prompted the 
exchange to limit holdings in july soybean futures may be building 
again in the august contract 
ferruzzi has said it was complying with the exchanges directive 
but traders familiar with the firms methods said the company may 
have rolled its huge position out of the july contract and into the 
august contract potentially setting up another confrontation with 
the board of trade next month 
i have no way of proving it but a lot of people think thats 
what theyre doing said a trader who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann alluded to the 
possibility at a news conference in washington where he was 
testifying before a congressional committee 
we hope that our strong action will not be necessary in 
august mahlmann said 
ferruzzi did not return calls inquiring about its market 
position but the company released a statement saying it supports 
full disclosure of events that led to the board of trades 
emergency action 
board of trade spokesmen would not comment on ferruzzis market 
position or on trader response to the emergency order 
if open interest is in line with deliverable supplies that is 
the idea said exchange spokesman michael oconnell 
oconnell said updated figures on july open interest and 
deliverable supplies of soybeans would be available today

a classaction lawsuit has been filed by 
shareholders against egghead discount software accusing the 
nations largestvolume personal computer software retailer and its 
principal officers of securities fraud 
the lawsuit disclosed thursday by egghead follows nearly 13 
million in unexpected losses last quarter despite a 50 percent 
increase in eggheads sales 
egghead which has denied the allegations has blamed much of 
the loss on shrinkage or missing inventory and on poor 
accounting systems 
the suit which seeks unspecified damages was filed in us 
district court in seattle and alleges that the plaintiff egghead 
stockholder steve goldman and others were damaged as a result of 
alleged misstatements in connection with the companys initial 
public stock offering and its public statements and filings from 
june 6 1988 through april 24 1989 
the main claim is the same claim that you get in any 
securities fraud cases said steve berman an attorney 
representing shareholders 
we are alleging that egghead and its directors failed to 
disclose material facts about the companys financial and 
competitive condition at the time they offered the stock and 
throughout the class period he said 
egghead denied the allegations 
we have reviewed the plaintiffs claims and believe they are 
entirely without merit said stuart sloan egghead president and 
chief executive officer egghead intends to defend this caes 
vigorously 
eggheads stock went public in june 1988 at 17 a share it 
closed thursday in overthecounter trading at 11 down 50 cents 
the issaquahbased company reported a loss of 121 million or 
80 cents a share on sales of 3424 million for fiscal 1989 
they had been touting the company as a good company and one 
that had tight controls berman said and then boom you find 
out that obviously they dont have those controls 
we allege that either they knew about some of the problems or 
they were reckless and negligent in not knowing about them 
named as defendants were sloan and other egghead officers and 
directors including founder and chairman victor alhadeff also 
named were the underwriters of its initial public offering 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp and first boston corp

union pilots at northwest airlines 
have decided they wont try to buy into the carrier at least not 
until after new owners take over 
union members decided thursday it is too late to arrange an 
equity investment with a buyout of the eaganbased airline at hand 
by a group led by los angeles investor alfred checchi and with the 
pilots labor contract still locked in a standoff with management 
whether or not we should have proceeded with a different 
strategy a year andahalf ago is a moot point said pete 
quortrup a spokesman for the pilots some 180 members at the 
fivehour meeting seemed to accept that idea 
the longsmoldering issue has divided the ranks of the air line 
pilots association in recent months some of its 2800 members have 
insisted the union should hold a stake in the carrier being taken 
over by checchis wings holdings 
in a tender offer that expires at midnight tonight the group 
would pay 121 a share or about 365 billion for the airline 
checchi has said his group will entertain an employee 
investment but only after his buyout is complete 
still frustrated advocates of an employee stock ownership plan 
mailed flyers in recent weeks to 5000 pilots at northwest 
including a separate group of 2200 former republic airlines 
pilots that group has divorced itself from the investment idea 
i would much prefer to govern my own destiny as to have 
someone else govern it for me said tom beedem a dc10 pilot and 
former chairman of the northwest pilots master executive council 
beedem said before the meeting he was among those urging members 
to promote an employee ownership plan before settling their labor 
contract with northwest he also said such an agreement should be 
in place before a labor contract is signed 
with the ranks alerted advocates pitched their idea thursday at 
a bloomington hotel but the notion eventually was dropped without 
a vote 
later quortrup said master executive council chairman pete 
dodge recounted the history of pilot efforts to buy into northwest 
including unsuccessfully exploring the prospect last summer 
both arguments were received thoughtfully dodge said but 
the idea was abandoned for now because you cant change a 
strategy at this point the company is not going to be a public 
company that much longer 
the debate was emotional for some said quortrup because 
ownership appeals to pilots in a period of change and uncertainty 
the pilots also were briefed at midday by their labor contract 
negotiators who spent the rest of the day at the bargaining table 
after 28 months the two sides are still at odds over basic issues 
such as wages

the senior republican on the house banking 
committee is proposing a compromise intended to break a deadlock 
over how to fund president bushs proposed savings and loan bailout 
the dispute between the house and the senate is the most 
significant hurdle to be overcome if congress is to send savings 
and loan legislation to the presidents desk before leaving for its 
august vacation 
the senate in its bill adopted in april favored the 
administrations financing plan which would create a new 
quasiprivate agency to borrow 50 billion in sampl rescue costs 
that mechanism would keep the spending from ballooning the federal 
budget deficit 
the house in its plan passed last month would include the 50 
billion in the budget deficit in what democrats say is more honest 
accounting the plan would be slightly cheaper than the 
administrations because sampl funds would be borrowed directly 
through the federal government 
rep chalmers wylie of ohio the senior republican on the house 
banking committee said thursday that under his plan the first 25 
billion in sampl spending be borrowed this year and next the 
remaining 25 billion would go onbudget in 1991 
by that time the government would be selling enough property 
from failed sampls to partly offset the spending strain he said 
he conceded the scheme would put great strain on the ability of 
the administration and congress to reach agreement on the federal 
budget as the 1992 elections approach 
wylie said treasury secretary nicholas bradys visceral 
reaction was not very favorable but he said that brady 
nevertheless planned to raise the proposal when house and senate 
conferees next meet publicly on tuesday the staffs of the two 
chambers have been working behind closed doors trying to resolve

the environmental movement is attracting new 
followers these days from what some people might consider an 
unlikely place wall street 
since it began to gather momentum more than two decades ago the 
drive for cleaner air land and water around the world often has 
seemed at odds with the cause of economic expansion 
now in at least one noteworthy case the interests of the two 
camps appear to be converging if a good many stock market analysts 
are right the business of environmental cleanup and pollution 
control is shaping up as a growth industry in its own right for 
the 1990s 
for evidence of that you need look no further than the stock 
market where shares of companies such as waste management inc and 
browningferris industries the nations two largest watedisposal 
concerns climbed last week to record highs 
waste management at around 58 was up more than 6 from where 
it stood at the end of june and had more than doubled in price 
since late 1987 
browningferris which climbed to near 39 from 3325 at 
midyear also traded at double its levels of less than two years 
ago 
brokers said demand for those issues was swollen by buy orders 
from organizers of a new investment company that was assembling a 
portfolio of stocks in the environmentalservices business 
but there were other driving forces as well when leaders of the 
seven major industrialized nations issued a communique at the end 
of their economic summit meeting in paris earlier this month they 
devoted onethird of the document to environmental issues 
william reilly administrator of the federal environmental 
protection agency called that a major milestone 
in the united states president bush also has proposed 
intensified measures to deal with such problems as acid rain 
while there is no mistaking the momentum it has gathered 
however analysts say investors who want to ride the environmental 
wave face some significant hazards and uncertainties 
for one thing stockmarket participants began to discern the 
investment potential of environmentalservices stocks a long time 
ago 
the dow jones index of five pollution control and waste 
management stocks has more than sextupled since june 30 1982 
ranking near the top of the more than 80 industry groups tracked by 
the company over that span for established companies in the field 
the time for getting in on the ground floor appears long past 
in addition when a company encounters unexpected costs or other 
problems in some environmentalservices activity the past record 
suggests that its stock is likely to react harshly to any resulting 
earnings disappointment 
even as new waste management crises whether they be in 
medical waste nuclear waste or air pollution seize investors 
attention the surest profits remain in the solidwaste field 
says the value line investment survey in its latest quarterly 
apppraisal of the industrial services industry 
solidwaste handling is an established industry within which 
larger players can excel by adding technological refinement and 
managerial finesse to established operating procedures 
by comparison the investment advisory service says the 
cleanup of hazardous wastes often poses problems unique to 
individual sites and requires the development of new 
methodologies 
whatever the potential pitfalls the search has begun in earnest 
for companies and industries that might benefit from changes 
wrought by environmental concerns 
if the idea once was big business vs the environment it is 
now the environment as big business

the chicago mercantile exchange says it has 
reversed an earlier proposal to ban dual trading in most of its 
markets 
in a letter to its members the exchange thursday said 
acrosstheboard restrictions on the practice would be a serious 
mistake and that the practice should be allowed as long as 
surveillance measures are adequate to detect abuse 
dual trading is the longstanding practice among floor brokers at 
futures exchanges of trading for their own accounts and their 
customers 
the practice came under fire after the disclosure in january of 
a federal investigation of suspected trading fraud at the chicago 
merc and the chicago board of trade the worlds two largest 
futures exchanges 
critics say dual trading presents opportunities for floor 
brokers to put their own interests ahead of their customers by 
trading for their own accounts ahead of large customer orders that 
they know will move the market 
a blueribbon committee appointed by the merc to investigate 
trading practices proposed on april 19 that the exchange do away 
with dual trading in all markets except those where it is needed to 
maintain market liquidity 
but after reviewing the proposal the exchanges internal 
committee on dual trading recommended that the practice be allowed 
in any market in which federal regulators determine that the 
exchanges computerized tradereconstruction system produces an 
audit trail that is verifiably accurate to the nearest minute 90 
percent of the time

capital citiesabc inc says it has reached a 
tentative agreement with negotiators for its technicians union on a 
fouryear contract 
the deal was reached thursday after the union offered to 
compromise on issues relating to job security the company said 
the two sides have been negotiating for five months and an earlier 
proposal was rejected in may 
negotiators for the union the national association of broadcast 
employees and technicians said they would submit the contract to a 
vote without taking a position on it 
the unions members 2700 according to the union 2150 
according to the company will vote by august 11 the engineers 
at 1850 make up the largest unit withnin the union 
the union came to us and offered a very constructive and 
workable approach and this resulted in the agreement today said 
patricia matson a spokeswoman for cap citiesabc 
the company told its employees in a letter that the 
compromise became possible earlier this week when the union 
suggested to the company that the companys fouryear job guarantee 
to nabet was less significant to the union than the issue of 
separate seniority 
the company had offered to make the job guarantee four years 
instead of three but john krieger a spokesman for the national 
association of broadcast employees and technicians said it came 
with so many escape clauses that it was like a swiss cheese full 
of holes 
the company withdrew the jobguarantee proposal and substituted 
the seniority list compromise 
the new rules call for employees on local and network television 
seniority lists who were hired before thursday to have a higher 
priority than those hired after thursday who will be put on a new 
separate seniority list 
that new list will determine who was last hired should layoffs 
occur 
a separate seniority list for radio employees will be maintained 
as the company originally proposed 
in addition the company gave nabet assurances it would retain 
some radio engineers to perform work no longer subject to nabet 
jurisdiction 
its a compromise that they wont throw people out wholesale 
and hire new people krieger said 
he said 80 jobs had been at stake until the compromise and now 
the union was willing to take a chance that the compromise will 
work krieger said 
the proposal to be voted upon calls for a signing bonus of 10 
percent for the first year and pay increases of 3 percent in the 
second and third years and 4 percent in the fourth year the 
original plan called for a 5 percent lumpsum bonus in the fourth 
year 
nabet also represents publicists wardrobe people and 
newswriters in certain cities among other workers

municipal bond investors finally may be coming 
out from the dark 
unlike buyers of corporate and treasury bonds municipal bond 
buyers have no central place to turn to find out current trading 
prices of their investments 
newspapers rarely print lists of municipal bond prices and 
those lists that are available contain only a fraction of the 1 
million or more muni bond issues outstanding 
municipal bond investors also dont benefit from the disclosure 
rules that apply to corporate bond issuers these rules require 
release of detailed financial and background information so that 
corporate bond buyers can make an informed investment 
but several efforts under way could change all that 
late last month the securities and exchange commission approved 
the first formal disclosure rules for municipal bonds the rules 
grew out of the agencys fiveyear investigation of the 225 
billion bond default by the washington public power supply system 
the largest bond default in municipal bond history 
the new rules effective jan 1 will require brokerages 
underwriting municipal bond issues exceeding 1 million in value to 
obtain extensive information about the projects being financed the 
government agencies issuing the bonds and any foreseeable risks 
the bond underwriters then must release this information to all 
potential buyers in the form of official statements during a 
certain time period after the bonds are issued 
the sec rules also encourage the development of a central 
repository that would hold and distribute bond disclosure 
information that would make it easier for municipal bond investors 
to research before they buy 
on another front a trade group is studying the feasibility of 
devising a system to make municipal bond price information readily 
available to retail buyers possibly through a computer network 
similar to the one used for overthecounter stocks 
when investors in the 760 billion municipal bond market want 
to know what their bonds are worth they probably wont find them 
listed in the local newspaper the public securities association 
said in announcing a task force to study a pricing system 
instead investors must call their brokers who may or may not 
have the information at their fingertips said the psa which 
represents banks dealers and brokers that underwrite and sell 
municipal and us government bonds 
but establishing a system to provide trading prices wont be 
easy in part due to the vast number of muni bonds said psa 
president heather l ruth 
another problem she said is that many of the smaller bond 
issues such as those from regional school districts or smalltown 
sewer authorities are not actively traded that means it would be 
hard to establish a trading price if the bonds rarely change hands 
because of this any pricing system most likely would be limited 
to the most actively traded bonds ms ruth said it also may rely 
on indexes of similar kinds of bonds to show representative prices 
rather than prices of individual issues she added 
ms ruth said that despite the absence of disclosure 
requirements most of the larger municipal bond issuers such as 
state governments have provided detailed background information 
for years 
she said the neardefault by the city of new york on billions of 
dollars worth of bonds in the mid1970s was the catalyst for this 
practice 
before the crisis municipal bond issuers typically prepared 
only a one or twopage statement describing new bond offerings 
which was really a sales document ms ruth said 
but new yorks fiscal problems left a bad taste in the mouths of 
municipal bond investors prompting the major issuers to provide 
detailed reports on new issues she said the effect of the sec 
rules will be to spread this practice throughout the muni bond 
market she added 
municipal bonds were exempted from disclosure requirements when 
the sec was established in 1934 however they were not exempted 
from the antifraud regulations of the sec statute which bar bond 
dealers from providing misleading information to customers 
muni bonds were left out of the disclosure requirements for 
several reasons ms ruth said 
for one she said the default rate on municipal securities 
has always been extraordinarily low as compared with corporate 
securities 
another reason was concern that congress would be overstepping 
its bounds if it regulated how state and local goverments raise 
funds she said in addition most municipal bonds were owned by 
institutional investors who were thought to be savvy about the 
risks 
but the new york city crisis and the subsequent wppss default 
changed all that

delta air lines said friday it will appeal to the 
us supreme court a federal appeals court ruling which held that 
the association of flight attendants may pursue a mergerrelated 
claim for damages against delta 
delta spokesman bill berry said the airlines attorneys were 
preparing an appeal of the 30 ruling this week by the us court 
of appeals which held that the union can seek to compel 
arbitration over western airlines failure in 1987 to bind delta to 
a collective bargaining agreement between the union and western 
western was merged into atlantabased delta two years ago the 
ruling was seen as favoring unions that have been hurt by airline 
mergers 
berry said the matter also had been addressed in two california 
decisions in favor of two former western flight attendants unions 
the supreme court overturned both rulings and sent them back to the 
9th us circuit court of appeals he said 
delta is going to go ahead and appeal this to the supreme 
court berry said we really thought the appeals courts 
knowing what the supreme court had done would have the same 
finding 
before the merger between the two airlines afa negotiated major 
wage and work rule concessions covering westerns flight attendants 
in exchange the union won a clause in the collective bargaining 
agreement requiring western to bind any successor or merger partner 
to the agreement 
western refused to arbitrate the unions subsequent grievance 
over the alleged breach of contract for failing to bind delta

american airlines officials are unsure 
how an old discount fare was reloaded into a computer reservation 
system allowing travelers to book roundtrip flights to anywhere 
in the country for 152 
travel agents with access to americans sabre reservations 
system discovered the snafu early thursday and booked an untold 
number of delighted clients the airline said 
the vaunted sabre which feeds flight reservation and ticketing 
information to 14000 travel agencies worldwide has been at the 
center of two other scheduling fiascos 
in 1988 american said it lost an estimated 50 million in 
potential sales when a faulty sabre program prematurely cut off 
sales of discount tickets and in may the system crashed for about 
12 hours leaving travel agencies with blank screens 
american spokesman john hotard said the airline was 
investigating how a promotional fare offered for several days after 
the fourth of july holiday made an unscheduled reappearance 
complete with a new expiration date of sept 30 
somebody just loaded it in by mistake hotard told the 
dallas morning news once we found out we started pulling it out 
of most of the markets 
american hadnt determined the financial impact of the mistake 
or the number of lucky flyers who booked a flight under the bogus 
fare before the error was corrected by midafternoon hotard said 
but american will honor all tickets issued under the 152 fare 
he said 
about the only restriction for the fare was that it required a 
saturday night stayover but not even an advance purchase was 
required 
we ticketed as many as we could said michele mckechnie 
coowner of elite travel inc in arlington we booked 25 to 30 
people whoever was lucky enough to call while it was in there

strikebound eastern airlines has received a cash 
infusion of 75 million to help it with its rebuilding plan in 
coming months 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland on thursday approved the 
release of the cash from an escrow fund to eastern the airline 
initially asked lifland for the release of 100 million from its 
major creditors while a committee representing the creditors asked 
that only 40 million to be released 
however the parties agreed to the 75 million figure and the 
judge approved it with the understanding eastern could request 
additional money from the escrow fund which contains money from 
the sales of eastern assets 
miamibased eastern said it expected to file its reorganization 
plan today which will discuss how it plans to emerge from chapter 
11 bankruptcy at about twothirds its prestrike size 
easterns exclusivity period during which other parties to the 
case cannot file reorganization proposals under bankruptcy law is 
due to end today 
the airline which recently slashed fares in an effort to lure 
skeptical travelers now is raising prices on its most heavily 
traveled routes eastern is hiking fares at least 20 on its 
cheapest roundtrip fares originating at several cities including 
its miami and atlanta hubs marketing vice president george brennan 
said thursday in some cases roundtrip fares are going up about 
40 
the move takes pressure off easterns competitors to cut their 
fares or keep discounts theyve recently announced 
in another development published reports indicated eastern was 
prepared to sell its latin american routes and most of the terminal 
space they occupy to american airlines because of continuing 
difficulties in contract negotiations with striking pilots 
a memo from eastern senior vice president tom matthews to the 
air line pilots association said the route sale idea would be 
scrapped if the company reached a contract agreement with the 
pilots according to reports thursday in the fort lauderdale 
sunsentinel and the miami herald 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the company would not 
comment on the reports alton becker a spokesman for american 
said the dallasbased airline unit of amr corp has done no deals 
with eastern but added we are an acquirer if any airline has 
assets it wants to sell well look at them 
eastern pilots based in atlanta passed a resolution late 
wednesday urging the pilots union leadership to continue supporting 
a buyout bid for eastern by chicago businessman joseph ritchie if 
the bid fails the atlanta pilots said the union should pursue 
another bid and if that is unsuccessful it should push for the 
appointment of a special trustee to run the airline 
if that fails the last resort according to the resolution 
would be to support the liquidation of easterns assets the pilots 
at the atlanta hub carry considerable weight within the pilots 
unions eastern unit 
in washington sen sam nunn dga became the latest lawmaker 
to express concern about the eastern situation in a letter sent 
wednesday to president bush he asked him to direct transportation 
secretary samuel skinner and attorney general dick thornburgh to 
undertake an immediate review of eastern 
eastern parent texas air corp announced separately wednesday 
that it placed orders for 28 billion worth of boeing 737300 
aircraft to be divided between eastern and continental airlines 
another texas air subsidiary the order includes 50 firm orders and 
options to buy 50 more of the jets 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo and eastern president phil 
bakes said wednesday in atlanta that the transactions demonstrate 
confidence that eastern will be a thriving operation in the 1990s 
the airline is in the midst of a 4monthold strike by machinists 
pilots and flight attendants 
lorenzo and bakes also acknowledged that the august expansion of 
easterns flight schedule will not be as large as originally 
announced but they maintained that the smaller expansion is not a 
sign that the rebuilding program is faltering 
the airline originally promised to have 390 flights a day by 
aug 1 but it said this week some reductions may be necessary 
before the strike march 4 eastern had about 1100 daily flights 
it now has 220

a california company has developed a telephone 
for the hearing impaired that for the first time focuses on the 
most common type of sound that some people cannot hear instead of 
simply turning up the volume an executive said friday 
the walker clarity telephone working much like a graphic 
equalizer on stereo recording equipment boosts the highfrequency 
sounds that most hearingimpaired people have difficulty hearing 
there are over 20 million people in the united states who 
have some form of hearing impairment and roughly 95 percent have 
loss in the high frequencies walker equipment corp president 
marv tseu said 
for the hearing impaired normal telephone conversations can 
resemble the sounds made when a stereos bass control is turned up 
too much while the treble is lowered 
this affects recognition of consonants and makes it difficult 
for the hearing impaired to distinguish between words such as 
tomato or potato phone conversations sound muddled 
when you lose the ability to hear these highfrequency sounds 
you lose a lot of ability to understand the language tseu said 
by telephone from his office in santa cruz calif 
this problem is compounded by lowfrequency noise on the phone 
system itself merely turning up the volume in many cases just 
increases the noise without making the highfrequency sounds more 
distinct 
if you take a standard telephone and amplify it it raises all 
of the sounds equally all you get is a louder muddle tseu said 
the new telephone has a sliding control that allows the user to 
balance the volume and the treble the highfrequency sounds for 
maximum clarity 
the walker clarity telephone will assist anyone with mild to 
severe hearing loss but not those with profound hearing loss tseu 
said it works best when used without a hearing aid or with a 
hearing aid that has a telephone coil for use on hearing 
aidcompatible phones he added 
the phone also has a lowfrequency warblingtype ring a bar 
that lights up when the phone rings enlarged keypad and a braille 
dot on the number 5 key to aid the visually impaired 
it also features a mute button that will turn off the mouthpiece 
as long as the button is depressed this shuts off background noise 
that sometimes feeds back through the earpiece tseu said 
the company began shipping the phone last month to hearing aid 
dispensers and audiologists tseu said the phones are made in hong 
kong and retail for 287 
walker is a division of plantronics inc a major manufacturer 
of of telephone headsets

bat industries plc has begun in earnest its 
lobbying effort to get the british government to block sir james 
goldsmiths hostile 21 billion takeover bid analysts were divided 
friday about its chances of success 
meanwhile baring brothers and co ltd a privately owned 
merchant bank was exploring independently interest among financial 
institutions in launching an alternative bid sources familiar with 
the talks said friday 
the goldsmith group through a new company called hoylake 
investments plc is offering 1386 a share worth of securities 
mostly highyielding junk bonds for bat launched july 11 the bid 
is 80 percent debtfinanced 
the goldsmith group says it wants to break up bat by selling off 
its nontobacco interests 
bat confirmed friday that 170 members of parliament have signed 
a motion calling for the bid to be referred to the monopolies and 
mergers commission for an investigation on the ground that the 
offers highly leveraged nature is against the public interest 
the members of parliament are seeking a preliminary debate on a 
motion condemning the use of highly leveraged junk bond financing 
to take over major british companies for the express purpose of 
breaking them up bat said 
such financing poses a direct threat to british industry 
the motion said 
it wasnt known whether house of commons leaders would approve a 
debate before parliament adjourns on july 28 for its summer recess 
which extends until oct 17 
a bid can be held up for months if it is referred to the 
monopolies commission under the usual procedure the office of 
fair trading recommends to the trade secretary whether a matter 
should be referred to the commission 
bat chairman patrick sheehy has said the company also intends to 
make a direct submission to the office of fair trading seeking a 
referral 
i think there is more than even chance that the bid will be 
referred said bruce davidson an analyst with the london 
investment firm smith new court plc the political implications 
are enormous should things go wrong the politicians need the 
assurance that at least they would be able to say they had looked 
at it 
nigel utley an analyst with laing and cruickshank said that 
despite the considerable support bat has been able to attract in 
the house of commons i would have thought still that the 
government would not refer it 
utley also noted a reference doesnt guarantee that the 
governments final decision would be negative in the end it 
would just give them bat more time to plan a defense 
the government has blocked bids in the past mostly on 
competition grounds but also for public interest reasons 
energy secretary cecil parkinson who has no say in the matter 
but who as a cabinet member may reflect the governments views in 
this case said i have to say i rather regretted the arrival of 
the junk bond i dont think its mans greatest invention 
but the minister added at a luncheon of the association of 
american correspondents in london its a free country its not 
the governments business its bats and bats shareholders and 
they have to make up their minds 
us insurance regulators also are looking at the bid because 
bat owns farmers insurance group inc of los angeles 
a source close to barings said the merchant bank was prepared to 
act as a focal point for shareholders who want to maximize 
their investment barings declined to comment 
a spokesman for bat who spoke on condition he was not 
identified said the conglomerate had not been approached by 
barings but added bat is always happy to talk to shareholders 
and barings is one 
barings has been exploring the possibility among others of 
restructuring the conglomerate into a single holding company with 
four classes of shares to represent its four principal businesses 
of tobacco retailing paper and financial services sources said 
utley one of the analysts said i think its a natural 
response from the investment banking community who will be looking 
for ways to help bat realize value for their shareholders im sure 
this is just one of several possibilities they are looking at

a lawyer who challenged the reorganization 
plan of the ah robins co said friday his clients would accept 
without further appeal the plans 25 billion compensation package 
for dalkon shield claimants if robins would fund the package 
pending a limited appeal on a separate issue 
however lawyers for robins have rejected the proposal by alan 
b morrison of the washingtonbased public citizen litigation 
group we dont believe his proposal affords the basis for 
negotiations or discussion said roscoe puckett a robins 
spokesman 
robins which filed for protection from creditors under chapter 
11 of the federal bankruptcy law in august 1985 as claims mounted 
against the birth control device would be acquired by the new 
yorkbased american home products corp under a reorganization 
approved in federal court last summer and upheld by the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals on june 16 
morrison who has until sept 14 to ask the us supreme court 
to review the case wrote a letter june 28 to robins attorneys 
saying that a tentative decision had been reached to seek such a 
review 
however morrison wrote the petition to the high court would be 
limited to the reorganization plans injunction that bars dalkon 
shield injury lawsuits against robins officers and other third 
parties if robins and ahp would complete the merger pending that 
appeal and fund the 25 billion trust 
the trust is to pay the claims of some 195000 women who said 
they were injured by the intrauterine device which robins sold in 
the early 1970s 
robins has insisted on a final court resolution of the entire 
reorganization before funding the trust and robins attorneys in 
a letter dated july 13 rejected morrisons offer to separate the 
injunction issue 
we firmly believe that further appeals of the plan 
particularly after five judges have considered it and have judged 
it proper are not in and indeed are contrary to the best 
interests of the dalkon shield claimants and other constituencies 
of robins said the reply signed by attorneys james c roberts 
and alesia ranneymarinelli of the mays amp valentine law firm of 
richmond 
morrison said his clients want to pursue allegations that 
certain officers of robins and others including attorneys who 
represented the company in earlier dalkon shield litigation 
conspired to cover up evidence about knowledge of flaws in the iud 
women who used the device have raised injury claims ranging from 
pelvic infections to sterility to fetal deformities 
in a followup letter thursday to robins lawyers morrison said 
robins shareholders in addition to dalkon shield claimants would 
benefit from a separation of the mergertrust fund issues and the 
injunction issue because the stockholders would be paid for their 
robins shares without further delay 
the merger with ahp involves a 700 million exchange of stock 
the companys chairman ec robins sr and its president e 
claiborne robins jr are the principal beneficiaries of the 
injunctions included in the plan morrison wrote 
morrison whose initial offer was made only to robins sent 
copies of his second letter and the prior correspondence to 
attorneys for dalkon shield claimants and robins stockholders in 
what he acknowledged was an effort to put pressure on robins to 
reconsider the separation issue 
neither mark ellenberg a lawyer for the claimants nor robert 
miller the stockholders attorney could be reached immediately 
morrison said in his second letter that no final decision has 
been reached on whether to go to the supreme court 
during the appeal of the case only 100 million of the 25 
billion trust package has been available to pay dalkon shield 
claims 
more than 95 percent of claimants who participated in balloting 
on whether to approve the reorganization plan voted for it 
morrison argued in the appeal before the 4th circuit that the 
votes should have been weighted so that women with larger claims 
would have a greater voice in deciding the issue

soybean futures prices closed modestly lower 
friday on the chicago board of trade reflecting improved growing 
conditions in the midwest while corn and wheat futures finished 
narrowly mixed in quiet trading 
analysts said four days of showers in the western corn belt had 
revived corn and soybean crops and forecasts for the coming week 
predicted no return to the withering heat of late june and early 
july 
news that federal regulators had ordered italian grain merchant 
ferruzzi finanziaria spa to reduce its holdings in the 
nowexpired july futures contract last week also weighed on the 
soybean market analysts said 
the news prompted worries that ferruzzi might be ordered to 
reduce its position in the august contract 
but ted mao a grain specialist in new york with shearson lehman 
hutton inc said the ferruzzi news was a minor factor in fridays 
market 
the market in general has been responding to better weather 
he said 
at the close wheat was 2 cents lower to cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 395 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 1 cent higher with september at 239 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with september at 150 a bushel 
and soybeans were 3 cents to 7 cents lower with august at 674 a

winchells donut houses the nations 
secondlargest chain of doughnut shops agreed to be acquired for 
40 million by shato holdings ltd a vancouverbased restaurant 
and real estate firm 
shato a privatelyheld firm said thursday it will pay 380 
for each of winchells 88 million shares 
the balance of the cash payment will be used to liquidate 
winchells publicly traded partnership settle debts and cover 
transaction costs said nancy larson winchells director of tax 
and investor services 
the deal must be approved by a majority of winchells 
shareholders 
shato owns more than 100 restaurants and catering outlets in 
british columbia and a land development company 
second only to dunkin donuts among the nations doughnut 
chains winchells has 657 stores in 14 western states in the late 
1970s the chain had nearly 1000 stores 
winchells has struggled since it was spun off by dennys 
restaurants in 1987 the chain lost 128 million in 1988 and 
posted a loss of 34 million on 363 million in revenue during 
the first quarter of 1989 
winchells had been looking for a buyer since june 8 one day 
after tw services which owns 42 percent of the doughnut chain 
accepted a 165 billion takeover bid by coniston partners of new 
york 
tw services also owns dennys and el pollo loco restaurants 
coniston has said it will retain both chains 
ward lendenmeyer an analyst at sutro amp co said poor 
management competition from groceryowned bakeries and sluggish 
demand contributed to winchells decline 
in 1971 winchells bought out all its franchises to operate 
them as companyowned stores 
that was a big mistake lendenmeyer said there isnt 
enough sales volume to pay employees very much people tend to 
work harder when they have a stake as a franchisee 
winchells was founded in 1948 by verne h winchell who sold 
used cars and jukeboxes before opening his first doughnut shop in

the turner broadcasting system inc shareholders 
meeting was transformed into a debate on fairness in media friday 
as a watchdog group accused chairman ted turner of using his cable 
television network as a vehicle for promoting liberal political 
causes 
reed irvine chairman of washingtonbased accuracy in media 
said conservative organizations have a difficult time getting their 
views aired on turners tbs superstation though the cable station 
provides much free time to liberal groups which he said turner 
supports 
specifically irvine said tbs has given nine hours of prime time 
this year to shows produced or backed by the better world society 
a group headed by turner that tends to support liberal causes 
irvine who owns 200 shares of tbs stock also criticized turner 
for refusing to air an antiabortion film following the thursday 
night broadcast of abortion for survival a program that 
favored the prochoice position 
if youre going to give free air time distribute it 
equitably irvine said 
the exchange between turner and irvine took up nearly an hour of 
the 90minute meeting turner apologized to shareholders who came 
to atlanta expecting hear about the operation of tbs and instead 
got nitpicking 
turner acknowledged that his personal feelings play a part in 
his decisions on which special programs to broadcast but he said 
he is not bound to show the offerings of any organization he said 
each program is evaluated on its own merits 
he said conservative opinions are aired frequently on his cable 
news network but he did not want to be bound to presenting 
opposing viewpoints on his entertainment station 
we have to make these judgments turner said someone is 
opposed to everything 
irvine questioned the business wisdom of showing the abortion 
program for which turner said he did not try to sell advertising 
three times on tbs 
turner contended that tbs will not lose money on the abortion 
program because ad space was not normally sold out for those slots 
anyway he said one hour of prime time generally is worth 100000 
we couldnt do it no ads every night he said we could 
easily do it once a month without any problem you know we do 
things differently from the other networks and were growing 
rapidly and theyre not

the bush administration said friday that it 
was launching a round of negotiations with west germany japan 
south korea and norway in an effort to halt certain subsidies those 
nations provide for their domestic shipbuilding industries 
the decision was announced by us trade representative carla 
hills who said the talks would have a deadline of producing 
results over the next eight months 
hills acted after the shipbuilders council of america the 
lobbying group for the us industry filed a petition charging 
that foreign commercial shipbuilding subsidies offered by the four 
countries violated international trade rules against such subsidies 
the four nations account for nearly 60 percent of all the 
commerical ship construction on order around the world because of 
the subsidies the american shipbuilding industry is in a state 
of virtual collapse the shipbuilders council had argued in its 
petition 
us shipbuilders had petitioned hills to begin an investigation 
into the subsidies with the threat that if they were not removed 
within a year the four nations could face us trade sanctions 
hills however rejected the industrys request for the formal 
investigation with its more strict deadlines for sanctions in 
favor of eight months of informal talks held under the auspices of 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade the genevabased 
organization which regulates world trade 
she said if the talks fail to produce results by march 31 of 
next year she would accept the petition from the us shipbuilders 
to consider actual trade sanctions 
i will review our progress toward a multilateral agreement by 
march 31 1990 if i believe in consultation with the industry 
that insufficient progress is being made in our negotiations i 
will invite the shipbuilders to resubmit their petition she 
said in announcing her decision 
when us shipbuilders filed their petititon they claimed that 
shipyards in the four countries were getting large government 
subsidies that had enabled them to sell ships at cutrate prices 
while us shipyards had received no new contracts for commercial 
vessels since 1985 
the petition had the support of 96 members of congress including 
representatives from texas mississippi louisiana virginia 
maryland and maine which have large shipyards in their districts

allegheny international inc on friday 
introduced its sixth proposal to reorganize its consumer products 
business including its crown jewels sunbeam corp and 
nonoperating chemetron corp 
the company acknowledged that the framework of a plan adopted by 
its board may lack enough support among creditors to win adoption 
in us bankruptcy court where allegheny international has been 
trying to reorganize since february 1988 
management has so far filed five reorganization plans in court 
all of which have failed 
this particular version has the support of somebody other than 
the management its different in this regard said robert sable 
attorney for unsecured creditors this has a little more momentum 
than some of the others but its not a sure thing by any means 
the latest proposal calls for paying 400 million in cash to 
settle claims against sunbeam and the principal on allegheny 
internationals secured bank debt 
a 50 million note would be issued against claims by sunbeams 
institutional lenders and the parents senior secured bank lenders 
the note is to be paid on claims filed since allegheny 
international sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
federal bankruptcy law it could be surrendered after one year to 
acquire twothirds of the common stock in the reorganized company 
allegheny international said it had a commitment for bank 
financing for the plan unsecured lenders would get bonds and 
preferred stock and shareholders would be left with 5 percent of 
the equity in the reorganized company 
the company said it anticipates filing the new plan in 
bankruptcy court in august 
allegheny internationals fifth plan filed in court may 31 
called for a separate reorganization for sunbeam the plan did not 
receive enough creditor support to win adoption 
chemetron is the nonoperating remnant of a former chemical and 
industrial gas business 
allegheny internationals management no longer has the exclusive 
right to propose reorganization plans various creditor groups are 
drafting plans but sable said none expects to file in court 
within the next couple of weeks

nebraska investor warren e buffett has come 
calling on the takeover battleweary gillette co playing the role 
of squire to the twicetargeted razor company 
buffett nicknamed the oracle of omaha for his canny 
investments and forthright business advice has a reputation for 
taking sizable stakes in a limited number of companies and holding 
them sometimes for years analysts hailed the move as a chance for 
gillette to recover from its costly battles against two hostile 
bids in three years 
its a masterstroke harry wells who follows gillette for 
the boston investment firm of adams harkness amp hill said friday 
one of the things that this does is totally take gillette out of 
play 
it obviously can reduce their nervousness a bit said brenda 
lee landry of morgan stanley amp co in new york 
essentially i think it will give investors some confidence 
landry added theyve sort of got buffetts blessing 
gillette announced thursday that buffett chairman of omaha 
nebbased berkshire hathaway inc had purchased 600 million of 
gillette preferred stock convertible into an 11 percent stake in 
the company and had taken a seat on the gillette board of directors 
his record as an astute longterm investor is widely 
recognized and his investment in gillette is a highly favorable 
development for the company its stockholders and employees said 
gillette chairman colman m mockler jr 
buffett was traveling friday and could not immediately be 
reached at his office in omaha 
on thursday he issued a prepared statement saying gillette is 
synonymous with highly successful international consumer 
marketing and is exactly the sort of business in which we like to 
invest for the long term 
despite buffetts good reputation analysts said they dont 
perceive him as a perennial white squire or friendly investor 
riding to the aid of besieged companies 
well to be sure hes not altruistic wells said hes 
making a good investment 
berkshire hathaway is a 6 billion conglomerate with interests 
including an encyclopedia publisher a candy maker an omaha 
furniture mart and investments in coca cola co capital citiesabc 
inc and salomon brothers 
the 57yearold investor known for the pithy annual reports he 
writes himself sent a 21page letter to shareholders this year 
that said berkshires management team gained 569 million in net 
worth in 1988 contributing to an average net worth gain of 23 
percent over the last 24 years 
his interests include 63 percent of cocacola worth about 
115 billion in september 1987 salomon disclosed it had sold a 
12 percent stake to buffett preventing corporate investor ronald 
o perelman from acquiring the stock 
gillette has successfully fought off two hostile takeover bids 
in the last three years but each time at a substantial cost the 
company undertook a major restructuring after turning down a 412 
billion revlon group inc buyout offer in november 1986 
in august 1988 gillette repurchased 156 million shares to head 
off an attempted takeover by coniston partners of new york 
coniston agreed not to pursue gillette for 10 years 
coniston general partner paul tierney jr had little comment on 
the buffett purchase 
i wish warren buffett the very best we have no longer any 
investment in gillette tierney said

but greenspans comments were open to numerous interpretations 
dealers said according to one view the fed might think it already 
has done enough to enliven the economy which in recent months has 
sent out sluggish signals 
if this is true the central bank might not want to drive down 
interest rates any further until it determines whether the economy 
needs extra stimulation falling us interest rates tend to reduce 
demand for dollars

supply raised speculation that fed actions in recent weeks have 
provided significant economic stimulation

m2 jumped 175 billion in the week ended july 10 m2 includes all 
money readily available for spending such as cash and travelers 
checks plus accounts like savings deposits and moneymarket mutual 
funds

eased by the m2 number said brady benson a currency market

in european trading the dollar recovered ground as traders 
adjusted their currency holdings ahead of sundays elections for

soybean futures prices fell modestly friday on the chicago board 
of trade while an executive of the italian firm ferruzzi 
finanziaria spa said the exchange had put the soybean market 
in serious trouble by forcing traders to liquidate their 
holdings 
analysts attributed fridays price decline more to improved 
growing conditions than to the ongoing dispute between ferruzzi and 
the exchange 
corn and wheat futures finished mixed in quiet trading 
on other markets porkbelly futures prices fell sharply while 
livestock futures were mixed precious metals advanced and crude 
oil futures declined 
soybeans settled 3 cents to 7 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in august at 673 a bushel wheat was 2 cents lower 
to cent higher with september at 395 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to 1 cent higher with september at 239 a bushel and oats 
were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with september at 150 a bushel 
analysts said four days of showers in the western corn belt had 
revived corn and soybean crops and forecasts for the coming week 
predicted no return to the withering heat of late june and early 
july 
news that federal regulators had ordered ferruzzi to reduce its 
holdings in the nowexpired july futures contract last week also 
weighed on the soybean market prompting worries that ferruzzi 
might be forced to reduce its reputedly sizeable position in the 
august contract 
but ted mao a grain specialist in new york with shearson lehman 
hutton inc said the ferruzzi news was a minor factor in fridays 
market 
the market in general has been responding to better weather 
he said 
in des moines iowa ferruzzi executive david swanson urged an 
audience of more than 1700 soybean producers and traders to form a 
committee to study and improve the chicago board of trade 
today as we are well aware the market is in serious 
trouble swanson president of ferruzzis central soya co 
subsidiary told the annual convention of the american soybean 
association 
the board of trade issued an emergency order july 11 requiring 
traders to reduce their holdings in the july soybean contract to 1 
million bushels prior to the contracts expiration the contract 
expired on thursday 
the order was widely seen as a move to prevent ferruzzi from 
cornering the soybean market a charge the company denies 
board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann told the soybean 
growers that the exchange took the action to prevent defaults on 
contracts to deliver soybeans without the order the board has

supply of deliverable soybeans 
frozen porkbelly futures prices fell sharply on the chicago 
mercantile exchange erasing the previous days gains and a 
government report released after the close of trading left analysts 
divided on the markets likely future course 
the agriculture department report showed 1288 million pounds of 
pork bellies in the nations commercial freezers as of july 1 the 
largest july 1 supply since the recordhigh 1332 million pounds 
reported in 1964 
the hefty supply of bellies the part of the pig from which 
bacon is made has pulled prices down to nineyear lows 
thomas moragan president of sterling research corp in 
arlington heights ill said recent indications of increased belly 
usage suggest the supplies of bellies might at last be dwindling 
and prices could start moving higher 
but charles levitt shearsons chief livestock analyst was 
skeptical 
when youre at a nineyear low anything is possible but the 
fact remains that we have the largest supply of pork bellies in 
storage in 25 years levitt said

corona extra that trendy pricey mexican 
beer you wash down with a lime has lost some appeal among us 
yuppies and forced its brewer to seek other customers namely 
lightbeer drinkers and the japanese 
in a new advertising campaign the american promoters of corona 
are peddling a new light brew theyre also stressing coronas 
tropical mexican roots and the heavier versions popularity with 
seasoned california surfers 
the us market is flat because of lifestyle changes said 
michael j mazzoni executive vice president and general manager of 
chicagobased barton beers ltd which imports corona to the 
western united states from cervecerias modelo the brewer 
theres a new emphasis on fitness and sales are flat with the 
yuppies whose purchases once enabled corona to threaten dutch 
brew heineken as the no 1 us import mazzoni said in an 
interview 
corona sells for about 5 a sixpack in the us market more 
than double what it costs in mexico it seemed to draw 
styleconscious affluent young americans like a magnet with its 
clear longneck bottles and the mexican custom of downing some 
alcoholic beverages with a squeeze of lime 
the mexican beers stagnant sales in the united states partly 
reflect a decline in alcoholic beverage drinking by many americans 
which is affecting rival brews as well 
at 24 billion cases the us beer market grew negligibly over 
1987 while imports rose just 04 percent after two years of strong 
growth 
coronas sales in the us market peaked in 1987 at nearly 25 
million cases last year sales totaled about 22 million cases 
according to statistics compiled by impact a newsletter about the 
us beverage industry heineken sold more than 34 million cases in 
the united states in both 1987 and 1988 
the mexican beers hold on the no 2 spot is secure and sales 
still far exceed 1984 when the brewer sold about 15 million cases 
in the united states but the stalled growth has provoked concern 
weve really been clobbered over the past year mazzoli 
said we need some excitement 
modelo hopes to stir something up by introducing what hardened 
beer drinkers may consider a contradiction in terms corona light 
its the final evolution in light said thomas a mcnichols 
bartons marketing director 
while total us beer consumption hasnt grown light brews are 
becoming more popular for the first time three of the five 
topselling brands are lights and the trend has carried over into 
imports 
modelo shipped its first case of corona light northward in april 
and began testmarketing in los angeles san francisco san diego 
phoenix and chicago eventually a new plant in guadalajara will 
produce up to 400000 cases of corona light a month 
there are people who say coronas already light but i cant 
tell you how many times ive heard people say wrongly theyre 
worried about its calorie content said mazzoli 
corona averages about 148 calories a bottle the brewer says 
despite rumors its as high as 400 calories the light varietys 
calorie content is 105 
modelo and its us distributors barton and gambrinis importing 
co inc of san antonio plan to duplicate marketing tactics used 
to promote corona lights heavier cousin relying at first on 
wordofmouth advertising by introducing the brand in trendy 
restaurants and bars 
the successful and voiceless corona television ads filmed in 
such tropical resorts as ixtapa also will be used to tout corona 
light mcnichols said 
the brewer also is trying to counter its slippage in the 
american market by reaching out to drinkers in japan where corona 
sells for 740 a bottle 
were going after young adults the opinion leaders and what 
we call the sensitive trend leaders said john r hamaguchi 
import marketing director for hiroya co ltd of tokyo japans 
oldest liquor merchant 
theres the opinion leader the one always with the latest 
news fashions and hairstyles and who drink corona because its a 
new thing hamaguchi said 
then theres the sensitive trend leaders coronas a very 
sophisticated item in japan especially in tokyo night clubs he 
said thats where the sensitive trend leaders go 
since it introduced corona to japan in july 1987 hiroya sold 
130000 cases of corona through 1988 making the beer the no 5 
import and 10th overall we want 1 million cases five years from 
now hamaguchi said 
unlike the western ad pitch the japanese ad campaign is full of 
words in fact it features a man singing singing about what he 
likes and how corona fits 
i like twobranch roads in the middle of the city 
a rhythm that stimulates the right side of my brain 
a melody that has lost the code begins to be heard 
if i take the right road itll lead me to the end of the ground 
if i take the left road itll lead me to the end of the sea 
in my left hand ive got a lime 
in my right hand ive got a corona 
at this moment im in the bottle of paradise

million to gain control of integrated resources but the deal was 
called off may 25 by the new york financial services company 
even before the collapse of that deal analysts were saying the 
corporation lacked enough capital to have room to maneuver in such 
deals 
despite the uncertainty that has surrounded ich thomas o 
hicks chief executive officer and chairman of hicks muse said 
thursday in a release 
we are attracted to the niche characteristics and strong 
market position of its core operating companies it would be our 
intention to follow our practice in previous acquisitions of 
inviting key management to invest with us in the transaction 
hicks muse was formed in may by hicks and john r muse a 
former managing director of prudentialbache securities inc

lead to a resurgence of inflation

marion laboratories inc chairman ewing 
kauffman didnt want to relinquish control of the company he 
founded almost 40 years ago but says he knew he had to 
the drugmakers future depended on new products and heavy 
competition was blocking it from finding those on its own 
i personally did not wish to sell its my baby kauffman 
said in an interview on friday 
but he said his concern for stockholders and employees won out 
he encouraged marion officials to look for a partner and supported 
their choice of a dow chemical co subsidiary merrell dow 
pharmaceuticals 
under a deal announced monday the merger will create the third 
largest pharmaceutical company in the nation kauffman will sell a 
big chunk of his 23 percent stake in marion and accept a switch to 
chairman emeritus he says hell leave in one year 
it is emotional kauffman said i originally did 
everything in this company 
but kauffmans reduced role at marion wont be the end of the 
hard work he loves in the wings wait expanded roles with the 
kansas city royals baseball team he coowns and more charity work 
at 72 kauffman remains as plainspoken and practical as he was 
in 1950 when he took 5000 in cardplaying earnings from the navy 
and started a business selling pills to physicians and hospitals 
from the basement of his kansas city home 
a picture of that house hangs inside the front door of the 
companys current headquarters dubbed the taj mahal by 
kauffman 
kauffman worked 16 hours a day as marion grew quickly going 
public in 1965 that was all fun that was a lot of fun he 
said 
after a dry spell in the 1970s marions sales exploded in the 
late 1970s on the strength of the heart drug cardizem 
unlike many pharmaceutical companies marion doesnt do its own 
basic chemical research instead it licenses compounds from other 
companies develops them for medical use and sells them 
company officials project 1 billion in sales this year but 
analysts said those sales would dip in 1992 when other companies 
can begin making generic versions of cardizem 
more importantly marion didnt have another big moneymaking 
drug under development merrell dow with a strong research budget 
seemed the perfect fit 
the merger guarantees growth through the 90s and past the year 
2000 he said it will make us not only stronger but better 
it also will put a lot of money into the pockets of kauffman 
his family and trusts and foundations kauffman will sell 39 
percent of his stake in marion under terms of the merger his stake 
is currently valued at about 13 billion 
much of that money will go into his charitable foundation and 
some will be pumped into the royals he said kauffman plans a 
bigger role with the team especially in player development and 
scouting 
despite his success most kansas citians dont think of kauffman 
as the founder of a billiondollar company hes simply mr k 
the man who brought majorleague baseball back to the midwest after 
charles finley took the athletics away in 1967 
but the whole thing was an accident he said civic leaders 
recruited him almost against his will and wife muriel encouraged 
him 
she said that i was working too hard and i needed some 
diversion kauffman said 
in many ways the team has gone against his businessman 
instincts 
i would have made more money if id invested it in a savings 
and loan at 5 percent he says with a grimace 
kauffman sold part interest in the royals to memphis businessman 
avron fogelman in the early 1980s he discounts recent speculation 
about fogelmans realestate business and says the team wont be 
moved from kansas city 
it is secure now and it will be secure in the future he 
said 
although just a casual fan kauffman said he has enjoyed the 
royals winning years including the 1985 world series championship 
hes also enjoyed his eighthgraders 
since 1988 kauffman has offered to send nearly 700 of them to 
college or vocational school if they promise to stay in school 
keep up their grades and steer clear of teen parenthood and drugs 
kauffman estimates the first group of 225 students from his 
innercity high school alma mater would cost him 13 million its 
money wellspent both for the fun he has and the practical 
benefits he said 
its going to get more difficult as they get older of course 
but we think were going to turn a lot of them into taxpaying 
citizens instead of welfare recipients 
for the future those activities will keep him busy 
im satisfied with all this he said but im not 
fulfilled you always have more you want to do

a federal judge has ruled against 
procter amp gamble co in a patent dispute with kimberlyclark corp 
defeating the consumer products giants bid for control of the 3 
billion disposablediaper market 
procter amp gamble had charged that the dallasbased manufacturer 
of superabsorbent huggies diapers with copying procter amp 
gambles design of superabsorbent pampers 
procter amp gamble based in cincinnati was seeking removal of 
huggies from store shelves and unspecified monetary damages 
but us district judge falcon hawkins ruled thursday that a 
procter amp gamble patent for its superabsorbent diaper is 
unenforceable because the company intended to deceive a patent 
examiner 
procter amp gamble spokeswoman carol boyd said the company planned 
to appeal the decision 
procter amp gamble is the leader in the disposable diaper 
industry with 47 percent of market kimberlyclark is no 2 with 
about 30 percent of the market 
at the heart of the lawsuit was a procter amp gamble patent to 
combine wood pulp fluff and superabsorbent material to produce a 
thinner diaper 
after the application was rejected several times procter amp 
gamble was awarded a patent in 1985 based on new test data that 
convinced a patent examiner the development was unique the ruling 
said 
but hawkins said procter amp gamble did not provide the us 
patent office with results of 1983 tests challenging the 1985 data 
and the attorney handling the matter was grossly negligent for 
failing to do so 
the finding of intent to deceive is bolstered by the highly 
material nature of the false affidavit the judge said in his 
58page ruling 
procter amp gamble attorneys argued during the 17day nonjury 
trial that the firm lost 300 million a year because of the alleged 
patent infringement by kimberlyclark the trial ended may 31 
hawkins also ruled that an antitrust complaint filed by 
kimberlyclark against procter amp gamble in a separate lawsuit may 
proceed that case is expected to go to trial in charleston early 
next year 
procter amp gamble filed the lawsuit in south carolina because 
kimberlyclark operates a diaper manufacturing plant in the state

of the currency and the fdic 
frank anderson a banking analyst for stephens inc in little 
rock ark said the deals end the problems for texas large banks 
a vital and important step in the recovery of texas is getting 
these banks recapitalized anderson said there must be a 
vehicle for raising capital for business to expand and new 
companies to come in 
were already seeing visible signs of recovery especially in 
houston im highly encouraged anderson said 
bob walters executive vice president of sheshunoff information 
services inc in austin was less optimistic but he agreed the 
signs are positive

back going again the fdic and fslic federal savings and loan 
insurance corp still have a bunch of problems out there

bancshares deals each of texas nine largest holding companies 
have found new owners in the past three years deposit guaranty was 
the only texas company to become owner of one of the problem banks

private placements of preferred and common stock 
national bancshares existing stockholders will retain a 2 
percent stake in the rescued bank

186 million bank of dallas in february 1988 financed with 70 
million in investor capital raised by steinhart

secondquarter earnings rose 11 percent to 196 million from 177 
million for the same period last year

9 percent from 14 million in the same quarter last year 
mcdonalds sales during the second quarter jumped 5 percent to 
43 billion from 41 billion during the comparable 1988 period 
mcdonalds attributed the sales increase to new restaurants and 
higher sales at existing restaurants several marketing and 
promotion programs including the introduction of the mcchicken 
sandwich also contributed 
we believe 1989 will be another good year of growth in sales 
and profits mcdonalds chairman fred l turner said our 
management team has not changed its expectations even though we 
had one of our strongest operating years in 1988 which has made 
comparison difficult for the first six months of this year 
for the first six months of 1989 net income was 3377 million 
or 90 cents a share up 11 percent from 303 million during the 
same 1988 period revenue during the period was 29 billion up 10 
percent from last years 26 billion 
systemwide sales for the six months totaled 82 billion a 7 
percent increase from 77 billion reported for the period last

hostile soybean farmers confronted 
officials of the chicago board of trade on friday and colleagues 
applauded their criticism 
there was a more reserved reception for an official of the 30 
billion ferruzzi group of italy which at one time this month 
controlled 56 percent of the contracts on the exchange for the july 
delivery of soybeans and claimed it was victimized when it was 
forced to sell out over an eightday period 
at the end of the separate sessions before a convention of the 
american soybean association farmers said many questions remained 
over the recent soybean trading frenzy and price decline on the 
exchange hard feelings were widespread 
farmers appear to be getting crushed in a battle of giants 
bemoaned james lee adams of camilla ga president of the american 
soybean association asa wants soybeans to be crushed not 
farmers 
two main antagonists karsten mahlmann the chairman of the 
board of trade and david swanson the president of ferruzzis 
central soya co inc disagreed on the july 11 decision of the 
exchange to force ferruzzi and other major traders to liquidate 
contracts for july delivery or sale of millions of bushels of 
soybeans 
that decision touched off wild gyrations in soybean prices the 
july contract which stood at 726 a bushel before the board of 
trade action wound up at 688 a bushel when it expired on 
thursday 
you took sides it was highly unfair to farmers ray heck of 
the des moines suburb of urbandale told mahlmann in a 
questionandanswer period 
mahlmann said the exchange board was worried that there were not 
sufficient supplies available to meet large holdings of contracts 
for july delivery of soybeans in the final days of trading 
the result either would be a manipulated upward surge in prices 
or defaults on contracts that could threaten the existence of the 
exchange 
we do not let one market participant muscle things around 
he said 
mahlmann said there were similar contract worries in may but 
the exchange got by on the skin of our teeth 
heck said the board of trade waited too long to act 
you knew you had problems in may you didnt know how to 
handle it or have the guts enough to handle it heck told 
mahlmann you waited to handle it in a poor way too late i dont 
think youre lily white 
mahlmann said the exchange was reluctant to take emergency 
action ordering liquidation of contracts because it did not want to 
disturb markets he said the board waited until there were no other 
alternatives 
heck jumped in with an accusation of insider manipulation 
alleging that the board acted as soon as you got your setup 
made he was applauded by many members of the audience of more 
than 300 people 
swanson in later appearances before the convention and 
reporters flatly denied any wrongdoing by ferruzzi or any attempt 
to corner the market he called for a study by farmers and traders 
to find ways to improve the board of trade which he said has 
failed to keep up with the global expansion of commodities trading 
earlier david kass the director of market surveillance for the 
federal commodity futures trading commission confirmed his agency 
issued an order of its own to liquidate contracts even before the 
chicago board of trade acted 
he said a large trader who he did not identify was given a 
week to reduce its position below 3 million bushels 
swanson confirmed that ferruzzi had received such an order from 
the cftc 
he said his company was holding contracts for delivery of 23 
million bushels of soybeans in july a holding it began building up 
a year ago because of worries that it might not be able to fill 
export orders or supply its own plants as a result of a reduction 
of soybean supplies in the 1988 drought 
he said ferruzzi initially had a small share of the contract but 
that its holdings took a bigger share of the outstanding contracts 
near the expiration of the july contract because other traders 
already had settled their accounts 
we didnt buy anything late in the game the universe was 
shrinking around us he told soybean producers 
he said the cftcs private approach would have given ferruzzi 
time and flexibility to unwind its position although he said the 
contracts may have been liquidated in an orderly manner without 
such intervention 
but he said the public disclosure of the board of trade order 
and a timetable requiring sales spread out over a specific period 
put ferruzzi in a onesided punitive inflexible process 
mahlmann said the board of trade acted so the process would not 
be onesided he said its orders also affected traders on the other 
side of the fence who sold a large number of contracts short in a 
short sale a trader sells borrowed soybeans and hopes the price 
will fall before he must buy soybeans to settle his account 
mahlmann also categorically denied reports that alleged the 
exchanges action came at the urging of domestic trading giants 
cargill inc or archerdanielsmidland co 
we wont let any one party influence the marketplace we wont 
be influenced by any one party its absolutely untrue as some 
allegations that have been made that this decision was arrived at 
at the urgence and for the benefit of domestic companies against a 
foreign company mahlmann told reporters 
we believe by having taken dramatic effective action we have 
discouraged and will not have a recurrence of what we had to do 
after the presentations farmer mike willette of delavan minn 
said he tended to take ferruzzis side 
i think farmers got mistreated a little but after hearing 
both sides im not 100 percent clear whos right and whos wrong 
but he said the episode has further eroded the credibility of 
the exchange 
farmers are tending to distrust the chicago board of trade 
more than before he said
