high above hong kongs imposing skyline the 
final girders are swinging into place atop the bank of chinas 
striking prismshaped building 
the 70story glassandsteel building to be the local 
headquarters of mainland chinas official bank is a 
nonetoosubtle symbol of chinas unrivaled influence and growing 
activity in this british colony which reverts to chinese 
sovereignty in 1997 
communist chinas soaring presence is a result of 
marketoriented economic reforms championed by chinese leader deng 
xiaoping in beijing and the part of the agreement with britain that 
says hong kong can keep its capitalist system for 50 years after 
1997 
chinese officials of various ranks are invading hong kong for a 
crash course in capitalism and to secure moneymaking deals the 
big chinese companies are wheeling and dealing in hong kongs 
highflying property market investing in major construction 
projects and even buying large blocks of local stock 
chinese diplomats are busy too 
xu jiatun chinas top diplomat in hong kong shows up at pop 
concerts and cocktail parties he heads the local branch of chinas 
official xinhua news agency but is viewed by many as the colonys 
shadow government 
xus main task is to promote stability and prosperity in hong 
kong and he is full of kind words for its capitalist society 
we have some comrades who always fear capitalism but in fact 
they dont understand that the modern capitalist system is a great 
creation of human civilization he has told reporters 
no official figures are available to show how many chinabacked 
companies are in hong kong but estimates run into the thousands 
china is widely regarded as the largest foreign investor in hong 
kong with estimates ranging from 6 billion to 8 billion 
the investments include department stores factories 
supermarkets and real estate much of the activity is financed by 
the 14member bank of china group which saw profits rise by 30 
percent to 60 percent in 1987 according to the capital information 
services financial research firm 
chinas property purchases in hong kong totaled about 1 billion 
last year exceeded only by japanese and local investors according 
to william kwan of chesterton petty an international property 
consulting company china snatched up hotels office buildings and 
residential highrises 
they have to support the political confidence of people in 
the years before 1997 kwan said noting that the injection of 
chinese capital creates demand and raises real estate prices 
some deals reflect the need for more space by expanding chinese 
companies while other deals are strictly to make money 
china international trust and investment corp for example 
bought an office building near the central business district for 
about 45 million in may 1987 and then sold it to japanese 
interests five months later for a 35 percent profit according to 
chesterton petty 
other chinese moves that have turned heads in hong kong include 
bailouts of financially troubled hong kong banks and a pledge 
by the bank of china of the equivalent in hong kong dollars of 128 
million to save the colonys teetering futures exchange after the 
global stock market crash in october 
the purchase by citic which is chinas premier international 
investment company of 125 percent of cathay pacific airways ltd 
the territorys profitable flag carrier 
participation of three chinese companies in three competing 
consortia bidding for a multimilliondollar tunnel project through 
the suburban new territories 
matching chinas flurry of economic activity in hong kong has 
been its expanded political work 
from the xinhua headquarters across the street from the happy 
valley race track a staff of several hundred stay in touch with 
nearly every sector of society 
hong kongs chineselanguage wide angle magazine reported that 
the news agency has separate departments responsible for keeping in 
touch with the hong kong government students grassroot 
organizations and the colonys elite 
joseph ys cheng a political science lecturer at chinese 
university of hong kong says chinas plan to win over local 
residents is a longtime process of befriending us of coopting 
us so when the chinese come in 1997 theres a very good chance 
of us being immobilized or at least neutralized 
one group that china has successfully cultivated is the power 
elite who believe toeing the beijing line is the best way to keep 
their businesses healthy after 1997 
china also can count on several local organizations to support 
its policies here 
for example the hong kong federation of trade unions which 
represents about 170000 workers mobilized its members last year 
to support chinas opposition to general legislative elections in 
hong kong this year 
this along with the colonial governments decision to delay 
elections until 1991 has led some local activists to believe china 
already is calling the shots in hong kong

when the dust storms come kabul 
vanishes from sight behind a white cloud that grittily obscures all 
sense of what is and is not real 
then the winds die down and the dust suspended in the air 
drifts to the ground the sun breaks through and the city of mud 
brick houses and 2 million people shimmers back into view 
its a bit like stepping into a magic spell and visiting 
brigadoon the scottish highlands town in the broadway musical 
that appears for a day once every hundred years before fading away 
into the mist again 
kabul has that same sense 
the distinction between reality and fantasy blurs 
the afghan capital is at once communist and capitalist 
the government of the peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
is one of the soviet unions most successful attempts to impose 
communist rule on a moslem nation 
but here the united states has entered the fray by supporting 
and helping arm the anticommunist guerrillas who are fighting 
afghan and soviet soldiers 
and in spite of the sovietstyle government kabul is a 
capitalist city dollars are avidly sought by merchants who sell 
everything from centuryold handwoven afghan carpets to gaudy lace 
stockings from far east sweatshops 
kabul is a city full of life and increasingly of death 
teenage girls strive for the latest styles as their tailors 
stitch governmentissue blue cotton into school uniforms patterned 
on the skirts and jackets shown in european fashion magazines 
the markets bustle with more traditionally clad women wearing 
the chadri an allenveloping veil that descends in pleats from 
a skullcap with only a coarse mesh panel over the eyes to let the 
wearer see out 
small boys in pajamalike tunics and pants turn cartwheels in 
grassy traffic circles dodging sprays of water from tanker trucks 
that keep the geraniums blossoming 
at night streets are virtually deserted the rare motorist is 
suddenly stopped by an afghan soldier who emerges from the gloom to 
wave his rifle and check the travelers identity 
soviet soldiers have started withdrawing from other cities as 
part of a pullout the kremlin says will by feb 15 end its 
eightyear military intervention but they still surround kabul 
with a ring of tanks armored personnel carriers and fortified 
bunkers 
guerrilla rockets hit kabul several times a week usually at 
night often they land near afghan and soviet military posts but 
rockets are notoriously inaccurate and many of the casualties are 
civilians asleep in their homes 
one of these victims was carried into a hospital xray room a 
few days ago the whitehaired man lay unconscious on a narrow bed 
of ropes woven across a wooden frame his right eye was closed his 
left concealed by a bloody bandage blood stains covered the 
shoulders of his brown tunic and one leg lay at an improbable 
angle under a red plaid blanket 
he had been brought to the hospital bed and all by three men 
wearing turbans baggy trousers and layers of robes 
the old man lived according to a hospital staff member who said 
such victims arrive almost every morning but the staffer refused 
to give specific numbers reflecting a reluctance to make 
statements not authorized by the government 
death is tangible at tapaeshuhadan the hill of the 
martyrs kabuls cemetery for government troops who have died in 
the decade of fighting the mujahedeen or moslem holy warriors 
tapaeshuhadan is offlimits much of the time even to 
mourners for it is in a military zone a visit to the hill quickly 
reveals the reason 
tapaeshuhadan sits atop a huge ammunition dump evident from 
the concrete doorways and little ventilation chimneys built into 
the slopes below the graves 
the members of the peace solidarity and friendship organization 
who escort foreign visitors to the cemtery were at a loss to say 
how many men are buried there but a rough reckoning achieved by 
counting graves in one quadrant and extrapolating made 10000 seem 
a conservative estimate 
these escorted visits add to the blurring of reality and 
unreality in kabul but there are other encounters that seem 
genuine like the one with a man in a crocheted white skullcap who 
declared himself a mujahed one of those seeking to oust the 
government 
he spat on the ground to express his contempt for the afghan 
government communism and the soviet union 
speaking in arabic he said he had learned from the koran 
islams holy book and from three pilgrimmages to mecca in saudi 
arabia one of the countries arming the mujahedeen he said god 
willing the brotherhood of moslems will see victory in 
afghanistan

a drug widely used to treat adults with aids 
appears to dramatically reverse the devastating effects of the 
disease on the brains of children new research shows 
the aids virus frequently robs young victims of their ability to 
talk and walk and lowers their intelligence 
the latest research shows that the drug azt seems to bring back 
childrens speech as well as other functions controlled by the 
brain 
functional ability returned to normal in many kids said dr 
philip pizzo who directed the study at the national cancer 
institute 
his research was presented sunday at the opening of the fourth 
international conference on aids 
azt also known as zidovudine or retrovir is the only medicine 
routinely used to suppress the aids virus called hiv in adults 
it can slow the progression of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
but does not cure it 
pizzos findings were made unexpectedly during the testing of a 
portable pump to administer the drug to children he found that 
among other changes the youngsters iq scores rose about 15 points 
after they got the medicine 
everybody who looks at this data has to get excited said 
dr daniel hoth of the us national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases we are all nervous by small numbers of 
patients studied but the data itself is very exciting 
dr martin hirsch of massachusetts general hospital in boston 
also cautioned that the preliminary study did not include a 
comparison group 
its intriguing he said of the results i would have 
liked to have seen a control group who were not treated 
pizzo tested azt on 21 aidsinfected children who ranged in age 
from 14 months to 12 years about twothirds got the virus from 
blood products while the rest were infected by their mothers 
before birth 
pizzo said that 62 percent of the patients had suffered clear 
neurological damage from the virus and in every case they were 
improved after taking azt 
the iqs of those who had obvious brain impairment rose from 
about 70 to 85 among those who were judged to be mentally normal 
when the study began the iqs improved from about 95 to 105 
suggesting that they had probably already suffered subtle mental 
injury from the infection 
pizzo said the youngsters continued to improve steadily nine 
months after the treatment started 
brain scans also showed that missing tissue seemed to be 
restored in the infected youngsters brains pizzo speculated that 
cells that had been shrunken by the virus were restored to their 
normal size 
he cautioned that further study will be necessary to learn how 
long the improvement lasts and whether the children eventually 
worsen again 
in a separate study dr catherine wilfert of duke university 
medical center in durham nc described a preliminary threemonth 
study of the drugs safety in children 
she said the work shows that youngsters tolerate the treatment 
well and while its too soon to draw firm conclusions our 
feeling is that the number of opportunistic infections is 
substantially reduced 
research by dr maxime seligmann of hopital saintlouis in paris 
suggests that combining azt with the herpes drug acyclovir 
significantly improves its effectiveness in people with aids 
in four months of testing on 130 patients there were 25 deaths 
among patients who got azt alone compared with 11 among people who 
got both drugs 
these preliminary data suggest that acyclovir may have 
additional benefit without additional toxicity in patients with 
fullblown aids seligmann said

the presidents guest house is meant to be fit 
for a king but when explosive gas leaked in and a chandelier 
crashed onto the bed where visiting heads of state sleep some work 
was clearly in order 
six years and 13 million later blair house is now a guest 
house worthy of this great nation says ambassador selwa 
roosevelt the chief of protocol who oversaw the restoration 
mikhail gorbachev couldnt stay there last december for his 
summit with president reagan because the house was closed for 
repairs but should he return this year he would find a new wing 
renovated kitchen plumbing fire and safety systems new 
electrical heating and air conditioning 
not a palace perhaps but not the dilapidated antique it was in 
june 1982 then the house was judged uninhabitable after gas leaked 
into the boiler room and a chandelier fell on the bed fortunately 
then unoccupied 
we all realized that the house was in very bad shape all you 
had to do was look at it says mrs roosevelt it had a veneer 
of looking all right because it had a certain warmth and all of 
that but the minute you started looking the rugs were threadbare 
the steps were sagging the plumbing was unbelievable the kitchens 
were like kitchens at the turn of the century 
blair house actually predates the turn of the century and it is 
an architectural gem rich in history it consists of four 
connecting buildings across from the white house on pennsylvania 
avenue and around the corner on jackson place 
the original house dates from 1824 and was long owned by francis 
preston blair a member of the powerful intimate group around 
president andrew jackson that was called the kitchen cabinet 
later the house was a meeting place for leaders on both sides 
of the conflict that became the civil war in a small room to the 
right of the front door col robert e lee was offered the command 
of the union armies and declined in favor of his native 
commonwealth of virginia 
president roosevelt approved the acquisition of the house in 
1942 saying the government needed it for the entertainment of 
distinguished visitors 
on nov 1 1950 an assassination attempt was made on president 
truman at blair house by two puerto rican nationalists who 
attempted to force their way in the attempt failed and one of the 
nationalists was killed leslie coffelt a white house guard died 
in preventing the assailants from gaining entrance and a plaque 
outside the house commemorates his heroism 
in more recent times columnist diana mclellan got into hot 
water in 1981 when writing her column for the washington post she 
carried an item that thenpresident carter had bugged blair 
house where presidentelect ronald reagan was staying before the 
inaugural the post retracted the item after carter threatened to 
sue for libel 
when the general services administration decided in 1982 that 
blair house was so dilapidated it was dangerous the agency said 
millions of dollars were needed to repair the structure 
the alternative was to tear it down there was nothing in 
between mrs roosevelt said 
congress appropriated 86 million and another 48 million was 
raised from private sources to pay for the project mrs roosevelt 
hopes to have more than 1 million left for a fund to maintain the 
house 
there has been little skimping in the refurbishing the 
collection of antiques has been expanded many of them donated 
along with china silver and fabrics the room where visiting heads 
of state receive the press is an uncommonly elegant pressroom with 
its two fireplaces blue damask upholstery red serabend rugs and 
view of the white house across pennsylvania avenue 
the state department sees the house as one of its diplomatic 
assets secretary of state george p shultz has said the feelings 
of being truly welcome which staying at the presidential guest 
house foster can tip the balance in our favor with many nations 
where personal relationships are vitally important 
when people feel welltreated and warmly treated this makes 
it much easier mrs roosevelt says 
she believes the american people can be proud of the house 
which she says is neither ostentatious nor plebian 
they dont want pretensions because the american people arent 
that way this house sort of straddles a very nice line its not 
too grand but it has elegance she says its really just the 
right degree of grandness

british police have a new expression in their 
vocabulary hes been stalkered they say meaning hes been 
framed 
the term also has become synonymous with abuse of power by 
british authorities in northern ireland 
for instance when policemen shot and killed three unarmed 
guerrillas of the irish republican army in the british colony of 
gibraltar in march the media raised the specter of another 
stalker affair 
the man whose gave rise to such expressions is john stalker a 
former detective with britains national police agency who has 
written a book about his official inquiry into suspicions that the 
police in northern ireland had a shoot to kill policy toward 
suspected guerrillas of the outlawed ira 
the stalker affair which chronicles stalkers investigation 
of the royal ulster constabulary ruc and his subsequent downfall 
has swiftly risen to the top of englands bestseller charts and 
was published in the united states in may it will be published in 
paperback in britain this fall 
stalker tall and lean was in washington recently to promote 
his book 
the book has become a handle to attach to the issue of the 
accountability of police and security services in northern 
ireland he said in an interview 
with unassuming calm stalker discussed the furor his book has 
stirred in parliament and the embarrassment it caused the 
government of margaret thatcher by describing clumsy handling of 
the tensions between majority protestants and minority roman 
catholics in northern ireland 
aptly named stalker made his career hunting moors murderers 
thieves and prostitutes in 1984 he was asked to investigate the 
ruc after one of its members reported that fellow officers had lied 
in court about the 1982 shooting deaths of six suspected ira 
guerrillas the six were unarmed 
the circumstances of those shootings pointed to a police 
inclination if not a policy to shoot suspects dead without 
warning rather than to arrest them stalker wrote 
his investigation took a bizarre twist when on the verge of 
obtaining a secret tape to prove his suspicions stalker was pulled 
off the case and suspended from the force over the next three 
months in the summer of 1986 he endured a humiliating and much 
publicized investigation into what now appear to have been 
trumpedup charges 
stalker was accused of consorting with a suspected criminal and 
of impropriety in the use of police cars a police board 
subsequently exonerated him and he was reinstated as the deputy 
chief of the manchester police britains secondlargest urban 
police force he resigned seven months later saying his commander 
did not want him on the force 
in an interim report stalker had recommended that 11 police 
officers be prosected for perjury and conspiracy to pervert the 
course of justice by lying under oath about the northern ireland 
shooting incidents 
the government has since said that although serious criminal 
breaches were found in the affair prosecution of the 11 would 
damage security and would not be in the public interest 
in the course of his probe stalker discovered the existence of 
a tape which recorded events in the hayshed where one of the six 
victims michael justin tighe 17 was shot dead stalker was told 
by informants that the tape would prove tighe had been killed 
without warning 
stalker battled for months to get the tape of the electronic 
surveillance of the hayshed which was believed to be an arms depot 
for the ira about to get the tape stalker was called off the 
investigation 
the decision that resulted in my removal was i think a 
political one he wrote my interim report was read with anger 
and fear at senior levels within the ruc he said 
the investigation also disturbed the delicate balance between 
catholics and protestants in the volatile province the ruc has 
tried very hard to shed its sectarian image as a predominantly 
protestant force but the investigation was a setback stalker 
wrote 
stalker said he decided to write the book as a purge for me 
and my family after the harrowing experience they underwent 
stalker said he felt partly vindicated by a government 
announcement that changes had been made in the ruc regarding the 
accountability of its antiterrorism squads based on his report 
now he added with resignation he wants to get on with his new 
career in journalism 
there is no one i can sue no one i can name he said i 
am just another casualty of the political situation in northern 
ireland

residents of a subdivision have mowed 
each others lawns for years but they never knew it until a 
surveyors error was recently discovered and showed that all 104 
lots were improperly plotted 
due to the surveyors miscalculation more than a decade ago when 
the little brook subdivision was laid out none of the lots in the 
subdivision of the hartford suburb was correctly mapped out 
officials said 
for example while one homeowner may have built a fence on what 
appears to be his lot it technically sits on his neighbors 
property early indications are that some the boundaries are off as 
much as 3 feet said town manager frank b connolly 
the error was discovered during the construction of an adjacent 
condominium project 
the acreage is right its just not where you think it is 
connolly said last week 
all the houses which range in value from 200000 to 300000 
and builtin swimming pools appear to be on their proper lots but 
shrubs fences and sidewalks arent 
town officials have intervened because of the number of 
homeowners involved and because the towns rightofway which 
includes the sidewalks may have to be moved 
as a first step the town appropriated 17500 to resurvey the 
subdivision and the results are expected in august 
were preparing a map showing all the trees and all the 
fences connolly said 
once they have the map in hand officials will try to sort out 
the problem officials say they might just leave everything as it 
is and file new deeds or they might make everything conform to 
existing deeds 
connolly said that because of legal obligations such as 
mortgage agreements things cant be left alone both solutions 
undoubtedly will prove difficult and involve banks title insurance 
companies attorneys and lots of paperwork 
we dont know which is more practical which is more 
economical it can get ticklish if you move boundaries connolly 
said youre talking about a community effort 
so far little brook residents have cooperated and have reacted 
calmly to the situtation 
obviously people are nervous about it i call it a 
sleepingdog issue said p joseph harpie jr a little brook 
resident and town councilman no one wants to be the first to 
draw their gun im hopeful that once the town determines its 
rightofway the neighbors will work something out 
one resident who spoke on condition of anonymity said some 
neighbors are willing to rewrite deeds if necessary to conform to 
what exists but two are fighting over the location of a fence 
that may have to come down 
vinny hayes another subdivision resident laughed about the 
situation 
its unfortunate he said the city is going to spend a 
lot of money resurveying 
hayes became serious only when talking about the possible 
expense of refiling his deed 
the surveyor walter e peters of we peters land surveyors is 
dead a developer of the subdivision said his company has no stake 
in the matter 
the ironic part is that if there wasnt additional development 
going on in newington it would never have been picked up 
connolly said

the politicians taking credit for passage of a 
new program to protect the elderly from the financial ravages of 
catastrophic illness have been less eager to acknowledge that it 
also means a major tax increase for millions of older americans 
those who benefit from the legislation now awaiting president 
reagans signature would pay the entire cost at least for the 
near future 
congress itself estimates the average tax increase will be 285 
per person in 1989 and 506 in 1993 
sponsors of the bill however are reluctant to use the term 
tax increase in public discussions of the bill rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee repeatedly referred to it as a new incomerelated 
premium 
for many medicare recipients the increase would more than wipe 
out what they gained when the tax system was overhauled in 1986 
the tax increase would start at 15 percent next year jump to 25 
percent in 1990 and then rise by as much as one percentage point a 
year thereafter conceivably reaching 35 percent by the end of the 
century 
this tax increase would pay for about twothirds of the cost of 
protecting medicare recipients against catastrophic hospital 
physician and drug expenses the program would cost an estimated 
33 billion over the next five years alone the remainder of the 
cost would be covered by raising the monthly part b premium paid by 
recipients for doctors services 
we have not asked our children to pay the medical bills that 
we incur said rep jj pickle dtexas these benefits will 
be paid for by the men and women who will use the coverage 
but even some members of congress who voted for the bill worried 
aloud that as the tax burden on the elderly grows pressure will 
mount to have other taxpayers share the cost 
the compromise bill cleared by congress last week is 
considerably more generous than the version recommended by reagan 
nevertheless there is no indication that the president will veto 
it even with the tax increase 
backers of the bill acknowledge that no more than 7 percent of 
the elderly and disabled who are eligible for medicare would 
benefit from the bill even though all will have to pay the part b 
increase and many will face the new tax 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance committee 
compared the bill to fire insurance 
not everybody is going to have a catastrophic illness and not 
everybody wants to have a fire either bentsen said but what 
you are paying is an insurance premium that takes the law of 
averages and applies it to the individual with the fervent hope 
that the vast majority never have the need to use this benefit 
negotiators who wrote the final version of the bill decided that 
paying for the expansion solely by raising the part b premium would 
have made it prohibitively expensive for lowerincome people 
the final compromise said sen bob dole rkan takes into 
consideration an individuals ability to pay for this protection 
and in doing so allows this coverage to be more affordable for 
lowincome beneficiaries 
the bill includes several restrictions on how the tax would be 
applied 
it would hit only those people eligible for medicare generally 
age 65 or older or disabled whose incomes are high enough that 
they already pay at least 150 income tax typically a couple over 
65 with adjusted gross income of 11000 or less would not be 
subject to the increase 
congressional staffers estimate that in 1989 about 40 percent 
of americans over the age of 65 would have to pay the tax increase 
a private organization the institute for research on the economics 
of taxation estimates 46 percent next year and 56 percent by 1993 
the maximum tax would be 800 per person in 1989 1600 for a 
couple if both spouses are eligible for medicare rising to 1050 
2100 per couple in 1993 
the tax will be at a rate of 2250 for each 150 of regular 
incometax liability in 1989 by 1993 42 per 150 of liability 
according to the institute for research a couple with 21000 
adjusted gross income and taking the standard deduction would face 
a tax increase of 236 in 1989 and 441 in 1993 at 31500 income 
the increase would be 473 next year and 882 in 1993 
on the average taxpayers with incomes between 20000 and 
30000 were given a 220 tax cut in the 1986 tax overhaul those 
between 30000 and 40000 averaged 273 
the increase in the monthly part b premium required by the bill 
would be the same regardless of income in 1989 the 2710 premium 
would rise to 3110 and by 1993 would be 4260 a month

the forces of michael dukakis and 
jesse jackson are still miles apart on taxes defense and many 
foreign policy issues but a preliminary platformdrafting session 
ended with jackson getting one wish that the democrats brand south 
africa a terrorist state 
the platform writers boarded this islands horsedrawn taxis and 
headed home sunday after three days of deliberations that produced 
working papers on health education civil rights and other issues 
the papers were generated by committee staff working with 
surrogates of michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
the papers on defense and foreign policy have yet to be written 
and on taxes we agreed to disagree said michael barnes a 
former maryland congressman leading dukakiss platform team 
the 16member drafting committee left without casting any votes 
but will meet again sometime before the full 186member platform 
committee convenes in denver june 2526 
the jackson forces encountered little opposition on the south 
africa issue although earlier in the campaign dukakis balked when 
jackson tried to extract such a pledge from him 
we have no problem declaring south africa a terrorist state 
but lets go beyond that said rep robert matsui a dukakis 
backer from california 
the massachusetts governor the certain nominee favors passage 
of the tough sanctions in a bill that could put the apartheid 
regime in johannesburg on the same us list of terrorist states as 
libya and iran 
but the delegates parted company sunday on another bedrock issue 
for the jackson campaign whether to freeze pentagon spending two 
labor leaders rose to the defense of the defense budget and nuclear 
deterrence 
rachelle horowitz political director of the american federation 
of teachers said the democrats must root out pentagon waste but 
also honor our treaty obligations and defend democratic 
institutions and our freedoms 
i hope this platform will call for a stable defense budget 
she said 
the defense budget is not a sacred cow retorted leslie 
mclemore a jackson backer from jackson state university in 
mississippi 
later when mclemore urged the party to forswear first use of 
nuclear weapons james b booe secretarytreasurer of the 
communications workers of america said 40 years of bargaining has 
taught him never to tell any adversary for sure im not going to 
do anything i want to keep them off balance 
the democrats working papers call for appointment of a federal 
drug czar an equal rights amendment ending homelessness 
expanding aids research and providing advance notice of plant 
closings without using the word abortion the civil rights paper 
calls for freedom of reproductive choice regardless of 
ability to pay 
i found more areas of agreement than disagreement said rep 
william gray iii of pennsylvania the drafting panel chair 
those who hoped for divisive bloodletting will find the floor 
is clean said eleanor holmes norton jacksons platform chief 
she predicted it will be easier to reach an accord on defense than 
on taxes 
if by stable they mean something close to what we mean by 
freeze then perhaps theres room for compromise norton said 
madeleine albright dukakis foreign policy adviser said i 
think you will not see freeze in the platform 
janice thurmond an athens ga lawyer urged that the platform 
embrace jacksons views on selfdetermination for the palestinians 
albright told reporters flatly the platform will not contain such 
language 
robert borosage a senior jackson adviser said the jackson camp 
will be insistent on its demand to further tax the rich and freeze 
defense spending 
weve got agreements with dukakis on commitments for a whole 
range of domestic programs but wheres the money going to come 
from he said 
barnes the dukakis platform team leader was asked if the 
dukakis campaign would relish an opportunity in atlanta to reject a 
minority plank favoring a tax hike 
were not seeking floor fights he said adding that jackson 
has enough delegates to take anything he wishes to the 
convention

a strong earthquake startled residents 
over a 350mile expanse of northern and central california on 
sunday night but authorities said there were no immediate reports 
of serious damage or injuries 
the quake hit at 645 pm and had a magnitude of 51 on the 
richter scale said a spokesman for the university of california 
seismographic stations in berkeley its epicenter was on the 
calaveras fault about 10 miles northeast of san jose near alum 
rock said spokesman anthony lomax 
the us geological survey in menlo park estimated the temblor 
at 53 geophysicist bill ellsworth said the earthquakes 
5milelong center was just north of the epicenter of a 62 quake 
in morgan hill in 1984 the regions largest temblor in years 
an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale is considered capable of 
causing substantial damage but authorities said they had no damage 
reports worse than a few cracked ceilings and a broken water heater 
and water pipe in nearby milpitas 
the whole mountain shook said al wong a maintenance 
supervisor for the federal aviation administration atop 2571foot 
mount tamalpais 10 miles north of san francisco in marin county 
residents as far south as bakersfield and as far north as santa 
rosa flooded authorities and media with calls about the quake 
police and sheriffs spokesmen throughout the san francisco bay 
area the central valley and napa and sonoma counties to the north 
all said they had felt it but were unaware of any damage 
it lasted longer than they usually do said santa clara 
county sheriffs deputy ray dominguez it came all of a sudden 
and then leveled and rolled off 
it was the strongest quake ive felt here in years said 
meteorologist mike pechner of radio station knbr in san francisco 
and a lifelong resident of the area 
a resident of foster city on the san francisco peninsula said 
people ran out into the street after the quake hit a south san 
francisco resident said bottles fell off the shelf in his house and 
plants were tipped over 
dan trevan a motorist who was driving over the golden gate 
bridge said his car jumped a little bit during the quake 
bay area rapid transit and southern pacific railroad crews 
slowed trains to check for damage to the tracks but found none 
officials said 
pacific gas amp electric said it had no reports of power outages 
in the san jose area adjacent to the epicenter 
the quake was the third reported sunday in california mild 
earthquakes jolted napa and solano counties in northern california 
and the inland area of southern california around ontario but 
there were no reports of damage or injury 
the ontario quake also was felt in the cities of san bernardino 
fontana and riverside about 50 miles east of los angeles 
it struck about 220 pm pdt was centered about five miles 
eastsoutheast of ontario and measured 34 on the richter scale 
said hall daily a spokesman for the california institute of 
technology in pasadena 
the temblor was the second widely felt quake to hit southern 
california since friday when a shaker measuring 52 on the richter 
scale hit 40 miles northwest of los angeles and was felt in much of 
central and southern california 
daily said initial data indicated it was unlikely the sunday 
quake was related to the one which struck friday 
the napasolano quake which measured 33 on the richter scale 
occurred at 244 pm the seismographic stations at berkeley 
reported the epicenter was near lake berryessa about 40 miles 
north of berkeley 
vacaville police received dozens of calls from residents who 
werent sure what the jolt was said dispatcher jamie weishaar 
many of the people were confused because it didnt feel like 
an earthquake some people thought it might have been a sonic 
boom she said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in the strenth of the shaking thus a reading of 75 reflects an 
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage and 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

race and sex are irrelevant but some independents and republicans 
would hestiate to support a black for the job a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
some republicans also expressed reluctance about supporting a 
woman for vice president the national survey said independents 
did not shy from a woman candidate and democrats did not lean away 
from a black or a woman 
the survey also indicated a substantial majority of americans 
would oppose president reagan for a third term if he could run 
again most republicans favored another reagan term independents 
and democrats did not 
the poll also found that 89 percent of americans would not want 
to be president and a plurality would not want their child to be 
fiftynine percent thought it possible their child could be 
president 
on the question of vice presidential candidates 75 percent of 
the 1204 respondents said it would not matter to them if a 
tickets second slot were filled by a black or a woman 
still 17 percent of independents said they would be less likely 
to vote for a ticket with a black for vice president compared with 
4 percent who would be more likely to back it the division was 
wider among republicans while there was no measurable split among 
democrats 
the survey did not specify any candidate black civil rights 
activist jesse jackson secondplace finisher for the democratic 
presidential nomination has said he should be offered the vice 
presidential slot

the legal complexities in the irancontra 
prosecution of former white house aide oliver l north and three 
codefendants are sometimes as perplexing to the lawyers and the 
judge as they are to the general public 
a continuing legal battle is being fought on several fronts 
between independent counsel lawrence e walsh and lawyers for 
north former national security adviser john w poindexter and arms 
dealers albert hakim and richard v secord 
here are some answers to a number of questions about the case 
q who is charged with what 
a all four defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud 
the government theft of government property and wire fraud in the 
diversion of profits from the usiran arms sales to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
poindexter and north are both charged with lying to congress 
north also faces charges of obstructing a presidential inquiry 
with pocketing 4300 in travelers checks a contra leader gave him 
to cover expenses with accepting an illegal gratuity in the form 
of a 15000 highsecurity fence around his home with obstructing 
an fbi inquiry into the fence and with conspiring to illegally use 
a taxexempt foundation to raise money to help arm the contras 
secord and hakim are charged with conspiring to py illegal 
gratuities to north by setting up a 200000 fund for norths 
family and by arranging installation of the fence 
q when is the case going to trial 
a that is still up in the air but us district judge gerhard 
a gesell said last week that the defendants should be tried 
individually so that he could ensure they each get a fair trial 
gesell said he would decide major pretrial issues by july 1 the 
first trial likely will begin during the fall presidential campaign 
q who goes first 
a walsh designated north as the leadoff defendant to be 
followed by poindexter 
q why did gesell order four separate trials 
a the judge was presented with a unique problem because three 
of the four defendants north poindexter and hakim testified 
last year before congressional hearings under grants of limited 
immunity from prosecution as a rule walsh is prevented from using 
the testimony of the defendants against them as evidence 
q what does that have to do with holding four separate trials 
a gesell ruled that each defendant has a right to present a 
codefendants immunized testimony as evidence of his innocence if 
a joint trial were held gesell would have to choose between 
protecting say poindexters fifth amendment right not to have his 
congressional testimony used against him and the sixth amendment 
right of hakim and secord to use poindexters statements to 
congress as evidence of their innocence 
secord and hakim both say that testimony by north and 
poindexter would help clear them of any wrongdoing by showing that 
they acted with the understanding their activities were approved by 
the us government 
q is gesells order a blow to the prosecution 
a prosecutors dont generally like trying conspiracy cases 
against individual defendants its easier to show a jury how the 
actions of each member furthered an alleged conspiracy if all the 
defendants are being tried together it means walshs resources 
will be seriously stretched and the cases will take a long time to 
try 
q what are the remaining issues before gesell can set a trial 
date 
a the judge must decide whether the immunized congressional 
testimony of north poindexter and hakim tainted the investigation 
of prosecutors but his decision to hold four trials appears to 
foreshadow a decision that congressional immunity wont be a 
barrier to trying the case 
gesell also has to rule on whether procedures for handling 
200000 pages of classified documents collected during walshs 
investigation will protect the defendants rights to a fair trial 
q what are those 
a the classified information procedures act requires the 
defense to notify the prosecution before trial of any government 
secrets it expects to use as evidence in the case defense lawyers 
contend this will tip off the prosecution 
q can the court force the government to declassify secret 
documents needed for the trials 
a no if there is a large enough volume of material that the 
government agencies wont release walsh would be forced to drop 
the case 
if the government determines that a particular document is so 
sensitive it cant be made public the law provides several ways 
for the information to be presented the court can order a 
statement of what the document would prove can substitute a 
statement of facts that a document would prove for the actual 
material or the judge can also delete sensitive portions of the 
material 
q what sorts of secrets are involved 
a the keepers of government secrets are especially sensitive 
about any document that reveals the source of foreign intelligence 
the government also is anxious to protect information revealing 
that a foreign country provided information or was involved in a 
secret initiative with the united states 
gesell speculated at a hearing that the defendants may want to 
introduce evidence about other covert operations they engaged in to 
show that the procedures were no different than those followed in 
the irancontra affair 
the judge said evidence about other secret operations might help 
the defendants show they acted with authority or at least the 
belief they had the permission of higher officials

this media generalassociated press poll is 
based on telephone interviews april 29may 8 with 1204 adults in 
the continental united states the phone numbers were selected 
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult 
who had the most recent birthday 
the results were weighted to adjust for variations in the 
sample the poll has a threepoint margin of error meaning the 
results theoretically would be within three points of the same 19 
times out of 20 if every adult american were asked the same 
questions the error margin is larger for subgroups five points 
for republicans for example 
there are other sources of potential error in polls including 
the wording and order of questions these are the questions and 
responses in this poll

untold millions of dollars from 
corporations and labor unions are flowing into the nations 
election process through a legal loophole says a report released 
today by a bipartisan research group 
union and corporate contributions to state and local political 
parties for activities that are not directly used on federal 
elections are generally known as soft money the national party 
organizations the republican national committee and democratic 
national committee also collect and disburse soft money in a 
variety of ways permitted by federal law 
these funds are not required by law to be reported at the 
federal level and only some states have strict reporting 
requirements 
the center for responsive politics said it identified 33 
million in corporate contributions to political parties in five 
states in the 198586 election cycle california colorado 
florida missouri and washington 
this amount if multiplied nationwide would blossom into an 
enormous sum despite the fact that there was no presidential race 
to boost contributions even higher said ellen s miller 
executive director of the center 
noting that nearly a billion dollars is tallied in reports to 
the federal election commission on spending for congressional 
campaigns and presidential races she added lying just below the 
surface are untold millions of additional dollars unaccounted for 
by the fec 
the money can be used for such activities as state conventions 
voter registration drives research office expenses and 
getoutthevote drives 
soft money plays an important role in presidential election 
years since the major parties presidential campaigns are paid for 
by the us treasury and the amounts the national parties can spend 
in addition are limited 
republicans have traditionally raised far more in soft money 
than democrats but the finance chairman for democratic nominee 
michael dukakis has talked of raising 42 million in soft money for 
the fall campaign 
based on reports filed with the five states involved the center 
identified the following amounts in corporate contributions to 
state parties in 198586 
california republicans 808290 democrats 295389 
colorado republicans 645888 democrats 71050 
florida republicans 466445 democrats 458258 
missouri republicans 369482 democrats 22400 
washington republicans 129776 democrats 31250 
the center identified about 1700 soft money contributions in 
these states almost all of them from corporations 
in its report the center said american continental corp of 
phoenix gave 85000 to the california democratic party in 1986 
while atlantic richfield co of los angeles gave a total of 89000 
to the two state parties 
the largest individual contribution identified by the center was 
by charles keating chairman of the board of american continental 
who gave 100000 to the florida gop 
the report referred to the publicly disclosed contribution of 1 
million by mcdonalds heir joan kroc to the dnc at most 20000 
of that could be used on federal elections under the law meaning 
at least 980000 would have to go into the dncs softmoney 
accounts 
the report also noted published reports of gifts to the rnc 
totaling 150000 from texas developer trammell crow 127600 from 
phillip morris corp and 124000 from atlantic richfield 
corporate and union money can also be used to pay for buildings 
for the national parties the report mentioned contributions to the 
democratic building funds of 50000 from the painters union 
10000 from the united auto workers and 5000 from the 
machinists union 
it cited contributions to the rnc fund of 40000 from bethlehem 
steel and 24120 from drexel burnham lambert

michael dukakis who once described himself as a 
man of few wants lives in a duplex he bought 17 years ago for 
25000 drives a 5yearold dodge buys his clothes at a bargain 
basement and generally vacations at the homes of friends or family 
despite his frugal lifestyle or perhaps because of it the 
apparent democratic presidential nominee has a net worth of at 
least 500000 in property investments and salary and is the 
potential beneficiary of about 1 million controlled by trusts 
according to his financial disclosure forms and statements made by 
his presidential campaign aides 
james dorsey the governors statehouse press secretary said 
the dukakises live comfortably but added nowadays there 
isnt much time to spend money on anything 
the last time the democratic presidential nomineetobe took a 
financial risk was 25 years ago when following the lead of two 
uncles in haverhill a half century before he took out two 
mortgages to buy the sixapartment building he was living in for 
55000 
the investment proved successful in 1971 eight years after 
buying the apartment building in the boston suburb of brookline 
dukakis sold off the apartments as condominiums one of the first 
condo conversions in the state for a reported 26000 profit 
earlier that year he and his wife kitty moved out of the 
apartment building and bought half of a sidebyside brick duplex 
down the street for 25000 
the dukakises still live in that modest threestory duplex 
since massachusetts is one of only three states that doesnt 
provide a governors residence but as a result of new englands 
inflated real estate climate the dukakis home now carries an 
estimated value of 367400 
like many americans the dukakis home is the governors single 
largest investment unlike many americans dukakis has paid off the 
mortgage indeed the governor who refuses to use credit cards 
has no reported debts 
his only independent stock investment totals less than 1000 in 
a small massachusettsbased robotics manufacturer automatix inc 
which brought him less than 100 in income last year according to 
his financial disclosure forms 
the governor has no vacation homes his vacations are usually 
mixed with family visits to a cousins home in ft lauderdale 
fla to mrs dukakis sisters home on cape cod or to her fathers 
summer home in the berkshires 
he has no airplanes boats or a garage full of cars the only 
car owned by the man who likes to ride the subway to work is a 1983 
dodge valued last year at 2750 
dukakis 54 has put his money into longterm investments aimed 
at retirement or benefiting his three children after 25 years in 
state politics first as a legislator and now as a threeterm 
governor dukakis has built his state retirement account up to 
49494 
if the governor has taken out life insurance his federal and 
state financial disclosure forms dont reveal it and his 
presidential campaign staff wont discuss it 
he and mrs dukakis have 44610 in various savings individual 
retirement accounts and checking accounts some of which are 
considered trusts for his children the campaign staff said 
the governor and his wife reported total income last year of 
108957 virtually all of it was from his 85000ayear 
governors salary and mrs dukakis 20000 as a parttime director 
of the public space partnership project at harvard universitys 
kennedy school of government and the 2000 she earned as director 
of a college textbook publisher the dukakis interest income 
amounted to 1445 
dukakis also is the potential beneficiary of money from two 1 
million trusts set up by his late father panos however half the 
money in those trusts is slated to go to bates college in maine 
where dukakis father went to school 
dukakis has reported two additional trusts valued at a total of 
110000 which were set up by mrs dukakis late grandmother 
mabel williams and her father harry ellis dickson but only the 
governors wife and children are potential beneficiaries 
dukakis has no direct control over or involvement in any of 
these trusts 
it was one of the trusts set up by dukakis father that drew 
attention last year when the governor filed a report with the 
federal election commission revealing that until 1986 when he was 
running for reelection the trust included stocks in companies 
doing business in south africa in 1983 dukakis vocally supported 
and signed legislation to divest massachusetts pension fund stocks 
with south african ties to protest that countrys system of racial 
segregation 
dukakis before withdrawing as a trustee of the trust last year 
told the state street bank amp trust co of boston which manages the 
trust to divest any south africantied stocks stocks in 10 
companies were immediately sold 
today the trust in which dukakis mother euterpe and his 
campaign chairman paul brountas are trustees has holdings in 21 
companies including ibm several of the socalled baby bells 
spawned by the breakup of american telephone and telegraph co and 
the washington post co 
so could dukakis be called a millionaire its not accurate 
to say that no campaign spokesman steve akey said potential 
yes 
it was during discussion last year over raising the governors 
salary from 75000 to an advisory boards recommendation of 
125000 that dukakis described himself as a man of few wants 
dukakis who eventually agreed to a 10000 raise in governors 
pay balked at the boards further recommendation for a 
25000ayear housing allowance saying he could live on almost 
any salary within reason

congress remains skeptical about government 
subsidies for overseas advertising of us farm products with an 
appropriations panel turning down a proposed 215 million increase 
for next year 
rep charles schumer dny calls fridays vote by the house 
appropriations committee a victory for both the taxpayer and the 
small farmer 
schumer said he hopes this is the beginning of the end for 
huge handouts to agribusiness concerns for overseas advertising 
if giant companies want to advertise their brands in japan 
they shouldnt ask the american taxpayer to pay for it he said 
the appropriations committees action held the program to its 
usual level of 110 million from a proposed level of 325 million 
for fiscal 1989 
the agriculture department says the program is part of an 
overall effort to make us farm products more competitive 
overseas it notes that american exports fell from 38 billion in 
1984 to 263 billion two years later the level crawled back up to 
279 billion last year and is projected to hit 32 billion in 1988 
a persistent critic of excesses in the agriculture budget 
schumer prompted the general accounting office to conduct an 
investigation of the targeted export assistance program the 
congressional investigative agency said it found insufficient 
accountability and management controls in the program as well as 
an array of other problems 
the tea program was established by a voluminous 1985 law that 
put into place all of the nations current major agricultural 
programs since 1986 it has supplied 110 million a year in 
commodity credit corp generic certificates to reimburse 66 
organizations for promotion of a wide range of farm exports 
the generic certificates are issued by the commodity credit 
corp which is owned by usdas agricultural conservation and 
stabilization service 
the certificates may be redeemed for their face values worth of 
surplus crops held by ccc the corporation acquires these goods 
primarily through federal programs under which farmers pledge their 
crops as collateral for pricesupport loans with the option of 
forfeiting the commodities rather than taking them to market 
themselves 
when the crops are transferred to another owner under an 
agriculture department paymentinkind program such as targeted 
export assistance the amount of the original loan goes on usda 
books as a realized loss 
pears wheat peaches fruit cocktail peas lentils grapes 
apples wood poultry eggs soybean meal dairy cattle citrus 
prunes nuts raisins rice potatoes chocolate red meat pasta 
and cotton have all been the subject of overseas advertising 
supported by the targeted export assistance program 
the program is intended to give first crack at the money to 
products that have faced unfair foreign trade practices 
tea operates two kinds of programs one subsidizes associations 
for generic advertising of specific us products such as 
american pears the other pays private companies to promote not 
just american pears or american apples but farm products 
marketed under their brand names 
individual amounts can be substantial sunkist growers inc for 
example received 793 million in fiscal 1986 and 955 million in 
fiscal 1987 for overseas promotion of california citrus 
at least 900000 was allocated under tea to promote us 
tobacco exports the gao reported usda says an exporting group 
tobacco associates used money from the program to participate in a 
1987 tobacco show in china and that this is paying off in greater 
contacts with the chinese tobacco monopoly 
several new tea activities are now planned with china 
including sponsorship of a leaf grading school in china and 
reciprocal trade team visits between china and the united states 
according to a usda report

the fbi should include stringent safeguards 
against abuse in the guidelines it used to launch a lengthy 
investigation of reagan administration political opponents says a 
former justice department aide 
eric richard said the bureaus investigation of the committee in 
solidarity with the people in el salvador from 1983 to 1985 was 
carried out under relatively lenient guidelines on foreign 
counterintelligence and international terrorism the group opposes 
reagan administration policies in central america 
in prepared congressional testimony richard said the probe 
could justifiably have been conducted under another set of 
guidelines the relatively rigorous set of investigative rules 
governing domestic security and terrorism investigations 
details of the fbi investigation of cispes surfaced in february 
internal fbi documents showed that agents investigated nuns union 
members and college professors who opposed reagan administration 
central america policy photographing protesters at peace rallies 
and recording license plate numbers the investigation involved 
nearly all of the fbis field offices 
the more lenient foreign counterintelligence guidelines allowed 
the fbi to conduct a much broader investigation than would have 
been possible under the domestic investigation guidelines 
richard suggested that the fbi rework the international 
terrorism guidelines and apply some of the safeguards against abuse 
that are contained in the domestic security guidelines 
the international guidelines permit investigations of entire 
organizations under the domestic standards investigations must 
focus on participants who knowingly act to further criminal 
objectives 
the domestic guidelines also specify that before investigations 
are opened the danger to privacy and free expression posed by an 
investigation must be considered 
if these standards had been conscientiously applied to the 
cispes investigation it seems certain that an ongoing intrusion 
into legitimate political activity would have ended much sooner 
said richard 
richard the attorney generals special assistant for 
intelligence during the carter administration made his remarks in 
testimony to be delivered to the house subcommittee on civil and 
constitutional rights 
the investigation of cispes began march 30 1983 prompted by an 
informants claim that members were covertly furnishing money and 
supplies to the farabundo marti national liberation front a 
leftist group seeking to seize power in el salvador 
the probe was closed in june 1985 when the justice department 
concluded that the group was involved in political activities 
protected by the first amendment and was not participating in 
international terrorism

a group of scientists is offering a sobering 
weather forecast for the year 2020 the planets average 
temperature hitting a 10000year high and the worlds oceans 
surging an average of 83 feet inland 
things are going to change too fast scientist michael 
oppenheimer said as the world meteorological organization a united 
nations agency released a report last week on the climate change 
that could be triggered by the greenhouse effect 
the report painted a picture of a global civilization heating 
its atmosphere in a myriad of ways from burning fossil fuel to 
destroying tropical forests 
those actions could force the average temperature up by 2 
degrees fahrenheit in the next three decades the report says that 
might not sound like much but the scientists say it would be 
enough to wreak havoc 
such a temperature increase for example would cause the sea 
level to rise by 10 inches bringing seawater an average of 83 feet 
inland according to oppenheimer 
the potential for economic political and social destruction 
is extraordinary said biologist george woodwell 
to illustrate the warming trend he noted that four of the 
hottest years in the last century have been recorded in the 1980s 
the organization held four news conferences around the world 
including one in washington to talk about the report 
oppenheimer said even if mankind abruptly stopped adding 
excessive gases to the atmosphere the delayed impact of already 
released gases would eventually raise the average temperature 1 to 
2 degrees 
the scientists estimates are tied to an assumption that the 
earths population industrialization and emissions will continue 
to grow along the upward curve that has been followed for the last 
130 years 
the report also gives a scenario tied to an assumption that 
worldwide growth and development could load the atmosphere with 
vastly increasing amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide 
methane and chlorofluorocarbons 
in this case the figures get two to three times worse instead 
of a 10inch increase in the sea level the report estimates a 
2foot increase instead of a 2degree increase in the average 
temperature a 6degree surge is called for oppenheimer says that 
temperature level last occurred 2 million years ago 
whatever the increases the report paints a dismal picture for 
coastal areas erosion of beaches loss of wetlands more frequent 
and more severe flooding damage to port facilities 
in its only cost estimate the report said global expenditures 
of tens of billions of dollars will be needed over the next 50 
years for dikes walls and drainage systems to counter rising seas 
caused by already released gases 
it forecasts destruction of forests and agricultural lands for 
the midlatitudes the heavily populated band that encompasses the 
united states china europe and the southern half of the soviet 
union 
forest loss is a critical element because this releases still 
more carbon into the atmosphere the report says the midlatitude 
nations probably will be able to maintain food production but in 
different growing areas 
semiarid tropical regions like northern africa central america 
and india would lose already marginal agricultural areas and face 
scarcities of fresh water and wood for fuel humid tropics would be 
wetter and warmer 
in the highlatitudes like the northern soviet union 
scandinavia canada the arctic and the antarctic the scientists 
see melting ice packs and glaciers more clouds and precipitation 
the slow disappearance of permafrost and the possibility of large 
carbon releases from the soil 
the report says that limiting the amount of global warming 
could be accomplished only with significant reductions in the 
use of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum 
if reasonable economic growth rates are to be maintained 
these reductions can be achieved only with two major changes large 
energy efficiency increases of the order of onehalf in 
industrial nations and rapid deployment of alternative energy 
sources it said 
the report also calls for reduced deforestation and increased 
forestation and implementation of last years agreement among 
industrialized nations to decrease the production and use of

southern baptists mixed preaching and 
politicking as fundamentalists and moderates today approached a 
convention fight over control of the denominations 
multimilliondollar organizational empire 
a fundamentalist wing gradually has gained predominance among 
trustees of southern baptist convention institutions through nine 
years of winning the influential presidency of the countrys 
largest protestant body 
but moderates think they can regain the office at the 
convention which opens tuesday they cite numerous victories on 
the state level and various fundamentalist moves that have 
antagonized the grassroots 
expected to be nominated for the presidency were the 
fundamentalistbacked rev jerry vines of jacksonville fla and 
the moderatebacked rev richard jackson of phoenix ariz 
the president has appointive authority over trustees who run the 
147millionmember denomination 
harsh words have been traded in the spiraling campaign recently 
with fundamentalists demanding literalistic beliefs about the bible 
among denominational teachers and agency staffers 
moderates defend a longtime baptist concept of the soul 
competency of individuals to interpret the bible as they 
understand it 
a respected patriarch of the denomination the rev herschel h 
hobbs 80 of oklahoma city says the bitter struggle is hurting 
the christian cause 
in this controversy we are our own worst enemies hobbs 
the former convention president said in a statement 
what all outside forces of evil could not do we are doing to 
ourselves as paul said in galatians 515 we are like wild animals 
devouring one another we deny the very oneness and peace for which 
jesus prayed 
as a prelude to the convention the thousands of messengers 
were offered a day of preaching some of it from leading exponents 
of the two factions 
so divided was sentiment that there were separate preaching 
arenas a pastors conference of mainly fundamentalist speakers 
and the forum for moderates 
the forum announced its 1988 denominational statesman award to 
the rev randall lolley driven by demands of newly ruling 
fundamenalist trustees to resign as president of southeastern 
baptist theological seminary 
trustees are no longer free to debate and decide issues he 
said they have people breathing down their necks to accomplish 
the prearranged agendas 
he along with four academic colleagues at the wake forest 
nc seminary quit after trustees enacted measures requiring that 
faculty members profess that the bible is free of error 
the price which he has paid for his convictions is a witness 
to his faith an act of judgment upon all those who surrender to 
the temptation to compromise their convictions said the award 
citation 
among preachers scheduled at the pastors conference were 
fundamentalist former presidents the revs charles stanley and 
bailey smith both of atlanta and paige patterson of dallas a key 
strategist for that wing 
patterson denounces recent tactics of moderates accusing him of 
rightwing political ties calling it hurtful misrepresentation 
apparently born out of a willingness to do almost anything to 
reverse the conservative resurgence 
of moderate charges that he was involved in a rightist political 
group the council for national policy he says conservative 
christians now simply are doing politically what liberals have done 
for a long time 
it is no longer the left involved in isolation but now the 
conservatives are involved he said what is sauce for the 
goose is sauce for the gander 
the rev w winfred moore of amarillo who sent out the brochure 
criticizing patterson and others in the fundamentalist wing said 
there are some of our brethren who want to make all of us 
believe the same way they do our diversity has always been our 
greatest strength now they are telling us we cannot be different 
any more

itll be very tough times for wildlife of all kinds says 
university of california davis wildlife specialist lee fitzhugh 
virtually anything that depends upon herbaceous plants and seeds 
will suffer songbirds amphibians reptiles and some small 
mammals 
territorial disputes may increase as animals concentrate around 
dwindling water supplies in late summer and fall says fitzhugh 
jim vashro of the montana department of fish wildlife and parks 
said fish in streams and rivers are forced to move to deeper holes 
for protection 
the fish are concentrated more so the predation and food 
competition goes up he said theres a larger mortality rate 
and less oxygen as the water temperatures go up the oxygen needs 
of the fish go up and they become stressed their growth rate is 
slowed or they die 
the dry weather could mean fewer ducks for the fall hunting 
season 
gay simpson of the south dakota department of game fish and 
parks said many nesting areas have dried up although the extent of 
the problem wont be fully known until after a breeding pair survey 
and brood count are conducted 
around atlanta coyotes descendants of animals smuggled in by 
hunters have taken to raiding watermelon patches in search of 
water state wildlife officials say rats are reported invading 
yards in the san francisco bay area in search of water 
even handouts for birds could be affected 
feed prices are way up already with the dry weather said 
tom westman owner of several minnesota greenery wild bird stores 
in just the last month weve seen a 25 percent increase in our 
costs on sunflower seeds if some of these areas dont start 
getting rain then in the fall prices will continue to climb

drought across broad patches of the nation is shriveling crops 
and pastures driving up grain prices and leaving some farm workers 
jobless community water use restrictions are in place in 
california the midwest and the southeast 
its not total destruction for all these crops yet but 
another week or two of dry weather is going to put us near the 
point of no return said richard grove agricultural extension 
agent for seneca county ohio 
in addition low water threatens to disrupt shipping on rivers 
in the south and hydroelectricity there and in the northwest 
these are the problem areas 
southeast parts of the carolinas georgia tennessee and 
alabama have had belownormal rainfall for up to four years 
atlanta and six surrounding counties have water conservation 
programs 
the hardesthit reservoir is north carolinas fontana lake 
which is 45 feet below normal some private wells have gone dry in 
north carolina 
midwest and northern plains a hot dry spring and less than 
normal winter snow has left the soil so dry in some places that 
seeds didnt germinate some farmers in northwestern ohio have 
plowed crops under rather than spend more money on fertilizer 
north dakota gov george sinner says the drought is the worst since 
the 1930s 
thunderstorms on sunday produced muchneeded rain over parts of 
the dakotas and northwestern minnesota mobridge sd got 147 
inches of rain in six hours and jamestown nd got 08 inch but 
the region will need more rain to replace subsoil moisture 
areas of illinois are restricting water use and residents in the 
chicago suburb of long grove complain about dry wells saying they 
suspect their neighbors of using all the water long grove 
administrator dm doughty said one womans well ran dry while her 
neighbor across the street had three or four sprinklers going 
its kind of hard to love your neighbor he said 
the northern plains problem is shared by farmers in canada 
where old wives lake a 12milewide expanse south of moose jaw 
saskatchewan is bone dry for the first time since 1937 
west coast san francisco and los angeles have imposed 
mandatory water rationing in the wake of light winter snow in the 
mountains where the snowpack is a natural reservoir growers have 
been told that irrigation allotments may be cut 
that lack of snow also has left hydroelectric reservoirs falling 
on the columbia river in washington at the same time water must be 
released from those reservoirs to help migrating salmon 
during the past month the grain futures market in chicago has 
surged upward as traders bet on smaller and smaller harvests 
soybean futures rose 25 percent during the past month and last week 
broke the 9abushel barrier highest since late 1983 oats traded 
up by the daily limit 10 cents raised to 15 cents at midweek 
on four of the five trading days last week 
the market opened sharply lower wednesday after reports that 
parts of westcentral iowa got rain with 52 inches at coon rapids 
and 179 at des moines but other parts of the state stayed dry 
the price of soybeans for july delivery closed slightly lower 
friday on the strength of forecasts for rain early this week but 
that was a decline of just 2 cents 
iowas statistical bureau said the states pastures were at 
their june 1 driest since 1956 
the us agriculture department cited dry weather on the plains 
in may when it reported that farmers were harvesting an estimated 
157 billion bushels of winter wheat thats slightly more than 
last year but 3 percent 50 million bushels less than a 
prediction issued a month earlier 
corn is just lying there not enough moisture to germinate it 
some early corn is barely surviving said bobby peek 
agricultural extension agent in buncombe county nc transplants 
of tobacco are dying they stood there for a few days and now 
theyre starting to die i never have known a spring like this and 
nobody you talk to has either 
the situation is acute for dairy farmers because grass to feed 
livestock is wilting or not growing as fast as usual and they also 
depend on hay grown at this time of year to feed their animals in 
the winter 
the agriculture department is already allowing farmers to cut 
hay or let animals graze on land that was set aside for crop 
reduction or conservation in struggling counties in montana the 
dakotas nebraska iowa wisconsin minnesota illinois indiana 
and ohio 
some farmers are selling cattle earlier than usual to avoid 
rising feed prices 
normally we have two to three cuttings of alfalfa a year the 
yield from the first cutting was way down and there wont be much 
of a second cutting said don keyes of the minnesota agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service much of the state has had 
less than half normal rain this year

the antiimmigration national front has all but 
vanished from the legislature in nationwide elections despite 
winning a stunning 14 percent of the vote in aprils presidential 
balloting 
in national assembly elections two years ago 35 members of the 
farright party won seats on sunday only one survived 
but the front was ambushed less by voters than by a new 
winnertakeall polling system 
not only did party leader jeanmarie le pen lose his seat he 
also dropped 17300 in a bet with a pollster whose organization 
predicted le pen would be defeated 
le pen called the election unfair and undemocratic adding 
that it was unreasonable for a party that won 4 million votes in 
april to be nearly shut out of the legislature in june 
the socialists who won the presidency and took control of the 
national assembly in 1981 made it possible for the national front 
to get into the assembly when they changed the election law from a 
winnertakeall majority system to a proportional one 
the majority system favors large parties the proportional 
system where seats are allotted on the basis of the percentage of 
votes won is better for smaller parties 
when the conservatives ousted the socialists from power in the 
assembly in 1986 they immediately voted back the majority system 
we unfortunately predicted victory of the 
socialistcommunist left even though they are in a minority 
because of the majority system of election which we fought said 
jeanpierre stirbois secretarygeneral of the national front 
the election system was conceived to eliminate the 
national front said le pen and on the whole it achieved its 
objective at least in parliament 
the national front vilified by the other political parties and 
accused of being racist and xenophobic for its antiimmigration 
platform burst onto the political scene in 1984 by winning 11 
percent of the vote in elections for a european parliament 
the party won 98 percent in 1986 legislative elections not 
only entering the assembly for the first time but surpassing 30 
seats the number needed to form a separate parliamentary political 
group 
le pens 144 percent performance in the 1988 presidential 
election was 2 points above the most optimistic prediction 
though suffering a serious setback in this election the 
national front recorded at least one success it brought 
traditional rightist parties into a deal for mutual support in 
several constituencies in recognition of its political strength 
le pen claimed this arrangement allowed the right to blunt what 
otherwise would have been a socialist landslide 
carrying the national front standard will be only yann piat who 
won reelection from a mediterranean district mrs piat the wife 
of a naval officer celebrated both her victory and her 39th 
birthday on sunday 
i am an ardent defender of a strong europe but a fierce 
adversary of uncontrolled immigration she said

house sure with warmth and feeling obviously i have that but 
with the ability to get the job done and i think thats what the 
american people are looking for its certainly my great strength 
and its the reason that weve done as well as weve done he

infamous interview with dukakis republican opponent george bush

the boston press photographers association the massachusetts 
governor who has rarely strayed from his straightforward delivery 
on the campaign trail poked fun at his chief rival selection of a 
running mate and even himself 
dukakis told the gathering he took a break that afternoon to go 
to a harvard boutique to pick up my speech for tomorrow a jibe 
at bushs characterization of dukakis as an elitist 
master of ceremonies bob warren presented him with a cardboard 
presidential seal with a likeness of a cod in place of the bald 
eagle

democratic nomineetobe michael dukakis says as 
president he would wage a real war on drugs something he 
says the reagan administration has failed to do 
dukakis was focusing on drug issues today he had meetings set 
with leaders of his state antidrug program and with members of 
congress to discuss national efforts to fight drugs 
a day earlier dukakis was in utah to address the nations 
mayors and was harshly critical of the administrations dealings 
with panamas manuel antonio noriega who is under indictment on 
drug charges 
if elected dukakis told the us conference of mayors in salt 
lake city on sunday he would tell the cia and other agencies 
never again never again are you going to bankroll a drug peddler 
whos poisoning our society and killing our children 
dukakis also chided reagan for ignoring efforts by latin 
american leaders to get noriega to step down 
they tried to go it alone and they fell flat on their face 
dukakis said of administration efforts to oust noriega 
dukakis said he would direct more foreign aid to antidrug 
efforts including support for drugcrop eradication and step up 
protection of officials in drugproducing nations who have the 
guts to join us in this war 
he said the military should be prepared to assist those efforts 
dukakis outlined a domestic antidrug effort he said would 
include tougher drug laws and stiffer fines property seizures and 
sentences along with increased cooperation between federal state 
and local law enforcement agencies he called for expanded drug 
education for students and teachers and guaranteed access to drug 
treatment 
for us the stakes are clear dukakis said in a speech well 
received by the mayors a largely democratic group the war is 
on 
dukakis did not mention his certain republican challenger vice 
president george bush by name but he attacked administration 
antidrug efforts in which bush played a part when he headed an 
antidrug task force 
what we have today is chaos dukakis said of the 
administrations antidrug effort 
dukakis picked up endorsements from more than 500 democratic 
mayors and vice mayors 
dukakis held a private gathering with several black mayors who 
support jesse jacksons presidential campaign several described 
the meeting as a positive step toward building black support for 
dukakis but added that how he resolves differences with jackson 
will be a crucial factor 
before leaving for boston dukakis met with leaders of the 
church of latter day saints and separately with actor robert 
redford

a newly discovered herpes virus may 
cause much of the damage to the immune system in people suffering 
from the deadly disease aids a researcher says 
dr robert gallo one of the discoverers of the aids virus said 
sunday that the herpes virus works in concert with aids to attack 
the white blood cells that orchestrate the bodys defenses against 
disease 
he said the herpes virus can knock out the bodys immune system 
more effectively than acquired immune deficiency syndrome once the 
aids virus has weakened the bodys defense 
the herpes virus appears to be harmless or to produce only very 
mild disease in otherwise normal healthy people gallo said at the 
opening session of the fourth international conference on aids in 
stockholm 
most of us in this room have been exposed to and probably 
infected with this virus while showing little or no sign of it 
he said 
the new herpes virus was discovered by researchers in gallos 
laboratory in 1986 it was initially called hblv for human bcell 
lymphotropic virus and is now referred to as hhv6 human herpes 
virus type six 
this sixth human herpes virus though related is different from 
the herpes viruses that cause cold sores and genital infections 
one of the principal targets of the aids virus is the t4 
lymphocyte a white blood cell that serves as the master 
orchestrator of the bodys immune response to invading organisms 
it appears however that the aids virus only infects a small 
percentage of t4 cells yet it kills a very large percentage of 
them 
there are a number of theories to explain how this might happen 
but gallo proposed that the new herpes virus might be the answer 
in studies in the test tube the herpes virus is a more 
effective killer of t4 cells than is the aids virus gallo said 
it can activate the dormant aids virus and it is more common in 
aids patients and in such highrisk groups as homosexuals and 
drug abusers than it is in the population at large gallo said 
the aids virus weakens the immune system allowing hhv6 to 
enter hhv6 activates the virus and kills cells producing further 
loss of immune defenses and the deadly cycle continues 
to prove that gallo will have to do studies with animals if he 
can find animals that are infected both by the aids virus and 
hhv6 he said

times 
of course when youre young you have high thoughts she 
said but youre living in a community where a lot of sisters and 
brothers are living a celibate life and you dont think anything 
about it 
shakers believe god has a mission for everyone she said 
whoevers mission it is to marry and bring new life into the 
world thats their mission she said our mission is to live

creations including the flat broom clothespin and ladderback 
chairs

country 
now the villages in canterbury and sabbathday lake are the only 
ones with shakers the sabbathday lake shakers still admit new 
members but the canterbury village has admitted none since 1965 
the maine village has five members recognized by the new

2block runway down rodeo drive

chairman george fenimore who estimated the 14month celebrations 
cost at 16 million 
throughout much of its history beverly hills with its lavish 
mansions and fashionable boutiques has attracted worldwide 
interest 
its just the fame of it said tourist sue brown of 
doncaster england its all very exciting most people know 
rodeo drive even in our little town 
the los angeles visitors and convention bureau estimated that 
between 16 million and 18 million tourists last year ambled through 
the golden triangle beverly hills downtown district compared

legendary home pickfair in the northern reaches of the city the 
home has since been owned by los angeles lakers owner jerry buss 
and most recently by meshulam riklis and his singerwife pia

he often walks his two golden retrievers through his neighborhood 
i wave to the tourist buses and sign peoples maps to the 
stars homes said stewart who was honored by the fivemember 
city council earlier this month as man of the year 
a lot of people come up to me and say that guy looks like 
dean martin said joe patti whose la famiglia restaurant is a 
popular celebrity hangout and i say that is dean martin 
all the hoopla aside beverly hills is a thriving city of 
33000 known for its communityoriented government 
new commercial developments are limited to three stories and 
fast food chains are banned its schools are among the nations 
best with 93 percent of its students going on to college 
i have great affection for beverly hills stewart said 
its a city built for the benefit of the community itself not 
just for a small group of celebrities 
some people say oh youre just a snob from beverly hills 
restaurateur patti added well theyre just jealous

the us embassy has begun notifying american 
residents that they no longer need limit their movements to avoid a 
possible terrorist attack on thursday the embassy warned the more 
than 1500 americans living in beijing to take precautions the 
chinese government had told it unidentified terrorists from a third 
country might attack us citizens in the capital 
on sunday the embassy canceled its warning after the chinese 
assured us officials the danger was over 
the chinese government informed us today that it has taken 
effective action to ensure that persons who intended to harm 
american citizens will not be able to do so embassy spokesman 
mckinney russell said sunday 
late saturday the official xinhua news agency issued a 
statement by the vice minister of public security gu linfang 
saying necessary measures had been taken and the problem has 
been solved gu did not elaborate 
xinhua quoted gu as saying that some persons recently 
attempted to harm americans in china but russell said he was not 
aware of any attempted attack 
russell said the chinese government did not tell the embassy the 
nationality of the alleged plotters a us official in washington 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said last week that there was 
middle eastern involvement 
several western hotels increased their security staff in 
response to the warning the international school run by the united 
states and four other foreign governments blocked off its road and 
tightened security 
the embassy also recommended that americans avoid restaurants or 
bars known to be gathering points for americans and avoid wearing 
clothing that clearly identified them as american 
us officials refused to say what steps were taken to increase 
security on the four compounds that house embassy offices and 
ambassador winston lords residence

as weeklong activities marking the millennium of 
christianity in russia neared culmination president andrei a 
gromyko pledged to allow religious freedom for roman catholics in 
this officially atheist country 
gromykos statement published sunday in the communist party 
newspaper pravda came in response to a question from cardinal 
johannes willebrands a member of the largest vatican delegation 
ever to visit the soviet union 
at the st danilov monastery meanwhile thousands of people 
celebrated a divine liturgy on one of the holiest dates on the 
russian orthodox calendar known as sunday of all the saints who 
shone forth in the land of russia 
the ceremony culminated a week of conferences services and 
receptions commemorating 1000 years of christianity in russia 
willebrands who heads the vaticans secretariat for christian 
unity was among several foreign dignitaries in moscow for the 
millennium who attended a saturday meeting with gromyko 
of course we arent making any attempts to encroach on the 
rights of the catholic church pravda quoted gromyko as telling 
the cardinal and likewise we are not trying to encroach on the 
rights of catholics living in the soviet union 
the vatican representative had asked whether it would be 
possible to organize catholic churches not only in the soviet 
unions baltic republics where a recognized church exists in 
lithuania but also in other parts of the soviet union where there 
are large catholic communities 
he listed those areas as the ukraine byelorussia and 
kazakhstan according to vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
those republics have no fully recognized catholic churches and 
the vatican wants the right to appoint bishops there navarro said 
pravdas report of the question taken from a tass dispatch 
omitted the specific references to the ukraine byelorussia and 
kazakhstan reflecting the kremlins sensitivity on the issue 
gromyko said catholic churches could be opened outside the 
baltic states if local authorities agree 
in the future we will give the necessary attention to the 
wishes of soviet catholics regardless of where they live the 
78yearold president told the prelates 
though officially atheist the government supports the russian 
orthodox church and has exhibited greater religious tolerance in 
the three years mikhail s gorbachev has been in power 
willebrands met friday with clergy of the underground ukrainian 
catholic church which josef stalin ordered absorbed into the 
russian orthodox church in 1946 during a massive campaign of 
religious repression 
ukrainian clerics say there are between 3 million and 4 million 
ukrainian catholics in the soviet union pope john paul ii said in 
a letter in april to ukrainian catholics that their church should 
be fully recognized 
the russian orthodox church bitterly opposes recognition of the 
ukrainian catholic church claiming it was formed only as a result 
of a forced split in the orthodox church at the end of the 16th 
century

of smiths grove ky one of 15 finalists when they bid you can 
really see it sometimes you get the eye winkers and finger 
wigglers

a new test can distinguish infants infected by 
the aids virus from those who only appear infected because they 
carry blood proteins from their mothers a study suggests 
the test works by detecting genetic material from the virus 
rather than the standard method of detecting the proteins as 
evidence of possible infection scientists said 
the proteins called antibodies form in reaction to exposure to 
the aids virus a mothers antibodies can pass to the fetus and 
make the infant appear to have been exposed to the virus when 
standard testing is used 
the study led by steven wolinsky at northwestern university 
medical school in chicago is to be reported this week in sweden at 
the fourth international conference on aids 
it used a polymerase chain reaction technique called pcr 
to detect genetic material from the virus causing acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
part of the test focused on nine children ages 6 months to 3 
years who had tested positive by standard tests three tested 
negative by pcr and later were shown to be free of the virus the 
six others scored positive by pcr later showed other signs of 
infection 
in a different group of five children who had tested positive by 
standard tests three scored positive by the pcr test and later 
showed other evidence of infection the two others who tested 
negative with pcr were found to be free of the virus 
five children who tested negative by standard tests also scored 
negative with pcr 
a second study by wolinsky and colleagues confirmed other 
demonstrations that pcr can detect infection in adults before they 
test positive on antibodybased tests 
tests of stored blood samples suggested that 16 of 18 men who 
tested positive on a standard antibody test would have tested 
positive at least six months earlier with a pcr test for one man 
the difference was 42 months researchers said

investigators will study flight data 
to find out why a dc9 jetliner on a domestic flight crashed in 
heavy fog near a northeastern airport apparently killing all 22 
people aboard 
austral air lines said 15 passengers and a crew of seven were 
aboard the private carriers plane which on sunday crashed into a 
grove of eucalyptus trees about a halfmile short of the posadas 
airport 
the plane had left buenos aires sunday morning stopping first 
in the river port city of resistencia before heading north for 
posadas the capital of misiones province which is about 650 miles 
north of buenos aires 
the airline statement said flight 046 crashed for unknown 
reasons it added given the magnitude of the accident it is 
presumed there are no survivors 
intense heat at the crash site initially prevented recovery of 
all the bodies 
a misiones radio station said the planes black box was found in 
the wreckage and investigators hoped the device that records flight 
data will help them determine the cause of the crash 
local news reports indicated the jetliner made an abrupt turn 
while approaching the airport runway three miles outside posadas 
stalled in the air and then crashed 
we flew over the crashed plane a little after the accident and 
fire consumed everything in 10 minutes said federico lujan 
civil aviation director of misiones province 
witnesses and firefighters at the scene said the air was filled 
with the smell of burning eucalyptus and that wreckage from the 
charred dc9 was strewn across a large area 
austral released a list of the people on board that indicated 
most were argentine but one passenger identified only as peterson 
was also listed in the flight manifest 
austral is a private carrier purchased last year from the state 
it competes with the government carrier aerolineas argentinas on 
domestic routes austral had been taken over by the state earlier 
this decade because of financial troubles

fault about 10 miles northeast of san jose near unincorporated 
alum rock 
both seismographic centers recorded several small aftershocks 
sunday night and berkeley center spokesman anthony lomax warned 
that another temblor of up to magnitude 4 was likely 
experts expressed concern because the 5milelong epicenter was 
just north of the center of a destructive quake that hit morgan 
hill in 1984 registering 62 on the richter scale the regions 
strongest temblor in years 
sundays quakes shallow epicenter increased its impact on the 
area experts said 
two children in fremont 10 miles north of the epicenter said 
they were knocked to the floor and suffered mild bruises when the 
ground began to ripple 
it still hurts when i walk said 5yearold tommy harang 
whose 12yearold sister chrissy also took a fall 
in milpitas the quake knocked dozens of boxes cans and bottles 
off the shelves of at least one supermarket and further cracked a 
window damaged in an earlier quake 
we got off pretty easy said bill smith the night manager 
ive lived in california all my life so im blase about 
earthquakes i thought here we go again 
earlier sunday an earthquake registering 33 on the richter 
scale jolted napa and solano counties in northern california and a 
quake measuring 34 hit the inland area of southern california 
around ontario 
the ontario temblor was the second widely felt quake to hit 
southern california since friday when a shaker measuring 52 on 
the richter scale hit 40 miles northwest of los angeles and was 
felt in much of central and southern california 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in the strenth of the shaking 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage

cbs president laurence tisch admits making 
mistakes that led to the networks slump to third place in the 
ratings but vows to make changes to return it to the top spot 
i have heard your concerns and disappointments loud and 
clear tisch said at sundays opening session of the threeday 
cbs affiliates conference 
cbs fell to third place in the ac nielsen co ratings last 
season for the first time in its history 
we share your disappointment with our primetime ratings last 
season he said we will not settle for third or even second 
place our highest priority is to restore cbs to no 1 we will use 
every resource and we are committed to that goal 
tisch said the network would improve programming and the 
promotion of that programming 
we must be more aggressive in bringing our programming to the 
attention of the public through promotion he said adding that 
the network was putting new people in charge of ontheair 
promotion 
asked to identify an area where he had specifically made a 
mistake tisch said he felt he should not have encouraged the 
entertainment division to drop the tuesday night movie and put in a 
block of four comedies 
i think if we had not done that and i had not encouraged them 
to do that we would not have ended up in third place he said 
in addition to its ratings woes cbs has been beset by 
programming delays resulting from the 14week writers strike news 
budget cuts and buyout rumors 
there is one thing i want to make clear said tisch who is 
also chairman of loews corp despite rumors cbs and loews stock 
is not for sale the network is not for sale 
the estimated 800 people attending the luncheon burst into 
applause 
tisch said he believed the price tag of 243 million for the 
1992 winter olympics was a smart investment he said he had been 
criticized for the bid but said it was the first time anyone had 
accused him of overspending 
we have seen how two weeks of olympic coverage can raise an 
entire network and boost the ratings of its schedule he said 
tisch said he didnt plan to put cbs into the cable business as 
abc and nbc are saying he felt the american public would be 
better served by strengthening overtheair broadcasting

new aids cases are being reported in 
the united states at the rate of one every 14 minutes and an 
estimated 365000 cases will have been reported by 1992 the latest 
us government figures show 
dr james curran director of the aids program at the us 
centers for disease control in atlanta said today that it is 
difficult to tell whether the aids epidemic is leveling off 
but he also said that in his view that is not a very important 
question 
we had a thousand cases reported in the united states last 
week he said in an interview during the fourth international 
conference on acquired immune deficiency syndrome does it matter 
whether its going up or not 
it might level off like lung cancer or heart disease and 
thats not good curran added 
he said an increasing number of people are contracting aids 
through heterosexual contact in the united states but that no 
explosive increases in heterosexual spread of aids are likely 
the data is too incomplete for firm conclusions curran said 
in europe 12221 cases of aids have been reported as of march 
31 more than double the number reported a year earlier 
jeanbaptiste brunet of claude bernard hospital in paris said 
today 
aids among drug abusers is increasing rapidly in spain france 
and italy he said an estimated 300000 to 800000 people in 30 
european countries are now believed to be infected with the aids 
virus brunet said 
on sunday the director of the world health organizations aids 
program told the conferences opening session that as many as 
several hundred million people around the world may be at risk of 
getting aids which is now present in virtually every country in 
the world 
no country is immune dr jonathan mann said 
we do not we cannot have precise numbers but it is likely 
that several hundred million people around the world may have 
behaviors which make them potentially vulnerable to infection with 
hiv said mann one of 7000 scientists and doctors attending the 
largest aids conference ever held 
he estimated that 150000 people will develop aids in 1988 
doubling in one year the estimated number of cases in the history 
of the epidemic 
in other developments researchers at the national cancer 
institute reported that a widely used aids drug appears to 
dramatically reverse the devastating effects of the disease on the 
brains of children 
dr philip pizzo said children who have lost their speech as the 
result of aids infection in the brain subsequently recovered their 
ability to talk and other functions of the brain 
pizzos study of 21 aidsinfected children aged 14 months to 21 
years showed that their iq scores rose about 15 points after they 
took azt the only drug that has been shown to help delay the onset 
and severity of aids symptoms 
mann painted a grim picture of the aids epidemic but noted that 
the world has never seen a mobilization of the kind that has been 
mounted to fight the deadly disease 
as an example of the ferocity with which aids can spread among 
drug abusers mann described the situation in bangkok thailand 
two years ago virtually no one in the city had antibodies to 
the aids virus the presence of aids antibodies indicates an 
individual has been infected with the virus 
in 1987 1 percent of the population had antibodies to aids in 
the first three months of this year the infection had spread to 16 
percent of bangkoks population 
this epidemic curve already documented in new york city 
edinburgh and milan threatens every community of iv intravenous 
drug users in the world mann said 
aids is changing the world he said it has become a key 
part of the history of our time 
the number of aids cases officially reported to the world health 
organization stood at 96433 as of june 1 the number of actual 
cases is now estimated to be 200000 mann said 
although aids was not identified until 1981 the origins of the 
epidemic have been traced back to the 1970s the time of what mann 
calls the silent pandemic 
a virus spread across the world and we didnt even know it 
existed it is or should be shocking to our modern pride 
that such a global expansion could occur without even being 
detected he said 
participants in the fourday conference were scheduled to make 
about 3600 presentations but no breakthroughs were expected in 
ways of curing or preventing the deadly virus 
aids damages the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

iran said its forces broke through iraqi 
defenses east of the southern port city of basra today killing or 
wounding 4000 iraqis nearly three weeks after the iraqis drove 
them out of the region 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia said fierce fighting was raging in the salamcheh region 
with the iranians holding the upper hand in a twopronged 
offensive 
iraq said the iranians had crossed the border in what it called 
a reckless assault at the deserted police posts at bubiyan and 
kut suwadi 15 miles east of basra 
an iraqi military spokesman who cannot be identified under 
military regulations told reporters in baghdad that the iraqis 
3rd army corps absorbed the momentum of the offensive and 
contained it 
he acknowledged fighting was still going on east of fish lake 
an area flooded by the iraqis several years ago to block iranian 
thrusts 
the spokesman said the iraqis were preparing a counteroffensive 
that will teach the enemy a good lesson he did not elaborate 
there was no independent confirmation of either sides claims 
the two nations rarely allow correspondents or other observers into 
the combat zones 
irna said iranian troops punched through iraqi defenses 
destroying 30 sovietmade tanks decimating three infantry brigades 
and then overrunning three artillery battalions setting ammunition 
dumps on fire 
irna correspondents with the iranian assault force reported that 
thick black smoke from the burning iraqi depots billowed over the 
battlefield 
the agency reported that several hours after the offensive was 
launched a halfdozen other iraqi infantry brigades had suffered 
25 to 40 percent casualties it made no mention of iranian losses 
the agency said the battlefield was littered with knockedout 
tanks and armored vehicles and that more than 700 iraqis were 
captured including several senior officers 
irna said iranian artillery was pounding iraqi positions behind 
the lines to block reinforcements reaching the hardpressed 
frontline units 
the offensive was the first major iranian operation announced in 
the strategically important southern sector since may 25 
at that time iraqi soldiers pushed the iranians out of a 
hardwon bridgehead east of the southern port city of basra in a 
lightning offensive that apparently caught the iranians by surprise 
the iranians had seized marshlands east of basra with severe 
losses in early 1987 and battled to within six miles of the city 
before they were blocked by iraqi defenses 
the loss of the basra bridgehead was irans second battlefield 
defeat in five weeks 
the iraqis had recaptured the faw peninsula south of basra on 
april 18 ending two years of iranian occupation 
the iranians jolted by loss of their two main footholds on 
iraqi soil had been expected to launch a retaliatory offensive in 
an attempt to regain military initiative in the nearly 8yearold 
persian gulf war 
irans leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini seeking to restore 
irans military fortunes appointed parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani as acting commanderinchief of the armed force on june 
2 
tehran radio said at the time that rafsanjanis appointment as 
military leader was expected to herald new victories on the 
battlefield 
rafsanjanis appointment climaxed a shuffle of military 
commanders that followed the loss of faw on april 18 the same day 
that the us navy sank or crippled six iranian naval craft in a 
series of clashes in the gulf

a judge today rejected a bid to 
reopen the trial of the sharpeville six and the blacks convicted 
for a mob murder once again faced hanging unless president pw 
botha intervenes 
the judge gave the defendants 35 days to appeal to botha or the 
chief justice 
the president already has turned down an appeal for clemency in 
doing so he spurned an international campaign to spare the six 
who were found guilty in the mob killing of a black town councilor 
pretoria supreme court justice willem human who presided over 
the original trial in 1985 rejected an application by defense 
lawyers to reopen the case to consider allegations that police 
coerced two state witnesses 
the defendants five men and a woman were convicted of 
complicity in the 1984 death of black town councilor who was stoned 
to death and burned during riots provoked by a rent increase 
human who had granted a stay of execution hours before the six 
were to hang in march said today the request to review the case 
was frivolous and absurd 
but he extended the stay of execution which would have expired 
today until july 19 giving defense attorneys 35 days to appeal 
once again to botha and ask acting chief justice pj rabie to 
overrule the courts decision 
however human indicated he felt the chief justice would not 
overturn his decision by telling the lawyers that their only 
remaining hope lay in petitioning botha again 
several dozen friends relatives and diplomats crowded into the 
courtroom did not react immediately to the reading of the decision 
but some broke down and wept in the corridor when attorney prakesh 
diar explained the ruling to them they then went to pretoria 
prison to visit the six convicts 
diar said its a bit surprising that he would give a time 
limit on when the chief justice would have to make a decision 
our experience when you petition the chief justice is that it 
takes many months hes giving us a deadline for the chief justice 
to make up his mind i think im losing a little extra hope with 
the judges attitude 
human said apart from allegations that two witnesses were 
coerced there was ample uncontested evidence to implicate all six 
defendants and he would not extend the stay of execution beyond 
july 19 
diar said he would try to appeal to the chief justice but he 
said the fate of the six was really in bothas hands 
i hope and i pray that the state president will reconsider his 
previous decision this is a politically related case bothas 
decision may be based on political considerations 
diar said he spoke to his clients last week and described them 
as hopeful but not confident 
prosecutors argued during a hearing last week that human had no 
jurisdiction to reopen the case because an appeal has been rejected 
by the countrys highest court the appeals court 
defense lawyers had said human could reopen the case if he 
determined the trial court was defrauded by false evidence obtained 
through coercion 
but human said today that further questioning of a state witness 
who recanted part of his incriminating testimony would be an 
exercise in futility 
the six were granted a stay of execution march 17 one day 
before they were to hang 
their case has generated controversy in part because they were 
not convicted of contributing physically to the councilors death 
they were convicted under the doctrine of common purpose which 
held them responsible because they actively participated in the mob 
which killed the councilor 
the government has contended that the six have been unfairly 
portrayed abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law authorities 
say evidence at the trial showed that each played an active part in 
the killing through such actions as making firebombs to burn the 
victims house and slapping a woman who pleaded for the councilors 
life 
the defendants are mojalefa sefatsa reid mokoena oupa diniso 
duma khumalo francis mokhesi and theresa ramashamola the only 
woman on death row for what activists say is a politically related 
crime 
through the policy of apartheid the white minority government 
has established a racially segregated society and denies the 
countrys 26 million blacks a vote in national affairs 
the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate 
districts schools and health services black officials in the 
governments employ are thus often resented by other blacks

budget director james miller said today that 
this years federal deficit will likely be greater than the 
administration had forecast forcing automatic spending cuts unless 
new ways are found to slash spending 
miller said greater spending on such things as savings and loan 
bailouts and lower tax revenues will push the budget gap higher 
than the 146 billion threshold that would force cuts under the 
grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
im afraid its about to fall miller speaking on nbctvs 
today program said of grammrudmans automatic budgetcutting 
ax 
were going over in spending and some of the receipts are a 
little bit short so it looks like unless we do something itll 
fall said miller director of the presidential office of 
management and budget 
the budget blueprint worked out earlier this year by 
congressional leaders and the administration projects a 1353 
billion deficit next year barely below the 136 billion target of 
the grammrudman law for fiscal 1989 
the congressional budget office had offered more pessimistic 
forecasts for the budget but congress used figures provided by the 
white house in projecting the deficit 
when we sent the budget up the bipartisan budget agreement 
didnt leave very much margin for error at all miller said 
today the problem is that if we just tip over at all thatll 
trigger the cuts 
he said the administrations figuring had assumed revenues that 
have actually been depressed because of lower inflation than the 
white house had foreseen and we have some spending thats up for 
example bailing out thrift institutions thats going to cost 
more money 
the government last week paid out a record 135 billion to 
investors in two failed california savings and loans 
miller said the grammrudman law would force cuts of 3 percent 
in domestic programs and 8 percent in defense spending unless 
congress comes up with other cuts by oct 1 
by law we have to make these determinations miller said 
we dont want those cuts i dont think anybody wants those 
cuts 
a concern is there are a number of threats up there congress 
has got a number of bills its trying to pull out of the hopper 
and when youre right there at the margin it looks like were 
going to have to do these acrosstheboard cuts we cannot afford 
to have that increased spending 
he said the budget gap was not enough to warrant more taxes 
however 
i just dont think at this point we really need to have a tax 
increase said miller

a palestinian suspected of placing bombs 
aboard two us jetliners that killed five people will be tried in 
athens on charges of entering greece on a forged passport a 
security official said today 
the palestinian mohammed rashid 34 has been held at greek 
security police headquarters since a tip from the us embassy led 
to his arrest june 1 at athens airport 
the united states is seeking rashids extradition for his 
alleged involvement in the bombings of the us jets over hawaii in 
1982 and over greece in 1986 
we understand that rashid is to be tried for coming into 
greece with false travel documents the question of his extradition 
therefore doesnt arise at this stage said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to police rashid entered greece on a fake syrian 
passport if convicted he could receive an 1824 month sentence 
for traveling on forged documents the security official said 
under normal practice it would be possible for extradition 
proceedings to be started after he has finished serving the prison 
term the security official said 
the official said he was not aware that any date had been set 
for rashids trial in the crowded athens judicial system suspects 
may be held for up to 10 months before their case is heard 
greece has followed similar procedures in the past when faced 
with extradition requests for alleged terrorists 
a jordanian arrested in greece in 1982 is still awaiting 
extradition to italy where he is wanted for allegedly plotting an 
attack against the rome synagogue that killed a small boy 
rashid believed to be an explosives expert is suspected of 
placing a sophisticated device that went off aboard a twa jet on a 
romeathens flight in april 1986 as it flew over southern greece 
four people including a baby died when they were blasted out of 
the aircraft 
rashid also allegedly placed a bomb aboard a pan am jumbo jet 
that exploded as the plane was coming in to land at honolulu on a 
flight from tokyo in 1982 a japanese teenager was killed and 15 
passengers were injured

democrat michael dukakis and republican george 
bush are likely to face a tight race for the white house this fall 
but dukakis is off to a fast start in some traditionally republican 
states according to a 50state associated press survey 
democrats around the country expressed optimism about dukakis 
chance to end eight years of republican rule in the white house 
republicans in the survey said the contests shapes up as a close 
one but several officials added that bush could win easily if he 
succeeds in his attempt to depict dukakis as an heir to the 
democratic partys recent liberal past 
the ap survey included recent public opinion polls and 
interviews with independent political analysts and party officials 
in all 50 states 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts leads in the polls in 
california and new jersey both of which last voted democratic in 
1964 he is running even with bush in the polls in utah which gave 
president reagan his largest majorities in 1980 and 1984 one 
survey shows him even in reliably republican nebraska and within 
striking distance in texas and florida key southern states 
said democratic chairwoman karen marchioro of washington state 
this is the best shot weve had in a long long time the last 
time a democrat carried her state in a presidential election was 
1968 
i think it will be the closest presidential contest weve had 
since 1976 said tom cole the gop state chairman in oklahoma 
oklahoma hasnt voted for a democrat in a presidential campaign 
since 1964 
republicans have won four of the last five presidential 
elections with jimmy carters victory in 1976 the only exception 
while dukakis leads in nationwide public opinion polls there is 
agreement that political fortunes in the five months until the 
election will be influenced by factors such as selection of a vice 
presidential running mate campaign debates and the health of the 
economy 
republicans say dukakis lead is a temporary result of favorable 
publicity in recent weeks from his string of primary victories 
against jesse jackson 
nobody has laid a glove on dukakis says south carolina gop 
party director tom denny thats going to change once the 
conventions are over we havent been able to start hitting on 
him 
for now dukakis lead nationally is reflected in poll results 
around the country and optimism among democratic officials in 
states from washington and oregon to new hampshire 
he leads bush by double digits in polls in california the 
largest state with 47 electoral votes which last voted for a 
democrat in 1964 he is also viewed as the leader in both 
washington which last went democratic in 1968 and oregon which 
last voted that way in 1964 
polls in utah and nebraska indicate the two men are running 
even neither state has backed a democrat in a presidential race 
since 1964 and gop officials in both states express confidence 
that wont change this time 
bush holds leads in polls in texas and florida but dukakis is 
well within striking distance and officials in both parties say the 
race could be influenced by vice presidential running mates bush 
is perceived as running generally well across the south 
i sense a strong base of support for vice president bush in 
the south says steve french political director of the alabama 
republican party but republicans in alabama realize how close 
this election can be 
officials of both parties agree that the vice president also has 
to contend with weaknesses in the midwest that were exposed during 
the primary season 
if the election were held today i think michael dukakis would 
stand a good chance of winning iowa where a democrat last won in 
1964 said the states gop chairman michael mahaffey 
as is often the case the large industrial states illinois 
michigan ohio among them are viewed as key battlegrounds 
although dukakis seems to hold the early advantage in each of them 
most officials believe dukakis holds an advantage in new york 
the secondlargest state with 36 electoral votes in pennsylvania 
gop chairman earl baker said dukakis is the strongest democratic 
candidate to run in the state dukakiss base also gives him a 
good shot at connecticut as well as massachusetts and rhode island 
and democratic officials say the three northern new england states 
shape up as closer than usual 
no matter what the polls look like this is going to be a close 
election because the vice president has an advantage in the 
electoral college says lee atwater bushs campaign manager he 
says in states in the south and west there are 210 or 220 
electoral college votes easily available for the vice president 
the problem is the other 50 are going to be difficult 
leslie dach dukakis communications director says the democrat 
intends to stage raids in normally secure republican territory 
we can win electoral votes in every region of the country he 
says 
it takes 270 electoral college votes to win the presidency 
the race could be heavily influenced by the vice presidential 
selections 
the survey turned up little enthusiasm for jesse jackson on the 
democratic ticket in keeping with polls that indicate that such a 
pick would lose support 
dukakis has been advised by some to look to a southerner such as 
sen sam nunn of georgia a westerner or perhaps ohio sen john 
glenn to fill out his ticket 
if dukakis doesnt pick a southerner it just makes it that 
more difficult for us said texas democratic chairman bob slagle 
on the republican side the name of california gov george 
deukmejian came up frequently as talk turned to holding his state 
in the gop column former tennessee gov lamar alexander also was 
mentioned by several as a good southern choice 
whatever the preferences the polls indicate the importance of a 
vice presidential selection 
a texas survey gives bush a margin of 48 percent to 41 percent 
over dukakis but if texas democratic sen lloyd bentsen were to 
join the ticket the survey shows the race would narrow to 
essentially even 
similarly a recent poll in california gives dukakis a lead of 
53 percent to 40 percent over bush but the vice president would 
fare far better if deukmejian joins the ticket

after graduating from college in three 
years 11yearold adragon eastwood de mello faces a mindboggling 
choice should he pursue the answer to cosmic riddles or should he 
go to junior high 
like most boys his age the frecklefaced lad with a prince 
valiant haircut would rather not go back to junior high i 
already know that stuff he lamented saturday as he received his 
bachelors degree in mathematics from cowell college at the 
university of california santa cruz 
but unless adragon is admitted to a graduate program he will 
be required by state law to go to junior high this fall his 
father augustin de mello is prepared to send his son abroad to 
escape that fate 
our system is not equipped to deal with children like him 
said the proud father a single parent who started adragon on a 
special learning program at an early age by hanging space mobiles 
over his crib 
on cbs this morning program today adragon said im not 
sure what graduate school ill go to however he said going 
back to junior high school wont do me any good 
the father said he introduced adragon to sophisticated books 
before he was a year old and that adragon uttered his first 
hello at 6 weeks when he was a little older than 1 he 
strapped on a guitar and started singing the father said 
adragon knew the alphabet at age 2 could read and write by 3 
and received an associate degree with highest honors from a 
twoyear junior college by 10 the father said adragon spent just 
one year at the university 
adragon would like to continue his studies at the santa cruz 
campus but has not yet heard whether hes been accepted in the 
graduate division for the fall 
i want to start learning scientific programming next year 
he said i want to go into astrophysics or particle physics 
which hopefully will lead to the discovery of the creation of the 
universe which is what im interested in 
he says he wouldnt mind picking up a nobel prize along the way 
cowell college provost john lynch said he had mixed feelings 
about adragons rapid progress its quite an achievement and he 
earned his degree but i hope he will go on and be educated in life 
as broadly as he was in math said lynch 
adragons father is concerned his son made no friends at santa 
cruz 
i kept questioning myself was this the right way to go it 
gets harder and harder for him said de mello he isolated 
himself his computers were his friends it was very lonely for 
him 
although hes confident about his abilities to grow 
intellectually adragon himself worries about his social life 
it is strange having everyone so much higher than you he 
says and in elementary school they have a recess i once asked a 
student at santa cruz where the playground was and he laughed 
i finally found the playground in my computer

hes from 
i saw the picture in the paper and said thats mo said 
duffie swartz of columbus ohio swartz was in huntington with her 
sister connie hughes of new york when they saw the newspaper 
moses said he was told after the women identified him that 
sunday was his 33rd birthday 
moses knew little about himself other than he remembered being 
in jacksonville that he was a cleveland indians fan and traveled 
frequently 
moses said the women look familiar and that he probably was in 
nearby kenova where swartz used to live on may 3 looking for them 
when he lost his memory

scientists plan to turn a green cornfield 
into a laboratory this month to test a genetically altered 
microorganism in hopes of killing a caterpillar that costs american 
farmers about 400 million a year 
proponents call testing of the microorganism cxcbt a step 
toward a new era of chemicalfree pest control critics worry that 
genetically engineered materials will spread uncontrollably once 
released into the environment 
the microorganism will be injected into corn stalks to combat 
the european corn borer one of agricultures most destructive 
pests 
although researchers have conducted other experiments of 
genetically altered materials in the environment the tests will be 
the first approved for a genetically altered plant vaccine 
said the microbes creator peter carlson chief scientist of crop 
genetics international inc 
if crop genetics is successful this time or in future tests 
and there are similiar developments going on all over the place 
this will be a significant step forward in the production of 
food said richard d godown a washingtonbased lobbyist for the 
industry 
biotechnology industry officials say cxcbt is just the edge of 
a gene revolution that could dramatically boost crop production 
and help feed a world population expected to double in the next 40 
years while cleaning up the environment 
but the industrys main critic says the field tests which will 
begin june 20 are part of a dangerous trend to unleash hundreds of 
similiar products without evolutionary defenses against them 
and said jeremy rifkin president of the washingtonbased 
foundation on economic trends the pesticide doesnt work 
if they develop a niche youre stuck with them rifkin 
said they mutate they migrate they have mobility you cant 
recall them 
environmental groups including the national audubon society and 
the environmental defense fund did not oppose the limited field 
tests approved in may and officials say if their questions about 
spread are answered with more tests they may support the final 
product 
the crucial question for environmental groups is whether there 
will be adequate testing and regulation because cxcbt is just the 
beginning of a rush of dozens perhaps hundreds of similiar 
products said maureen hinkle the audubon societys director of 
agricultural policy 
its a wonderful idea she said if it works it will be a 
tremendous boon 
whether cxcbt will work is another question 
rifkin said the microbe approved for limited field tests by the 
environmental protection agency and the department of agriculture 
doesnt kill corn borers outside the petri dish and is being used 
by the biotechnical industry to set precedent 
field tests of cxc without bt produced yields that were 17 
percent below normal rifkin said the environmental defense fund 
also said cxc can lower corn yields but carlson said the average 
corn yield at 33 test sites was on par with farmers and only 
seven showed reduced yield including one patch with a 17 percent 
drop 
the organism being tested did not kill the corn borer outright 
but sickened it carlson said its easier to get approval for 
testing a recombinant microbe if its not a sledgehammer he said 
he hopes his product will weaken the caterpillars and then 
natural forces such as disease that were not present in 
greenhouse tests will kill the moth larvae crop genetics also is 
working on an improved form of cxcbt that could kill the corn 
borer outright as well as products to combat cotton rice and 
soybean pests he said 
concerned about insect transmission the epa is requiring the 
test patches in queen annes county and beltsville be sprayed 
against insects 
rebecca goldburg an environmental defense fund biologist said 
the new yorkbased environmental group is not convinced carlsons 
bug will work or is safe enough but the possibility of an 
alternative to chemical pesticides is heartening and worth pursuing 
i believe there is a potential for some genetically engineered 
organisms to cause some ecological problems ms goldburg said 
lots of genetically engineered organisms wont cause any 
problems what we have to believe is that we have the ability to 
say yes to some and no to others 
only one other genetic cropprotector a microbe altered to 
fight frost has been approved for field testing by the 
environmental protection agency epa spokesman albert heier said 
a montana state university researcher injected a genetically 
altered bacteria into 14 elm trees in an effort to block dutch elm 
disease but he cut them down in 1987 after officials learned he 
conducted the experiment without federal or university approval

israel today deported arabamerican activist 
mubarak awad an expulsion prime minister yitzhak shamir said was 
necessary to deter violence 
awad wearing a white shirt and carrying a jacket was 
accompanied up the stairway to the twa aircraft by two police 
officers before other passengers boarded he waved briefly and 
appeared to make a vforvictory sign before entering the jetliner 
police barred reporters from the tarmac at ben gurion 
international airport and took identification documents from 
several journalists who ventured near the plane armed border 
patrol guards forced news photographers off the roof of the 
terminal building 
twa flight 885 carrying awad to new york took off at 415 pm 
also today israeli soldiers fatally shot a 43yearold 
palestinian man in the head while searching a village near the west 
bank city of ramallah a hospital official said the army said it 
was checking the report 
shamir last month ordered awad a 44yearold advocate of 
nonviolent resistance to the israeli occupation deported despite 
us objections the prime minister told israel radio today that 
awads expulsion will have a deterrent influence on other arabs 
shamir maintained awad played a leading role in the 
sixmonthold arab uprising in the occupied lands the rebellion 
has adopted some of the methods advocated by awad including use of 
commercial strikes and boycotts of israeli products 
awad was brought to the airport near tel aviv more than an hour 
before his flight to new york the convoy that accompanied the van 
included dozens of policemen the van carrying awad sped behind a 
hangar and was parked awad could not be seen by reporters 
about a dozen israeli supporters held placards at an airport 
entrance one written in hebrew and english read mubarak next 
year in jerusalem 
awad issued a written statement today in which he urged israelis 
and arabs to learn to take a risk for peace 
it would be unfair and cowardly on our part to postpone our 
conflict for the next generation the statement said 
awad who has a home in wapakoneta ohio also vowed to return 
to his native jerusalem 
early today in the west bank town of abwein israeli troops 
shot and killed dib mahmoud hussein after he failed to obey an

shamir told israel radio as he toured a factory near tel aviv 
that israel would respond to an upsurge in arab attacks swiftly 
and aggressively 
referring to an unprecedented firebomb attack sunday at tel 
avivs main shopping mall he said 
this is more proof that they the arabs are not just talking 
about the occupied territories but that the conflict is one for 
our survival these are blows against our existence 
defense minister yitzhak rabin and industry minister ariel 
sharon spoke out about a need to use guns to punish 
firebombthrowers and arsonists who have destroyed israeli forests 
in recent weeks 
rabin told the weekly cabinet session sunday that he had 
authorized israeli civilians in the occupied territories to shoot 
at arabs holding firebombs the jerusalem post daily reported 
sharon a former defense minister said on army radio that arab 
firebombers should be shot dead not only after they the 
firebombs are thrown they must be shot with the intention to kill 
to allow normal life for both arabs and jews 
israeli police meanwhile arrested three 20yearold 
palestinian men suspected of trying to set fire in a field in a 
jerusalem suburb over the weekend the radio said

the stock market and the franc dropped today after 
voters denied socialist president francois mitterrand a legislative 
majority and created the prospect of an unstable governing 
coalition 
the socialists emerged from sundays second round of voting with 
the biggest bloc of votes but must now look to the communists or 
the centrists for a coalition partner to form a national assembly 
majority just a few weeks ago the socialists were widely expected 
to gain an absolute majority 
also the extremeright national front all but vanished from the 
legislature winning just one seat against 35 two years ago among 
the casualties was party leader jeanmarie le pen 
some commentators said the political landscape could remain 
unsettled for weeks or even months such uncertainty would be 
unusual in france which has known only stable government 
majorities since charles de gaulle founded the fifth republic in 
1958 
share prices declined on the paris stock exchange today in 
reaction to the prospect of instability retreating an average of 
more than 2 percent the franc fell to 338 against the deutsche 
mark compared to 339 at fridays closing the market hates a 
vaccum said one trader at the paris exchange 
mitterrands premier michel rocard tried to put the best face 
on the partys disappointment you have chosen prudently he 
told voters sunday night in a television address it will take 
several days to draw the appropriate conclusions of all these 
choices 
however others were more pessimistic 
it will be the most subtle and complex situation you could 
imagine said political commentator alain duhamel 
the socialists could put together a majority in the 577seat 
national assembly either by joining with the communist party or by 
enticing some centrist members of the conservative coalition to 
change sides 
neither path looked easy 
it also was possible that the socialists would set up a minority 
government with rocard or someone new as premier they would then 
try to win by seeking votes to the left or the right depending on 
the issue 
the communists said they would not consider forming a coalition 
with the socialists unless mitterrand reverses his movement toward 
the center and launches radical new economic policies to fight 
unemployment and poverty 
centrist leaders said they would not abandon their conservative 
allies but they also indicated the time has come for right and 
left to find a way to work together 
sundays election filled 575 seats in the national assembly the 
final two seats will be determined in french polynesia on june 26 
it takes 289 votes to form an absolute majority in the assembly 
the socialists had 276 seats 
just barely behind the conservative alliance had 271 the 
conservative rally for the republic won 126 the centerright union 
for french democracy took 129 and smaller rightist parties 
collected a total of 16 
the communists had 27 
the national front salvaged one seat its leaders said it fell 
victim to the replacement of a proportional electoral system by a 
system of majority vote in two rounds which favors larger parties 
the first round was june 5 
sundays runoffs were in the 453 districts where no candidate 
won a majority the first time and voter turnout was estimated at 
71 percent 
in 1986 the conservatives won control of the legislature and 
mitterrand was forced into an uncomfortable cohabitation with 
the right 
but following mitterrands solid reelection victory may 8 with 
54 percent of the vote over thenpremier jacques chirac it was 
widely expected that the socialists would win a handy absolute 
majority in the assembly 
but the preelection polls proved wrong 
mitterrand met late sunday night with rocard but made no 
immediate public statement the new national assembly is to meet 
for the first time june 23 
after mitterrand was first elected in may 1981 he called 
legislative elections and won a clear majority for his socialists 
he named four communists cabinet ministers but they later quit 
when the government switched to an economic policy of austerity 
recently mitterrand said the socialists should pursue an 
opening toward the center although exactly what he means has 
been the mostdebated question in recent french politics 
georges marchais head of the communist party said his forces 
would vote for any socialist proposals favorable to popular and 
national interests but not commit them in advance to backing the 
government unless mitterrand changes course 
marchais called for a policy of effective struggle against 
unemployment poverty and social inequality an increase in 
purchasing power salaries pensions and welfare payments a policy 
of new growth in the economy a policy of freedom preserving the 
rights of wageearners and the independence of france a policy of 
peace and disarmament 
mitterrands policies by now may be closer to those of the 
centrists however the centrists have longstanding ties to their 
conservative partners that will not be broken easily

authorities using death certificates 
and toe tags have identified dozens of decaying bodies found 
stacked in a funeral home some for years but a coroner said some 
of the identities may never be known 
there will be about 10 that no matter what we do we will not 
be able to identify them chief medical examiner peter lipkovic 
said sunday one doesnt have a head or legs so even if we had a 
dental chart what could we do 
officials on a routine inspection discovered eight of the bodies 
early last week and another 36 were found friday at howell morning 
glory chapel which had the city contract for handling the bodies 
of indigents 
twentysix boxes containing cremated ashes also were found at 
the funeral home the state department of professional regulation 
suspended owner lewis howells license after the initial finds 
meantime the painstaking process of identifying the remains 
continues 
a clerk from the vital statistics office at the state department 
of health and rehabilitative services put in overtime this weekend 
pulling death certificates for investigators 
we entered names into the computer playing a matching game 
lipkovic said 
means of identification also have included hospital bracelets 
medical examiners toe tags and medical appliances such as hip 
pins labels on cremation boxes were used to identify 26 sets of 
remains 
by sunday officials had identified 49 of the 70 remains at the 
home there were leads on identifying many of the remaining bodies 
lipkovic said 
the oldest body was identified through a 1978 death certificate 
lipkovic said 
officials have not released the names of those identified and 
have not contacted family members 
lipkovic said he believes no more bodies will be found but 
officials plan to bring in heavy equipment to dig up the yard 
behind the funeral home 
three crime scene experts from the florida department of law 
enforcement and two homicide detectives from the sheriffs office 
are working on the investigation

polish leader wojciech jaruzelski today 
opened a twoday meeting of the communist party central committee 
with a plea for national reconciliation and a promise that more 
independent groups will be legalized 
but he appeared to rule out talking to the outlawed solidarity 
trade union which polish authorities have maintained accepts money 
from the us government 
we can talk to anyone as long as he is not a client 
especially a paid one of a foreign court jaruzelski said 
the plenum was the first meeting of the 230member central 
committee since poland was shaken by strikes in april and may and 
it was expected to give important signals of the authorities 
future moves to prevent more unrest 
jaruzelski first secretary of the polish united workers party 
said upcoming nationwide elections for municipal and provincial 
councils offer poles an opportunity to chose active candidates who 
could represent their needs 
the elections sunday are structured in a way that assures in 
advance that the communist party and its allies will dominate the 
councils 
but jaruzelski said more seats have been set aside for nonparty 
members he said those independent people who refused to join the 
councils were another case of missing the train of history 
the party leader who also is president of the council of state 
said a governmentsocial commission should be established to 
monitor price increases in poland and said acrosstheboard price 
increases such as were introduced earlier this year should be 
avoided in the future 
jaruzelski confirmed that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will 
visit poland next month and said the trip will be important for 
polands future 
and the polish leader spoke at length about the disenchantment 
of youth with the communist party and called for redoubled efforts 
to win the allegiance of the younger generation 
referring to the strikes between april 25 and may 10 jaruzelski 
said they increased the chance for national understanding because 
they showed the majority of poles displayed a front of realism 
strikes took place in five factories with brief stoppages or 
strike threats in 25 others but the labor unrest did not spread 
out of control to factories around poland as it did in 1980 when 
solidarity was born 
a new law on associations is awaiting enactment said 
jaruzelski but that should not stop new groups from being 
legalized in the meantime 
he mentioned no specifics but there have been official hints 
that at least three independent groups a warsawbased proprivate 
enterprise economic society the dormant polish chapter of the pen 
writers club and the dziekania political discussion club in warsaw 
may soon be legally registered 
jaruzelski also suggested a round table meeting of 
representatives of existing and proposed associations to discuss 
solutions to polands problems he gave no details on who would 
convene the meeting who could be invited or when it might take 
place 
national reconciliation and one of the goals of the socialist 
renewal jaruzelski said it is broader today than in past 
years

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether the government may use a 19th century antifraud law to 
impose stiff civil fines on top of criminal penalties assessed for 
the same offense 
the court said it will hear an appeal by reagan administration 
officials seeking to fine the manager of a new york medical 
laboratory 131170 for defrauding the government of 585 on 
medicare bills 
the government imposed the penalty against irwin halper who 
runs new city medical laboratories 
halper was convicted criminally of submitting inflated claims 
for medicare reimbursement he was sentenced to two years in prison 
and fined 5000 
government officials then also fined him 131170 under the 
false claims act a civil statute enacted in 1863 to combat fraud 
against the union army by civil war defense contractors 
the civil fine was based on 2000 for each of 65 separate 
charges of overbilling plus 1170 for double the actual loss 
suffered by the government 
the government said halper billed blue cross and blue shield of 
greater new york at 12 per patient for a service that medicare 
reimburses at 3 
us district judge robert w sweet in new york city originally 
reduced the civil fine to 17170 and subsequently cut it to 1170 
when the government protested the first reduction 
sweet said the stiff fine the government wants amounts to a 
criminal penalty for violations for which halper has already been 
punished he said the original fine bears no rational relation 
to the governments loss 
the judge said the civil fine violated halpers double jeopardy 
protection against being punished twice for the same offense 
in the appeal filed today government lawyers pointed out that 
congress in 1986 increased the fines so that offenders now may be 
penalized from 5000 to 10000 per offense plus triple the 
actual government loss 
congress strengthened the governments civil remedies because 
it determined that more severe sanctions were needed in order to 
stem the tide of rampant fraud inflicted on the government 
justice department lawyers said 
such a stiff penalty is reasonable and well within congresss 
legislative power they said 
the case is us vs halper 871383

police have captured the no 2 leader of the 
shining path a fanatical maoist group that has waged a guerrilla 
war against the government for eight years a government minister 
said today 
osman morote 42 was arrested by counterinsurgency police 
sunday at a house in downtown lima along with two women deputy 
interior minister agustin mantilla said he declined to name the 
women 
morote had fake identification papers but was identified by his 
fingerprints mantilla said 
the capture is considered the most important since the shining 
path launched its guerrilla war in may 1980 since then the 
violence has claimed more than 10000 lives and cost this 
impoverished nation 5 billion in damage to its economy according 
to government figures 
morote known within the rebel band as comrade remigio is 
second in importance only to abimael guzman a former professor of 
philosophy who founded the shining path in 1970 as a splinter group 
of the communist party 
the shining path is seeking to overthrow perus elected 
government and install a peasant and worker state patterned after 
the ideas of chinas mao tsetung 
guzman is the ideologist of the organization but morote is 
considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the 
advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands 
that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military 
intelligence sources said the capture is the most important 
achievement so far in the governments efforts to halt the advance 
of the rebel movement which has spread from its base in the 
highland state of ayacucho through much of the country 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said morotes 
capture will create a power vacuum within the central committee of 
the shining path and cause tension until a replacement is decided 
upon 
there have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry 
between morote and guzman 53 and mantilla said he did not 
discount the possibility that guzman had betrayed morote to get him 
out of the way

the supreme court declining to study an 
unprecedented racialdesegregation case today refused to free 
yonkers ny officials from having to integrate city schools and 
build subsidized housing to overcome decades of discrimination 
the court without comment left intact rulings that yonkers 
must build subsidized housing in predomimantly white sections of 
the city and create magnet schools to reduce segregation 
the case stemming from a justice department lawsuit begun by 
the carter administration eight years ago marked the first time 
the government linked discrimination in education and housing 
yonkers with some 200000 residents is located just north of 
new york city 
us district judge leonard b sand in a 600page decision in 
1985 ruled that yonkers officials intentionally and unlawfully 
promoted racial segregation through their housing and school 
policies 
he said the city had confined subsidized housing to 
predominantly black and hispanic southwest yonkers and that 
officials had bowed to the racial bias of some whites in resisting 
school integration 
the judge then ordered the city to pay the multimilliondollar 
bill for desegregating the school system and building 200 units of 
subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of the city 
city officials agreed last january to build the 200 units but 
then sought to cancel the courtapproved agreement sand refused on 
june 8 to cancel the agreement 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld sands 1985 ruling 
in a 163page decision last december 
the appeals court rejected arguments by school board and city 
officials that discrimination in schools and housing should not be 
linked 
when two actors have cooperated in a given venture each 
contributing to the outcome that each desires it requires no 
stretch of legal doctrine to conclude that each actor is liable if 
the result deliberately attained is unlawful the appeals court 
said 
the reagan administration supported the appeals court ruling 
urging the supreme court to reject the appeals acted on today 
as they have throughout this litigation the school board 
and the city blame each other for the segregated yonkers public 
school system justice department lawyers said this 
fingerpointing however should not divert this courts attention 
from the substantial evidence of cooperative intentionally 
segregative actions by both the board and the city 
the cases are yonkers board of education vs us 871632 and 
yonkers vs us 871686

israeli and palestinian intellectuals did today 
what their political leaders have been unable to do for 40 years 
they signed a peace accord 
the treaty written in hebrew arabic and english on 
parchmentlike paper was signed by about 25 israeli and 
palestinian writers and painters during a news conference at which 
foreign reporters far outnumbered local journalists 
the document calls for the establishment of an independent 
palestinian state called falastin in the west bank and gaza 
strip which israel captured during the 1967 mideast war 
the treaty recognizes the right of israel and falastin to live 
in peace and security within their own borders it designates 
jerusalem a demilitarized city with open borders which would serve 
as the capital of both states 
israeli author yoram kaniuk described the signing as an 
historic moment 
we hope this will have some kind of influence on politicians 
who say there is no one to talk to and nothing to talk about he 
said claiming the document represented the first treaty ever 
successfully negotiated by israelis and palestinians 
kaniuk is one of the leaders of the israeli and palestinian 
writers artists and academics committee against occupation the 
only professional group that represents both israelis and 
palestinians from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the group includes leftwing israeli artists among them poet 
nathan zach 
he recently canceled an international poetry festival to protest 
allegedly harsh measures by the army to quell the 6monthold 
palestinian uprising in which 207 palestinians have been killed and 
about 5000 injured two israelis also have been killed 
asad el asad head of the palestinian writers association in 
the occupied territories said the palestine liberation 
organization favors the terms of the artists treaty 
we feel we are transmitting clearly and honestly the message 
of our represenatives the plo said el asad 
israel which is celebrating its 40th anniversary refuses to 
recognize the plo saying it is a terrorist organization the plo 
which has called for the destruction of israel has also refused to 
accept un resolutions recognizing israels right to secure its 
borders 
kaniuk said that israeli and palestinian negotiators often 
disagreed about the terms of the treaty and each side eventually 
had to give up dreams and accept reality 
zach said he would now extend his appeal beyond the circle of 
the committee and ask all likeminded artists writers and 
academics in israel and the occupied territories to sign the treaty 
if clods like us who are not always very good at taking 
action can do it so can politicians said zach if they 
dont its because they dont want to or are afraid to

caucus distributions smiths family on april 11 1985 asked a 
judge to appoint a financial guardian for him

the bullet was deflected from some kind of surface 
gerasimov said police had not yet determined whether the killing 
was premediated he said 
the shooting occurred during a demonstration for retaining the 
nagornokarabakh region in azerbaijan he said he did not say 
when the policeman was killed 
armenians gathered in a moscow cemetery on sunday and marched to 
the offices of the official tass news agency because of rumors that 
two armenians had been killed in azerbaijan he said the rumor was 
false

a federal antitrust lawsuit by actor paul 
newman and director george roy hill over profits from video 
cassette sales and rentals was killed by the supreme court today 
the court without comment let stand rulings that threw out the 
1985 suit against universal pictures and its parent mca inc 
newman and hill contended that universal and other major movie 
studios illegally conspired in the early 1980s to hold down 
artificially the profits paid to actors and directors from video 
sales and rentals 
the lawsuit said that as a result newman and hill did not 
receive their fair share of the profits from two movies made years 
earlier the sting and slapshot 
both men had signed profit participation agreements giving 
them a percentage of all income received for showing the movies 
us district judge james ideman dismissed the suit ruling that 
newman and hill had suffered no antitrust injury 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal last 
year 
the fundamental problem is that newman and hill entered into 
contracts between 1972 and 1976 before the alleged conspiracy 
arose the appeals court said the subsequent conspiracy could 
not have affected the competition for newman and hills services at 
the time the contracts were made 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for newman and hill called 
the appeals court ruling bizarre 
how is it possible that a direct victim of a horizontal 
pricefixing conspiracy does not suffer antitrust injury the 
appeal asked 
the case is newman vs universal pictures 871617

a newspapers thwarted attempt to obtain the 
names and addresses of jurors who served in a muchpublicized new 
york murder trial failed to win supreme court review today 
the justices without comment turned away arguments by newsday 
that the public has a constitutional right of access to such 
information unless there exist specific reasons justifying secrecy 
the controversy stems from the 1984 trial in suffolk county 
ny of william patterson on charges of murdering his estranged 
wife frances 
mrs patterson was shot through a window of her home while 
watching television with her two children on june 29 1982 
during jury deliberations in pattersons trial a reporter for 
the long islandbased newspaper asked court officials for the 
jurors names and addresses the request was denied 
after pattersons trial ended in a mistrial due to a deadlocked 
jury newsday continued to seek the juror information 
the suffolk county commissioner of jurors refused to give the 
newspaper the information it sought he said the jurors names and 
addresses fell within the confidentiality exemptions of a state law 
aimed at curtailing secrecy within the state court system 
newsday sued over the blocked access claiming a constitutional 
right to criminal trial records 
three state courts rejected newsdays appeal 
the new york court of appeals the states highest court ruled 
last dec 23 that the names and addresses of jurors who serve in 
criminal trials may be kept confidential 
inasmuch as newsday has not contended that it has been 
denied access to any judicial proceedings or to any transcripts of 
any proceedings newsdays constitutional right of access has not 
been violated the state court ruled 
in the appeal acted on today newsday relied on past supreme 
court decisions upholding the publics right to attend criminal 
trials including jury selection and pretrial hearings 
the appeal said the interest which led this court to 
recognize such rights are also promoted by access to the names 
and addresses of jurors 
the newspaper urged the court to recognize a first amendment 
right of access to jurors names and addresses which must be 
properly considered before such access may be denied

the worlds most powerful atom smasher is 
set to start exploring some of natures deepest mysteries this week 
and physicists are thrilled at the prospects for scientific 
breakthroughs 
after nearly 10 years of construction and finetuning the giant 
collider at the fermi national accelerator laboratory in suburban 
batavia west of chicago is ready to come on line to smash protons 
and antiprotons together 
we have the potential for making more discoveries in 
highenergy physics than at any other time in history says fermi 
director leon lederman 
fermilab spokesman richard dease said today that the startup 
date is not certain but it is expected to be this week 
more than 200 physicists from around the world will be 
participating in the search for tiny subatomic particles that have 
so far eluded scientists trying to unravel the basic details of how 
the universe works 
fermilabs collider has three times the power of its closest 
competitor the cern collider in geneva switzerland and could 
open the door to new unexpected scientific discoveries officials 
say 
now we really get to go into the unknown says harvard 
physicist roy schwitters thats why were in the business 
schwitters codirector of the 40 million collider detector 
facility compared the collider to using wrecking bars and 
sledgehammers to try to find the treasure 
the fermilab collider whirls protons and antiprotons around in 
opposite directions on a 4mile circular track called the tevatron 
the protons and antiprotons travel at a speed close to that of 
light 186000 miles a second 
when they collide they annihilate in a burst of energy reaching 
2 trillion electron volts equivalent to a temperature of 10000 
trillion degrees 
the detector facility traps the traces of particles produced by 
the collisions

the supreme court today turned down the appeal 
of a philosophy professor denied an opportunity to address congress 
about secular humanism during the lawmakers daily moments of 
opening prayer 
the court over one dissenting vote refused to hear arguments 
that the professors rights were violated 
justice byron r white voted to review the case more fully 
paul kurtz who teaches philosophy at the state university of 
new york in buffalo said he unlawfully was denied an invitation to 
make remarks to congress about his humanist beliefs he had asked 
the chaplains of the senate and house to let him speak during the 
time designated for opening prayers 
kurtz said he was barred from speaking because he told the 
chaplains he would not lead the lawmakers in prayer 
the opening ceremonies of our nations legislature if they 
claim to represent anybody must represent everybody the religious 
and nonreligious alike kurtzs lawyer argued 
the us circuit court of appeals here threw out kurtzs suit 
last september 
the chaplains of the house and senate occasionally invite guests 
to deliver the opening prayers kurtz wrote to the chaplains in 
1984 seeking to address either or both houses 
he said as a secular humanist i would not of course invoke 
any deity during my remarks i do believe that it is important 
however for members of congress occasionally to have the 
opportunity to hear nontheists speak of moral responsibilities 
both chaplains declined to invite him the senate chaplain said 
kurtz must have a senator sponsor him to receive an invitation the 
house chaplain told him that each house session must begin with a 
prayer 
kurtz then sued the chaplains and treasury secretary james a 
baker his suit named baker on grounds that the treasury provided 
taxpayer money to fund the chaplain programs in congress 
the appeals court threw out his suit on grounds that the 
chaplains lacked the authority to permit kurtz to speak that 
deprives kurtz of legal standing to sue the appeals court said 
the rare privilege for outsiders of addressing either house 
requires approvals of the members of each house the appeals court 
said 
even if the chaplains had agreed to invite kurtz it would be 
unreasonable to imagine that they could have provided him with the 
actual opportunity to deliver nonreligious remarks to either house 
of congress during the time expressly set aside for prayer the 
appeals court said 
the reagan administration urged the justices to reject kurtzs 
appeal but on different grounds 
justice department lawyers said kurtz must lose his case because 
a 1983 supreme court upheld the constitutionality of prayers that 
open each day of the nebraska legislature the court said such 
prayers do not violate constitutions establishment clause 
requiring separation of church and state 
so too is it untenable to contend as kurtz does that the 
framers of the constitution intended the establishment or 
freespeech component of the first amendment as equaltime 
provisions mandating nontheistic speechmaking whenever congress 
permits religious invocations the government lawyers said 
the case is kurtz vs baker 871581

the supreme court ruled today that police 
officers sometimes may chase a person who starts running at the 
sight of them even though they have no reason to suspect criminal 
conduct 
the court unanimously ruled that michigan prosecutors may use as 
evidence the drugs dropped by a man who began running when he 
spotted a police cruiser on a detroit street 
writing for the court justice harry a blackmun said the 
detroit officers pursuit of michael mose chesternut did not amount 
to a seizure under the constitutions fourth amendment 
the amendment generally requires police to have a warrant or 
probable cause to suspect a crime before conducting any search 
or seizure 
the court held in 1980 that a person is seized as opposed to 
arrested when in view of all of the circumstances surrounding 
the incident a reasonable person would have believed that he was 
not free to leave 
adhering to that principle blackmun said chesternut was not 
unlawfully seized during the initial police pursuit 
blackmun noted that the police did not sound their cruisers 
siren or order chesternut to halt they merely pursued him as he 
ran blackmun said 
while the very presence of a police car driving parallel to a 
running pedestrian could be somewhat intimidating this kind of 
police presence does not standing alone constitute a seizure 
he said 
according to court records chesternut was standing on a detroit 
street corner talking to another man a little after midnight on 
dec 19 1984 when he saw a police cruiser 
police said chesternut immediately started running away and was 
followed by the officers after turning a corner and as the 
cruiser drew alongside of him chesternut threw a number of packets 
to the ground and then stopped 
the officers said they picked up the packets which appeared to 
contain narcotics and then arrested chesternut he was charged 
with possessing heroin codeine and diazapan 
a state judge threw out the case ruling that police lacked a 
reasonable suspicion to pursue chesternut and therefore had seized 
the evidence unlawfully a state appeals court upheld the dismissal 
but todays ruling reinstated the charges against chesternut 
the case is michigan vs chesternut 861824

of the two was quickly recaptured authorities said 
the detainees used a hacksaw blade late sunday to cut through 
cell bars knocked out a fourthfloor window at the cumberland 
county jail and lowered themselves on a rope made of bedsheets 
authorities said 
the breakout occurred minutes before the 11 pm lockdown when 
the inmates are returned to their cells and locked in for the 
night officials said 
the escape apparently was spotted by a fayetteville police 
officer who noticed someone drop from the center sheriffs

killing a woman injured himself while falling from the fourth 
floor and was recaptured and taken to cape fear valley medical

the stabbing deaths of paul kutz sr 68 and his wife janie kutz 
62 
meyer a 21yearold former soldier at fort bragg pleaded 
guilty to the december 1986 murders and was to appear in superior 
court today for a continuation of the sentencing phase of his 
trial he faces the death penalty or life in prison

presidential race than public opinion surveys last month with 
democrat michael dukakis holding a slim fivepoint lead over 
republican george bush

surveys in may

percent support for dukakis who has clinched the democratic 
nomination and 44 percent for bush the republican nomination 
campaign winner seven percent were unsure 
lou harris amp associates contacted 1258 likely voters and the 
margin of sampling error in its survey was plus or minus three

the soviet union claims it owns a government 
building and a downtown parking lot in jerusalem and is expected to 
demand several million dollars in back rent israeli officials and 
media said today 
the soviets also are expected to claim other property in 
jerusalem most of it believed acquired decades ago through the 
russian orthodox church 
israeli government officials declined to comment on specific 
soviet claims but jerusalem city spokeswoman sivana meryn said the 
city acknowledged a paved parking lot on king george street in 
downtown jerusalem was built on soviet property she said israel 
would be willing to negotiate rental payments 
the soviet union says the building which currently houses the 
agriculture ministry also belongs to the soviets 
israeli officials said they were ready to discuss the claims but 
hoped the talks would be friendly and would not disrupt a movement 
toward improved ties between the soviet union and israel 
the soviet union severed ties with israel to protest the israeli 
capture of lands from egypt jordan and syria in the 1967 war 
last july for the first time since then moscow sent a consular 
delegation to israel to examine property holdings and speak to the 
estimated 2500 soviet passport holders in israel 
israel in return has asked that it be allowed to send a 
delegation to moscow and prime minister yitzhak shamir said last 
week that soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told him 
the israeli delegation would receive soviet visas next month 
on sunday the head of the soviet delegation georgi martirosow 
informed the israeli foreign ministry that the delegates had 
completed a survey of property owned by the soviet union and 
currently being used by israel 
martirosow recently returned from moscow where he spent several 
weeks combing soviet archives for deeds and other documents showing 
soviet property holdings in israel a foreign ministry official 
said 
the soviet delegates are expected to present a detailed list of 
their holdings along with demands for rental payments in the next 
several weeks the official said requesting anonymity 
a spokesman who answered the telephone at the soviet 
delegations office declined comment 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said two weeks ago that the 
soviet union would be willing to renew ties with israel once all 
parties in the middle east conflict agreed to participate in an 
international peace conference 
shamir however has rejected israeli participation in such a 
conference

the supreme court today told wisconsins 
highest court to restudy the case of a teenager born out of 
wedlock who says she should be allowed to seek support payments 
from her fathers estate 
the justices said the wisconsin supreme court should review its 
ruling that a 4600 settlement between heather jo kruegers 
parents after she was born bars her from seeking any additional 
money 
todays order sending the case back to wisconsin said the state 
court should consider it in light of the justices decision last 
week striking down as unconstitutional a sixyear deadline 
pennsylvania imposed for filing paternity lawsuits 
miss krueger 18 of baraboo wis was born sept 7 1969 
her mother betty lou krueger reached an agreement in 1970 with 
arlen lee moore who admitted he was heathers father and agreed to 
pay 3600 in child support over the next four years plus 1000 in 
hospital costs 
a lawsuit was filed in behalf of the child in 1984 seeking 
additional support payments from moore who died in 1986 when the 
private plane he was piloting crashed 
moore owned his own biochemical research business his widow 
who lives in sun prairie wis is the heir to his estate 
the suit in behalf of heather jo sought 17 percent of moores 
gross income since 1974 plus additional money for his daughters 
medical bills and medical insurance the suit also sought to have 
her named his primary beneficiary in a life insurance policy 
the wisconsin supreme court last june threw out the suit the 
appeals court said the lump sum settlement between heather jos 
parents in 1970 bars any further lawsuit based on longstanding 
doctrine 
the state court said the doctrine is based on the principle that 
fairness to the defendant requires that at some point litigation 
over the particular controversy must come to an end 
the state court said the interests of heather jo were 
virtually represented by her mother when the agreement with 
moore was reached although the settlement agreement appears 
in hindsight to be low we are satisfied that it is not 
unconscionable 
the appeals court also rejected arguments that heather jos 
rights were violated because such lumpsum settlements were only 
permitted for illegitimate children 
wisconsin law was amended in 1981 to ban such settlements for 
children born out of wedlock and to require continuing support for 
them 
miss krueger is attending college at the university of 
wisconsinbaraboo center and is living with her mother who does 
parttime work as a cleaning lady and clerk 
wisconsin state officials urged the high court to hear the case 
and rule in favor of miss krueger 
attorney general donald j hanaway said permitting the lumpsum 
payments for those born out of wedlock creates a class of children 
totally deprived of an ability to receive child support from 
fathers who have the ability to pay 
the case is gerhardt vs moore 871103

soviet forces reportedly have 
returned to some cities in eastern afghanistan to fight moslem 
guerrillas who have raided posts defended by afghan troops sources 
said today 
dr ijaz gilani an analyst at the pakistanibased institute of 
strategic studies said he has received reports that the soviet 
forces are back at the garrison of jalalabad and khost near the 
pakistani border 
there was no independent confirmation of gilanis report 
gilani said afghan forces have remained on the defensive since 
the soviets began withdrawing their troops on may 15 
the low morale of the kabul regime soldiers touched a new low 
with the withdrawal of russian troops from certain garrison towns 
and strong points gilani said 
soviet troops first entered afghanistan in 1979 to support its 
marxist government 
jalalabad on the main road from peshawar pakistan to the 
capital of kabul was the first soviet garrison vacated although 
soviet officials claimed the garrison was left completely to the 
afghan troops guerrillas say they have spotted soviet soldiers 
there long after the reported pullout 
khost scene of a major battle early this year after it was 
seized by guerrillas was recently reported again on the verge of 
collapse as rebels poured in from the pakistan border just 15 
miles away 
gilani said he had no precise figures on the soviet 
redeployment but officials in moscow and kabul have warned they 
might revise their ninemonth withdrawal time frame if pakistan and 
the united states continue to arm the moslem guerrillas 
the war is still continuing at a medium pace with more 
initiative in the hands of the guerrillas gilani said 
statistics compiled by gilani and his analysts indicated there 
were 266 battles in afghanistan in may down from 431 in the 
corresponding month in 1987 he said 231 of the attacks last month 
were launched by guerrillas and 35 by sovietkabul forces 
according to estimates by the institute of strategic studies 
some 2450 afghan troops defected to the guerrillas last month 
however gilani said it was difficult to determine the difference 
between outright defections and cases in which afghan troops have 
surrendered to the insurgents 
the report also said 868 soldiers were killed in may including 
54 soviets 192 guerrillas 542 afghan troops and 80 unidentified 
people 
in april a total of 1149 soldiers died compared to a 
september 1987 high of 2351 according to the report

a west german womans effort to recover the 
claude monet painting stolen from her sisters home during world 
war ii ended unsuccessfully in the supreme court today 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that gerda 
deweerth waited too long before trying to recover the painting from 
edith marks baldinger who bought it in new york city in 1957 
the painting monets champs de ble a vetheuil is one of a 
series of impressionist landscapes painted near the town of 
vetheuil in northern france 
the oil painting shows a wheat field a village and trees it is 
signed and dated claude monet 79 
monet is one of the best known members of the school of 
impressionistic artists active in france in the late 19th and early 
20th centuries it was from his early work impression sunrise 
la havre that the term impressionism was coined 
the painting at issue is valued at more than 500000 according 
to the appeals court that ruled against ms deweerth 
she inherited the painting in 1922 and kept it in her home at 
wuppertalelberfeld west germany in 1943 ms deweerth sent the 
painting to her sisters home in southern germany for safekeeping 
during the war 
when american troops quartered in the house departed in 1945 
the painting disappeared lower courts assumed it was stolen 
ms baldinger was a goodfaith purchaser of the monet 12 years 
later 
us district judge vincent broderick in new york ruled that the 
painting must be returned to ms deweerth but the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals reversed his ruling 
the appeals court said ms deweerth failed to exercise 
reasonable diligence in locating the painting after its 
disappearance and therefore had waited too long under new york 
law before suing its current owner 
the case is deweerth vs baldinger 871752

a 16yearold student who praised mikhail 
gorbachevs reform movement won moscows first beauty pageant and 
walked away with a wealth of prizes that drew a gasp of amazement 
from the audience 
i felt exactly like alice in wonderland maria kalinina said 
sunday after her warm smile and svelte figure won over the 12 
judges who chose her from six finalists in a contest that 
emphasized bathing suit competition 
photographers were waiting for her as she arrived at school 
today and hurried to a secondfloor classroom to take the 
equivalent of her high school final examinations 
izvestia an afternoon paper reported with almost unbelieveable 
speed for the normally slow soviet press that ms kalinina received 
the highest mark in her spanish test and top grades in literature 
and math exams as well 
like the other finalists ms kalinina is very thin in contrast 
to the common perception in the west that soviet women are stout 
the moscow beauty 88 contest made possible by gorbachevs 
more tolerant policies was the first of its kind in the soviet 
capital millions of soviets watched a live television broadcast of 
the pageant 
although similar pageants have been staged in several other 
soviet cities such contests are still a new phenomenon in a 
socialist society which long disdained them as bourgeois it was 
not clear yet whether the new beauty queen would compete in 
nationwide or international pageants 
ms kalinina was the youngest contestant in a field of 36 that 
included an accountant two librarians and two actresses the 
oldest was yelena baranova 26 a doctor who did not reach the 
final round sunday night 
during the questionandanswer competition practically the only 
event in which the finalists wore more than a tiny scrap of 
clothing ms kalinina was asked what made the moscow contest 
different from beauty pageants in the west 
ours is different because we have perestroika she 
replied using the russian word for gorbachevs policy of economic 
and social reforms 
the third and final night of what was gala event by normally 
austere soviet went smoothly until the glittering crown was placed 
on ms kalininas head 
at that moment longstemmed red roses began to rain from the 
ceiling knocking off the crown and causing the beauty queen to 
duck and dodge although she never lost her smile the next shower 
of roses was aimed a little in front of the beauty queen and did 
not disrupt the ceremonies 
as the master of ceremonies read out the list of prizes for ms 
kalinina the crowd of 11000 in the palace of sport sighed in 
amazement the prizes included a cruise on the adriatic sea a 
trip to austria a television and mounds of cosmetics from the 
western and soviet sponsors of the event 
the other finalists and some of the other contestants received 
cosmetics and trips inside the soviet union for categories such as 
the most photogenic and most athletic 
trips abroad are rare for soviet citizens and western cosmetics 
of the types distributed to the finalists are highly prized in this 
country 
some of the loudest applause of the evening went to writer 
mikhail zadurnov who performed comedy routines satirizing consumer 
shortages and the bureaucrats that are blocking soviet reforms 
at the end of an evening dominated by rock music by soviet 
bands zadurnov said and we muscovites would like to thank 
ronald reagan alluding to the facelift moscow received for the 
recent superpower summit 
the parting line brought gasps of surprise from the crowd then 
thunderous laughter and applause

george bush said today he has no long list 
no short list for the vice presidential spot on the republican 
ticket adding that he has only now started to consider a process 
to choose a running mate 
bush who clinched the presidential nomination two months ago 
told reporters that he and his aides are getting a little 
procedure worked out for winnowing the field of prospects for the 
no 2 spot on the ticket 
ive enjoyed all the fabulous speculation about whom he 
might select the vice president told reporters called to his 
office in the old executive office building 
bush announced the hiring of two new toplevel campaign aides to 
deal with the press sheila tate who was spokeswoman to first lady 
nancy reagan from 198185 was named press secretary and jim lake 
who held previous press roles in the 1980 and 1984 reaganbush 
campaigns was named as a senior communications adviser 
pressed to say how close he was to picking a vice presidential 
running mate bush said no list were getting a little 
procedure worked out so there literally is no long list no short 
list 
bush reiterated that he will not seriously consider the question 
until after the democrats put together their ticket in atlanta next 
month meanwhile he continues to get advice from party activists 
i think we need an exciting vice presidential candidate 
said gov garrey carruthers of new mexico we need someone 
certainly who is a good communicator like ronald reagan 
i recommended to bush that he choose elizabeth dole 
carruthers said in an interview 
he wasnt alone in offering advice to bush and the vice 
presidents aides its apparent the suggestion box at the bush 
campaign is packed 
bush and his aides have been reluctant to talk about what 
selection process theyll use how long a bush shortlist of 
candidates might be or when the choice will be made known 
but the jockeying to have an impact on this decision was evident 
at the unity 88 weekend conference put on by the republican 
national committee 
former secretary of state alexander m haig jr who joined sen 
bob dole rkan rep jack kemp rny and former delaware gov 
pete du pont in saluting bush joked about the speculation the 
alsorans in the gop competition came to denver to protect their 
prospects for the spot on the ticket 
haig said that since he had run for president and been defeated 
by bush he had no interest in seeking the second spot im 
content he said 
the list of names has lengthened in recent weeks including 
speculation about potential women candidates such as mrs dole 
former un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick and sen nancy kassebaum 
of kansas along with senator dole kemp du pont plus govs jim 
thompson of illinois george deukmejian of california and john 
sununu of new hampshire 
i would like to see somebody that would be just a little bit 
more conservative than bush just to satisfy the right wing of 
the party said bill hughes a bush campaign chairman from 
vancouver wash 
joy wood of denver who is trying to unseat rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo said im pushing for a very experienced 
person i think the republican party has very qualified women at 
the top but i as a woman want the strongest vice presidential 
candidate 
i suspect it will be a man but i just hope it will be a very 
qualified person she said 
barbara campbell state republican party chairwoman in montana 
said i think its a possibility that bush will select a woman 
but she also said that i have stated that its important to 
look to someone who understands the west 
punch green bushs campaign chairman in oregon said i want 
him to pick a guy or a gal who will be a vice president just like 
george bush has been for ronald reagan a person who will disagree 
with him at times in the oval office but then stand by the 
president when he makes the decision 
carruthers however said he hoped bush wouldnt make the choice 
based mostly on the basis of perceived loyalty 
loyalty is one condition but i would hope that it would not 
be the firstorder condition he said 
what i would concern myself with most is the selection of a 
winner carruthers said

george bush criticized south africa today as a racist state 
but said he would not support breaking off diplomatic relations 
the apparent republican presidential nominee commented as a new 
poll suggested he was gaining slightly on democrat michael dukakis 
bush was asked at the white house whether he agreed with a move 
by the democrats to have their party platform brand south africa 
a terrorist state 
i think its a racist state regrettably he said 
that language was stronger than president reagan uses but 
bushs policy recommendation was the same as the reagan 
administration has followed he said the government must see 
whether the united states can use its moral influence to change 
things in south africa 
the new harris poll showed dukakis with a 5point lead just 
within the surveys margin of potential sampling error that was 
down from a 7point advantage in a similar poll last month 
dukakis was supported by 49 percent bush by 44 percent and 7 
percent were unsure in the poll in which lou harris amp associates 
contacted 1258 likely voters the first week of june the margin of 
sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points 
one day earlier bush seeking black support edged away from 
the reagan administration on aid to minority businesses while 
democrat dukakis suggested he would use the us military to help 
fight the war on drugs 
jesse jackson meanwhile struck a conciliatory stance on the 
touchy issue of whether he wants to be the democratic vice 
presidential candidate after declaring last week that he was 
entitled to consideration and that consideration means an 
offer jackson backed off a bit 
i do not want to push mike dukakis to that point jackson 
said sunday interviewed from chicago on nbctvs meet the 
press asked whether he should be offered the no 2 spot he said 
only that he deserved serious consideration 
jackson spent the weekend in his hometown of chicago mulling 
his next move he has said he will campaign all the way up to the 
democratic convention dukakis wrapped up the democratic nomination 
in the final four primaries last week 
the massachusetts governor was meeting today with congressional 
leaders and law enforcement officials from several states to 
discuss drug issues he also sounded an antidrug theme on sunday 
when he told the us conference of mayors the administrations 
antidrug effort is in a state of chaos 
that was an apparent dig at bush who headed an administration 
task force on antidrug efforts without providing specifics 
dukakis told the mayors meeting in salt lake city that the 
military should be prepared to assist in druginterdiction efforts 
it will take tough sustained and unrelenting enforcement 
at home and abroad enforcement which uses the military where 
appropriate and necessary he said 
as dukakis spoke democratic party platform drafters were 
calling for the appointment of a federal drug czar a 
platformdrafting panel wrapped up a long weekend of work sunday at 
the resort of mackinac island mich 
in addition to backing a drug czar the democrats released 
working papers that urged expanded aids research adoption of the 
equal rights amendment greater efforts to end homelessness and a 
law requiring employers to give workers advance notice of plant 
closings 
the jackson forces had mixed success at the platformdrafting 
sessions the committee agreed the democratic platform will label 
south africa a terrorist state as jackson has demanded but the 
panel was split on whether to call for a jacksonbacked freeze in 
pentagon spending and expressed reluctance to call for the tax 
hikes jackson wants 
despite some bickering the democrats put up a united front 
i found more areas of agreement than disagreement said rep 
william gray iii of pennsylvania the chairman of the drafting 
panel and a jackson supporter 
the republicans too were making like a happy family over the 
weekend in denver at the first of three unity conferences by 
the republican national committee gop activists from 16 states 
and three former rivals for the nomination rallied around bush 
the vice president who pleased many republican observers when 
he went on the offensive last week against dukakis promised the 
party faithful on saturday theyd be seeing more of the same 
were just beginning he said 
another bush tactic has been distancing himself from the white 
house on selected issues one of them is likely to be civil rights 
and the vice president stepped slightly away from the 
administration on the use of federal aid to assist minority 
businesses 
i support strongly increased minority development efforts by 
the federal government he said in a commencement speech sunday 
at predominantly black central state university in wilberforce 
ohio we must bring black americans and other minorities into the 
free enterprise system 
the reagan administration has opposed government programs that 
set aside a portion of contracts for minorityrun businesses such 
setasides have been used by federal state and local governments 
as a way to remedy past discrimination 
bush who celebrated his 64th birthday sunday was awarded an 
honorary degree by the university 
later sunday the vice president flew to danville va where he 
campaigned for gop congressional candidate linda arey and repeated 
his call for dukakis to join him in requesting an independent 
counsels investigation of alleged ethics breaches by democratic 
house speaker jim wright of texas 
wright who is under preliminary investigation by the house 
ethics committee has denied the allegations 
bush was back in washington today where he planned to spend the 
first part of the week dukakis scheduled a threeday southern 
campaign swing later in the week

companies may violate antitrust law when they 
lobby private organizations that play a prominent role in 
influencing business legislation the supreme court ruled today 
the 72 decision upheld a 114 million jury award against a 
company accused of packing a meeting of the national fire 
protection association when the organization adopted a safety code 
for electrical wiring 
justice william j brennan in his opinion for the court said 
such activity to influence a private organization does not warrant 
the same antitrust immunity granted to businesses and trade groups 
that lobby governmental bodies 
the activity at issue here did not take place in the open 
political arena where partisanship is the hallmark of 
decisionmaking but within the confines of a private 
standardsetting process brennan said 
also he said the activity involved more than an exercise of 
the power of persuasion the adoption of an industry code in 
part involves the exercise of market power because members of the 
national fire protection association including consumers 
distributors and manufacturers implicitly agreed to abide by the 
associations rules brennan said 
given the context and nature of the conduct it can more aptly 
be characterized as commercial activity with a political impact 
he said 
the case stemmed from a may 1980 meeting of the association that 
adopted a model legislative code for electrical conduit a hollow 
tubing used in building construction to carry insulated electrical 
wires 
allied tube amp conduit corp the largest producer in the united 
states of steel conduit was accused of organizing 230 voters at 
the meeting to block approval in the code of a competing plastic 
conduit 
the charge was made by indian head inc and its carlon division 
which makes electrical conduit from polyvinyl chloride a plastic 
the national fire protection association is a private 
organization that adopts the national electrical code of safety 
regulations on which must state legislation is based 
indian head said allied illegally restrained trade in violation 
of federal antitrust laws a federal jury awarded 38 million and 
the amount as provided by law was tripled 
a federal judge threw out the judgment but it was reinstated 
last year by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals based in new 
york city 
the supreme court in upholding the appeals court ruling 
refused to extend protection from antitrust suits it established in 
1961 
the justices ruled then that railway companies did not violate 
antitrust law when they conducted a public relations campaign for 
legislation aimed at placing the trucking industry at a 
disadvantage 
justices byron r white and sandra day oconnor dissented today 
the case is allied tube vs indian head 87157

the supreme court ruling that the postal 
service is similar to a private business said today the service 
must pay interest on back pay owed to a worker who won a lawsuit 
charging it with illegal discrimination 
by a 53 vote the court ordered interest on back pay for a 
letter carrier in chesterfield mo who was fired and later 
ordered rehired 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said when the 
post office department was reorganized by congress in 1970 into the 
postal service it became in key respects more like a private 
enterprise than a government agency 
the reorganization launched the postal service into the 
commercial world specifically allowing it to sue and be sued 
blackmun said 
it follows that congress is presumed to have waived any 
otherwise existing immunity of the postal service from interest 
awards he said 
the court ordered interest paid to theodore j loeffler who was 
fired from his job as a letter carrier after 10 years 
his superiors said loeffler violated a rule dealing with the 
organizing of socalled boxholder mail that is sent to current 
occupant at an address and does not carry the residents name 
for a period in 1979 and 1980 letter carriers were not allowed 
to sort the boxholder mail in separate compartments of their 
carrying bags before beginning their routes they were required to 
leave the third class mail in bundles and sort it out at each point 
of delivery 
loeffler who worked in a rural area openly refused to obey the 
rule as did two female letter carriers 
one of the women was suspended and threatened with dismissal 
the other woman was warned but was not otherwise disciplined 
loeffler was fired when he was caught breaking the rule the 
fourth time 
he sued the postal service under a 1964 civil rights law banning 
sex discrimination in employment and a federal judge ruled in his 
favor loeffler was awarded 91871 in back pay and was ordered 
reinstated 
but the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled that loeffler 
was not entitled to interest the back pay would have earned from 
the time he was fired until he won the suit 
such interest generally is authorized for those who win 
antidiscrimination suits under the 1964 act 
the appeals court said the postal service was immune from the 
interest payments because congress had not passed a law 
specifically eliminating the services protection against such 
civil rights suits 
the reagan administration said todays case could affect 
hundreds of employment discrimination cases pending against the 
postal service 
dissenting from the ruling were chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices byron r white and sandra day oconnor 
justice anthony m kennedy did not take part in the ruling 
the case is loeffler vs frank 861431

chinese factories and offices have at least 20 
million excess workers and the situation is costing the government 
billions of dollars each year the official xinhua news agency said 
monday 
the news agency quoted an official in charge of personnel 
affairs as saying that overstaffing costs the state about 162 
billion a year equal to half the total revenue the state receives 
from enterprises each year 
he said many employees spend working hours playing cards or 
watching television at one 800person factory in shijiazhuang 
northeast china employees were found to work only four hours 
during an eighthour shift he said 
china with an urban work force of 120 million has cited low 
productivity and surplus workers as major obstacles to its drive to 
modernize industries and make them more profitable 
but the government is also committed to keeping unemployment at 
the present stated level of 2 percent and has said it must create 
30 million new jobs by 1990 just to keep pace with the expanding 
work force 
factory managers have been given authority to dismiss 
unproductive workers but it is very rare for workers to be fired 
for loafing on the job

a subcommittee of the nations largest 
presbyterian body today voted overwhelmingly to recommend adoption 
of a major policy statement on nuclear war 
the revised paper on christian obedience in a nuclear age 
was scheduled to be considered later today by a full committee of 
the 200th general assembly of the presbyterian church usa 
the subcommittee of the committee on peacemaking and 
international relations ended almost four days of attimes 
contentious debate with a 151 vote to recommend adoption of the 
statement 
the subcommittee revised the original proposal to make it clear 
presbyterians considered obedience to government the normal course 
and to soften language that now declares nuclear deterrence 
immoral the subcommittee adopted a writing teams finetuning of 
the policy to agree with earlier changes in recommendations 
meanwhile the full assembly today took up some internal issues 
including commissioning of missionaries 
other issues remaining for discussion by the denominations 
highest body include pornography abortion and israels treatment 
of palestinians in its occupied territories 
on sunday the statement on nuclear war was revised to say a 
christian normally should support the government and nuclear 
deterrence is immoral as an end in itself the 630 delegates 
are scheduled to take up the report tuesday evening the day before 
the assembly ends 
we presbyterians will study this issue to death while the 
rest of the world moves on said subcommittee member j leslie 
reindl an elder from minnesota 
sue anderson an elder from tennessee however said the paper 
and the fiveyear process that preceded its writing had led to 
much debate in the 3 millionmember denomination 
if the intent is to make peace especially within the 
denomination ms anderson said then let the people sitting 
beside me in the pew have a chance to look at this 
reservations in the subcommittee centered around fears the paper 
elevated tax resistance and civil obedience above obedience in the 
churchs eyes and promised financial support to those who engage in 
resistance 
however the revised paper retains declarations that nuclear war 
is immoral and says the policy of nuclear deterrence has been 
in danger of becoming an end in itself rather than an interim 
measure of selfdefense such a policy as an end in itself is not 
morally defensible the work for peaceful alternatives needs to be 
vigorously pursued 
supporters of the original paper expected the full committee to 
restore some of the recommendations including discussions of 
corporate support financial and otherwise for tax resisters 
other issues awaiting assembly action included a recommendation 
that the church call for israel to end its repressive 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and that the church ask 
the us government to stop aid to israel that subsidizes 
settlements in the occupied territories 
also tuesday commissioners face what is expected to be a hotly 
contested election for stated clerk the officer responsible for 
the operation of the assembly 
the rev james e andrews 60 has been stated clerk or interim 
costated clerk of the denomination since it was formed in 1983 by 
the reunion of the northern and southern branches of the 
presbyterian church previously he held the office in the 
presbyterian church us the southern church for 10 years

when sam nunn overcame his reluctance to talk 
about the possibility of being michael dukakis running mate the 
georgia senator gave the interview to a newspaper he is sure the 
massaschusetts governor reads every day the boston globe 
frequently mentioned in speculation about the democratic vice 
presidential nomination the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee has been cautious in indicating his interest but he is 
interested 
his response to the question of whether he would even accept the 
offer is delicately phrased i probably would not accept he 
told the globe 
nunn earns a spot among possible nominees because some judge him 
the perfect balance on a ticket with dukakis 
a conservative southerner with the liberal northeasterner 
an expert on defense with an expert on domestic policy 
a senator with a governor 
the best in louisiana would be nunn said state party 
chairman jim brady hes strong on national defense and hes 
perceived to be very intelligent 
because of nunns expertise in defense and foreign policy 
former virginia gov charles robb and others have even talked of 
nunn being vice president and secretary of defense an 
unprecedented double role in us government 
that would be the only reason that he would want to give up 
the chairmanship a major substantive role to basically sit 
around an inquire into the health of both his own president and 
leaders of other countries robb said 
nunn carefully encourages that by contrasting his clout in the 
senate with the vice presidents role you have tremendous 
potential power but you dont have power unless you had some 
unusual understanding as to what youre going to be which i dont 
think would be easy to work out for me or anyone else i think 
theres just a very definite problem there 
but there is a long list of reasons cited by critics that nunn 
should not be on the ticket in general positions he has taken 
have caused consternation among various democratic groups 
civil rights is at the top of the list and has become a 
particularly thorny matter with democratic runnerup jesse jackson 
pressuring dukakis on the issue every day 
sam nunn represents the old south said patricia ireland a 
vice president of the national organization for women from florida 
nunn voted in 1975 against bringing up the legislation to renew 
the voting rights act when the law was up again for a vote in 
1982 nunn voted for amendments that critics said would weaken the 
legal protections in 1980 he voted to continue a filibuster that 
killed new federal powers to fight housing discrimination 
he voted against an extension of time to ratify the equal rights 
amendment he supported a constitutional amendment that would 
overturn the supreme court decision legalizing abortion and leave 
the matter up to each state 
such criticism irritates nunn 
i dont enjoy it i dont like it i dont want my children to 
read 10 15 20 years from now that sam nunn was against civil 
rights thats just absolutely false he told the newspaper 
nunns aides say that each of his votes was on the specific 
matter at hand and often dealt with procedural considerations 
for example aides said nunn voted against the era extension 
because it would not allow states to withdraw a previous 
ratification vote on the fair housing bill nunn argued he didnt 
want the federal government being both judge and jury on alleged 
violators 
whether or not jackson would object to nunn on the ticket is not 
known but his aides quickly started boosting ohio sen john glenn 
as an alternative choice when nunns name was first mentioned 
nunn also has a long record of support for many of president 
reagans policies congressional quarterly an independent 
magazine ranked nunn as the most frequent supporter of the 
president among senate democrats in 1983 and 1985 never dipping 
below a 58 percent level in votes on reagan issues 
hes too conservative for me said colorado democratic party 
executive director sigrid freese of nunn hes more republican 
than democrat 
and there are a series of specific issues on which nunn and 
dukakis disagree 
nunn voted for aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua while 
dukakis says that policy is illegal nunn voted for the mx missile 
which dukakis opposes he voted for a balanced budget amendment and 
the grammrudman law requiring automatic spending cuts in 1985 
in 1986 the liberal americans for democratic action gave nunn a 
30 percent rating while their counterpart the american 
conservative union gave him a 55 percent mark 
a thoughtful and careful politician nunn has sometimes been 
called dull a word applied to dukakis as well nunn has little use 
for such criticism 
it would bother me if i felt audiences i spoke to felt that 
i never had that impression nunn told the newspaper i 
could become very controversial by just saying a lot of stupid 
things and the media would say where did you get all that 
charisma but then in two years i wouldnt be back up here 
there is also the question of just what nunn could bring the 
democrats in the south one poll in florida suggested adding nunn 
to the ticket was worth only one precentage point of the vote in 
the fall 
a charlotte observer poll in north and south carolina found a 
dukakisjackson ticket trailing a george bushbob dole gop team by 
five percentage points but a dukakisnunn ticket trailed by 13 
points

a former aide to house speaker jim wright was 
quoted today as saying he thought working on a book written by his 
boss was part of my job rather than the volunteer project 
described by wright 
matthew cossolotto said i did think it was part of my 
congressional job that was my understanding at the time and i 
still think that 
the statement by cossolotto published in the forth worth 
texas startelegram contrasts with statements by wright 
dtexas who said today that cossolotto had volunteered and that 
the important thing was the aide gave full value for taxpayers 
dollars 
it is common practice for people on the staff to help in 
preparation of articles books and speeches wright told 
reporters adding that such action is proper if the writing 
involves matters of public policy 
was that cossolottos work on the book public work i think 
it can be argued that it was 
wright earlier defended his actions in backtoback appearances 
sunday on cbstvs face the nation and abctvs this week 
with david brinkley 
last friday the house ethics committee announced it was 
starting a preliminary inquiry into allegations of conflicts of 
interest in wrights financial dealings 
some of the allegations center on the book written by wright 
reflections of a public man according to reports sunday in the 
fort worth newspaper and in the new york times one texas 
businessman said he bought 1000 copies of the book as a legal way 
to give money to wright and bypass limits on campaign contributions 
cossolotto was on wrights staff at the time and wright has said 
cossolotto worked on the book on his own time rather than while he 
was supposed to be at his job 
but cossolotto disputed that i never understood it the book 
to be personal time nobody ever said this was a project to be done 
around personal time it was pretty clear 
cossolotto now in private business in washington said of the 
fact that his statements differ from wright i dont want to 
characterize it as a conflict 
i do have a recollection of it and the speaker has a 
recollection of it he was quoted as saying 
wright said sunday the congressional investigation of his 
financial dealings wont hamper him in his role as chairman of next 
months democratic national convention 
there is no cloud over my head no sir the texas democrat 
said ive done nothing unethical nothing illegal nothing 
violative of the rules of the house 
other allegations concern wrights political efforts on behalf 
of several texas businesses 
wright said the allegations are a partisan political ploy by 
republicans seeking to deflect attention from ethical violations by 
current and former members of the reagan administration 
its a partisan ploy and it will be revealed to be a partisan 
ploy wright said on the cbs program 
wright when asked if he would step down from the chairmanship 
of the partys convention if asked said i dont expect to 
i havent done anything dishonest or illegal he said im 
convinced i havent violated any rules of the house 
i may have done some things at one time or another in my 
career that were bad judgment he said but whatever mistakes 
ive made have not been dishonest mistakes 
wright refused to say if he thinks the ethics investigation 
should be conducted by an independent counsel rather than the 
committee i dont have a preference he said 
im not trying to tell the committee how to do its business 
wright said on abc i asked them to look into it thoroughly i 
asked them to do it promptly now anything that can be done is 
fine with me so long as it gets the facts out and gets them out 
soon 
i want this resolved and im convinced that the resolution is 
going to be that i havent violated any rules 
the committees inquiry was originally suggested by rep newt 
gingrich rga one of wrights harshest critics in the house but 
the panel said its investigation will be wider in scope than that 
suggested by gingrich 
wright received a 55 percent royalty totaling about 55000 on 
his book questions have been raised about wrights use of a 
congressional staffer to work on the book purchases of the book by 
friends and lobbyists and about the royalty percentage which is 
higher than those usually paid to authors 
wright said there was nothing wrong with the contract and 
joked that the royalty proceeds are going to my favorite charity 
mrs wright and me 
the book was published by william carlos moore a friend of 
wright who also received large printing contracts from wrights 
reelection campaign 
i think its a good book wright said while acknowledging 
that it contained little that was new 
its not fresh stuff he said most of it is reprinted 
from speeches articles newsletters memoirs little vignette 
style so theyre selfcontained 
the times and startelegram articles sunday concerned purchases 
of the book by fort worth developer s gene payte 
payte said he bought 1000 copies at a cost of 6000 because 
federal election laws limit individual campaign contributions to 
1000 for each election 
if i wanted to help jim and wanted to give him some money i 
couldnt do it payte told the startelegram but i could buy 
his books 
payte who has known wright since he entered congress in 1955 
said he bought the books to show my appreciation to wright and 
that he encouraged other texas business executives to do the same 
asked about such reports wright answered i didnt sell these 
books

as the long primary season ended michael 
dukakis had few scars from his battle for the democratic 
presidential nomination but now comes the hard part 
dukakis clinched the nomination without becoming the target of a 
lot of criticism from within his own party 
when criticism did come it was from a rival on the left in 
fellow democrat jesse jackson and from the right in republican 
george bush that left dukakis in the best position of all the 
middle 
also dukakis made it this far without the intensely negative 
campaign coverage that hit some of his presidential rivals 
according to experts who are studying television coverage of the 
race 
now though its finally oneonone said sen bob dole 
who lost his bid for the republican nomination and thats bad 
news for michael dukakis 
it may or may not be bad but it will be different 
bush signaled that last week when he took the gloves off in 
trying to reverse dukakis lead in the polls he lashed at dukakis 
as an oldstyle 60s liberal with views born in harvard yards 
boutique 
dukakis like bush hasnt officially locked up his partys 
nomination but he has entered a new phase of his presidential race 
in which he is one of the final two players and inevitably will 
draw the intense scrutiny such a position brings 
i think hell get a round of very tough press before the 
convention said bob beckel who helped walter mondale through 
these same waters in 1984 as campaign manager any mistake he 
makes will be magnified 
thats a certainty says michael j robinson a government 
professor at georgetown university and a student of presidential 
campaign press coverage 
whenever someone emerges from a pack into a twoperson race 
that persons coverage always becomes more negative he said 
its never not happened 
dukakis character and background have already come under 
extensive examination in television and newspaper stories two 
biographies have been published 
but therell be more attention to such accounts now and to 
stories questioning the validity of anything he claims or contends 
he takes at least partial credit for the economic boom in 
massachusetts look for stories examining the loss of manufacturing 
jobs in that state and pointing out current budget problems 
look for examinations too of the personal side of michael 
dukakis the cool way he deals with some people suggesting to some 
an insensitivity 
and look for criticism of his bland speaking style 
what dukakis sees as positive will be a negative to some his 
seemingly vague talk of partnerships his calling without 
specifics for good jobs at good wages and i mean good wages 
people are going to be talking about how incredibly bromidic 
he is hes clicheridden robinson said its going to be a 
story now does michael dukakis say anything 
robert lichter who is conducting a televisioncoverage study at 
the center for media and public affairs a nonprofit reasearch 
group says dukakis has fared better than youd expect for a 
frontrunner 
dukakis missed being treated as a frontrunner lichter 
said he went right from being treated as a cofrontrunner with 
jesse jackson to being the winner i would be astounded if his 
coverage doesnt become more critical in the next couple of 
months 
republican political consultant eddie mahe says polls show even 
partisan republicans have not yet reacted negatively to dukakis 
an indication he says that they havent begun paying attention to 
the race yet 
he says dukakis press coverage shows that republicans and other 
critics have held their fire 
robinson adds that in part thats because dukakis has been in 
hiding avoiding a lot of exposure to the press and risking his 
lead 
now theres going to be an active effort on the part of the 
republican party george bush and republican surrogates to say 
hey this is what the guy says but look at his record mahe 
said 
still mahe and others suggest dukakis is in a strong position 
to weather increasingly tough examinations unless some skeletons 
are unearthed or he commits some gaffe that supports the doubts 
critics are trying to raise 
its like in basketball hes been able to get a couple big 
feet planted in the center said mahe you cant get him out of 
there now by bumping him somebodys going to have to plow into him 
and take an intentional foul

people extradited from foreign countries to 
face criminal charges here cannot avoid defending themselves 
against related civil lawsuits filed in us courts the supreme 
court ruled today 
the justices ruled unanimously against wilfried van 
cauwenberghe a belgian citizen who is trying to avoid having to 
defend himself against a 19 million lawsuit in california 
the court said van cauwenberghe has no right to appeal before 
any trial is held the authority of a los angelesbased federal 
court to preside over the lawsuit 
van cauwenberghe was sued by another belgian roger biard who 
lent 1 million to a california real estate partnership engaged in 
renovating a kansas city townhouse complex 
according to court papers biard was repaid 800000 of the loan 
and accused van cauwenberghe of fraud 
van cauwenberge also was convicted in federal court in 
california of wire fraud and related charges he was sentenced to 
time already served in pretrial confinement and was ordered to pay 
biard 34501 in restitution 
van cauwenberghe had been arrested while on a trip to 
switzerland and was extradited to los angeles 
in seeking to have biards civil lawsuit dismissed van 
cauwenberghe argued that the belgian courts are a more convenient 
forum for the civil case and also that extradited individuals are 
immune from such suits 
a federal judge refused to dismiss the suit and the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals said it was premature for it to hear van 
cauwenberghes appeal 
the supreme court today agreed that any such appeal by van 
cauwenberghe can wait until after the trial is completed 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said van 
cauwenberghes freedom is not at stake in the case 
van cauwenberghe cannot be imprisoned or required to post bail 
in a civil suit and in fact is not even required to be present at 
the civil trial 
van cauwenberghes right to challenge the outcome of the lawsuit 
can be vindicated after there is a judgment in the suit marshall 
said 
the case is van cauwenberghe vs biard 87336

frank drozak president of the 80000member 
seafarers international union since 1980 and a vice president of 
the aflcio died at his home from brain cancer labor officials 
said monday 
drozak 60 who had been hospitalized several times in the past 
18 months for cancer treatments died saturday 
despite his illness he had remained active in the union just 
last fall he had lobbied extensively for legislation that would 
have required 11 kuwati tankers operating under the us flag in 
the persian gulf to be manned by american crewmen 
congress passed the measure but the reagan administration 
citing national security interests used an exemption in it to 
allow the reflagged tankers to be staffed mostly with filipino 
crews who are paid about onefourth the 30000 to 35000 annual 
wage of us seamen 
drozak assumed the leadership of the seafarers union at a time 
when its membership was suffering large layoffs due to an 
overcapacity of ship bottoms in the world new technologies that

louis lamour one of americas 
most prolific storytellers whose frontier tales of gunfighters 
lawmen and drifters enthralled millions of readers from waitresses 
to presidents has died he was 80 
the funeral for lamour who died of lung cancer friday at his 
beverly hills home will be private his daughter angelique said 
sunday night 
a few hours before his death lamour was proofreading the 
manuscript of his autobiography education of a wandering man 
according to bantam books his publisher of 33 years 
for millions of readers around the world louis was the 
embodiment of the north american frontier said stuart applebaum 
his editor at bantam 
they were able to relive our american history and heritage 
the editor added his books gave pleasure to truck drivers and 
truck stop waitresses financiers and presidents of the united 
states his work far transcends the western novel genre 
lamour wrote 101 books nearly all of them westerns including 
hondo the iron marshal the quick and the dead 
sacketts land down the long hills and ride the dark 
trail 
nearly 200 million copies of the books are in print his works 
were translated into 20 languages 
more than 45 of his novels and short stories were made into 
movies including hondo burning hills heller in pink 
tights and stranger on horseback stars cast in lamour 
westerns included john wayne natalie wood and alan ladd 
applebaum noted that perhaps his bestknown novel how the 
west was won was based on the movie screenplay 
lamour was a writer who paid scrupulous attention to accuracy 
if he said that the cowboys went over a hill and to the right 
was jones hill then there was jones hill he researched it from 
heck to breakfast retired newspaperman jack evans said sunday 
he would travel widely to check out the geography the way 
people talked evans said from his farm in lamours hometown of 
jamestown nd if you start reading his books you wont quit 
it gets ahold of you and grabs you til the end he was that good a 
writer 
he always said he was just a storyteller in the ancient folk 
tradition of people sitting around the fire just telling 
stories said joseph wershba a new yorkbased television news 
producer who knew lamour for more than a decade 
lamour dispelled myths about life in the old west such as 
townfolk fleeing the bad guys many of the actual settlers he 
noted were civil war veterans not deterred by gunplay 
i go to an area im interested in and i try to find a guy who 
knows it better than anyone else usually its some brokendown 
cowboy lamour once explained in an interview with the 
associated press 
im actually writing history it isnt what youd call big 
history i dont write about presidents and generals lamour 
said i write about the man who was ranching the man who was 
mining the man who was opening up the country 
although he was the first novelist to win the congressional gold 
medal and received the presidential medal of freedom he never won 
a top literary award but that didnt bother him 
he never really paid critics and literati that much mind 
applebaum said he received thousands of fan mail letters every 
year they were the critics that counted 
lamour left jamestown when he was 15 for what he later called 
his yondering years picking up such odd jobs as prize fighter 
tugboat deckhand longshoreman lumberjack prospector miner 
circus roustabout fruit picker elephant handler and amateur 
archaeologist 
as a result he was largely selfeducated in later years he 
lectured on such campuses as the university of southern california 
the university of oklahoma and baylor university 
he said that he wanted to write almost from the time i could 
walk he became a prolific contributor in the 1940s and 1950s to 
pulp magazines 
after world war ii he used the pen name tex burns because he 
recalled no editor believed that the name lamour could ever 
appear on a western story 
he used his real name after his first novel the 1953 hondo 
was made into a successful motion picture starring wayne hondo 
was followed by 85 novels 14 short story collections and one 
nonfiction book 
his readers included presidents dwight d eisenhower jimmy 
carter and ronald reagan who read jubal sackett while 
recovering from surgery in 1985 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
reagan and his wife nancy sent a telegram to lamours widow 
expressing their heartfelt sympathy on the authors death 
he brought not only millions of hours of enjoyment to readers 
but the best descriptions of american history former president 
jimmy carter said in a telephone interview today one of the last 
requests he made of me was a signed copy of my last book an 
outdoor journal we used to swap books all the time but i always 
got the best end of the deal 
lamour received the congressional gold medal in 1983 and the 
medal of freedom from reagan the following year 
two lamour books are scheduled for release this fall 
lonigan a short story collection and the sackett 
companion a nonfiction account of his research for his 17 
novels devoted to the fictional sackett clan 
in addition to his daughter lamour is survived by his wife of 
32 years kathy and son beau

years said commercial diver wayne brusate who discovered the 
wreck in july 1986 while searching for a tugboat that sank in the 
late 1960s 
about 300 bottles of french champagne and scotch whisky have

served the coastal towns of lake huron with packaged goods until it 
went down in 80 feet of water with all 27 crewmembers on nov 9 
1913 
several thousand more bottles still rest in the wreck roughly 3 
miles offshore from port sanilac about 80 miles northeast of 
detroit brusate said 
most freighters on the great lakes carried coal iron ore and 
tons of wheat but this was like a general store said brusate 
of marysville mich 
the 60 bottles sold saturday by christies auctioneers brought a 
total of 3460 said michael davis vicepresident of christies 
wine division among wines that did not come from the ship the

an alaska airlines jetliner skid off a runway 
after landing at seattletacoma international airport and four of 
the 82 people aboard sustained minor injuries officials said 
the accident occurred late sunday as flight 187 from tucson 
ariz landed and resulted in a 15minute closure of the airport 
authorities said 
the extent of damage to the boeing 727 was not determined 
although there was no fire and no damage to the fuselage was 
visible 
the passengers used emergency chutes to evacuate said airport 
spokeswoman margo spellman 
afterward two people complained of back pain and were taken 
away by ambulance ms spellman said one person received a bruised 
knee and one a sprained ankle she said 
the airplane veered off a runway and came to a rest on a grassy 
strip dividing seatacs two parallel runways said police 
spokesman john eliadis 
national transportation safety board investigators were checking 
to determine if the plane blew a tire upon landing or had struck 
debris on the runway officials said 
it was a fairly normal flight until we landed said marlene 
davies 52 of kent one of 75 passengers 
i saw the white line and we kept going over it and then i saw 
smoke or dust or something she said i couldnt tell if it was 
smoke or dust but i wasnt waiting around to see 
it was very scary 
she said the plane had been on the runway 5 to 10 seconds before 
it veered off she praised the flights seven crew members for 
quick action in getting the passengers off the plane 
it seemed to me like about 30 seconds from the time we stopped 
to the time the stewardess threw the door open and yelled to 
evacuate she said 
the airport was closed to aircraft for about 15 minutes but 
reopened with one runway eliadis said 
alaska airlines officials were not immediately available for

into the murder of a 70yearold woman who left most of her estate 
to the ministry of louisiana television evangelist jimmy swaggart 
mclennan county district attorney vic feazell said sunday that 
his office renewed the investigation because of a reporters new 
information that could help him resolve what he called unanswered 
questions about the december 1983 slaying

swaggart but could involve one or more individuals connected with 
the jimmy swaggart ministries at that time said feazell

footstool and died later at a waco hospital her husband maurice 
patrick baugh died of heart failure five days after her death 
the couple in their will left all but 25 percent of their cash 
only not to exceed 25000 to the baton rouge la television

parents to change their will larry neale baugh said two men 
working on behalf of swaggart ministries had recommended ms warren

the soviet supreme court today cleared the names 
of three prominent old bolsheviks lev kamenev gregory zinoviev 
and karl radek who died in the 1930s during the purges of kremlin 
dictator josef v stalin 
the court said the government newspaper izvestia is 
returning to these tragic figures their honor and their names as 
part of the campaign to stimulate more open discussion of key 
issues in soviet political life and to dismantle the system created 
by stalin 
the three men were as important in their time as nikolai i 
bukharin an old bolshevik rehabilitated in february but 
exonerating bukharin was considered more crucial politically 
because his economic theories were similar in key respects to 
reforms being attempted by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the rehabilitation of zinoviev kamenev and radek izvestia made 
clear was meant to reassure soviets they would not be punished for 
expressing political views tumultuous discussion is forecast at a 
nationwide communist party conference starting june 28 which is 
to debate proposals to expand the reforms 
the persecution of the old bolsheviks said izvestia is an 
urgent item for today 
we are learning democracy mastering the rules of political 
discussions we are learning democracy mastering the rules of 
political discussions also in a time of hard struggle the 
newspaper said in a long article on page three under the headline 
a return to truth 
zinoviev and kamenev spent years in exile with soviet founder 
vladimir i lenin before he led the bolshevik revolution in 1917 
they were elected to the ruling bodies of the bolshevik party after 
the revolution and sided with stalin against his archrival leon 
trotsky after lenin died in 1924 
after trotsky was forced into exile stalin turned on his former 
allies and zinoviev and kamenev were convicted of treason and 
executed following a show trial in 1936 
radek was born in poland took part in the 1917 revolution was 
accused of siding with trotsky and expelled from the party in 1927 
he was later rehabilitated and edited izvestia in the 1930s 
he was tried again in 1937 and sent to a labor camp where he is 
thought to have died 
trotsky was murdered in exile in 1940 in mexico and has not been 
rehabilitated 
izvestia printing a detailed account of the purges and their 
prelude said that our predecessors the people of the 20s could 
not control the situation and were burned up in the flames of 
repression 
they preached intolerance toward the opinions of their 
opponents and gave birth to physical and moral terror and the 
oppression of those who were left in the minority led to a 
situation in which one man crushed the majority 
a lack of the very notion of personal opinion created that 
wild crowd syndrome which sanctified any tyranny in the name of 
the people 
in a word discussion has been cut off for a long time about 
the paths toward the building of socialism it has been restored 
now more than a half century later and from the same place about 
the paths of developing revolution about the role of the party and 
about the place of the ruler or vozhd in russian stalin was 
known as the vozhd or supreme leader 
in reversing the decisions against zinoviev kamenev and radek 
izvestia said the supreme court naturally did not discuss the 
party face of rehabilitated citizens and did not evaluate 
whether they were right or wrong in the old debates but it said 
clearly they are innocent before the law state and people

set up a corporation for convicted smuggler kenneth m kiken in 
1985 and served as the corporations registered agent 
kiken who was twice convicted on federal marijuana imporation 
charges in 1974 is awaiting trial in us district court on new 
drug charges in the attempted importation of 165000 pounds of 
marijuana in 1985

kiken after his 1974 convictions since then levine has been a 
trustee for property kiken owned in nearby odessa has arranged a 
loan for kiken and later handled the sale of the property the st 
petersburg times reported sunday 
freedman a corporate and real estate lawyer prepared financial 
and legal documents that named levine the trustee for the odessa

both levine and freedman say they knew of kikens 1974 
convictions but said they were unaware of any activities alleged 
in the latest indictment both defended their roles in helping 
kiken manage his business affairs 
i dont see anything wrong with it freedman said in a 
telephone interview friday from bermuda where he and the mayor are 
vacationing just as i have no hesitation in saying to you that 
someone accused of criminal conduct is entitled to representation 
if an individual wants to buy a piece of property or set up a 
corporation ive never felt it appropriate to inquire whether it 
was going to be for a legitimate purpose or if that person had some 
ulterior motive 
said levine it looked like the guy had turned legitimate and 
was successful in that regard and there was no reason to question 
it

war against drugs one of the hallmarks of her administration last 
month she announced operation crackdown the bulldozing and 
burning of 50 rundown buildings that attracted crack dealers 
mrs freedman said her husband would never knowingly represent a 
drug smuggler in business transactions 
my husbands integrity his ability to tell right from wrong 
certainly makes me very confident that hes going to do the right 
thing in every circumstance she said from bermuda on friday 
kiken was arrested march 30 a federal indictment accuses him of 
conspiracy and aiding and abetting the attempted importation of 
165000 pounds of marijuana aboard a barge in october 1985 the 
load was worth an estimated 50 million

a south african lawyer whose arm was blown off in 
an april carbomb explosion alleged monday that the south african 
government planted the bomb as part of a death campaign against 
african national congress members 
south african officials denied it 
albie sachs 53 is a white member of the anc the main 
guerrilla group fighting the south african government 
the exiled attorney said the government was responsible for the 
april 7 attack in the mozambique capital of maputo 
it was an arm almost certainly the military arm of 
pretoria said sachs who spoke in a television interview from an 
undisclosed location in britain 
theyve been doing it in many parts of the world theyve 
threatened to kill anc people wherever they might be anywhere in 
the world said sachs who looked ill as he spoke with the stump 
of his arm still bandaged sachs was also burned and his eye 
injured in the explosion 
they are the only people who have the possible motivation and 
capacity for this kind of thing he said 
independent television which carried the interview said sachs 
was secretly flown to london for medical treatment after the 
explosion which blew apart his car at the time of the blast 
sachs was employed by the mozambican justice ministry 
the television station said sachs has been living in britain 
under an assumed name 
the south african embassy in london denied government 
responsibility for the attack 
the anc is on record as having advocated a policy of violence 
its very possible this policy has extended to members of the 
organization itself said minister justus de goede the no 2 
diplomat at the embassy 
the anc is fighting to topple the south african government and 
its policy of apartheid under which the nations 26 million blacks 
have no voice in national affairs and the 5 million whites control 
the economy and dominate government

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken monday by the supreme court 
 
vaccine 
 
the court ruled the government may be forced to pay damages when 
a vaccine it licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent 
by a 90 vote the justices rejected reagan administration 
arguments that the government always should be shielded from 
lawsuit in such cases 
the case is berkowitz vs us 87498 
 
sentencing 
 
the court agreed to judge the constitutionality of a new 
sentencing system for people convicted of federal crimes 
at issue in the sentencing case is whether the us sentencing 
commissions rules that took effect nov 1 may stand or must be 
thrown out the validity of the commission itself is at stake also 
by the time the court announces its decision expected sometime 
in 1989 thousands of defendants will have to be resentenced 
regardless of which way the court rules 
the case is us vs mistretta 871904 
 
police authority 
 
the court armed police with new authority ruling that officers 
sometimes may chase someone who starts running at the sight of them 
even though they have no reason to suspect criminal conduct 
it unanimously ruled that michigan prosecutors may use as 
evidence the drugs dropped by a man who started running when he 
spotted a police cruiser on a detroit street 
the case is michigan vs chesternut 861824 
 
racial desegregation 
 
the court declined to study an unprecedented 
racialdesegregation case refusing to free yonkers ny 
officials from having to integrate city schools and build 
subsidized housing to overcome decades of discrimination 
the court without comment left intact rulings that yonkers 
must build subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of 
the city and create magnet schools to reduce segregation 
the cases are yonkers board of education vs us 871632 and 
yonkers vs us 871686 
 
fraud 
 
the court agreed to decide whether the government may use a 19th 
century antifraud law to impose stiff civil fines on top of 
criminal penalties for the same offense 
the court said it will hear an appeal by reagan administration 
officials seeking to fine the manager of a new york medical 
laboratory 131170 for defrauding the government of 585 on 
medicare bills 
the case is us vs halper 871383 
 
postal service 
 
the court ruled that the postal service is similar to a 
private business and said the service must pay interest on back pay 
owed to a worker who won a lawsuit charging it with illegal 
discrimination 
by a 53 vote the court ordered interest on back pay for a 
letter carrier in chesterfield mo who was fired and later 
ordered rehired 
the case is loeffler vs frank 861431 
 
direct mail 
 
the court barred states from banning all direct mail

the state supreme court gave no reason for its unanimous denial 
of byrnes appeal the 5th us circuit court of appeal in a

byrne appeal was pending there byrnes attorneys were expected to 
appeal to the us supreme court if that appeal failed

president reagan called today for a joint 
venture between the united states and other industrialized 
democracies to strengthen economic policy coordination open more 
markets and ease the debt burden of poorer nations 
previewing the points he will push at the sevennation economic 
summit commencing sunday in toronto reagan also said that finding 
a common offensive against money laundering and drug 
trafficking is of utmost importance 
in a speech prepared to the atlantic council a group that makes 
policy recommendations on the development of democracies around the 
world the president also said there should be greater efforts to 
restore the economies of the philippines and afghanistan 
reagan used much of his speech to extoll the virtues of his own 
economic policy of lowering tax rates easing government regulation 
and otherwise encouraging us business investment and said he 
believes that many of the other industrialized democracies have 
begun to follow the us pattern 
this new consensus on economic growth strategy has not only 
brought the economies of america britain canada and so many other 
countries roaring back he said it also has opened the way for 
coordination of economic policy among the summit countries that 
would have been unthinkable just a few years ago 
reagan will join the leaders of britain canada france 
germany italy and japan at the economic summit in toronto in his 
speech today the president made it clear he thinks the summit 
partners should move with greater speed on the question of 
agricultural subsidies the summit runs from sunday through tuesday 
and will be reagans last 
in no field do we have more weeding to do than agriculture 
where subsidies cost the consumers and the taxpayers of europe 
north america and japan 200 billion a year he said the 
president noted that agriculture has been a principal item on the 
agenda of the socalled uruguay round of trade talks but said 
not enough has been accomplished there 
those talks were scheduled to go for four years they are now 
nearing the halfway point he said its time to narrow down 
and lay out specific goals a road map and a timetable to the 
finish line

the supreme court said monday it will decide 
the fate of a new sentencing system for federal crimes that some 
judges have refused to adopt 
at issue are us sentencing commission rules that took effect 
nov 1 the validity of the commission itself likely is at stake 
also and a decision is expected sometime in 1989 
more than 50 federal trial judges have refused to use the new 
sentencing rules declaring them or the commission 
unconstitutional but dozens of their colleagues have imposed 
sentences under the new rules 
the reagan administration citing the intolerable 
uncertainty caused by the conflicing rulings urged the justices 
to resolve the issue even before any federal appeals court has 
ruled on it 
today the justices granted the administrations speededup 
appeal 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina the ranking republican on 
the senate judiciary committee said the courts action pleased him 
it is vitally important that these issues are resolved by the 
court as quickly as possible thurmond said 
by the time the court announces its decision in a test case from 
missouri thousands of defendants will have to be resentenced 
regardless which way the court rules 
if the justices uphold the system those defendants sentenced by 
judges who refused to apply the new rules will have to be 
resentenced if the justices invalidate the system those 
defendants sentenced under the new rules will have to be 
resentenced 
the commission estimates that by jan 1 more than 10000 federal 
court defendants will have been subjected to the new sentencing 
system 
the commission was created by congress in the sentencing reform 
act of 1984 legislation aimed at eliminating disparities in 
sentences 
the law empowers the commission with seven members appointed to 
sixyear terms by the the president to tell federal judges what 
sentences within certain ranges should be imposed for various 
crimes three of the commissions members must be federal judges 
the commissions rules called guidelines even though the 
1984 law makes them binding on all federal judges eliminated 
parole and curtailed credit for good behavior 
judges who have struck down the new sentencing system have ruled 
that congress avoided political accountability by 
unconstitutionally delegating its legislative power to the 
commission 
that the commission because it includes members of the 
judiciary and holds legislative power violates the constitutions 
separation of powers principles 
that the new rules violate defendants dueprocess rights by 
curbing too severely the sentencing discretion of judges 
in urging the justices to uphold the sentencing commissions 
authority lawyers for the commission said the 1984 law reflects 
a massive interbranch commitment to the creation of a major 
improvement in the administration of justice 
the test case accepted for review stems from the prosecution of 
john m mistretta who pleaded guilty in federal court to 
conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine after his arrest last 
december in kansas city mo 
before mistrettas sentence was imposed he challenged the new 
sentencing rules a trial judge dismissed the challenge and 
sentenced mistretta to 18 months in prison to be followed by a 
threeyear term of supervised release 
mistretta then appealed to the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals but justice department lawyers asked the supreme court to 
decide the case while it is pending before the appeals court

million to find his sunken spanish treasure 
now some of the booty is going on the auction block at 
christies in new york as divers continue to comb the site and 
preservationists painstakingly scrape centuries of marine crust off 
the riches 
this auction is particularly exciting because the pieces 
recovered enhance knowledge of the new world said christies

nuestra senora de atocha the richest of five spanish galleons 
dashed to the ocean floor about 40 miles west of the florida keys 
by a hurricane in 1622

ceramic pieces also dredged up were thousands of pieces of 
saltsoaked wood rusty navigational devices muskets tools pots 
and pans and other artifacts

fisher began his search for the atocha about 1970 the effort 
was marked by financial troubles and court battles and fishers 
oldest son and daughterinlaw were killed when their tugboat 
capsized during a 1975 search 
in 1982 the us supreme court rejected the state of floridas 
bid to keep a quarter of the salvors haul 
fisher estimates there are at least another 100 million worth 
of artifacts from the atocha remaining on the ocean floor

margarita and from a british slaving ship found during the quest 
for spanish treasure range from dishes to gold bars to a 113

vice president george bush denounced the 
government of south africa on monday as a racist state using 
the strongest language yet of any high reagan administration 
official toward the apartheid regime 
his remark which came a day after democratic platform writers 
agreed to castigate south africa as a terrorist state in their 
1988 party document seemed calculated to put distance between bush 
and administration policies on the subject 
however bush like president reagan said he does not favor 
breaking diplomatic ties with pretoria 
it was the second day in a row that bush sought to highlight his 
views on civil rights issues 
in a speech sunday at predominently black central state 
university in wilberforce ohio bush said he would campaign for a 
positive civil rights agenda and suggested that his priorities 
would be different from those of the administration including 
more federal support for minority businesses and more assistance 
for the disadvantaged 
bush talking monday to reporters in the executive office 
building adjacent to the white house was asked if he agreed with 
the democrats decision to brand south africa a terrorist state a 
characterization sought by defeated democratic presidential 
candidate jesse jackson 
i think its a racist state regrettably and i think we ought 
to do what we can by staying engaged and trying to figure if the 
us can use its moral influence to change that situation bush 
replied 
i dont favor breaking diplomatic relations he said 
the democrats who held a platformdrafting session over the 
weekend in mackinac island mich have not indicated whether they 
would seek to break relations with south africa 
in the past reagan has said he personally considered the system 
of apartheid or white minority rule in south africa repugnant 
but the president initially resisted imposing economic sanctions 
on that nation going along with the sanctions only after they won 
wide bipartisan support in congress 
on monday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration disagreed with the description of south africa as a 
terrorist state 
we believe the best way to influence policy in south africa is 
to stay engaged fitzwater said he briefed reporters at the same 
time that bush was answering questions and the subject of bushs 
comments did not come up 
bush who is spending this week in washington and has no 
campaign appearances planned met with reporters to announce the 
naming of two senior aides james lake as communications consultant 
and sheila tate as campaign press secretary 
lake a washington political consultant was the campaign 
spokesman for the reaganbush ticket in 1984 ms tate is a former 
spokeswoman for nancy reagan 
after announcing the appointments bush stayed on to answer a 
wide range of questions and even joked that he had offered a spot 
on his ticket to jackson whose democratic vice presidential 
thoughts have been a hot topic 
i saw jesse the other day i said jesse i dont think 
youre going to make it on the democratic ticket are you 
interested 
and he turned to his mother and he said george bush has 
done a good job as vice president i might keep him on and thats 
all i know about the jesse jackson situation 
on possible democratic platform fights bush said thats 
their problem thats the problem of the democrats the issues 
regardless of what happens are going to be so clear in the fall 
the differences that i think what ive got to do is do my part 
and not intervene in that democratic convention process at 
all 
i dont think it would be right for me to get involved in the 
democratic convention and to say what ought to be done about jesse 
jackson he ran a good race he stayed in there he came up when 
there was a lot of feeling that he wasnt going to do as well as he 
did and ill give credit for that bush added 
bush also said there were no immediate plans for treasury 
secretary james baker to join his campaign team im comfortable 
with the situation at present bush said he and i have been 
friends for so long i see him a lot so im getting the benefit of 
his advice as it is 
republican sources have said they expect baker to join bushs 
campaign this summer however baker a longtime bush supporter 
told the associated press in an interview on friday that no 
decision would be made at least until after the economic summit in 
toronto later this month

two basketball starsturnedcongressmen 
introduced legislation monday requiring colleges to give 
prospective students athletes an idea how theyll fare in the 
classroom as well as on the playing field 
sen bill bradley dnj and rep tom mcmillen dmd former 
teammates on the new york knicks professional basketball team 
introduced the student athlete righttoknow act 
the law would require all colleges accepting federal financial 
help to compile and report scholastic statistics regarding student 
athletes 
the data would be collected by the secretary of education and 
made available to students and their parents for use in choosing a 
school 
bradley and mcmillen said the act is aimed at encouraging 
highschool students to weigh academic standards not just athletic 
prospects as they chart their futures 
all too often the exbasketball players said students pick a 
college on the unrealistic hope that theyre on their way to a 
career in professional sports 
but since very few students make it to the pros picking a 
college by its academic credentials makes more sense according to 
bradley and mcmillen 
most people dont get that ticket to the pros said bradley 
who attended princeton university on an academic scholarship 
he and mcmillen acknowledged the bill would do little to address 
abuses by college athletic recruiters or to stop colleges from 
holding athletes to lower academic standards than other students 
but mcmillen said the measure would assist students trying to 
make wellrounded judgments about their educations 
the idea here is to provide a snapshot a balance sheet of 
the universitys academic picture said mcmillen a graduate of 
the university of maryland 
the act would require schools to report graduation rates for all 
students with academic scholarships broken down by sport sex and 
race the education secretary would be required to publish the 
information 
the law also would require students to acknowledge reviewing a 
schools academic data before signing a letter of intent to enroll 
rep ed towns dny a cosponsor of the legislation said 
if we can have reporting as to the ontime arrivals of airlines 
surely we a can let student athletes know whether they are likely 
to receive a useful college degree

the house completed congressional action 
monday on legislation to set efficiency standards for fluorescent 
lamp ballasts a move proponents say can produce energy savings 
equal to seven large power plants 
the bill covering the ballasts that start and operate 
fluorescent lights was given voicevote approval and sent to the 
white house where it is being opposed as unnecessary 
the measure is an amendment to the 1987 law that required 
efficiency standards for a variety of large household appliances 
the administration also opposed that legislation but president 
reagan signed it following its overwhelming approval by congress 
the american council for an energy efficient economy estimates 
that with at least 50 million fluorescent ballasts sold annually 
more efficient units could save 7000 megawatts of electricity by 
the year 2000 along with 11 billion in lower lighting costs to 
consumers 
the presidents office of management and budget said many 
ballasts already meet the proposed standards and the bill would 
impose unnecessary burdens on industry and force consumers to pay 
more for ballasts 
the bill and the 1987 law resulted from a coalition of energy 
conservation advocates and electrical and appliance manufacturers 
who began backing national standards after a handful of states 
began setting their own

mikhail s gorbachev on monday opened lines of 
communication with the vatican in his first meeting with a top 
roman catholic official but both sides said a papal visit and 
diplomatic relations are not imminent 
asked by reporters about a possible visit to the soviet union by 
pope john paul ii the soviet leader said for that a lot still 
has to happen 
cardinal agostino casaroli the vaticans secretary of state 
told reporters his meeting with gorbachev was warm and 
friendly 
but casaroli added we have not arrived at the point of 
speaking about diplomatic relations of any sort the question 
of any invitation to the holy father was not raised 
he said that as a result of his meeting with the soviet leader 
we can raise questions about the life of catholics which was 
difficult before because there were no direct contacts this 
possibility has opened up 
he did not say how the contacts would be maintained 
casaroli said statements by soviet officials about allowing 
greater religious liberty are important especially if the soviet 
union intends to allow believers to express their beliefs openly 
instead of merely allowing them internal freedom of conscience 
cardinal johannes willebrands head of the vaticans secretariat 
for christian unity said soviet officials appeared more willing to 
recognize that there are religious groups in their country with a 
point of reference outside the soviet union 
the russian orthodox church and most other religious groups 
recognized by soviet authorities are based in the soviet union 
making it easier for the kremlin to control them 
strict laws prohibit religious groups from doing charitable 
work require them to be registered with the government and sharply 
restrict religious education officials say the laws are being 
rewritten to reflect gorbachevs efforts to reform soviet society 
casaroli leading a vatican delegation at celebrations of the 
russian orthodox churchs 1000th anniversary carried a letter 
from john paul to gorbachev 
casaroli said the pontiff expressed the desire in his letter for 
regular contacts with the soviet government the vatican also 
expressed in general terms its concern over the naming of bishops 
and the establishment of a seminary for ukrainian catholics 
the ukrainian catholic church was forcibly integrated into the 
russian orthodox church in 1946 by josef v stalin but has survived 
underground since it has not been recognized by authorities and 
therefore is illegal 
casaroli and willebrands met last friday with five bishops and 
priests of the ukrainian catholic church 
russian orthodox church officials who are opposed to official 
recognition of the ukrainian church have said they will discuss 
this with vatican representatives later this month 
gorbachev and casaroli shook hands in the meeting room in the 
council of ministers building in the kremlin and then sat down at a 
table with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and interpreters 
they did not discuss the letter before reporters who were 
present for the first couple of minutes of their meeting 
instead gorbachev asked if casaroli had been cold in moscow 
the cardinal said he knew what kind of weather to expect since he 
had been to the soviet capital in 1971 gorbachev said he had been 
to sicily 
vatican officials told reporters that gorbachev read a russian 
translation of the papal letter during the meeting 
members of the vatican delegation the highest ever to visit the 
soviet union will travel to kiev leningrad and vladimir this week 
for continued celebrations of christianitys anniversary

sevennation summit in toronto called monday for a joint effort to 
restore the battered economies of afghanistan and the philippines 
and an international crackdown on money laundering from illegal 
drugs 
reagan also said he would prod world leaders to complete 
negotiations by the end of the year to cut back on agricultural 
subsidies which cost an estimated 200 billion a year in europe 
north america and japan 
its time that we in the summit nations forget about quitting 
time and join in a great venture to progress a joint venture 
that opens the international marketplace and that also strengthens 
the weak links in the international economy reagan said in a 
speech at the state department to the atlantic council a private 
group dealing with foreign policy 
on sunday reagan will fly to toronto for his eighth and final 
summit with the leaders of britain france west germany canada 
japan and italy billed as an economic summit the meetings 
invariably focus heavily on political issues as well 
with a presidential election in the united states and wall 
street still skittish after last octobers collapse the summiteers 
are expected to steer clear of controversies and emphasize areas of 
agreement 
reagan proposed that the summit nations join together to help 
restore the economies of two countries one the philippines a 
heroic democracy ravaged by communistled insurrection the other 
afghanistan a victim of brutal aggression 
he did not offer any specific proposals 
the administration has been talking with congressional leaders 
as well as with officials in asia and europe about the 
desirability of a multiyear assistance program for the 
philippines as well as a program to stimulate trade and investment 
there the amount of funding and details of the program have not 
been decided 
for afghanistan the administration has earmarked 119 million 
for resettlement of afghan refugees 
in his speech reagan also proposed a joint effort to help 
countries of subsaharan africa work out their debt problems we 
will take up their problems as we have those of other debtor 
nations on a casebycase basis working to help develop economic 
policies that promote growth and opportunity he said 
reagan said the summit nations also should join together to 
attack the lifeblood of one trade that should never be part of 
international trade the international narcotics trade 
at this summit we should join in a common offensive against 
money laundering and the flow of drug profits through the worlds 
financial institutions the president said he did not spell out 
how he would attack the problem 
on the economic front reagan extolled the virtues of his own 
policies saying the united states had led the way in persuading 
other countries to cut tax rates sell off stateowned industries 
and cut back on regulations 
starting with the united states reagan said the summit 
countries have had nearly six years of uninterrupted growth id 
like to make it 60 and more 
he said that in no field do we have more weeding to do than 
agriculture where subsidies cost the consumers and the taxpayers 
of europe north america and japan 200 billion a year the 
president noted that agriculture has been a principal item on the 
agenda of the socalled uruguay round of trade talks but said 
not enough has been accomplished there 
those talks were scheduled to go for four years they are now 
nearing the halfway point he said its time to narrow down 
and lay out specific goals a road map and a timetable to the 
finish line 
in toronto we the heads of the major industrial states can 
push our ministers to have that job completed by years end no 
excuses

millions of dollars in corporate soft 
money is pouring into the political system through state entities 
that can accept big donations that are banned on the federal level 
a private group said monday 
the center for responsive politics complained there is no way of 
knowing whether the money quietly finds its way into congressional 
and presidential elections where spending is strictly limited 
under the federal election commission 
federal law prohibits any corporate or union money in federal 
campaigns and limits individuals contributions to 1000 per 
candidate but many states have no limits on individual 
contributions and permit labor and corporate contributions to state 
parties 
the state party then can spend the money on voter outreach 
efforts such as voter registration and state conventions that can 
end up helping candidates for president or congress as well such 
funds are known as soft money 
the center for responsive politics a nonprofit bipartisan 
group said it could document 33 million in soft money 
contributions from corporations during the 198586 election season 
in five states 
there is currently no way to precisely determine the extent to 
which soft money is in fact being used to finance federal as 
opposed to state activities the report said 
most of nearly 1700 soft money contributions disclosed were 
from corporations fewer than 10 were from labor unons and those 
donations were in the 100 to 200 range the study said 
it listed top givers as american continental corp of phoenix 
which gave 85000 to the california democratic party in 1986 and 
atlantic richfield co of los angeles which gave a total of 
89000 to the state democratic and republican parties 
the largest individual contribution identified by the center was 
from charles keating chairman of the board of american 
continental who gave 100000 to the florida gop 
according to public records cited by the center in colorado 
the topdollar donor was ccs automation systems inc which gave 
30000 to the republicans in florida sw florida enterprises 
inc which gave 20000 to the democrats in missouri bruce 
investment co which gave 34082 to the republicans and in 
washington boeing co which gave a total of 42700 to both 
parties 
the group said it was not accusing any corporation or labor 
union of illegality since such contributions are legal in the 
states studied but it said there is a potential for abuse 
soft money is not required by law to be reported at the federal 
level and only some states have strict reporting requirements 
we have no idea how the soft money is mixed with the hard 
money said ellen miller the groups executive director we do 
not know for what purpose the moeny was given or how it was used 
it gives individuals and corporations and labor unions one 
more avenue to flex their muscle with candiates and parties 
noting that fec reports document nearly a billion dollars in 
spending in congressional campaigns and presidential races miller 
said lying just below the surface are untold millions of 
additional dollars unaccounted for by the fec 
for this years presidential election each national political 
party plans to raise soft money to augment the maximum 8 million 
it is allowed to spend to elect its nominee in addition to the 
party expenditure each candidate gets 46 million from the federal 
treasury to wage his campaign 
the finance chairman for likely democratic nominee michael 
dukakis says he wants to raise 42 million in soft money for the 
fall campaign 
based on reports filed with the five states involved in the new 
study california colorado florida missouri and washington 
the center identified the following amounts in corporate 
contributions to state parties in 198586 
california republicans 808290 democrats 295389 
colorado republicans 645888 democrats 71050 
florida republicans 466445 democrats 458258 
missouri republicans 369482 democrats 22400 
washington republicans 129776 democrats 31250 
the centers report noted that mcdonalds heir joan kroc gave 1 
million to the democratic national committee a few months ago at 
most 20000 of that could be used on federal elections under the 
law meaning at least 980000 would go into the dncs softmoney 
accounts 
the report also noted published reports of gifts to the 
republican national committee of 150000 from texas developer 
trammell crow 127600 from phillip morris corp and 124000 from 
atlantic richfield 
soft money also can go into national party funds for 
construction of party buildings the report said the democrats got 
50000 from the painters union 10000 from the united auto 
workers and 5000 from the machinists union for its building fund 
it cited contributions to the republican national committee fund 
of 40000 from bethlehem steel and 24120 from drexel burnham 
lambert

israeli and palestinian intellectuals signed a 
peace treaty in a symbolic ceremony monday after months of 
arguments and said their example shows that gaps between the two 
sides can be bridged 
if clods like us who are not always very good at taking 
action can do it so can politicians said one of the 
signatories israeli poet natan zach 
they said the agreement written in hebrew arabic and english 
was the first of its kind to be negotiated by israelis and 
palestinians 
it was signed by about 25 israeli and palestinian authors and 
artists during a news conference foreign reporters far outnumbered 
israeli and palestinian journalists 
the agreement was reached after many arguments said nissim 
kalderon an israeli poet after 40 years of war and brutality 
there is bitterness on both sides and demands on both sides that 
the other finds hard to cope with 
the pact calls for the establishment of a palestinian state to 
be called falastin in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip falastin is how the word palestine sounds in arabic 
jerusalem a key point of dispute would be demilitarized and 
serve as the capital of both states israel and falastin would 
recognize each others right to live in peace and security 
the signatories are members of the israeli and palestinian 
writers artists and academics committee against occupation the 
only professional group that includes both israelis and 
palestinians from the occupied territories 
most of the jewish members are leftwing activists 
zach for example recently canceled the international poetry 
festival which was to be held in israel this month to protest the 
army crackdown on the palestinian uprising in the occupied lands 
asad el asad head of the palestinian writers association in the 
occupied territories said the palestine liberation organization 
favored the terms of the treaty we feel we are transmitting 
clearly and honestly the message of our representatives the plo 
asad said 
israel refuses to negotiate with the plo saying it is a 
terrorist organization the plo covenant calls for the destruction 
of the jewish state and the plo has refused to accept 
unconditionally un resolutions guaranteeing israels right to 
secure borders 
zach said the group would now seek the signatures of additional 
intellectuals in israel and the occupied territories

about three of every 1000 patients at 
six us hospitals are infected with the aids virus but it has not 
spread extensively in the past year according to a study released 
monday 
it indicated the infection rate among hospital patients is about 
five times higher than that among military recruits from the same 
cities but has not changed over the first 15 months of the study 
the importance is that there has been a slowing in the rate of 
new infection said dr timothy j dondero the stable rate 
means it is not exploding 
dondero a researcher at the us centers for disease control in 
atlanta heads the study program called the us sentinal hospital 
surveillance network 
he said the infection rate seen at the six hospitals four of 
them in the midwest probably is lower than the rate nationwide 
if the rate at the hospitals were the same as the national 
figure that would mean about 700000 americans carry the aids 
virus the cdc officially estimates between 1 million and 15 
million americans are infected and dondero said he believes the 
true figure is closer to 1 million 
figures are based on anonymous blood testing of 18809 hospital 
patients 
excluded from the tests was anyone who might already have the 
disease acquired immune deficiency syndrome including patients 
hospitalized for infections or cancer many of those tested were in 
the hospital for accidents surgery or childbirth 
the cdc plans to expand the program to 40 hospitals across the 
country 
dr george grady the massachusetts state epidemiologist said 
the cdc study may have missed an increase in the infection rate 
because it did not sample enough people and did not choose a truly 
representative sample of the population 
there is a feeling across the country that the infection rate 
in gay men is stabilizing and that it is still going up in 
intravenous drug users he said

one or more people associated with jimmy 
swaggart ministries could be targets of a reopened investigation 
into the slaying of a woman who left part of her estate to the 
television evangelists ministry 
vic feazell mclennan county district attorney said sunday his 
office is reexamining ida lee baughs slaying in december 1983 and 
that a national enquirer reporters new information could help him 
resolve unanswered questions 
feazell said the inquiry was not aimed at swaggart but could 
involve one or more individuals connected with the jimmy swaggart 
ministries at that time 
what we are looking into right now is the possibility of 
violations of the texas penal code that could include being a party 
to murder feazell said 
jacqueline euna warren was convicted in april 1984 of murder in 
the case and sentenced to 99 years in prison 
mrs baugh 70 of mcgregor was found stabbed and beaten and 
died later at a waco hospital her husband maurice patrick baugh 
died of heart failure five days later 
in their will the couple left all but 25 percent of their cash 
not to exceed 25000 to the ministry in baton rouge la a 
swaggart spokesman estimated the couples total estate at between 
500000 and 800000 
baughs son contested the will charging that associates of 
jimmy swaggart ministries exercised undue influence on his parents 
to change their will 
larry neale baugh alleged that two men working on behalf of 
swaggart ministries had recommended that ms warren take care of 
mrs baugh 
later larry baugh dropped his charges the waco tribuneherald 
quoted a source familiar with the case as saying a settlement was 
reached between baugh and jimmy swaggart ministries 
feazell said a national enquirer reporter approached him with 
new information he had developed independently 
the information was believeable and parts of it have been 
substantiated he said 
feazell said his office had investigated a possible connection 
between the murder the will and jimmy swaggart ministries at the 
time of ms warrens trial 
lot of questions came to light in the spring of 1984 
unanswered questions that werent pursued he said 
i met with jimmy swaggarts attorneys at that time after 
meeting with him i decided to take no further action he said 
feazell said that as material becomes available it could be 
presented to the grand jury during the next few weeks it might 
be something we can wrap up rather quickly or we could take a long 
time with it

production of a vital oxidizer for the 
fuel of the space shuttle booster rocket resumed monday five weeks 
after the only other plant in the nation that made the chemical 
blew up a mile away 
fire inspectors were on hand at the kerrmcgee corp plant in 
nearby henderson when workers began filling vats with chemicals to 
produce ammonium perchlorate an oxidizer used in the solidfuel 
shuttle boosters and some military rockets 
clark county fire chief roy parrish said the inspectors would be 
at the plant until a dispute between the fire department and the 
company over storage of the finished chemical product is resolved 
its like a fire watch said parrish were going to have 
them out there 24 hours a day 
parrish refused to rule out the possibility of legal action 
against the company if it does not agree to fire department 
recommendations that it store the chemical in smaller piles and 
place the piles further apart than it currently does 
county officials and a team of safety experts hired by 
kerrmcgee plan to meet thursday to try and work out an agreement 
on the storage issue 
we will ask some very pointed questions said parrish 
theyre going to have to come up with some reasons why they 
selected the way they did to store the product 
plant spokeswoman annita bridges said workers will be on the job 
in three shifts while the plant gears up to operate at its capacity 
of 36 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate a year 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
said last week that they had only enough fuel for eight shuttle 
boosters enough for four flights each set of boosters needs 17 
million pounds of ammonium perchlorate mixed with its rubberlike 
fuel 
kerrmcgee temporarily halted its production of ammonium 
perchlorate after a series of thunderous explosions may 4 killed 
two people injured 326 and caused an estimated 73 million in 
damage at the pacific engineering and production co in henderson 
after a brief reopening the next week production was halted 
again under the threat of lawsuits by state and local officials 
until an independent safety team could inspect the plant 
kerrmcgee agreed among other things to ship the chemical in 
containers less susceptible to heat and shock and reduce by 50 
percent its supply of unfinished ammonium perchlorate 
the cause of the pacific engineering blast is still under 
investigation company officials have said the blast may have been 
caused by a leaking natural gas line but fire department sources 
said the most likely cause was a spark that set off ammonium 
perchlorate 
parrish said he would not speculate on when the departments 
formal report fixing the cause of the explosions will be finished

an exsheriff who pleaded guilty to 
buying the job from his predecessor for 100000 was sentenced 
monday to seven years in a federal penitentiary 
former mingo county sheriff charles e eddie hilbert was 
not motivated by personal greed or a lust for power said 
hilberts lawyer john cyrus in a real sense he was a victim 
of a corrupt system 
the crimes he committed were those of a stupid man cyrus 
told us district judge charles haden adding that his client has 
a low intelligence quotient and is only marginally literate 
hilbert 45 pleaded guilty in april to one count of mail fraud 
one count of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy to buy the 
sheriffs job from thensheriff johnie owens 
in addition to sentencing hilbert to five years on the 
conspiracy count haden also ordered him to pay a 10000 fine in 
addition hilbert was ordered to serve two years on the mail fraud 
charge which stemmed from a scheme to obtain backdated insurance 
coverage for his son who had been involved in a motorcycle acident 
hilbert also was sentenced to three years in prison on the tax 
evasion charge but haden said that sentence would run concurrently 
with his other terms 
the former sheriff who is scheduled to begin serving his 
sentence on aug 11 had faced a maximum sentence of 13 years in 
prison and a 350000 fine under federal law he must serve a 
minimum of onethird of the sevenyear sentence before he will be 
eligible for parole 
cyrus said hilbert did not profit from his crimes but 
rather mr hilberts crimes are more crimes of the heart 
eddie hilbert is a weak man further weakened by alcoholism 
cyrus told haden who emphasized that hilbert pleaded guilty to a 
conspiracy count under the federal governments racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act 
hilbert told the judge that he was sorry for what he had done 
and added that he had never taken a kickback or sold drugs to 
anyone in mingo county 
owens who said he took the 100000 from hilbert and gave some 
of the money to county commissioners to approve the arrangement is 
serving a 14year federal prison sentence 
former county commissioner rastie runyon jr is scheduled to 
report to federal prison later this month for his role in the 
scheme the other two county commissioners at the time also are 
under indictment

county democratic chairman donald evans 63 to one count of 
conspiracy to buy votes evans who is to be sentenced aug 8 also

a government brochure sent to more than 100 
million households explaining in frank language how the aids virus 
can be spread is getting a good response surgeon general c 
everett koop said monday 
the federal government mailing this spring was designed to reach 
every household in the country as part of a campaign to teach 
people how to avoid the risks of catching the fatal disease 
i think that a number of people who planned to be shocked who 
planned to criticize have been surprised that it is a good 
piece of education koop said at a news conference before he 
delivered a commencement address to graduates of the university of 
health scienceschicago medical school in suburban north chicago 
most pleasing are reports of family discussions of the brochure 
koop said 
people have heeded my request he said they have taken 
the family together and presented this to them as a problem that 
they all should understand 
he also said there have been a tremendous number of calls to 
a hotline asking for the brochure in spanish koop said no good way 
could be found to determine which households in the country would 
need the spanish language version when the brochure was mailed 
koop also cautioned against overreacting to what may seem to be 
new and frightening findings to be presented at the the fourth 
international conference on aids which opened sunday in stockholm 
sweden 
dont be misled that that something has just happened in the 
last week and now were in real trouble he said 
dr lars olof kallings a conference chairman characterized 
some of the information in the papers as frightening 
koop said aids continues to present a unique problem for people 
in the united states a country used to seeing diseases conquered 
by science 
i dont see a vaccine that is both effective and readily 
available as well as safe in this century koop said but he 
said that before the year 2000 scientists may develop a better 
agent to hold the aids virus in check postponing possibly 
indefinitely deaths from the disease 
koop said teenagers are among the toughest people to warn about 
aids because they are by nature risk takers 
he said that because aids symptoms often do not show up for 
years after infection teenagers may feel no fear because they do 
not see their friends dying from the disease 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys defenses 
against disease leaving a person prey to lifethreatening 
infections and certain cancers 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by infected drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
aids has struck more than 64000 people in this country since 
1979 and killed more than 36000 of them according to the national 
centers for disease control

south korea is once again being hit by 
a wave of violent antigovernment demonstrations and street battles 
between riot police and radical students here are answers to some 
questions on the latest unrest 
q why are there new riots in south korea havent elections and 
democratic reforms in recent months produced substantial changes 
a many of the authoritarian controls on politics and many other 
aspects of south korean life have been dismantled in recent months 
the small but powerful radical movement contends there has been no 
change and remains determined to overthrow a government it claims 
is a dictatorship radicals are fighting for an illdefined 
democracy of the masses 
the wellorganized radical movement which evolved during years 
of resistance to authoritarian rule has become increasingly 
leftist and violent as it has split with moderate opposition forces 
over political goals in recent months 
q most of the protesters are described as students who are 
they and what do they want 
a radical college students are the main strength of the protest 
movement they constitute up to 10 percent of college students 
with perhaps another 10 percent sympathizing with their ideas and 
aims 
many radical students are idealists seeking a perfect society in 
a nation dominated for most of its 40 years by military and 
civilian dictators they see themselves as champions of workers 
peasants and the poor 
the radicals have little understanding of politics or ideology 
partly because of strict government controls in the past on 
political education they talk about true democracy and sharing 
wealth but are vague or inarticulate on how to achieve their goals 
q how serious is the unrest 
a the radicals lack public support and are not a serious threat 
to the government but they are capable of causing trouble by 
violent tactics the main problem is that they are helping continue 
the confrontational nature of korean politics 
q why have the latest protests been mainly antiamerican 
didnt the united states help the south during the korean war 
a radical students contend successive authoritarian governments 
have been able to rule the country because of us backing 
students say the united states as a democracy has failed to push 
for democracy in south korea and other nations 
the radicals also claim the united states enforces partition of 
the divided korean peninsula to control the south the intensely 
nationalistic students resent the presence of 42000 us troops in 
south korea and oppose the growing impact of american cultural 
influence but the resentment aimed at the us government has so 
far had little impact on individual americans 
q how do the majority of the korean people feel about the 
united states and about the radicals antiamericanism 
a most south koreans are not antiamerican a majority are 
believed to support the presence of us forces as a defense 
against communist north korea 
but there is a growing belief among south koreans that the 
united states tends to patronize its weaker korean ally this 
partly reflects the koreans growing prosperity and confidence and 
their desire for a bigger voice in the world us trade pressure 
to open up south koreas markets to american imports has also 
stirred resentment 
q the students tried to march to the north korean border for 
reunification talks is reunification possible 
a radical students who insist they are not communists say 
reunification must be achieved at once they claim the governments 
in the north and the south will be swept away and the peninsula 
reunited if the ordinary people of both nations simply join hands 
but many south koreans fear the north wants to impose communist 
rule the north invaded the south in 1950 and the two nations 
technically remain at war since no peace treaty was signed 
there seems to be little hope of reunification while the north 
remains one of the most repressive communist regimes in the world 
and the south becomes one of the fastest growing prowestern 
capitalist nations the peninsula was divided in 1945 when us and 
soviet forces ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war 
ii 
q do the new protests pose a threat to the summer olympics in 
seoul in september 
a some radicals are backing north koreas demand to be a 
cohost of the games as a way of promoting reunification the 
international olympic committee and south korea have rejected the 
norths demand 
the south korean government is determined to make the games a 
major success and any attempt to disrupt them would be suppressed 
by a huge security shield but radicals may try to stage protests 
since world attention will be focused on south korea

an alaska delegation hoping to improve 
ussoviet relations and reunite eskimo families divided by the 
cold war took off today on a friendship flight to the siberian 
community of provideniya 
the flight aimed at cracking open a border closed for 40 years 
left nome at 1109 am adt for provideniya the federal aviation 
administration said 
dubbed friendship 1 the plane had left anchorage at 755 am 
for the 1hour flight to the western alaska town of nome the 
jumpingoff point for the second leg of the trip a 45minute 
flight to the soviet union 
the flight from nome to the eastern siberia port of provideniya 
is seen as a big step toward thawing relations between the 
neighboring regions once part of the same country before russia 
sold alaska to the united states in 1867 
eskimos once freely crossed the icy bering strait in motorboats 
and walrusskin umiaks to trade and visit with relatives the 
border was closed in 1948 amid growing cold war tensions 
this month the soviets approved todays onetime charter flight 
to provideniya after two years of work by alaskans promoting the 
idea 
eighty government officials eskimos and journalists were booked 
aboard the alaska airlines plane for the 225mile flight 
provideniya officials planned to entertain the oneday visitors 
with tours a banquet and a trip to an outlying native village 
the flight is long overdue says timothy gologergen 68 one of 
several siberian yupik eskimos who are making the trip 
this is the first chance to create peace towards our people 
and their people he said this way well have a chance to find 
out if the relatives are still alive there someplace and open up a 
little trade 
gologergen said his great grandfather migrated from siberia and 
kept in touch with relatives there until the iron curtain came 
down 
the friendship flight is part of a broader initiative that 
alaska business leaders educators and state officials have 
launched to improve relations with the soviet union those efforts 
combined with soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy of openness 
have started to chip away at longstanding barriers 
from a symbolic perspective the trip represents the reopening 
of an old gateway between alaska and the soviet union said gov 
steve cowper delegation leader im confident it will lead to 
better relations between our two countries for years 
the flight stems from the dream of james stimpfle a real estate 
agent in nome when alaskas oil recession began two years ago 
stimpfle brainstormed ways to improve the economy of his remote 
town of 3700 people 
he figured that if the alaskasiberia border were opened nome 
could become an economic and cultural center for both sides of the 
bering strait in addition to freer travel by residents stimpfle 
envisioned increased trade joint business ventures and tourist 
excursions by airplane and cruise ship between nome and siberia 
the barriers to such activity were and remain substantial 
though siberia and alaska lie only 3 miles apart at their closest 
point the regions are a world apart politically and economically 
even a telephone call from nome must be routed the opposite 
direction around the globe to reach provideniya 
officials in washington four time zones to the east and 
moscow 12 time zones to the west seemed content with the status 
quo 
so stimpfle tried some attentiongrabbing stunts he floated 
balloons from nome across the bering strait and pointed a huge 
peace sign in russian toward siberia 
he also wrote hundreds of letters to soviet and us officials 
urging the opening of the border slowly people began to listen 
especially after alaska airlines the largest air carrier serving 
alaska hopped on the friendship flight bandwagon 
it was only a short while ago that this flight was a dream 
said lou cancelmi alaska airlines spokesman i personally 
wondered if this day would ever come 
i dont think jim stimpfle ever thought for a moment that it 
wouldnt and thats what it takes to make something like this come 
true

police captured the top military leader of the 
shining path a maoist rebel group whose eightyear guerrilla war 
has taken more than 10000 lives in peru officials said monday 
officials said the capture of osman morote 43 considered the 
most radical leader of the movement was the hardest blow to date 
for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the 
andean highlands in may 1980 
osman morote is considered the no 2 of the party and its 
military chief the independent magazine si said recently for 
some shining path experts morote might even be in practice the 
true leader of the organization 
abimael guzman a former professor of philosophy founded the 
shining path movement and is generally recognized as its leader 
the shining path is seeking to overthrow perus elected 
government and install a peasant and worker state patterned after 
the ideas of mao tsetung 
deputy interior minister agustin mantilla said morote was 
arrested before dawn sunday at a house in downtown lima along with 
two women police sources said two other men also were arrested 
mantilla said morote had fake identification papers but was 
identified by his fingerprints 
counterinsurgency sources said police raided the house after 
neighbors told them of suspicious behavior by the people living 
there the sources said police discovered revolutionary propaganda 
dynamite and a revolver 
col javier palacios a top official in the counterinsurgency 
police presented morote to the press monday but did let him speak 
palacios said police had suspected morote was in the house he 
said morote put up no resistance 
the colonel said morote arrived in lima a week ago from the 
northern highlands to coordinate terrorists attacks in the capital 
palacios said the attacks were planned this week to mark the second 
anniversary of prison riots in which security forces killed more 
than 250 rebel inmates 
there have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry 
between morote and guzman and mantilla said he did not discount 
the possibility that guzman betrayed morote to get him out of the 
way 
morote known within the rebel band as comrade remigio is 
second in importance only to guzman who founded the shining path 
as a splinter group of the peruvian communist party 
the shining path devoted itself to 10 years of semiclandestine 
political work with peasants in the impoverished andean highlands 
before taking up arms 
guzman is the ideologist of the organization but morote is 
considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the 
advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands 
that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military 
counterinsurgency sources said morotes capture will create a 
power vacuum within the central committee of the shining path and 
spark tension until a replacement is found 
guzman morote and other shining path leaders went underground 
in the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war which has 
claimed more than 10000 lives 
guzman has not been seen for years and rumors have circulated 
that he may have died but most counterinsurgency experts believe 
that guzman described as brilliant by his former professors is 
still alive 
guzman has become a mythical figure for peruvians various 
rumors say that he is living abroad that he moves about peru 
disguised as a priest that he works as a day laborer in limas 
crowded street markets 
since 1980 the movement has expanded from its base in the 
highland state of ayacucho and now launches attacks throughout much 
of this impoverished nation 
damage to the economy from sabotage is estimated at 5 billion

officials on monday showed off the 13 million 
renovation of blair house the presidents guest quarters where 
visiting dignitaries can eat in one of three dining rooms 
entertain in a cozy library and have their hair styled at a private 
elizabeth arden salon 
it is not too grand but it has elegance said chief of 
protocol selwa roosevelt who oversaw the restoration it is a 
guest house worthy of this great nation 
manager benedicte valentiner said she doesnt expect guests for 
another six weeks because work is only 90 percent complete the 
chef for instance needs to a proper gas range for cooking the 
first official visitor has not been named 
blair house a 115room complex consisting of four connected 
townhouses on pennsylvania avenue across from the white house was 
shut down in 1982 after a malfunctioning gas valve leaked explosive 
natural gas during one dignitarys stay 
in 1985 congress allocated 86 million for a complete overhaul 
that included new electrical heating plumbing and air conditioning 
systems roof repairs installation of fire and safety systems and 
improved security 
the rest of the money more than 5 million was raised 
privately for refurbishing the interior of the fourstory house 
furniture is in the angloamerican style of 18th and 19th centuries 
with lots of overstuffed chairs and couches oriental rugs and 
handpainted wallpaper 
we wanted it to be soft and light said decorator mark 
hampton who shared the project with mario buatta that was no 
small feat because heavy curtains will be drawn to keep the local 
pennsylvania avenue terrorist from looking in the windows he 
said 
rooms that formerly had dingy white walls were painted a variety 
of bright colors salmon blue shades of yellow to name a few 
light streams through the back windows that face an interior garden 
chiefs of state invited by the president to use blair house will 
sleep in a double canopy bed in a private room part of a suite 
that includes another bedroom for a spouse a sitting room and 
three bathrooms one of which has a european bidet 
if the leader feels cramped by an 18th century bed the blair 
house staff can arrange for a kingsize bed to be installed 
we will do anything to make them happy said the 
multilingual valentiner who will stay on premises to supervise 
the staff of 13 during a an official visit the most number of 
people blair house can accomodate is 27 19 guests and eight staff 
members all stay free of charge 
if the leader wants see people he or she can attend to business 
in a booklined libary which hampton tried to give a masculine 
feel by using rich brown tones for news conferences heads of 
state have the use of a highceilinged room with two fireplaces 
since dignitaries often bring family members blair house has a 
private elizabeth arden studio with professional hair styling 
equipment 
the original house built in 1824 is rich in history after the 
original owners death it was sold to francis preston blair an 
intimate of president andrew jackson 
before the outbreak of the civil war col robert e lee was 
offered the command of the union armies at a blair house meeting 
but he declined in favor of his native virginia 
president roosevelt approved the acquisition of the house in 
1942 saying the government needed it for the entertainment of 
distinguished visitors 
on nov 1 1950 two puerto rican nationalists tried to force 
their way into blair house in an assassination attempt on president 
truman one of the nationalists and a white house guard died in the 
shootout

iran said its forces drove into southern 
iraq behind helicopter gunships monday recapturing some of the 
territory east of basra that they lost three weeks ago iraq said 
it repulsed the invaders 
iran claimed iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on the 
attackers but said chemical warfare units neutralized the poison 
gas and kept casualties to a minimum 
revolutionary guards stormed through mine fields and thickets of 
barbed wire in a twopronged offensive before dawn in the salamcheh 
region killing or wounding more than 11500 iraqis and capturing 
2100 iran said 
iraq acknowledged the iranians broke through border defenses in 
a reckless assault 15 miles east of basra the southern port 
and provincial capital the iraqis said their 3rd army corps 
absorbed the momentum and completely destroyed the 
offensive in a 19hour battle which was supervised by president 
saddam hussein and resulted in a new victory 
the iraqi president returned to baghdad on monday evening after 
the fighting settled in the favor of iraqi troops baghdad radio 
reported 
iran claimed the revolutionary guards supported by artillery 
barrages and air strikes were holding the upper hand 
an iraqi communique said iraqi planes flew 170 combat missions 
and helicopter gunships flew 240 
that is the highest singleday tally of iraqi missions in 
months the communique said the aircraft destroyed nearly 200 
vehicles and inflicted enormous losses 
no independent confirmation of the conflicting claims was 
available neither side allows western journalists or other neutral 
observers into combat zones except on rare guided tours 
the iranian attack was seen as a bid by irans new 
commanderinchief parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani to 
regain military initiative lost by defeats in the past two months 
of the war which began nearly eight years ago 
it was not clear how many iranian troops were involved in the 
thrust tehran communiques indicated the assault forces initially 
engaged at least 11 infantry and armored brigades an estimated 
40000 men 
since it is standard military practice for an assault force to 
outnumber defenders at least 21 that would indicate about 80000 
iranians 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted an 
unidentified revolutionary guards commander at the front as calling 
the iranian offensive a crushing response to recent iraqi 
movements in salamcheh 
it said air force planes flew 19 groundattack sorties and that 
28 missions by helicopter gunships destroyed tens of tanks and 
armored personnel carriers creating a hell of fire for the 
iraqi forces 
the commander claimed antiaircraft gunners shot down an iraqi 
warplane in the region but did not disclose the type of the jet 
reportedly downed 
according to iraqs communiques one of its air strikes was on 
an iranian air base near the western city of dezful apparently to 
knock out iranian jets supporting the offensive 
reports in official iranian media in the past two weeks have 
said thousands of basij or volunteers were going to the front 
in its reports of the battle irna said iranian troops broke 
through iraqi defenses and destroyed at least 30 sovietmade tanks 
it said the attackers caused heavy casualties in six infantry 
brigades and wiped out three artillery battalions that were caught 
in the open 
dispatches from the official iraqi news agency quoted a military 
spokesman in baghdad as reporting an iranian offensive east of fish 
lake an area northeast of basra flooded several years ago to 
frustrate iranian assaults 
he said the iraqis were preparing a counteroffensive that will 
teach the enemy a good lesson according to the iranians iraqi 
soldiers counterattacked at noon but were driven back with the loss 
of 800 killed or wounded 
irna dispatches said the battlefield was littered with 
knockedout tanks and armored vehicles of iraqs 3rd armored 
division and 5th mechanized infantry division 
elements of both divisions were involved in the iraqi assault 
may 25 that drove the iranians out of their hardwon bridgehead 
east of basra and back across the frontier the offensive monday 
was the first major iranian operation since that battle 
iran seized the marshlands east of basra with huge losses in 
january and february of 1987 and fought to within 6 miles of the 
city 
two years ago iranian forces captured the faw peninsula south 
of basra on april 18 iraqs 7th corps recaptured it in a 34hour 
battle that began with a surprise attack

the supreme court ruled today the government 
may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it licenses causes the 
disease it was intended to prevent 
by a 90 vote the justices rejected reagan administration 
arguments that the government always should be shielded from 
lawsuit in such cases 
in another case the court agreed to judge the constitutionality 
of a new sentencing system for people convicted of federal crimes 
the court reinstated a suit by the parents of a pennsylvania boy 
who contracted polio after receiving a dose of federally approved 
vaccine 
justice thurgood marshall in his opinion for the court said 
governmental immunity from suit only extends to instances in which 
an official exercises discretion or judgment 
the discretionary function exception however does not apply 
if the acts complained of do not involve the permissible exercise 
of policy discretion marshall said 
if a federal policy leaves no room for an official to 
excercise policy judgment in performing a given act or if the act 
simply does not involve the exercise of such judgment the 
government may be sued for causing personal injury marshall said 
the court revived a suit in behalf of polio victim kevan 
berkovitz who was less than three months old on may 10 1979 when 
his pediatrician in charleroi pa gave him a dose of orimune 
the drug manufactured by lederle laboratories is a form of 
sabin oral vaccine orimune was licensed by the government in 1963 
kevan was stricken with polio within a month and the us 
communicable disease center determined he contracted the disease 
from the vaccine he is paralyzed and deformed and breathes with 
the help of a respirator 
the berokovitz family contends that negligence by a goverment 
worker caused the childs polio 
the parents said the vaccine approved by the government violated 
its own standards for safety and that policymaking discretion by 
the government was not involved in approving the defective vaccine 
the reagan administration argued that even when an employee is 
negligent the government agency that employs the worker may be 
using its discretion in approving the vaccine 
justice department lawyers said if the government can be sued in 
such cases it will be forced into becoming an insurer of vaccines 
and may withdraw from licensing them 
federal officials said sabin oral vaccine administered 
routinely to all children in the united states has all but 
eliminated polio even though each year a few who take the vaccine 
have adverse reactions 
todays ruling overturned a decision by the 3rd us circuit 
court of appeals based in philadelhia which threw out the berkovitz 
suit last year 
the appeals court held that discretion was involved when the 
government initially decided to verify test results by vaccine 
manufacturers thereby shielding the government from suit 
ronald greene a lawyer representing lederle laboratories said 
the impact of the ruling is unclear he said the decision appears 
to cover all governmentlicensed vaccines and possibly other drugs 
as well but he said the standards enunciated by the court may 
affect a limited number of cases 
the facts alleged here are unusual and i dont know whether 
they the berkovitz family can prove them he said these are 
circumstances that are unlikely to arise very often 
faye peterson a spokeswoman for the food and drug 
administration who said the fda licenses more than 40 vaccines 
declined to comment on the impact of the ruling 
ellen viakley a lawyer for the berkovitz family said its 
not a case of an allergic reaction its a case where the 
government knew that this particular polio vaccine violated its own 
regulatory safety standards by the governments own regulatory 
safety standards this vaccine was unsafe but it licensed it 
anyway 
she said its not going to affect any cases where there is 
simply an allergic reaction such as dpt vaccine against 
diphtheria tetanus and pertussis which the american academy of 
pediatrics says is the source of threequarters of the serious 
injuries to children resulting from vaccines 
at issue in the sentencing case is whether the us sentencing 
commissions rules that took effect nov 1 may stand or must be 
thrown out the validity of the commission itself is at stake also 
by the time the court announces its decision expected sometime 
in 1989 thousands of defendants will have to be resentenced 
regardless of which way the court rules 
in other action the court 
armed police with new authority ruling that officers

the food and drug administration said monday 
it has published a final regulation requiring a permanent and 
stronger warning label against giving aspirin to children and 
teenagers with chicken pox or flu because of the danger of reye 
syndrome 
the new warning a modification of one already required on 
aspirin and aspirincontaining drugs says warning children and 
teenagers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu 
symptoms before a doctor is consulted about reye syndrome a rare 
but serious illness reported to be associated with aspirin 
the new part of the warning is the last phrase reported to be 
associated with aspirin 
the stronger warning is based on a public health service study 
that found a significant association between reye syndrome and 
taking aspirin during chicken pox or flu the fda said 
for one year aspirin and aspirin products must display an 
attentiongetting device such as a flag on the label alerting 
consumers to the new and stronger reye syndrome warning 
the new warning and attentiongetting statement will be required 
on aspirin products sold after dec 9 1988 until then the 
current warnings may be used 
although rare reye syndrome is fatal in 20 percent to 30 
percent of cases and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage 
its symptoms severe tiredness belligerence and excessive 
vomiting may occur just as a child or teenager appears to be 
recovering from flu or chicken pox

the pet skunk who made headlines and 
drew hundreds of callers lobbying to save his life was put to death 
monday because the man he bit refused to undergo precautionary 
rabies treatment 
after three stays of execution skunky was given a fatal 
injection so that his brain could be tested to see whether he had 
rabies 
skunkys owner jan shelton of buford had tried until the end 
to save the animal by trying to persuade the man whom skunky bit 
either to take rabies shots or drop his complaint 
she had tears in her eyes as she spoke her last words to her 
pet hey youre sleeping youre not conscious its fine she 
said 
the bitten man william eugene evans 48 had said thursday he 
would not change his mind and either drop his complaint or undergo 
a 600 series of rabies shots both moves would have spared 
skunkys life 
evans physician said evans should avoid rabies shots because he 
suffered a heart attack two weeks ago 
ms shelton claims that evans was mistreating her 1yearold 
skunk when he was bitten june 4 but evans said he was bitten when 
he reached down to pet the animal thinking it was a cat 
officials say that the skunk is not classified as a domestic 
animal and by state law had to be put to death and its brain 
tested for rabies the only alternatives were for evans to 
volunteer to undergo rabies treatment or to take a chance and agree 
to spare skunky from the fatal test 
county public information officer david hirt noted that skunky 
had won three stays of execution last week when the story began 
making headlines 
skunky won his first postponement so that his case could be 
heard by the county commission last week the commission gave him 
another break until thursday and then agreed to an extension until 
monday at noon 
ive had hundreds of calls to the county office to save 
skunky said hirt

britains first attempt to extradite a 
guerrilla suspect under a new agreement with the irish republic 
collapsed on monday when an irish court freed a man accused of 
bombings in london 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain was utterly 
dismayed by the ruling a senior aide said 
a crowd of supporters cheered patrick mcveigh 37 outside 
portlaoise district court and drove him away so quickly they left 
his wife celina standing on the sidewalk 
mcveigh was the first person targeted for extradition since the 
british and irish governments last month resolved legal differences 
which had stopped all extraditions this year 
an irish state application was made for mcveigh to be sent to 
britain to face charges regarding explosions between 1981 and 1983 
that killed two people outside chelsea barracks and a bomb disposal 
expert in oxford street 
judge jarlath ruane said the irish government had not properly 
established mcveighs identity 
the judge said british police had not sent witnesses to identify 
mcveigh as the man wanted so there was nothing to indicate the man 
in court was the same as the one mentioned on extradition warrants 
mcveigh from belfast was arrested may 18 as he left portlaoise 
prison after serving five years of a sevenyear term for irish 
republican army weapons offenses 
alan green britains director of public prosecutions said in 
london that irish authorities had assured his officers further 
identification was not needed 
an irish government spokesman said we do not comment on 
decisions made in court 
sean mcmanus national chairman of the sinn fein the legal 
political wing of the outlawed ira accused the british government 
of arrogance in assuming irish courts automatically would hand over 
prisoners 
there should be no extradition of irish citizens to face 
british injustice mcmanus said in dublin 
under a new law that took effect last dec 1 britain and 
ireland agreed to make positive identification the chief factor in 
extradition 
previously irish courts freed wanted guerrillas on grounds the 
ira was engaged in a political struggle and not a criminal one in 
trying to drive the british out of northern ireland 
the extradition issue has been a major britishirish dispute 
in 1986 bombing suspect evelyn glenholmes was freed when a 
dublin court found a london police warrant for her defective she 
has been on the run from valid warrants ever since 
londondublin relations are still troubled by the fatal 
shootings on march 6 of three guerrilla suspects in gibraltar 
colony and refusal to grant a new trial for six irish people 
imprisoned in britain for bombings of which they say they are 
innocent

the industrial giant 
daimlerbenz which forced people to work for the nazi war effort 
said monday that its 117 million payment to victims is designed 
to help prevent similar injustices 
we hope to make a contribution toward preventing the horrors 
of the past from being repeated daimlerbenz board chairman 
edzard reuter told reporters at the companys headquarters in 
stuttgart 
with this gesture we hope to soothe the still painful scars 
of the nazi regime said reuter whose family fled to turkey 
after the nazi takeover reuters father was a promiment social 
democrat one of the major foes of the nazis 
like other german companies during adolf hitlers third reich 
daimlerbenz used thousands of forced laborers to fuel its wartime 
production of engines and vehicles for the military many laborers 
died from illtreatment or were later murdered in nazi 
concentration camps 
the german red cross announced daimlers payments friday the 
announcement followed a study the company commissioned to determine 
the extent to which forced laborers worked in its plants nearly a 
half century ago 
daimlerbenz makes buses and cars including mercedesbenz 
luxury automobiles its many subsidiaries include a major aerospace 
manufacturer 
according to a study released in 1987 by an indepndent 
historical research group more than 46000 forced laborers were 
being used in daimlerbenz factories in 1944 
the study compiled by the hamburg foundation for 20th century 
social history concluded that by the end of the war half of the 
workers at the companys factories were forced laborers 
the study detailed brutal work conditions and executions of 
workers many from france and the soviet union accused of 
sabotage it also concluded that daimler management conspired with 
nazi leaders in the early 1930s to make the company germanys chief 
producer of military vehicles 
the amount of the daimlerbenz payment and its timing drew 
immediate fire from survivors of the labor programs 
the real tragedy is that 43 years after the end of the war 
only a quarter of those who worked at daimler are still alive 
said alfred hausser a spokesman for a stuttgartbased group 
representing the interests of the former laborers 
one cant even begin to call this compensaton hausser said 
daimlerbenz joins other major german companies that have paid 
reparations to former forced laborers and their families 
government studies indicate that more than 8 million people 
worked against their will in factories during world war ii 
among them were people deported from occupied territories 
prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates 
in 1986 the giant flick conglomerate paid 29 million to its 
victims other west german firms such as the giant krupp concern 
a major weapons producer during world war ii have also paid 
reparations 
in addition to the company payments the west german government 
has so far paid 468 billion to nazi concentration camp survivors 
under the 1952 luxembourg agreement signed between west germany and 
the world jewish congress 
that figure is expected to reach 585 billion by the end of the 
century

manufacturing corporations aftertax profits 
averaged 63 cents per dollar of sales in the first three months of 
the year up a sharp 43 percent from the fourth quarter the 
government reported monday 
the commerce department said us manufacturers aftertax 
profits totaled a seasonally adjusted 394 billion in the first 
quarter compared with 274 billion in the fourth quarter when 
profits averaged 44 cents per dollar of sales 
aftertax profits totaled 369 billion a 413 percent rise 
from the fourthquarter total of 261 billion in profits sales 
climbed a smaller 21 percent in the first quarter to 6291 
billion from 6162 billion in the fourth quarter 
the combination of rising profits and higher sales boosted the 
level of profits to 63 cents per dollar of sales an increase of 
43 percent over the fourth quarter performance of 44 cents 
the government said the profit improvement occurred in part 
because petroleum and chemical companies took large writeoffs 
against profits in the fourth quarter depressing earnings during 
that period 
manufacturers of primary metals electrical machinery and 
transportation equipment all enjoyed profit gains of more than 30 
percent in the first quarter from the final quarter of 1987 
compared with a year earlier companies reporting profit 
increases of 50 percent or more were food paper printing

a general strike was said to have virtually shut 
down armenia on monday and a shotgun blast killed a policeman 
during weekend ethnic protests in the neighboring southern republic 
of azerbaijan 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said an 
azerbaijani officer was killed by shotgun fire during protests in 
baku the azerbaijani capital gerasimov identified the slain 
officer only as sgt izmailov 
it was the first official confirmation of a police death in 
ethnic unrest that began in february in the neighboring caucasus 
republics gerasimov identified the gunman only as an armenian 
named aganbegyan 
azerbaijanis and armenians are arguing over control of 
nagornokarabakh a region with a predominantly armenian population 
that was assigned to azerbaijan in 1923 the conflict is aggravated 
by the fact that most azerbaijanis are moslems and most armenians 
are christians 
on sunday rumors that two armenians had been killed in 
azerbaijan led to protests by armenians in moscow they gathered in 
a cemetery and marched to the offices of the official tass news 
agency 
gerasimov told reporters monday we have received information 
from baku that the information about the murder of two armenians is 
false in fact there was a shooting in baku from a shotgun a 
shot from a shotgun and the bullet killed a militia sergeant 
there 
the bullet was deflected from some kind of surface he said 
and police have not determined whether the killing was intentional 
or accidental it occurred during a demonstration for retaining 
nagornokarabakh region in azerbaijan gerasimov said 
he provided no details of the shooting and did not say precisely 
when it occurred there were unconfirmed reports saturday of 
largescale protests in baku 
gerasimov and sergei grigoryants a moscow dissident reached by 
telephone said armenians met in their capital yerevan on sunday 
and decided on a general strike 
its timing is an attempt to influence a june 15 meeting of the 
supreme soviet of armenia 
armenias new communist party leader suren arutyunyan 
addressed protesters and told them the armenian supreme soviet 
would not only review but decide positively on their claim 
grigoryants said national government and party officials have 
refused the armenian demand for control of nagornokarabakh 
grigoryants a former political prisoner said the activists had 
not decided how long the strike would run but that it might 
continue until june 28 when a special conference of the national 
communist party begins in moscow 
he said estimates of the number of people who gathered in 
yerevan on sunday ranged from 500000 to 700000 which would rival 
the huge demonstrations at the end of february his estimate could 
not be confirmed independently 
after the february protests riots broke out in the azerbaijan 
city of sumgait north of baku officials have said 32 people were 
killed 26 armenians and six azerbaijanis 
those who protested on sunday agreed on a general strike to 
include all industries except food processing health care and 
transportation grigoryants said and it spread to public transport 
on monday 
he said strikes were under way throughout armenia with the 
possible exception of kafan city from which he had no information 
according to official and dissident versions of events in 
yerevan strikes meetings and protests continued from sunday night 
into monday morning 
grigoryants said the constant gatherings in the main square were 
called off monday afternoon because the temperature reached 104 
degrees 
people assembled again monday night but there was no information 
on their numbers or what happened he said 
arutyunyan was made armenian party leader may 21 replacing 
karen demirchyan azerbaijan party leader kyamran bagirov was 
replaced the same day in a clear indication of moscows displeasure 
with the unrest 
gerasimov said the trouble did not stem from mikhail s 
gorbachevs efforts to reform soviet society this is not the 
result of democracy and glasnost but many years of stagnation when 
we didnt delve deeply enough into national problems he said

the guardian angels on monday accused police of 
harassing them to halt their patrol of a restaurant district 
saying police arrested two angels after they were menaced by a 
knifewielding crack dealer 
i think its ridiculous for the police to be fighting the 
guardian angels they should be fighting the crack dealers said 
lisa sliwa spokeswoman for the group and wife of the groups 
founder curtis sliwa its almost as if they are on the side of 
the drug dealers 
the confrontation that led to the arrest of two youths sunday 
night followed an incident the previous night that left one angel 
critically injured after he was stabbed 
the angels started their patrols of the restaurant row section 
of west 46th street in midtown manhattan last wednesday fifteen 
proprietors asked the volunteer patrol group to help rid the block 
of drug traffic 
asked if the angels were being harassed by police detective 
joseph mcconville a department spokesman said i have no 
knowledge of that 
he had no comment when asked if the angels were being asked not 
to patrol restaurant row 
according to ms sliwa the latest incident occurred at about 1 
am monday while the two angels were on patrol in the area 
they told a small group of crack dealers to leave the area to 
move on one of the crack dealers pulled out a knife from his back 
pocket and threatened the angels she said 
the angels immediately called police who took everyone to the 
midtown north precinct station she said 
mcconville however said the incident occurred about 920 pm 
sunday 
john johnson 24 of new york told police he was surrounded by 
12 angels and refused to leave the area when they ordered him out 
johnson according to mcconville was bumped by an angel and then 
took out a pocket knife and held it at his side for protection 
when police arrived they arrested johnson and two angels loren 
gonzalez 21 of milwaukee and david baldwin 18 of newark nj 
the three were charged with menacing and the angels also were 
charged with harassing 
in saturdays incident illya lichtenberg 16 of verona nj 
was hit in the head with a bottle and stabbed in the chest during a 
confrontation between about 15 angels and 15 other people police

an alaska airlines boeing 737 jet crossed 
the iceclogged bering strait on monday in a short but historic 
flight aimed at bridging 40 years of wariness and distrust between 
the united states and the soviet union 
the onetime charter friendship flight to the eastern 
siberia port of provideniya from the western alaska town of nome 
was seen as a tentative first step in thawing relations and 
reuniting eskimo families split when the iron curtain slammed shut 
during the cold war in 1948 
the border between alaska and the soviet union was closed first 
by the united states and then by the soviets 
mondays 40minute flight was approved by the soviets with 
little notice earlier this month after two years of work by 
alaskans promoting the idea 
eighty government officials eskimos and journalists were booked 
aboard the jet making the 225mile flight it left nome shortly 
after 3 pm edt 
provideniya officials planned to entertain the visitors with 
tours a banquet and a trip to an outlying native village 
the flight is part of a broader effort being mounted by alaska 
business leaders educators and state officials to improve the 
states relations with the soviet union 
the flight was the dream of james stimpfle a nome real estate 
agent seeking ways to improve nomes economy he envisions nome as 
an economic and cultural center for both sides of the bering strait 
alaska airlines is seeking permission to follow the onetime 
charter with twiceweekly tourist excursions between nome and 
provideniya 
while peaceful interactions begin to flourish military interest 
in alaska and siberia also runs high the us navy has increased 
its emphasis on a strong defense in the north pacific and bering 
sea and us fighter jets last year intercepted a record number of 
soviet military aircraft off alaskas coasts

the white house on monday shrugged off a new 
book that says former presidential aide oliver north proposed using 
hostage negotiator terry waite in an attempt to set up libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi for assassination 
we dont look into ollie north stories said presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater thats history and world leaders 
know it its a book about oliver north what do we care 
he called the books narration about the alleged north episode a 
cockamamie story 
fitzwater said events involving north a former staff member of 
the national security council were a long time ago i dont know 
what he did 
north was fired in november 1986 after the discovery of an 
alleged diversion of profits from the secret iran arms sales to the 
contra rebels in nicaragua north and three other defendants face 
trial felony conspiracy charges 
a newly published book by cbs pentagon correspondent david c 
martin and wall street journal national security correspondent john 
walcott said north proposed asking waite to go to tripoli to meet 
with gadhafi 
waite would ask gadhafis help in freeing the american hostages 
in lebanon and then depart leaving the libyan leader to spend the 
night at his compound where he could be the target of an 
assassination attempt according to the book entitled best laid 
plans 
the book said norths plan was quickly rejected

pioneer 10 the little spacecraft 
that wont quit is still searching for a 10th planet five years 
after leaving the known solar system and 16 years after leaving the 
launch pad nasa scientists said monday 
disturbances in the orbits of neptune and uranus suggest that a 
mysterious planet x may be orbiting beyond pluto john d anderson 
of nasas jet propulsion laboratory said as nasa observed the fifth 
anniversary of pioneer 10s dash past plutos orbit 
pioneer 10 launched in 1972 and now over 4 billion miles from 
home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months also is 
searching for long gravity waves proposed by albert einstein and 
the boundary of the suns influence 
the radio signals the 570pound space probe is sending back 
from 45 times the distance between the earth and the sun arent 
very powerful and take six hours to get here at the speed of light 
but they are important to researchers trying to solve some 
classical puzzles about the universe 
the energy of the crafts signals picked up by a 70meter deep 
space antenna would have to be accumulated for over 11 billion 
years to build up enough energy to light a 7watt nightlight for 
one millisecond said richard o fimmel project manager at the 
nasa ames research center 
but the signals from pioneer 10 and its twin pioneer 11 
launched in 1973 are strong enough to send high quality data on 
a daily basis said physicist james van allen of the university 
of iowa a principal investigator on the pioneer project 
van allen who discovered the radiation belts surrounding earth 
said pioneer 10 has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its 
original missions to study jupiter and the asteroid belt between 
mars and jupiter 
one of the principal current objectives is the observation of 
cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored 
distances from the sun van allen said 
we now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer 
boundary of the heliosphere which is the sphere of influence of 
the sun and of penetrating into the nearby interstellar media 
he said 
but sadly he said pioneer 10 may stop working before it 
reaches the edge of the heliosphere 
the tiny craft is expected to operate only another seven to 10 
years fimmel said and may run out of energy before it reaches 
interstellar space 
before that however pioneer 10 may give scientists clues to 
the shape of the heliosphere 
and it is relaying strong evidence suggesting planet x or 
possibly two smaller unknown planets exist 
we have a 90 to 99 percent confidence that uranus and neptune 
are being disturbed and one candidate for that is a single planet 
x said anderson its conceivable there could be other 
gravitational effects on the two orbits 
we havent ruled out other matter which could be in orbit 
around the sun he said it could be small particulate matter 
it could be more than one planet that are very small the best 
hypothesis is a single planet x at one to four earth masses 
such a planet he said would likely be a mixture of ice and 
rock 
pioneer 10 made its closest approach to jupiter 82000 miles 
on dec 3 1973 21 months after it was launched after traveling 
an arcshaped 620 millionmile path from earth 
it was the first spacecraft to cross the asteroid belt fly past 
jupiter and return pictures chart jupiters intense radiation 
belts measure the mass of its four planetsized moons and 
discover that jupiter is predominantly a liquid planet 
pioneer 11 encountered jupiter a year later then reached saturn 
on sept 1 1979 
both craft though partly damaged along the way far exceeded 
their operations guarantee of at least 21 months a spokesman for 
trw inc of redondo beach joked monday that the company would fix 
anything wrong with the two pioneers if nasa could bring them back

vice president george bush promised a group of 
cubanamericans monday that the us government will make no 
accommodations with fidel castros communist government 
speaking at a ceremony at which the administration announced 
agreement with a private foundation on a plan to resettle some 
4000 latin american refugees bush said we have isolated him so 
effectively both diplomatically and politically that it would 
be foolhardy to make concessions in the interest of better 
relations 
there will be no diplomatic or political agreements that will 
prolong the suffering of cubans under castros marxist 
dictatorship he said adding that castros rule has proved 
calamitous for the western hemisphere 
there have been no accommodations made with castros corrupt 
communist government by this administration and if i may inject a 
partisan point i guarantee you there will be no accommodations 
if he is elected president bush said 
freedom for cuba is not a bargaining chip at all he said 
bush also said he would work hard to make tv marti successful in 
bringing news of the outside world to cubans on the mainland as he 
said radio marti has succeeded in doing 
bush attorney general edwin meese iii assistant secretary of 
state elliott abrams and immigration commissioner alan c nelson 
took part in ceremonies with representatives of the cubanamerican 
national foundation a private organization that has agreed to take 
on the project of helping to resettle some 4000 latin americans in 
this country 
the administration had been pushing for such a program but was 
unwilling to have it paid for out of the us treasury the 
foundation has volunteered to carry on the work at its own expense 
with donations

tragedies like the death of a navy recruit 
during a training program could be avoided if the pentagon did a 
better job of screening recruits for potential mental health 
problems rep michael bilirakis said monday 
we need to find out what steps are being taken by the military 
to deal with this very serious problem of phobias the florida 
democrat told a news conference 
on monday he wrote to defense secretary frank c carlucci 
seeking detailed information about how the pentagon screens 
recruits for potential mental health problems carluccis office 
said the secretary would not have any comment because the letter 
hadnt yet been received 
bilirakis letter referred to the march 2 death of airman 
recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis who drowned during an 
elite rescue swimmer training program at the pensacola fla naval 
air station 
a navy investigator is now deliberating whether five swimming 
instructors and a commanding officer should be courtmartialed 
because force was used to stop mirecki from leaving the pool where 
he drowned 
testimony at a navy preliminary hearing indicated mirecki had a 
phobia about being pulled under water 
bilirakis held his news conference along with members of the 
phobic society of america who said mireckis case highlights the 
dangers of phobias 
phobias are defined as persistent irrational fears of a 
specific object activity or situation which results in a 
compelling desire by an individual to avoid the fearful stimulus 
bilirikis citing statistics from the national institutes of 
mental health said phobias are the number one mental disorder in 
this nation and one out of every eight people suffer from some sort 
of phobia 
according to bilirakis mireckis death may have been avoided 
had his phobia been recognized before he entered the training 
program 
bilirakis said nothing on the military medical forms filled out 
by recruits addresses phobias additionally i am told there is 
nothing in the military medical procedures requiring a doctor to 
ask about specific mental health disorders at all

agriculture department researchers are growing 
coca plants in a 1 millionayear search for ways to eradicate 
south american crops destined for processing into cocaine 
officials said monday 
between 400 and 600 plants are being grown at two usda research 
sites one a greenhouse near washington and the other an outdoor 
location in an undisclosed warmweather area said dr edward b 
knipling associate deputy administrator for the agricultural 
research services national program staff 
knipling said all of the plants used in the experiment are 
incinerated afterward and that no cocaine is produced from them 
researchers earlier had grown opium poppies in thailand and 
marijuana in the united states as part of usdas research into ways 
to stem production of narcotics the priority changed two years ago 
because of growing use by americans of cocaine and crack a cocaine 
derivative knipling said 
the project was spotlighted in a report published in the new 
york times on sunday 
knipling estimated the cost of the program at about 1 million a 
year he said part of the funds come from the research services 
regular budget and the rest by the state department 
there is absolutely none being developed into cocaine 
knipling said its not possible not at our agricultural 
facilities 
he confirmed that the seeds were brought to the united states 
from south america and said a number of herbicides have been tested 
for use against the plant 
the chief herbicide recommended to the state department for use 
against coca is tebutherion a product manufactured by eli lilly amp 
co of indianapolis under the trade name spike knipling said it is 
used in considerable quantities in the united states to clear brush 
in areas where food crops do not grow 
guards alarms and wire fences are being used to keep out 
intruders at the usda installations knipling said he refused to 
disclose the precise whereabouts of either of the growing sites 
the issue first surfaced when the former head of the project 
walter gentner said in interviews that he had resigned in april to 
protest what he described as the failure of the agriculture and 
state departments to examine adequately the potential dangers from 
use of the herbicide 
knipling said there had been considerable pressure from various 
places in the administration to get on with approval of spike for 
use against coca 
weve been under an extensive sense of urgency coming from the 
state department and of course the white house itself that this 
is a highpriority project he said 
knipling said there had been frequent calls and visits to 
the research service that intensified the pressure he also said it 
was intensified by demands from congress and the public for action 
to combat drugs 
knipling contended that illicit cocaine production in south 
america is doing far more to endanger the environment than would 
use of tebutherion he said there was little doubt that the coca 
leaves were being heavily sprayed with pesticides which could 
cause harm 
moreover he said sulfuric acid and other chemicals being used 
to process the coca into cocaine are undoubtedly dumped into 
streams when the manufacturing process is over

senators scurried monday to overcome 
lastminute objections by the reagan administration to a 
farreaching welfare bill designed to help people break out of 
poverty through jobs training and education 
following a round of opening statements on the family security 
act key senators retired to the office of sen minority leader bob 
dole rkan to try to work out differences with the 
administration which was threatening to veto the measure 
the bills chief sponsor sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
said the first session was very promising and that the meetings 
would continue through the evening and on tuesday 
we have been attempting to find some solutions and we clearly 
are making progress at least in some very specific regards 
moynihan said 
dole said past congressional moves have only made the welfare 
system worse what we do here in the next few days in the senate 
will be a step in the right direction for once he said 
the fiveyear 26 billion bill is consensus measure that took 
18 months to develop it is a compromise version of a 7 billion 
welfare plan passed by the house last dec 17 
besides putting more welfare recipients to work the bill would 
force more absentee parents to pay child support and require states 
to provide at least six months of welfare benefits to poor 
households with two parents 
government checks are the main feature of the current aid to 
families with dependent children program serving 37 million 
families including 7 million children though there is a 
smallscale work program 
the moynihan bill and the more expensive house bill attempt to 
turn welfare into a jobs system with goverment checks a last 
resort if wages and child support payments are inadequate 
never has the senate considered so fundamental a redirection 
of the welfare system moynihan said 
its tempting to say this is an historical moment and yet 
events will decide whether that was the case he said referring 
to uncertainty over whether president reagan would veto the bill 
the administration was seeking among other things broader 
authority for states to use federal money for experimental welfare 
schemes a mandatory percentage of people participating in work 
training or education programs and a brandnew mandatory workfare 
or public works program that one senator said would cost 900 
million 
the office of management and budget said in a statement monday 
that reagan would veto the bill in its present form 
many senators said the moynihan measure is sorely needed to 
update and improve a 53yearold program conceived as a temporary 
benefit for widows in an age when divorced working and unmarried 
mothers were a rarity 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee called welfare reform an urgent national priority 
he said the nation is making do with a rube goldberg welfare 
system developed during the depression to meet the needs of a 
society that no longer exists 
bentsen and others hammered at moynihans themes that children 
are the poorest population group in america today and that their 
training for the job market is important given projections of an 
impending labor shortage 
millions of children who are living in poverty and receiving 
welfare today must become the trained motivated workers of 
tomorrow bentsen said 
states would have to require parents to furnish social security 
numbers at the birth of their children meet minimum standards for 
establishing paternity set guidelines for child support awards 
and set procedures for immediate wage withholding from paychecks 
all states would be required to have a jobs education and 
training program for welfare recipients with children age 3 or 
over or age 1 at state option states would have to guarantee 
child care for participants and spend half their money on people 
who are or are likely to be longterm welfare recipients 
nine months of transitional child care assistance and a year of 
medicaid coverage would be required for people moving off welfare 
into the workforce 
another provision would require states to give welfare benefits 
to families with two parents in the home twentysix states already 
provide such benefits moynihans compromise would make six months 
a year mandatory in the other 24 states 
the moynihan bill would be financed primarily by making 
permanent the internal revenue services refund withholding program 
for delinquent federal debtors and phasing out the dependent care 
tax credit for higherincome taxpayers 
the house bill offers states financial incentives to raise their 
benefit levels many of which are far below the federal poverty 
line liberal lawmakers and interest groups have criticized the 
senate bill for leaving out the provision

lewis earl hoppy swartz the father of 
organized surfing and developer of the judging system used on the 
professional circuit has died of a stroke while on his way to a 
surf competition he was 71 
swartz collapsed while standing in line at a ticket counter at 
the los angeles airport thursday his longtime friend dave 
mcintyre said monday 
as swartz wished his body will be cremated and the ashes 
scattered sunday at redondo beach 
swartz a 1930s surfing champ who was a familiar figure on 
california beaches with his trademark straw hat was headed for a 
western surfing association contest in santa cruz when he died 
this 12yearold kid walked up to me saturday and said dave 
i talked to hoppy last friday wheres hoppy recalled mcintyre 
i just said turn around and look out there 
the waves had been pretty flat and they suddenly came up to 6 
feet i said hes out there 
surfing was his whole life said leroy granis pioneer 
surfing photographer who grew up with swartz when surf boards were 
110 pounds of pine and redwood 
swartz started the united states surfing association in the 
early 1960s 
there is now an immense hole in amateur surfing on the west 
coast because he was really the crankshaft of organized surfing on 
the west coast said surfer magazine publisher steve pezman 
the sport will miss him 
surfing is really the antithesis of organized social behavior 
so it was hard to organize but it had to organize to survive 
hoppy was always the guy willing to do the dirty work 
he dedicated his life to making surf competitions a place 
where young people could become exposed to sportsmanship and all 
the virtues of wave riding 
in addition to surfing swartz had a masters degree in 
electrical engineering from the university of california berkeley 
and worked on space radar systems at the massachusetts institute of 
technology trw and hughes research before retiring at age 55 
swartz who recently moved to long beach is survived by a 
brother two sisters two daughters a son and eight grandchildren

recommend a halt to the scheduled tuesday morning execution of 
edward byrne jr convicted of romancing robbing and murdering a 
service station worker in august 1984 
the decision left byrnes fate up to the us supreme court 
other state and federal courts refused earlier monday to stop the 
execution which would be the 100th in the nation since capital 
punishment was reinstituted more than 10 years ago 
at mondays pardon board hearing byrne was described by defense 
attorneys amanda potterfield and nancy baumgartner as a sensitive 
articulate jailhouse poet who helped other inmates write letters to 
loved ones 
byrne clad in blue jeans and tshirt claimed he never intended 
to kill his victim 
i was planning to rob this woman all along said the curly 
haired 28yearold prisoner it was all set up there were no 
flaws that i could see 
four of the five pardon board members who heard byrnes case 
voted against a lighter sentence a fifth member was absent 
byrne was to die in the electric chair at the louisiana state 
penitentiary in angola for fatally bludgeoning roberta johnson of 
bossier city the pardon board has no power to stop executions but 
can recommend sentence reductions for approval by gov buddy roemer 
ever since his arrest byrne has admitted that he started dating 
johnson because he knew she handled large sums of money at the 
service station where she worked but he insisted he never meant to 
kill her 
johnson died after being struck repeatedly with a ball peen 
hammer 
i just attempted to knock her unconscious byrne told the 
pardon board in a hearing that began about 14 hours before his 
scheduled execution it didnt work

sentence to life imprisonment efforts to save him continued at the 
us supreme court early monday the 5th us circuit court of 
appeals and the state supreme court rejected appeals 
at the pardon board hearing which took place at the prison 
defense lawyers had yousef danesh a southern university professor 
of political science read poetry written by byrne danesh said he 
had become friends with byrne after the killer was incarcerated at 
the state prison 
baumgartner said byrne was a young man deeply remorseful about 
the death he had unintentionally caused 
but henry brown the district attorney who prosecuted the case 
painted byrne as a manipulative rogue and cold calculating killer 
brown said byrne had been caught in a leesville hotel room the 
morning after the killing byrne was captured naked with a 
barmaid he had picked up at a nearby tavern and had proposed 
marriage to parked outside was a car byrne had stolen from the 
woman he lived with before getting involved with johnson the

a japanese student charged with trying to 
sneak weapons aboard a jetliner remained jailed monday without bail 
he is a threat to the community and a risk of flight 
assistant us attorney marsha mcclellan told federal magistrate 
richard powers 
powers denied bail and scheduled a hearing thursday on a 
government motion to hold yoshino kosugi 18 a drexel university 
engineering student for trial 
kosugi en route to japan to spend the summer with his family 
was arrested sunday morning minutes before the scheduled takeoff of 
a northwest airlines jetliner for tokyo 
he had a roundtrip ticket and was scheduled to return in 
september when classes resume 
a routine check of his luggage uncovered four practice grenades 
with live primers blank rifle ammunition a small bottle of flash 
gunpowder smokeless powder a carbon dioxide pellet gun with 
cartridges and pellets 50 feet of detonation cord homemade 
firecrackers road flares and three knives 
the discovery led authorities to close one of five terminals at 
philadelphia international airport for three hours while the bomb 
squad examined the explosives 
the government charged that kosugi did willfully and without 
regard for the safety of human life try to place the seized items 
aboard an aircraft if convicted he faces a maximum of five years 
in prison and a 25000 fine 
an affidavit filed with the court said kosugi freely admitted 
that the items located in his luggage belonged to him and were 
packed in his luggage in a concealed manner by him for transport to 
his destination yokohama japan 
fbi agent john kundts who participated in the questioning said 
kosugi maintained that he collected military paraphernalia 
his items were all obtainable from an army surplus store 
the prosecution at the hearing did not say whether the 
government had any evidence or even believed that kosugi was a 
member of a terrorist group 
but shortly after the arrest kundts said foreign authorities 
had found no connection between kosugi and terrorist organizations 
in april another japanese yu kikumara accused of links to the 
terrorist japanese red army was arrested at a new jersey turnpike 
rest stop where explosives were found in his car 
nothing indicated any connection between kikumara and kosugi

investigators examined an alaska airlines 
jetliner monday and interviewed crew members to learn why it veered 
from a runway and skidded to a stop in mud after landing at 
seattletacoma international airport 
four people were slightly injured sunday night aboard the boeing 
727200 which remained overnight in the grassy strip between the 
airports parallel runways 
the 75 passengers and seven crew members aboard flight 187 from 
tucson ariz used emergency chutes to evacuate as a precaution 
airport officials said 
it was a fairly normal flight until we landed said 
passenger marlene davies 52 from nearby kent i saw the white 
line and we kept going over it and then i saw smoke or dust or 
something it was very scary 
it seemed to me like about 30 seconds from the time we stopped 
to the time the stewardess threw the door open and yelled to 
evacuate she said 
once out of the plane we ran as fast as we could to the 
runway we had just been on said passenger katherine tune of 
seattle we all congregated and the emergency crews gathered 
the jet was towed monday morning to an airport hangar where the 
national transportation safety board began its probe of the 
accident a representative of seattlebased boeing was assisting 
the jet manufacturer said 
upon examination of the airplane after it came to rest in the 
grassy area the left tire of the twotire front nose assembly gear 
was flat said dave marriott a spokesman for the seattlebased 
alaska airlines 
whether it was flat before they landed flat on impact or flat 
after that is still being looked into he said 
port of seattle spokesman john eliadis said the nose of the 
plane stopped about 400 feet from the runway and investigators 
were checking to see whether the plane might have blown a tire upon 
landing or possibly struck some debris on the runway 
gwen gause an ntsb staff assistant in seattle said the planes 
nose wheel had to be dug out of mud before the plane could be 
moved there was no other visible damage to the plane she said 
ms gause said it may take months to determine the cause of the 
accident 
margo spellman airport spokeswoman said two passenger 
complained of back pain were treated at area hospitals a third 
person had a bruised knee and a fourth suffered a sprained ankle 
ms spellman said 
the flight originated in tucson and made stops in phoenix and 
portland marriott said marriott said the airline canceled four 
flights monday between seattle and various california airports 
because the plane was taken out of service but expected to operate 
those flights on tuesday

a superpowerful american missile cruiser 
returned to patrol duty in the persian gulf monday after being 
pulled off for what a us navy spokesman said was maintenance 
the 9400ton uss vincennes was taken off duty less than two 
weeks after its arrival in the waterway may 28 it is the first of 
the navys billiondollar aegistype cruisers to be assigned to the 
gulf 
us navy officers say the warships multiplemission 
computerlinked radar and weapons system vastly expands the navys 
air and sea surveillance capabilities 
the navy spokesman lt cmdr brad goforth said the vincennes 
was withdrawn for maintenance upkeep but refused for security 
reasons to say what was the exact nature of the problem 
the ship was out of action for about three days other navy 
sources said 
those sources who spoke on condition of not being identified 
said the ships phasedarray radar system was involved but 
could give no other details and this could not be verified unlike 
standard radar the system is able to constantly monitor scores of 
contacts simultaneously 
in its first week in the gulf the vincennes had a near 
encounter with an iranian frigate that intercepted boarded and 
then escorted away the cypriotflag freighter vevey suspected of 
carrying warrelated cargo 
the cruiser followed the detained ship to the edge of irans 
declared warexclusion zone in hopes of detecting some signal 
from the vevey that would justify its intervention but neither saw 
nor heard any us officers said 
meanwhile lloyds shipping intelligence unit said an 
americanowned supertanker attacked by iranian gunboats saturday 
would continue to singapore as planned after repairs at a united 
arab emirates shipyard 
the 258979ton esso demetia owned by the exxon corp and 
sailing under the british flag had eight holes in its hull from 
rocketpropelled grenades lloyds said 
fires broke out but were controlled lloyds said there were no 
casualties 
the londonbased maritime agency which monitors commercial 
shipping worldwide said the ship now is anchored off bahrain and 
will sail to fujairah on the gulf of oman for repairs later it 
will head for singapore its original destination with its cargo 
of saudi arabian crude 
the raid took place about 45 miles off saudi arabia in an area 
where no such attacks are rare according to us navy officials 
and gulfbased shipping executives all these sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
of interest to navy intelligence was how the two or three armed 
speedboats could appear in daylight and just as quickly vanish in 
the western gulf about 60 miles off iran and the same distance 
from iranianheld farsi island the island is known as an operating 
base for the speedboatborne revolutionary guards in the northern 
gulf 
us forces maintain a careful watch on shipping activity in the 
gulf including small and mediumsized craft that might be used 
for minelaying or as mother ships for the speedboats 
in land and air action in the nearly 8yearold war between iran 
and iraq iran said its forces drove into southern iraq behind 
helicopter gunships on monday recapturing some of the territory 
east of basra they lost three weeks ago iraq said it repulsed the 
invaders 
iran claimed iraqi planes dropped chemical bombs on the 
attackers but said chemical warfare units neutralized the poison 
gas and kept casualties to a minimum

the 1 million or more americans 
infected with the aids virus are becoming more infectious and the 
risk to uninfected people is growing researchers said monday 
nonmonogamous sexual contact is becoming more dangerous 
said james goedert of the national cancer institute in bethesda 
md he presented his findings at the fourth international 
conference on aids in stockholm 
in a study of hemophiliacs goedert found that condoms dont 
protect against aids unless they are always used during sexual 
relations irregular condom use is no better than no condom at 
all he said 
dr james curran of the centers for diease control in atlanta 
reported that new aids cases are reported in the united states at 
the rate of one every 14 minutes 
he estimated 365000 cases will have been reported in the united 
states by 1992 but said the figure could range between 205000 and 
440000 
the aids conference here is the largest meeting ever held on the 
subject of acquired immune deficiency syndrome with more than 
7000 participants 
also monday 
jeanbaptiste brunet of claude bernard hospital in paris said 
the number of aids cases reported in europe has reached 12221 and 
is doubling every 11 months 
the incidence of aids in drug abusers is exploding in spain 
france and italy he said in 1985 7 percent of europes aids 
cases were in drug abusers now the figure is 30 percent an 
estimated 300000 to 800000 people in 30 european countries are 
infected with the aids virus brunet said 
australian researchers described six cases in which mothers who 
became infected after birth passed the virus to their infants 
through breast milk 
an early report from an expanding us government study of 
american hospital patients said that three in every 1000 patients 
tested at six us hospitals are infected with the aids virus but 
the spread of the aids virus appears to be slowing 
curran said it is difficult to tell if the aids epidemic is 
beginning to level off but said he didnt consider that an 
important question 
we had a thousand cases reported in the united states last 
week he said in an interview does it matter whether its 
going up or not it might level off like lung cancer or heart 
disease and thats not good 
a 1986 estimate that 1 million to 1 million americans were 
infected with the aids virus was probably too high then curran 
said we believe an estimate of 1 million to 1 million infected 
is accurate now he said 
goederts conclusions about the growing infectiousness of people 
carrying the aids virus came from a study of the rate at which 
infected hemophiliacs transmitted the aids virus to their wives or 
steady female partners 
in the first year of the hemophiliacs infection only 1 percent 
of the partners became infected 
by the fourth year the rate of transmission began to increase 
and by the fifth year 10 percent to 20 percent of the women were 
becoming infected each year goedert said 
there is a steeply increasing risk of becoming infected in 
longterm relationships goedert said 
the more partners the more the risk goedert said 
curran said that the transmission of aids among heterosexuals 
will continue to grow 
more and more women are acquiring the disease through 
heterosexual contact he said 
the data are too incomplete for firm conclusions he said 
but heterosexual transmission will be increasingly important 
without explosive increases as were seeing in iv intravenous 
drug abusers and gay men in the united states 
goedert said that a person infected with the aids virus becomes 
more able to transmit it when the disease progresses to the point 
where laboratory tests reveal an immune system deficiency even 
though there may be no visible symptoms 
dr robert redfield of the walter reed institute of research in 
washington said that the gradual spread of aids to heterosexuals is 
being accompanied by another unfortunate trend 
we have mounting evidence that the virus is steadily creeping 
into the young people he said 
among 17yearold applicants to the armed forces women are 
twice as likely to be infected as men suggesting that the women 
acquired the infection from heterosexual contact with older men he 
said 
about 60 percent of the nations approximately 18000 
hemophiliacs are now infected with the aids virus goedert said 
curran said the best available evidence now is that 40 percent 
of people infected with the virus will develop aids within nine 
years after becoming infected and the rate at which they develop 
aids is likely to climb as even more time goes by 
aids is a disease in which a virus attacks the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections 
and cancers 
the world health organization reported in april 1988 that 
there were 88031 aids cases reported worldwide since 1981 
including 57575 in the united states

the prime ministers of rivals greece 
and turkey held discussions in a very friendly atmosphere 
monday of problems that only last year brought the two nato allies 
close to war 
as they talked outside the capital about 2000 greek cypriot 
armenian and kurdish demonstrators in the city burned turkish flags 
outside the turkish embassy and shouted fire for the turkish 
dogs 
hundreds of helmeted riot police guarded the embassy building 
but there were no clashes witnesses said 
no signs emerged of a breakthrough on the major disputes over 
cyprus and the aegean sea during mondays one hour of talks between 
premiers andreas papandreou of greece and turgut ozal of turkey 
mesut yilmaz the but turkish foreign minister told reporters 
later the meeting was held in a very friendly atmosphere and all 
bilateral problems and international issues were handled 
ozal began a threeday visit to greece on monday the first by a 
turkish premier in 36 years 
progovernment and opposition greek newspapers both gave him a 
cool reception 
frozen smiles was the headline in 24 hours an independent 
athens daily the country receives ozal with a cold heart said 
the progovernment avriani 
in separate statements before the talks started both leaders 
made clear they did not expect immediate major advances on the main 
disputes 
on monday night ozal was guest of honor at a dinner beside the 
the swimming pool of a seaside hotel in vouliagmeni outside 
athens where he and papandreou are staying 
there is no room for petty designs onesided gains and 
shortsighted tactics ozal said in his speech in an apparent 
reference to greek demands that turkish troops leave cyprus 
papandreou said in his speech he had revived an earlier proposal 
for demilitarization of the mediterranean island and establishing a 
joint greek cypriot and turkish cypriot police force 
its clear that progress in greekturkish relations is 
directly affected by the solution of the cyprus problem and 
this is directly linked with the withdrawal of troops from the 
island he said 
ozal will drive into downtown athens on tuesday to lay a wreath 
at the monument of the unknown soldier outside parliament then 
hold more private talks with papandreou in the evening 
ozal began his visit with an appeal for patience on the the 
long road to peace on which we have started journeying 
we must have realistic expectations otherwise the 
disappointments to be suffered will take us away from our main 
goal he told reporters the problems go back a long time and 
as solutions were delayed some of these problems petrified and 
prejudices increased 
when ozal arrived at the airport only a few redandwhite 
turkish flags were displayed and a greek commando squad in 
camouflage battledress formed the honor guard 
the neighbors came to the brink of war in march 1987 over 
oildrilling rights in the aegean seabed the nearclash apparently 
convinced papandreou to alter his nodialogue policy toward turkey 
and seek friendlier relations 
greece wants turkey to pull its troops out of northern cyprus 
and agree on a joint appeal to the world court to settle the aegean 
continental shelf dispute 
ozal says turkey will not be pressured into withdrawing its 
forces from cyprus and prefers greekturkish talks to solve the 
aegean problem the soldiers were sent after a brief greekled coup 
in july 1974

jesse jackson expressed confidence monday that he 
could rally his supporters behind certain democratic nominee 
michael dukakis even if dukakis doesnt pick him as a running mate 
but jackson continued to stress that he is entitled to serious 
consideration for the no 2 spot on the ticket 
even if dukakis picks someone else jackson told reporters here 
the massachusetts governor could expect backing from him so long 
as our agreements are rational fair and consistent 
jackson sought to put the focus on harmony with the dukakis 
camp citing the weekend agreement that south africa shuld be 
branded a terrorist state 
jackson had strongly pushed that view and at a preliminary 
platformdrafting meeting in mackinac island mich the dukakis 
forces went along 
the south africa position is a step in the right direction for 
america because we must regain our credibility and our moral 
authority in the third world as leader of the free world jackson 
said at an impromptu sidewalk news conference here 
dukakis has backed strong sanctions and a divestiture of us 
industries in south africa to protest its apartheid policies of 
racial segregation but the massachusetts governor had resisted 
branding south africa a terrorist state in the same category of 
states as libya and iran 
our agreeing to declare south africa a terrorist state and 
thereby pointing to apply antiterrorist legislation to south 
africa is a real hope to people throughout the world who seek 
fairness and justice said jackson 
he said there was a good tone to the negotiations with the 
dukakis camp 
so far they the talks are having an impact on broadening and 
strengthening the democratic party he said 
but jackson noted that major differences remain including 
dukakis refusal to support the freeze on military spending that 
jackson has called for and the dukakis forces resistance to the 
tax hikes jackson wants 
jackson was in chicago for a weekend of meetings with members of 
his national staff to discuss plans for the democratic national 
convention in atlanta next month 
jackson said he planned to deliver several major policy speeches 
before the convention outlining his programs for health care 
education the war on drugs and foreign and defense policy 
he also met monday with the editorial board of the chicago 
tribune and with officials of johnson publishing co publishers of 
jet and ebony magazines

george p shultz said proliferation is 
winning the race against disarmament and told the general 
assembly on monday that all nations should sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty 
the us secretary of state said the danger of proliferation is 
most acute in south asia meaning india and its rival pakistan 
both have refused to sign the treaty and accuse each other of 
developing nuclear weapons 
he said that 136 nations have signed the 20yearold treaty and 
there is no good reason why every nation should not make such a 
commitment it is a contribution each and every state can make to a 
safer world 
shultz also said the united states is concerned about the 
introduction of advanced missiles into the persian gulf war 
because they have killed civilians 
hundreds of people were killed on both sides earlier this year 
when iran and iraq rained missiles on each others cities most of 
the weapons were believed to be scud missiles of an old soviet 
design some of them equipped with boosters for longer range 
shultz address to a special general assembly session on 
disarmament came a week after soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze called on the united states to join a permament 
nuclear test ban shultz did not respond to a series of soviet 
proposals that won praise from many in the 159member assembly 
in his speech shultz outlined american achievements in arms 
control and said washingtons top priority in the field is 
concluding a ussoviet treaty to cut strategic nuclear arsenals 
by 50 percent 
does anyone doubt that the spread of nuclear weapons threatens 
regional and global security he said what state believes 
that if it now acquired nuclear weapons its rivals would not do 
the same 
now that the united states and the soviet union have agreed to 
reduce their nuclear arsenals it would be tragic for other 
countries to pursue the capability to cross the nuclear 
threshhold shultz said 
he said south asia is the area of greatest danger and urged 
countries in the region to take concrete steps to meet this 
urgent challenge the us is prepared to work with countries 
inside and outside the region to find a lasting solution to the 
danger of proliferation that satisfies all parties 
shultz was among the final few of more than 100 speakers who 
have addressed the general assembly since the special session began 
two weeks ago 
in his remarks about the iraniraq war which began in september 
1980 he said we already are seeing signs of a dangerous new 
arms race which will put at risk countries far removed from the 
gulf region itself 
use of the missiles and the killing of civilians makes a peace 
settlement more difficult he said 
the un session has been divided over key disarmament questions 
and diplomatic observers said it will be difficult to draft a final 
document which can satisfy most nations and be adopted by consensus 
the united states and western allies have called for limited 
pragmatic steps in arms control continued respect for nuclear 
deterrence a limited role for the un and recognition that 
bilateral arms talks must supersede multilateral efforts 
they say the treaty on intermediaterange nuclear weapons and 
some progress in ussoviet talks on 50percent cuts on strategic 
weapons show that bilateral efforts should be allowed to continue 
unencumbered by a multilateral apparatus 
western diplomats also have said that conventional disarmament 
is as important as nuclear disarmament and urged poor developing 
nations which clamor for nuclear disarmament to cut their own 
mounting expenditure in conventional armies 
after the speeches end tuesday or wednesday groups will begin 
drafting resolutions and a final document for this third special 
session on disarmament in 10 years 
but if the divisions are too great and the disarmament proposals 
too sweeping and utopian western nations are expected to demand a 
vote making consensus unlikely

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
appealed monday for national reconciliation and expressed 
willingness to legalize new associations and cooperate with 
communities outside official life but not with solidarity 
we can talk to anyone as long as he is not a client 
especially a paid one of a foreign court jaruzelski said he 
referred to grants of 1 million the us government gave to 
solidarity after it became the first free trade union federation in 
the soviet bloc 
jaruzelski gave the major policy address at the start of a 
twoday meeting of the 230member central committee of the polish 
united workers communist party he is party first secretary and 
president of the council of state 
janusz onyszkiewicz national spokesman for the now outlawed 
solidarity labor federation said in a telephone interview that any 
claim that solidarity is disloyal to poland did not merit a 
response he noted that both polands roman catholic church and the 
communist government have accepted us aid in the past and added 
we are in very strange company 
it was the first central committee plenum since a series of 
strikes between april 25 and may 10 five factories were struck and 
25 other plants endured brief stoppages or strike threats in the 
strongest labor action since solidarity was suspended in december 
1981 and subsequently outlawed 
solidarity had been chartered by the government during 
nationwide strikes in august 1980 
jaruzelski accused the leaders of the recent strikes of an 
almost pathological lack of responsibility and said they could 
not be an objectively credible partner in dialogue 
but he said authorities are ready to talk with critics who want 
to improve the state 
national reconciliation is a basic condition and one of the 
goals of socialist renewal jaruzelski said it is broader 
today than in past years 
jaruzelski said a planned new law on associations would lift 
administrative restrictions and grant the associations more 
freedom in the meantime officials should legally register new 
socially justified groups he said 
he mentioned no groups specifically indications have emerged 
that at least three suppressed groups the proprivate enterprise 
economic society the polish chapter of the pen writers club and 
the dziekania political discussion club may soon be registered 
about 300 mostly noncontroversial private associations were 
legalized last year but applications of many other groups were not 
approved including local chapters of solidarity and the 
independent students association 
jaruzelski said ideas and practices are crystalizing slowly 
for cooperation with what he called independent communities that 
have refused to join pron the official national unity organization 
he proposed a permanent wageprice commission with 
representatives of labor management and consumers that would seek 
a social consensus for price increases he said this would avoid 
periodic acrosstheboard price increases like one this year and 
instead aim at a floating system with prices evolving gradually 
jaruzelski noted that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will visit 
poland next month and said the trip will add a new significant 
chapter to polishsoviet relations

soviet troops are leaving afghanistan 
faster than we all expected the un mediator who negotiated 
the withdrawal said monday 
diego cordovez refused to say how many red army troops have 
pulled out since the geneva accord took effect may 15 
he also said he is disturbed by allegations the pact is being 
violated 
the soviets said they had 100300 troops in afghanistan as of 
may 15 and would withdraw onefourth of them by early june western 
intelligence agencies had estimated soviet troop strength as up to 
115000 
in moscow kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev and afghan 
president najib on monday spoke of resolute retaliatory 
measures if pakistan continues to aid moslem guerrillas battling 
the kabul regime 
the warning was the first of its kind directly from gorbachev 
it came as sources in pakistan said soviet forces had returned to 
some cities in eastern afghanistan to fight guerrillas who raided 
posts defended by afghan troops 
najib and gorbachev distributed a joint statement over the 
official soviet news agency tass saying the soviet union and 
afghanistan believed that the un mission monitoring compliance 
with the geneva accords would adopt effective measures to curb 
the practice of pakistans aiding the guerrillas which if 
continued would make it necessary to undertake the most resolute 
retaliatory steps 
last week najib accused pakistan of violating the accords by 
aiding the guerrillas and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said moscow might have to review its troop withdrawal 
schedule 
both were in new york last to attend a special un conference 
on disarmament 
pakistan in turn has accused afghanistan of intruding on its 
airspace and territory 
pakistans un ambassador s shah nawaz said monday that 
the world will not be surprised if a crumbing afghan regime 
makes a desperate bid to retain the protective umbrella of foreign 
troops the withdrawal of which is the central element of the 
geneva accords 
he addressed the 159nation general assembly during a special 
session on disarmament 
cordovez said later in a news conference let me say that 
nothing that has happened was not foreseen in the geneva accords 
it is unfortunate that we have encountered difficulties and i am 
concerned about them 
he said the accord envisages violations and has procedures 
to deal with them 
it was also expected of course that some people would make a 
lot of noise said the un official 
the withdrawal has been going on very well faster than we 
all expected and when people now talk about the withdrawal 
slowing down i would say in reference to what the agreement 
provides simply that 50 percent of the troops should be out by the 
15th of august 
cordovez said he would visit afghanistan and pakistan at the end 
of the month to review the implementation of the geneva accords 
soviet troops first entered afghanistan at the end of 1979 to 
support its marxist government 
the united nations mediated the accord between afghanistan and 
pakistan aimed at restoring peace in afghanistan with the united 
states and soviet union signing as guarantors of the pact pakistan 
adjoins afghanistan is headquarters for all major afghan guerrilla 
organizations and shelters about 35 million afghan refugees

mubarak awad the arabamerican advocate of 
nonviolent protest who was deported by israel on monday got his 
first taste of passive resistance as a student in the american 
south during the early 1960s 
when he returned home to jerusalem in 1983 after 13 years in the 
united states awad applied these ideas to the arabisraeli 
conflict calling for civil disobedience to protest israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
awad remained largely unknown until israeli authorities ordered 
him deported last month saying he played a role in inciting the 
arab uprising that began last dec8 
he openly and intensely acts against israeli control read a 
decision last week by the israeli supreme court upholding the 
deportation order 
his case drew worldwide attention and us secretary of state 
george p shultz tried to intercede on his behalf 
awads americanborn wife nancy nye said her husband never 
tried to be a leader but she noted his ideas for boycotts of 
israeli products and nonpayment of taxes are being used in the 
uprising 
if you read an article mubarak wrote in 1983 and read todays 
underground leaflets its almost as if he envisioned what was 
going to happen she said in a telephone interview 
ms nye however has denied israeli charges that her husband 
wrote leaflets advocating violence he has been criticized by 
israelis for not speaking out against violent attacks by 
palestinian militants 
awad a softspoken man with graying curly hair said in a 
statement addressing israels government last week you have the 
power the law and the gun pointing in my face i am armed with 
hope truth and nonviolence 
awad was born in jerusalem on aug 22 1943 the fifth of seven 
children of a greek orthodox father and a protestant mother 
his father was killed by a stray bullet near his home during the 
1948 middle east war awad and his siblings were sent to orphanages 
and boarding schools while his mother worked as a nurse 
awad graduated from an anglican school in jerusalem and in the 
early 1960s went to lee college a pentecostal school in cleveland 
tenn intending to become a minister 
but ms nye said awad returned to jerusalem after a little more 
than a year repelled by the racial discrimination he saw 
but there he first became interested in martin luther king jr 
and the methods of resistance he advocated ms nye said 
this was reinforced by his education at a mennonite school 
she said he participated in antiwar demonstrations in america 
and from there it was just a natural progression 
awad taught for several years then in 1970 he returned to 
united states to study at bluffton college a mennonite school in 
bluffton ohio 
later he earned a masters degree in counseling from st 
francis college a catholic institution in fort wayne ind and a 
doctorate from the international graduate school in st louis 
in january 1978 he launched the ohio youth advocate program 
which offered community service programs for troubled youths 
awad returned to jerusalem in 1983 and two years later founded 
the palestinian center for nonviolence he lectured on civil 
disobedience counseled teachers against corporal punishment and 
planted olive trees in west bank villages to underscore the arabs 
claim to the land

president reagans nominee for a california 
judgeship was accused at a senate hearing monday of keeping 
property liens hanging over a dying man in a lawsuit filed by 
the us olympic committee 
vaughn r walker nominated for a us district court judgeship 
for northern california sharply disagreed with the statement by 
the attorney who opposed him in the trademark infringement case 
walker told the senate judiciary committee at his confirmation 
hearing there was nothing malicious in his representation of 
the usoc against the late tom waddell an aids victim who spent the 
last years of his life trying to organize athletic games he wanted 
to call the gay olympics 
the nominee was among 13 current or former judicial candidates 
listed by sen strom thurmond rsc as victims of a democratic 
plot to delay reagans judgeship nominees in the waning days of his 
administration 
sen patrick j leahy dvt who presided at the hearing said 
many of the delays were caused by the justice departments 
tardiness in responding to committee information requests on 
nominees 
other delays resulted because democrats wanted to investigate 
nominees thoroughly before they are given a lifetime charter to 
sit in judgment on the rights and liberties of the american people 
not afterwards leahy said 
there were two major issues in walkers nomination his 
membership in san franciscos olympic club which has few black 
members and does not allow its female members to vote and his 
conduct in representing the olympic committee a case in which the 
supreme court eventually ruled the usoc had exclusive use of the 
olympic name and the gay organization could not use it 
walker said he has been working from within to get the olympic 
club to change its policies with some recent success 
he promised to resign if current efforts to recruit minorities 
and allow full voting rights to women become stalled supreme court 
justice anthony kennedy resigned from the same club because he 
disagreed with the policies toward minorities and women 
in the olympic case walker was retained by the usoc in 1984 to 
prevent use of the gay olympics name a us district judge 
ordered that waddell a former us olympic decathlon athlete 
and a gay organization were liable for 96000 in attorneys fees 
and walker slapped liens against waddells home and other property 
in an effort to collect the money 
the liens were not removed until six days after waddells death 
due to aids in july 1987 
walker defended his actions saying a federal appellate court 
ruling in the case automatically dissolved the liens but the 
attorney for waddell mary dunlap told the committee that she and 
waddells estate lawyer were unable to get the liens removed 
without walkers agreement which he refused to give 
she said walker left the liens hanging over a dying man at the 
time he needed to know his daughter would inherit his estate 
ms dunlap contended that walker misrepresented the facts to 
the committee by telling senators that she had done nothing to 
obtain an order removing the liens ms dunlap said that she and 
waddells estate lawyer repeatedly tried without success to get 
walker to sign a release 
walker has drawn opposition from san franciscos gay community 
and the citys board of supervisors which voted unanimously 
against the nomination his main supporter republican sen pete 
wilson of california told the committee 
what principle of american jurisprudence is more fundamental 
than that due process of the law requires that however unpopular a 
client that client and that clients cause of action are entitled 
to be represented by competent counsel 
walker used similar language in defending himself telling 
leahy i was perfectly aware of how unpopular the position was 
but he added that the committee should be looking for judicial 
candidates willing to take stands that are legally correct 
even though they may be unpopular 
walker said the olympic committee held firm on the lien adding 
it did so in the hope that the gay organization working with 
waddell san francisco arts and athletics would raise the money 
for the attorney fees 
the client made the decision it had the right to recover the 
cost of the suit that was a perfectly legitimate decision on their 
part walker said adding i was not at liberty to go against 
his client 
he added that in his opinion the liens were ineffective after 
the court of appeals judgment which vacated them 
if that were so leahy asked why didnt you sign the 
release 
the client wanted to pursue it walker said

since shortly before the moscow summit that ended last week the 
soviets have been warning pakistan and the united states that 
continuing to arm the guerrillas violated the accords signed in 
geneva on may 15 
under those accords the kremlin agreed to withdraw its 100300 
troops from afghanistan by feb 15 western intelligence agencies 
put the number of soviet forces involved as up to 115000 
gorbachev did not issue any warnings about afghanistan during 
the summit said us officials who predicted then that the 
soviets would complete the withdrawal 
thousands of soviet troops already have returned home 
us officials rejected soviet complaints about aid still 
flowing to the moslem rebels noting an exchange of letters between 
us secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze that each side would arm its afghan 
allies as long as the other did so 
a joint najibgorbachev statement distributed over the official 
tass news agency said the soviet union and afghanistan believed 
that the un mission monitoring compliance with the geneva accords 
would adopt effective measures to curb the practice of 
pakistans aiding the guerrillas which if continued would make it 
necessary to undertake the most resolute retaliatory steps 
shevardnadze had made a similar warning after meeting with najib 
and foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov lashed out 
against pakistan for maintaining what he called an infrastructure 
of interference military camps training centers for the armed 
groups of the opposition all manner of subversive terroristic 
groups on pakistani territory 
he also attacked a white house statement that he said tried to 
justify pakistans continued supply of arms to the rebels saying 
the kremlin rejected a us proposal for mutual termination of aid 
the soviet union never agreed to its military aid to the 
legitimate government in the republic of afghanistan being linked 
in any form with arms supplies to the insurgent illegal groups 
which bank on the forcible overthrow of the government the 
statement said

antismoking forces hailed a federal jurys 
decision monday to hold a cigarette company partially responsible 
for the death of a smoker but analysts discounted any longterm 
impact for the industry 
mighty casey has struck out said dr alan blum a teacher 
at the baylor college of medicine in houston who founded the 
antismoking group doctors oughta care 
however because the jury did not find the tobacco industry 
conspired to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking 
analysts said the verdict could be considered a victory for the 35 
billion tobacco industry 
i think its probably the secondbest decision they could have 
hoped for said analyst lawrence pidgeon of goldman sachs amp co 
in new york 
the decision in the case of rose cipollone who died of lung 
cancer after 40 years of smoking exonerated the liggett group 
inc lorillard inc and philip morris inc of conspiracy 
the jury did find that liggett failed to warn the public about 
the dangers of smoking and violated its promise to consumers to 
make a safe product contributing to mrs cipollones illness 
the jury awarded 400000 in damages to widower antonio 
cipollone from liggett which faced separate charges because it 
made the brand of cigarettes mrs cipollone smoked before congress 
required health warnings on cigarette packs in 1966 liggett has 
promised an appeal 
its bittersweet for cipollones attorneys since they won but 
it wasnt necessarily on the charges they wanted or for they amount 
they wanted said pidgeon 
the two companies that were exonerated have a bit of breathing 
room while obviously for liggett its quite serious he 
added 
financial markets were closed when the jury made its decision 
but allan kaplan a merrill lynch tobacco analyst said he expects 
only shortterm damage to industry stocks 
its a loss but not a major loss kaplan said the only 
way this would be considered a negative is if the award made it 
exciting for other law firms to sue i dont think that 
happened 
he said stocks might drop early tuesday but would probably 
rebound during the day 
jefferies group inc which specializes in stock trading when 
the exchanges are closed did not handle any tobacco stock 
transactions after the ruling although there were many calls for 
information trading assistant maureen oconnor said 
weve had a lot of inquiries but everybodys trying to assess 
the news ms oconnor said the only offer was a bid of 80 per 
share with the buyer seeking to sell at 84 a share she said 
the tobacco companies waged an expensive defense the cost has 
been been put at 50 million by one industry analyst because they 
feared a loss in the case could open the way for many more 
liability suits 
the verdict marks the first time a jury has found any degree of 
liability but antismoking forces and tobacco industry 
representatives indicted it was not the clear victory for which 
both sides were hoping 
philip morris attorney peter bleakley said he thought the 
verdict represented a compromise on the part of the jury i think 
they had a holdout he speculated 
the jurors one smoker two who quit and three who never smoked 
would not comment on the case 
liggett attorney james kearney said he was very pleased by the 
verdict and thought it would discourage further liability suits 
the jury specifically rejected any claims of damages he 
said the flood gates have been closed even firmer than they were 
before 
marc z edell the attorney for cipollone said he saw a partial 
victory in the jurys conclusion that that the cigarette 
companies should have warned people as early as the 1940s about the 
health hazards of cigarette smoking 
richard daynard whose tobacco products liability project in 
boston supports lawsuits against the industry went further 
its the first time tobacco companies have been held 
accountable for the death and diseases their products cause its a 
tremendous victory ive been waiting four years to say something 
like that i think it will be a tremendous encouragement to 
plaintiffs and plaintiffs attorneys to say you can do it 
this could be the beginning of the end for tobacco 
companies added john f banzhaf a george washington unversity 
law professor who directs an antismoking group 
john j madigan jr director of government relations for the 
american cancer society in washington called the verdict the 
opening salvo in what will probably be a long battle 
rep henry a waxman dcalif the chairman of a house 
subcommittee that has scheduled hearings for july on possible 
federal regulation of the sale and promotion of tobacco said the 
jurys decision represents a signifcant and long overdue 
breakthrough 
this crack in the tobacco industrys liability armor will have 
implications far beyond the specifics of this case he said

scattered thunderstorms increased and intensified rapidly monday 
afternoon over the foothills of the central rockies and into the 
central high plains but a drought continued in northern illinois 
and caused fires in michigan 
most of the thunderstorms were over colorado and eastern wyoming 
hail two inches in diameter occurred early wednesday afternoon 
about 20 miles southeast of denver small hail was reported at 
laramie wyo 
a severe thunderstorm watch was in effect until monday evening 
for a large part of southeast wyoming and eastern colorado and a 
small part of the nebraska panhandle while showers and 
thunderstorms over minnesota and northern iowa diminished 
thunderstorms were widely scattered over coastal sections of 
southeast florida louisiana and texas 
the drought which has withered lawns and crops and caused 
watering bans across northern illinois entered its 20th day 
since may 24 no measureable rain has fallen over chicago the 
longest such period for this time of the year the only year that 
comes close to the current dry spell was in 1886 when a tenth of 
an inch fell from may 24 to june 12 
compounding the problem is that rainfall across northern 
illinois was much below normal throughout april and may as well 
wind and dry conditions fueled a fire that burned through 
thousands of acres of a rural michigan area monday as more than 100 
firefighters fought to contain it officials were helping evacuate 
an undetermined number of people whose houses lie in its path 
elsewhere in michigan monday hot weather continued breaking or

readings across new england were in the upper 80s to lower 90s 
much of the remainder of the eastern half of the nation had 
temperatures about 90 degrees but with low relative humidities 
the low humidity helps to keep the air feel reasonably 
comfortable but the downside is that it is maintaining the dry 
weather plaguing portions of the midwest and the southeast 
cloudiness and spotty light rain kept temperatures across 
montana on the cool side afternoon readings were mostly in the 50s 
to lower 60s 
west of the rockies sunshine and mild temperatures prevailed

lake tahoe calif 
the national weather service forecast scattered showers and 
thunderstorms extending from the upper mississippi valley across

plains to eastern colorado thunderstorms were predicted to be most 
numerous over north dakota and northern minnesota scattered 
showers were expected over northern maine and showers and 
thunderstorms should continue over central and southern florida 
high temperatures were forecast for the 80s to mid90s over much

the military government said monday it 
will execute anyone convicted of involvement in dumping foreign 
toxic waste in nigeria 
duro onabule spokesman for president ibrahim babangida said 
the death penalty also might apply to foreigners connected with the 
dumping of more than 2000 tons of chemical waste near the town of 
koko including poisonous and radioactive material koko is 150 
miles southeast of lagos capital of this west african nation 
prince tony momoh the information minister said at a separate 
news conference that 15 people had been arrested in the koko 
dumping he did not identify them but said an italian who directed 
the operation gianfranco raffaelli fled the country after 
newspapers reported the dumping 
there will be no mercy on this issue onabule told 
reporters we would rather do away with 20 nigerians stupid 
nigerians than allow them to endanger the lives of millions of 
nigerians and fellow africans 
he said the government seized the land on which the waste was 
dumped 
last friday the government said it had seized an italian ship 
that would be forced to remove the waste and recalled its 
ambassador from italy an italian firm was accused of dumping the 
waste for european companies 
police guarding the site in bendel state were withdrawn sunday 
for their own safety the nes agency of nigeria reported it said 
confirmation by chemists that the waste included poisonous 
substances prompted removal of the policemen who had been 
stationed around the site to keep the public away 
scientists urged anyone who had been near the site to have a 
medical examination 
attempts by european and american companies to dump toxic waste 
in west africa have provoked protests in recent weeks 
five congolese including three senior government officials 
were arrested after a dumping scheme was discovered there guinea 
arrested a norwegian businessman and charged him with complicity in 
dumping american waste on an island near the capital conakry 
several other countries said they had refused lucrative offers 
from western companies seeking permission to dump chemical waste

a district attorney has asked for more 
information in his examination of a us request for extradition of 
a palestinian accused in the bombings of two american jetliners 
judicial sources said monday 
they said the request for mohammed rashids extradition wasnt 
backed by hard enough evidence that would support opening 
extradition proceedings 
district attorney elias spyropoulos who is handling the case 
told us authorities greek law sets a twomonth time limit for 
providing needed information in extradition requests according to 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified 
what the americans have so far provided wont do and if the 
additional evidence hasnt landed on the district attorneys two 
months from now the proceedings cant be pursued one source 
said 
state department spokesman charles redman said in washington on 
monday that the united states asked greece for the immediate 
extradition of rashid a palestinian terrorist wanted in 
connection with the august 1982 explosion aboard a pan american 
world airways passenger jet in hawaii the blast killed one person 
and wounded 15 
redman said the united states was heartened by the greek 
governments june 7 statement saying it was dedicated to the 
international fight against terrorism 
we strongly believe that the most effective way to fight 
terrorism in this case is to expeditiously begin extradition 
proceedings against rashid he added 
it was the first time the reagan administration publicly 
acknowledged it was seeking rashid 34 american officials admitted 
privately last week that they were seeking rashids extradition but 
declined to make the case public citing the delicacy of the 
negotiations 
rashid was arrested at the athens airport june 1 by greek police 
acting on information from the united states according to police 
us officials said last week rashid also is wanted in 
connection with a 1986 explosion aboard a trans world airlines 
plane flying over greece in which four people were killed redman 
did not mention that case in his brief statement on rashid 
the us decision to publicly comment on the case came after a 
greek security official in athens said earlier monday that greece 
would try rashid on the charge of using a false syrian passport to 
enter the country 
if convicted on that count rashid could be given a jail term of 
1 to two years to be served before an extradition hearing took 
place said the security official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
government spokesman yiannis roubatis declined to comment on the 
case 
greece has followed a similar procedure in delaying extradition 
proceedings until a suspect served a misdemeanor sentence 
a jordanian arrested at the greekturkish border in 1982 is 
still awaiting extradition to italy where he is wanted for 
allegedly plotting an attack at a rome synagogue that killed a boy 
the jordanian abdel osama alzomor served a 20month sentence 
for smuggling explosives before the extradition request was heard 
although the request eventually was approved by the supreme court 
alzomor was sentenced again for being found in possession of an 
illegal weapon in his prison cell and remains in greece 
premier andreas papandreous socialist government which has 
good relations with the palestine liberation organization has been 
accused of being lax in fighting terrorism

a draft report for the energy department 
released monday appears to favor a south carolina plant over the 
hanford nuclear reservation in washington state for development of 
a new defense production reactor two senators said 
sen brock adams dwash an opponent of converting the 
mothballed washington public power supply system no 1 nuclear 
reactor to defense use said the report recommends against such a 
conversion 
the report released by an advisory panel to does energy 
research advisory board seems to favor the savannah river plant in 
aiken sc for the new production reactor adams said 
the proposed reactor would replace three savannah river plants 
that now produce tritium for defense use tritium a radioactive 
isotope of hydrogen is a key ingredient in nuclear weapons it 
decays relatively rapidly and so needs to be constantly replenished 
sen strom thurmond rsc said the report favored savannah 
river because its current reactor technology heavy water was 
chosen as the best type for producing nuclear weapons materials 
however an executive summary of the report said each of the 
reactor types considered can meet the mission requirements of a new 
production reactor with varying degrees of risk as to cost and 
schedule heavy water is the most mature technology others 
would require some research and development 
the heavy water option is limited to defense use and could 
win favor by clearly separating defense missions from civilian 
use the report said 
the technology for recovering tritium from a converted wppss 
reactor does not exist according to the report 
the doe report said adams says what i have said many times 
if we need to produce tritium we should build a special reactor 
designed for that purpose 
while these reports are preliminary they only confirm my 
belief that conversion of wppss no 1 is the wrong option and 
should not be pursued adams said 
but sen daniel j evans rwash a supporter of wppss 
conversion said the reports conclusions were by no means 
final 
evans said four of the advisory boards subcommittees are 
discussing possible technology for the reactor 
each subcommittee is inclined to sing the praises of its 
particular nuclear reactor technology its premature to speculate 
about the final decision evans said

chinese officials from 22 provinces and municipalities 
the us embassys commercial officer dennis barnes said it 
will be the first time so many smaller us companies visit china

insufficient say over personnel matters 
the event is sponsored by the china association of science and 
technology and peopletopeople international a spokane wash

rapid economic development the government has encouraged 
moredeveloped coastal areas in particular to set up

israel on monday deported arabamerican 
mubarak awad an advocate of nonviolent resistance to israels 
occupation he flashed a defiant victory sign before police hustled 
him aboard a plane that flew him to new york 
in the occupied west bank troops carrying out a predawn search 
in an isolated mountain village fatally shot a nearly deaf arab man 
after he ignored orders to halt hospital officials and villagers 
said 
israeli leaders called for tougher measures including 
shoottokill orders against arabs throwing firebombs and setting 
fires to israels pastures and scarce forests 
more than 2500 acres were scorched in weekend blazes and 
officials blamed most of the fires on arab arsonists american 
donors have planted 20 million trees in israeli national parks

played a key role in organizing te uprising shamir on monday 
rejected us condemnation of the order saying if the united 
states were confronted with a similar case the person would be 
expelled immediately with no second thoughts 
we think it is unjustifiable to deny mr awad the right to 
stay and live in jerusalem where he was born white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday if he acted illegally he 
should have been charged and tried in court with full due process 
of law he should not have been deported 
awad denied inciting violence against israel but has supported 
the uprising in the territories that israel captured in the 1967 
middle east war although he has little influence in the 
palestinian community some tactics he advocates such as tax 
boycotts were adopted by uprising leaders 
about a dozen israelis gathered at an airport gate to protest 
awads deportation unfurling banners and holding flowers one 
banner read mubarak next year in jerusalem a reference to a 
traditional saying of jews living outside israel police 
immediately confiscated the banners

fatally shot in the head after he ignored soldiers orders to halt

telephone interview that hussein was hard of hearing and probably 
never heard the order sami said hussein was killed during a search

circumstances 
hussein was the 207th palestinian killed in the uprising two

working for the military government resign 
after a weekend marred by an upsurge in arab violence including 
a firebomb attack in tel avivs main mall israeli leaders promised 
retaliation 
shamir told the daily haaretz he would introduce legislation to 
jail arsonists for up to 15 years 
we must put an end to this industry minister ariel sharon 
said on israel radio those who throw firebombs must be shot with 
the intention to kill they must be warned these are the steps 
the army is going to take 
defense minister yitzhak rabin told a closeddoor cabinet 
session he had authorized israeli civilians to shoot at arabs

at least 350 trade unionists were 
killed and 7500 arrested worldwide during 1987 the international 
confederation of free trade unions said in a report released 
tuesday 
despite improvements in some countries the overall picture 
remains grim the icftu said in its annual survey of antiunion 
violence 
there is a tendency among governments to consider respect for 
trade union rights as less important than certain other human 
rights it said 
the rights violations occurred in both dictatorships and 
democracies according to the brusselsbased icftu which has 141 
affiliates in 97 noncommunist nations and claims it represents 87 
million workers 
its 58page report said violations last year of union rights 
ranged from denying the right of association to murder torture 
and imprisonment 
the icftu report said latin american unionists faced the most 
ruthless treatment 
it said that in brazil more than 200 killings occurred 
related to disputes over landownership many of which concerned 
leaders and members of the national confederation of agricultural 
workers 
there is evidence most of the victims were slain by killers 
hired by landowners according to the report 
in colombia paramilitary groups killed at least 74 trade 
unionists and the real figure is probably much higher it said 
the report stated the most flagrant trade union rights 
violations are undoubtedly taking place in countries under 
dictatorship irrespective of their ideological orientation 
however in many countries even those with long established 
democratic traditions there are also restrictions and 
infringements of these rights 
the icftu said laws in britain and canada undermined the rights 
of trade unions and in the united states serious cases of 
unionbusting continue to occur 
it gave this summary 
africa in most nations unions are controlled by the parties 
in power that forbid rivals ban or curb the right to strike and 
interfere with the organization of union activities in ethiopia 
the trade union movement must by law follow marxist theory and 
south africa totally negates fundamental human rights 
latin america infringements of trade union rights continue 
to occur on a wide scale chile el salvador honduras guatemala 
and haiti among others continue to violently suppress union 
activities in nicaragua the human rights situation generally 
has improved but specific violations of trade union rights 
continue to occur including detention without trial and 
persecution of union members 
asia in communist nations freedom of association free 
collective bargaining and the right to strike do not exist 
anticommunist south korea used extreme police violence against 
strikers 
europe the introduction of economic reforms in some east 
european nations did not boost trade union rights in poland the 
courts rejected more than 30 applications for recognition by 
local enterprise sections belonging to the outlawed solidarity 
union federation romanian police broke up a demonstration of union 
workers in november 
in britain the most outrageous attack on basic trade union 
rights in recent years continues to be the ban on union 
membership in the governments intelligence gathering center at 
cheltenham 
middle east some arab nations allow only a single trade union 
and in others such as bahrain saudi arabia oman and qatar trade 
unions are banned 
emergency regulations remain in force in turkey to restrict 
human and trade union rights the report said

the federal government must cooperate with 
cities in combating drug abuse through military interdiction law 
enforcement treatment and education mayors said monday 
the 56th annual conference of mayors approved a sweeping 
platform calling for federalization of the war against drug abuse 
we are turning into a banana republic new york mayor edward 
i koch told the mayors at a luncheon session this country today 
is swimming in drugs 
koch said cities and states can no longer effectively battle 
drug dealing and use he called for a national drug czar to 
coordinate federal efforts with local jurisdictions 
the enemy as of this moment is drugs koch said the 
russians didnt come yesterday they didnt come today and i hope 
they wont come tomorrow but drug dealers did 
koch disagreed with mayors who have called for a cabinetlevel 
secretary of public safety saying such a post could lead to a 
national police force however he said drug offenders and dealers 
should be prosecuted under strict federal laws 
the platform approved by the mayors called for the president to 
outline a national strategy for waging war on drugs more money to 
finance the coast guards drug interdiction efforts and 
legislation that would send much more federal money to local 
jurisdictions for drug enforcement treatment and education 
virtually all 175 mayors attending the conference approved the 
platform said conference spokesman mike brown koch was the only 
mayor to address the session on drugs 
adm paul a yost jr commander of the coast guard said drug 
interdiction is the services top priority but budget cuts have 
forced it to scale back by 55 percent the ships and personnel used 
to intercept illegal drug shipments 
that i think is an outrage he said 
yost said he supports military involvement in the drug war but 
disagrees the responsibility should be turned over to the defense 
department instead the coast guard and us customs service 
should be charged with planning and executing interdiction efforts 
he said

you viewers who never understood why friends 
and coworkers were mad for a tv villain can catch up beginning 
wednesday when cbs reruns the wiseguy episodes gueststarring 
ray sharkey as mobster sonny steelgrave 
wiseguy stars ken wahl as undercover agent vinnie terranova 
who was himself so charmed by steelgrave he almost went over to the 
other side he has since gone on to chase new villains 
this is a whole new way to do television said sharkey 
you can get actors who do mostly movies because youve got a 
story with a beginning middle and end it runs longer than a 
miniseries and you can develop a character ive heard someone 
refer to this as a soap opera for tough guys 
but i wont be back on wiseguy next season im history the 
only way i could come back is in a flashback we may do that weve 
gotten so many letters asking for me that i think we should give 
them something theres even a sonny steelgrave memorial society 
they write us each week asking us to bring back sonny 
though the steelgrave episodes that opened wiseguy last fall 
attracted a following the show was up against nbcs cheers and 
night court on thursday night and didnt get big ratings cbs 
is hoping that will change if a new audience catches the show this 
summer wednesdays episode is the twohour movie that introduced 
the character 
sharkeys portrayal of steelgrave with his murderous mercurial 
charm has been likened to james cagneys cody jarrett in white 
heat or humphrey bogarts duke mantee in the petrified 
forest and mad dog earle in high sierra sonnys apocalypse 
is nearly as spectacular as cagneys in the gasoline refinery in 
white heat 
i meet people who memorize sonnys dialogue and say it back to 
me said sharkey just like the rocky horror show 
the role in wiseguy was a muchneeded boost for sharkey he 
had made a big splash playing an ambitious manager in the 
idolmaker in 1980 but his career dissolved into alcohol and 
drugs 
i went at it fullblown he said it was fun for a while 
then it got crazy and by 1985 it was sickening i lost great parts 
to guys who became big stars i couldnt get insured id turn in 
my urine tests knowing i would never pass 
i spent several years in and out of hospitals id dry out do 
a movie and end up back in the hospital i finally found a place 
that dealt with the problem and not the personalities i spent 62 
days there came out and went right to work 
he was only four days out of the rehabilitation program when he 
began the role on wiseguy 
he is currently starring as a puerto rican angel in wired 
based on the controversial bob woodward book about john belushi 
who died of a drug overdose the angel is a fantasy element added 
to the movie sharkey says its like playing the dark side of 
its a wonderful life 
the angel picks up belushi at the morgue and shows him the 
error of his ways 
its great sharkey said because he gets in all the blues 
brothers dance numbers and the saturday night live comedy 
sketches 
in august sharkey is set to costar with jacqueline bisset in 
the romantic comedy scenes from a class struggle in beverly 
hills in september he is slated to play attorney roy cohn the 
former aide to sen joseph mccarthy who died of aids 
after finishing the wiseguy shooting in vancouver canada 
sharkey went to greece and africa for the movie act of piracy 
playing a really bad guy a gun smuggler and modernday pirate in 
the caribbean those guysll kill your whole family and take your 
boat to run guns or drugs 
sonnys different he was a man who could carry out his own 
brand of ethics he did it with such charm and lack of guilt and 
i think the audience likes to see bad boys having fun sonny was a 
man who was very familyoriented his attitude was dont judge me 
by what i do for a living

murphys law may never be abolished but it 
appears to have been at least temporarily suspended for the benefit 
of the us economy 
the proposition that whatever can go wrong will go wrong 
seemed an apt one for followers of economic affairs over the past 
couple of decades 
recessions alternated with outbursts of inflation until the two 
evils finally came together in a phenomenon that was dubbed 
stagflation 
when a long period of growth finally arrived in the 1980s it 
had to be financed with huge deficits in the federal budget and 
international trade then the stock market crashed 
but in 1988 for a change the surprises have been almost 
entirely on the positive side as midyear approaches there is 
little sign of any of the woes that many pundits were forecasting 
at new years 
when the year began it appeared that the challenges facing 
the global economy would prove too difficult to overcome without a 
serious slowdown if not an outright recession observed david 
resler chief economist at the investment firm of nomura securities 
international inc 
avoiding that unhappy outcome would require robust growth in 
foreign demand for american goods plus an adequate expansion of 
manufacturing capacity so that both foreign and domestic demands 
could be satisfied at reasonably stable prices 
in addition resler said consumer spending would need to 
increase only moderately so that the additional savings needed to 
replace diminished foreign capital flows would be forthcoming 
there were few optimists about the prospects of meeting those 
lofty goals but the facts now seem to indicate that the us 
economy is getting just that mix of growth 
the big surprise of course is that things have gone as well as 
they have in the wake of the biggest stock market drop ever last 
oct 19 
the collective vision of stock investors and traders is supposed 
to be pretty sharp when the market takes a big dive government 
policymakers business planners and lots of other people pay close 
attention 
but eight months after the fact whatever calamity the crash 
might have been foretelling has yet to make its presence felt 
outside the securities industry itself 
the manufacturing economy is enjoying a boom in exports and 
consumers havent gone into hiding 
in fact the passage of time has given increasing credence to 
the strange idea first advanced by a few observers in the midst of 
the commotion in october that the crash actually was a beneficial 
event in some significant ways 
economic performance during the first half of 1988 got a 
helping hand from the stockmarket plunge last october 
economists at merrill lynch say in a justissued report 
that event jolted financial markets and the financial sector 
is still shaky but the liquefication of financial markets that 
occurred after oct 19 and the resulting decline in interest rates 
supported real economic activity as 1988 began 
even though shortterm rates are back to where they were in 
september 1987 interestratesensitive sectors particularly 
housing and consumer spending are stronger than they would have 
been had rates not declined earlier 
dont be fooled by all this say the pessimists if the alarms 
sounded by the crash for the federal budget and the machinery of 
the markets themselves continue to go unheeded they warn more big 
trouble is likely 
whats more they add murphys law applies particularly when 
people get comfortable and complacent and think the times are going 
well 
still it may be possible without tempting fate to add a new 
corollary to murphys law for economic purposes every once in a 
while unaccountably and when least expected something will go 
right

this sleepy backlands town has hopes of 
becoming less poor than it is because historians have found a 19th 
century uprising here to be highly significant in the study of 
social dissent 
brazilians have come to call canudos uprising of 1897 a 
communiststyle revolution 20 years before the russians had theirs 
but the brazilian army and police crushed the uprising here with 
bloody force 
an army of peasants led by a messianic preacher rose up against 
the government the army and the roman catholic church at least 
15000 rebels died in combat or were massacred by soldiers 
now historians and scientists from the united states portugal 
and brazil plan to restore part of the original peasant settlement 
and battleground and build a center to study the towns past and 
its place in the social history of the droughtplagued and 
impoverished brazilian northeast 
canudos really scared brazil said robert levine head of 
the history department at the university of miami in florida and a 
collaborator on the canudos restoration project said in a 
telephone interview it awakened brazilians to their own internal 
reality of backwardness and rural poverty and raised questions 
whether the country would advance the modernist movement after 
1910 had roots there 
the restoration project calls for a 6263acre canudos park and 
possibly a living museum 
plans also call for a community action program to stimulate 
local arts and crafts and to improve health and education in one of 
latin americas poorest regions 
this is important for us said acting mayor joao ribeiro 
gama we dont have a lot except for our history but almost 
anywhere you dig with a piece of stick you find bones 
in the 1890s canudos was a farming colony that once supported 
25000 people today it seems barely inhabitable 
it is 1200 miles northeast of rio de janeiro on the edge of a 
region so desolate that it was for years a hideout for outlaws and 
more recently a proposed dump site for brazils nuclear waste 
the main street is a dirt road that begins and ends ends where 
the town begins and ends giving way to scrubcovered red plains 
stretching to the horizon the nearest paved road is in uaua 32 
miles away 
most of the towns 12000 residents now raise goats or work on 
government projects during the chronic droughts of the northeast 
but on a rise overlooking the town is a reminder of its past 
the bulletriddled wooden cross erected by preacher antonio 
conselheiro at the original settlement 
antonio conselheiro which means anthony the counselor in 
brazils portuguese language was a lawyer who roamed the wild 
northeastern interior preaching frugality and chastity before 
settling here in 1893 with a long gray beard and dark robes he 
looked and sounded like a biblical prophet 
folks used to call him the good jesus recalled joao 
cardoso da silva who says his age is something over 100 and is 
by consensus the areas oldest living resident i was just a boy 
of 10 at the time but an uncle and a grandfather of mine left home 
to follow him 
antonio conselheiro set up a commune on an abandoned farm and 
established strict rules no private property no paper money no 
outside work 
later he became more militant and preached tax revolt and civil 
disobedience 
some say he really was a land reformer or an early 
communist archaeologist yara de ataide of bahia state 
university the coordinator of the canudos project said in an 
interview in salvador bahias capital 
peasants came from miles around to follow the new messiah and 
canudos grew from a tiny hamlet to bahias second largest community 
after salvador on the coast but the catholic church and the 
government worried about antonios growing influence and the army 
was sent to break up his commune 
however the illequipped bands of peasants fighting on terrain 
they knew well ambushed and routed three army expeditions and 
canudos became a national embarassment for the government 
finally a fourth expedition of about 10000 soldiers and police 
surrounded canudos and decimated the settlement during a 
threemonth siege on oct 5 1897 troops invaded the commune and 
slaughtered the final holdouts 
my greataunt was there and managed to escape she used to 
tell us kids how the soldiers cut off heads and the blood ran 
ankledeep in the streets said maria dos santos who runs the 
brasil hotel and boarding house in canudos 
despite its impact little has been written about the rebellion 
few outside of latin american scholars know about the canudos war 
the best account was rebellion in the backlands by euclydes 
da cunha who covered the uprising as a reporter for the brazilian 
newspaper o estado de sao paulo in 1984 the peruvian novelist 
mario vargas llosa published the war of the end of the world 
based on the rebellion 
but the government was less than eager to preserve the memory of 
canudos one reason was that the issues it raised land reform 
rural guerrilla warfare religious militants 
canudos became a model for social revolution and resistance to 
central authority said ms ataide of bahia state university 
after the fighting the settlement was burned and razed later a 
dam was built on the vaza barris river below canudos and most of 
the commune was flooded by the reservoir it created 
but the towns past wont go away 
luiz carlos lopes de magalhaes a mapmaker with the historic 
project walked through a seemingly trackless plain in the area 
known as the valley of death he knelt by a ring of stones and 
pointed to a partly exposed skull which had a jagged hole in the 
forehead 
this probably was a soldier he said they came here after 
the ambush to be treated or die there are rusty canteens and 
ammunition clips all around here 
magalhaes thinks antonio conselheiro got a raw deal from history 
they make him sound like a fanatic but a lot of people here 
think he was just trying to help the poor he said 
levine of miami university maintains that portraying antonio 
conselheiro as a communist or a land reformer misses the mark 
he was more like an ayatollah khomeini or a jim jones of the 
peoples temple in guyana an austere devout unworldly chaplain 
who tried to follow the precepts of the catholic church by 
withdrawing from the world he said 
canudos is important to understanding the background of social 
dissent we need to study it in relation to other events in the 
world like the rise of fundamentalism in the mideast

editors note unhurriedly and with caution determined to 
avoid the flaws that contributed to the challenger disaster nasa 
is moving toward the resumption of shuttle flights later this 
summer this time a veteran shuttle pilot will be a launch czar and 
a host of other changes have been made in hardware and procedure to 
minimize risk 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on that cold day jan 28 1986 any 
one of half a dozen officials aware that the weather might be 
damaging could have halted the launch of space shuttle challenger 
but none did and 73 seconds after liftoff the spaceship and its 
crew of seven were destroyed in a fiery explosion 
never again nasa says will the launch decision be so flawed 
the rules have been changed and when discovery resumes shuttle 
flights this summer one man will have the authority to command a 
launch or to scrub it 
he will look to many experts analyzing every scrap of 
information for help but in the end the decision to launch will 
be his 
that responsibility lies with robert l crippen a 50yearold 
navy captain who has gone into space more often on the shuttle than 
any other person he piloted the very first mission in 1981 and 
since has commanded three other flights 
i feel from my military training that there has to be one 
person in charge crippen said somebody needed to sign on for 
it and im willing to do it 
his fellow astronauts are delighted to have one of their own 
calling that critical shot 
rick hauck another navy captain who will command discovery on 
the first postchallenger mission said i flew my first mission 
with him in 1983 and i cant think of anyone who has more of a 
broad indepth knowledge of the whole shuttle system and hes a 
good thinker so bob is the right person to be there 
creation of a launch czar is just one of many changes introduced 
in the program as a result of the challenger disaster many have 
been timeconsuming and have led to delay after delay in getting 
the shuttle back into space 
some critics say nasa has been too conservative that it is 
delaying for any reason because it has lost the nerve to launch 
space agency officials heatedly deny this 
the no 1 priority for the us space program is to get the 
shuttle flying again but well not fly until we feel we are 
ready said rear adm richard truly associate administrator for 
space flight and nasas highest shuttle program official well 
never have a perfectly safe vehicle but well have one well have 
confidence in 
the most publicly visible shuttle changes have been in the 
overhaul of top nasa management all involved in the challenger 
launch decision have been replaced the solid fuel booster rocket 
blamed for the accident has been redesigned 
the rogers commission that investigated the explosion for 
president reagan said the direct cause was a small leak in a joint 
between segments of one of challengers two booster rockets flames 
shot past two synthetic rubber orings and touched off the 
explosion of the huge fuel tank 
the commission report said cold weather 36 degrees at liftoff 
time contributed by robbing the orings of their resiliency 
preventing them from sealing the joint properly some booster 
engineers had argued against launching in the cold but their 
concerns were blocked by lower level executives from reaching top 
managers 
while the shuttle fleet has been grounded nasa has made more 
than 80 modifications to the booster rockets and an additional 300 
to shuttle systems and support equipment the spaceship itself has 
undergone 210 changes including improvements to the engines 
structure brakes and landing gear and installation of a blowout 
hatch to the crew cabin and a telescoping pole the astronauts could 
slide down in an emergency landing 
thats a large number of changes and we are treating the 
flight as a new test flight of a vehicle thats not quite the 
same astronaut hauck said 
less visible are the changes in the approach to launching a 
shuttle 
items 
bob sieck happy to have only one job launch director instead 
of the multiple jobs he held as director of shuttle operations 
during challenger the launch decision process now is more 
formal more crisp and the responsibilities of the individuals are 
more welldefined he says 
eugene kranz director of shuttle mission operations at the 
johnson space center in houston overseeing an overhaul of flight 
design planning and training procedures to correct deficiencies 
that had nasa struggling to meet an accelerating flight rate as 
our schedules were becoming unmanageable at the time of the 
accident 
tommy holloway chief of the shuttle flight directors office 
in houston assembling a team of veterans to direct discoverys 
return to flight training a new generation for the higher flight 
rate ahead and streamlining documentation weather forecasting and 
other procedures we are a lot more safety conscious he says 
final preparation for liftoff begins about two weeks before the 
designated date when shuttle boss truly convenes a flight readiness 
review at the kennedy space center

the review crippen said will be much more thorough than those 
that preceded the last few shuttle launches because of the 
higher flight rate and other factors we had diverged from the high 
level of detail that it had started out to be he said 
following the review we will end up with action items he 
saidsome of these will be designated launch constraints meaning 
they have to be corrected and closed out before we can fly 
two days before the planned launch crippen will activate his 
newly created mission management team a group of 20 nasa and 
contractor managers skilled in all elements of the shuttle system 
we will look at all the changes that have occurred since the 
flight readiness review and we will report on the closure of the 
launch constraint items he said we will start looking at 
things like weather out of this meeting will come a decision on 
whether or not to start the launch countdown 
the management team will meet again the next day to review 
countdown progress and to decide whether to fuel the 
halfmilliongallon external fuel tank at three hours before 
liftoff the members will settle before consoles in a 
glassenclosed corner of the launch control center three miles 
from the launch pad 
nasas leaders will assemble in another glass enclosure on the 
other side of the control center called the operations management 
room here will be people like administrator james fletcher 
shuttle program director arnold aldrich truly field center 
directors the agency safety director and others the two groups 
will talk by intercom and telephone 
in the past the final ok to launch came from the senior 
management official present he nodded assent based on the 
recommendation of the launch director 
the operations management room will be a more businesslike 
place than were used to crippen said in the past you could 
say that if nobody showed up in that room you could have gone 
ahead and launched with the launch director making the decision 
now each person in that room just like those on my mission 
management team will have his own input into the launch decision 
if anyone has a concern he can bring it to me the lines of 
communication will be open to everyone anywhere in the system 
between the two glass cages launch director bob sieck and his 
launch controllers will be monitoring the countdown in touch with 
the astronauts aboard the shuttle and with the flight control 
center in houston 
sieck says its a luxury to be the launch director alone and not 
have to be saddled with the multiple assignments he had previously 
as director of shuttle operations at the kennedy space center 
crippen emphasizes the main responsibility for the countdown 
lies with the sieck crew 
they have preordained ground rules and launch commit 
criteria and we are there primarily to monitor and to handle the 
offnominal occurrence things that we were not smart enough to 
foresee he said 
a key moment will come at the nineminutebeforeliftoff mark in 
the count when a planned hold will be called at this point sieck 
will poll the members of the launch team to determine if there are 
any problems crippen will monitor conduct his own poll and then 
will make the decision whether to start the clock for the final 
count the vote must be 100 percent or we wont go ahead he 
said 
sieck said that during the challenger count the results of the 
poll all positive were relayed to the operations management room 
and the senior official there associate administrator jesse moore 
trulys predecessor said to proceed he and others in the room did 
not know of the cold weather worries of the rocket engineers 
as the launch team we would look to that room sieck said 
the program director was there the associate administrator was 
there the center directors were there but it was not clear as to 
the focus of the responsibility 
that shouldnt imply that the right discussions or the right 
communications did not occur but it wasnt specific and one of 
the rogers commission findings and recommendations was to improve 
the launch decision process 
because of the challenger accident and subsequent reviews of all 
systems sieck and his team will have more systems and subsystems 
to monitor more closely during the countdown 
we have added more launch commit criteria red lines as we 
call them sieck said weve added about 25 percent more 
instrumentation measurements theyre primarily in the highenergy 
systems in the main engines the auxiliary power units the fuel 
cell system and in the reactants 
because of the performance of these systems over 25 shuttle 
launches sieck said he did not expect the extra monitoring to make 
a launch postponement more likely 
but he said new weather restraints could cause delays 
the weather criteria are more conservative he said 
especially in the areas of potential severe weather and potential 
triggered lightning 
as an example when challenger was launched the rules said 
there could be no clouds or lightning within five miles of the 
launch pad or along the flight path that circle has now been 
increased to 10 miles 
intitially at least there will be no launch in temperatures 
below 55 degrees

visitors entering forrest s 
mccartneys office cant miss this sign if it isnt safe say 
so 
as director of the kennedy space center mccartney is overseeing 
the preparation of discovery for the first postchallenger space 
shuttle flight later this summer 
the sign sums up his approach if anyone anywhere in the 
system has a concern that person should report it 
id rather call a timeout to take a look at those concerns 
than to move on without checking thoroughly mccartney said in an 
interview i dont want anyone on launch day to say is there 
something i overlooked something i should have reported and 
didnt we want to be sure we have done everything humanly 
possible to make this vehicle as safe as it can be before it 
flies 
several workers have come forward with legitimate concerns 
other reports have proved unfounded and have caused processing 
delays mccartney says hed rather be safe than sorry 
mccartney 57 was a lieutenant general in charge of the air 
force space division when nasa administrator james c fletcher 
tapped him to be center director he was part of the space agency 
overhaul after the jan 28 1986 explosion of space shuttle 
challenger he retired last year from the air force and continued 
in the job as a civilian 
mccartney has gained a reputation as a handson director who 
takes a personal interest in his 13000 workers and the shuttle 
hardware that is checked out assembled and readied for launch here 
he pays close attention to the processing through daily staff 
meetings weekly sessions with center managers and monthly 
conferences with key nasa shuttle officials said 
i also get out and talk with the people mccartney says i 
want to know what they are thinking almost every day i personally 
check the hardware the orbiter the solid rocket motors if i get 
a free hour i say its time to go out and kick some tires so i 
get in the car and go out there 
the workers talk freely with me they discuss a full spectrum 
of concerns from processing concerns to work hours they dont 
feel intimidated its a good repartee and i feel good about it 
when he first took over as director nasas target for resuming 
shuttle flights was february 1988 that date has slipped several 
months and while the delays have been frustrating he says they 
have been necessary 
mccartney said the emphasis on quality and safety has created 
enormous paperwork or flight documentation as he calls it 
we close out flight documentation in an orderly way he 
said we are not going to move hardware to the next station until 
it is ready its timeconsuming but when in doubt dont no one 
is in a hurry to make a mistake

editors note floridas citrus groves severely damaged by 
freezes in 1983 and 1985 have rebounded and nearrecord crops are 
expected this season the problem is sales of orange juice and 
grapefruit are on the decline with many americans turning to other 
juices diluted products and soft drinks 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
americans are losing their taste for orange 
juice and the demand for fresh grapefruit has soured at a time when 
the florida groves are laden with a bumper crop 
and that has the billiondollar florida citrus industry worried 
worried enough to fight back with a proposed 72 million 
promotional campaign 
for the first time since such statistics have been kept retail 
sales of orange juice floridas premier citrus product have 
declined two years in a row so has the demand for grapefruit 
juice but thats not as serious since much less of the crop goes 
into juice 
orange juice is facing increased competition from other juices 
diluted products and soft drinks says dan gunter executive 
director of the florida citrus department 
image makers have some concerns about fresh fruit too 
fresh citrus products lack identity especially fresh 
grapefruit gunter told the florida citrus commission recently 
the department charged with the promotion and marketing of the 
states fresh and processed citrus products is proposing some 
hardhitting programs and increased budgets for the 198889 season 
merchandising and publicity campaigns are being mounted to try 
to convince people that orange juice is just as refreshing as any 
other beverage and probably much better for them 
we want to maintain orange juice as the gold standard of 
juices says the citrus departments marketing director bill 
gordon 
surveys show that the orange juice market share dropped 6 
percentage points from 1980 to 1987 while apple juice gained 6 
points orange juice sales are at 59 percent of the juice market 
with apple juice solidifying its hold on second place at 17 percent 
florida expects to produce 140 million 90pound boxes of oranges 
this season 90 percent of which will go into processed juices 
the current grapefruit crop is estimated at a near record 53 
million 85pound boxes with production expected to soar to about 
60 million boxes by the mid1990s most of the states export 
grapefruit is grown in the indian river section of the citrus belt 
excellent growing conditions ample rainfall early in the season 
and mild winter weather have resulted in outstanding crops since 
the 1983 and 1985 freezes which devastated the northern sections 
of the citrus belt 
there can be little doubt left that our industry is making a 
strong recovery from problems encountered earlier this decade 
gunter says 
the projected orange crop for this season would be the largest 
since the 198081 season when 172 million boxes were picked the 
fruit just kept right on growing says bob terry citrus 
statistician with the florida agricultural statistics service in 
orlando 
in the coming season the department wants to spend 394 
million to promote orange juice sales a 173 percent hike over the 
current 336 million 
the problem is rather more complicated with grapefruit fresh or 
otherwise since it is seen as dour and sour an unglamorous sort 
of lump for todays life styles 
a recent study shows that americans have quit spooning up the 
tarty fresh fruit by almost two pounds per capita since the 1970s 
some say it is no longer trendy and that nutritionconscious 
consumers have forgotten about it in favor of more glitzy and 
more heavily promoted products 
gunter and his crew want to develop an image and identity 
for fresh grapefruit in the modern world making it in computer 
terms more user friendly 
about half of the grapefruit crop is sold as fresh fruit 
for the even more difficult job of selling 100 percentpure 
grapefruit juice special tv commercials are being testmarketed in 
support of merchandising and public relations campaigns to explain 
the health benefits of grapefruit juice over other juices and 
beverages 
the commercials emphasize the unique cleantasting and 
invigorating attributes of the juice and are aimed primarily at 
women 2554 a category of steady users 
the proposed budget for promoting processed grapefruit juice is 
116 million up 621 percent from the 72 million being spent 
this season 
the departments proposed fresh fruit spending plan for 198889 
is 217 million an increase of 387 percent from the current 
157 million 
while the domestic demand for fresh florida grapefruit has 
declined the export markets have expanded dramatically over the 
past two seasons and overseas shipments are expected to set records 
in volume and value this year 
ive never seen the situation any better says grower jj 
parrish jr of titusville 
japan is by far the states best grapefruit customer importing 
almost 9 million cartons about 42 pounds each last season state 
citrus officials are working closely with american trade 
representatives trying to persuade japan to expand its quotas for 
the fruit 
the citrus department also plans a steppedup promotion campaign 
in other pacific rim countries and europe 
robert behr state director of economic and market research 
describes the problem this way 
the question is whether we can respond to these increases in 
production and help demand grow accordingly to absorb them

had not the writers guild of america walked out on march 7 the 
romantic dilemma might have been resolved before the end of the

godspell the joyous little pop musical that 
put the bible on broadway is back in town 
the show now playing at the lambs theater was directed by don 
scardino who has a long association with the hit musical he played 
jesus for more than 1000 performances during the shows sevenyear 
run in new york 
godspell based on the gospel of st matthew is one of 
those classic show business tales of success young man 
johnmichael tebelak writes show as a masters project at 
carnegie tech in pittsburgh show gets done on a shoestring in new 
york at a small experimental theater offoffbroadway gets 
favorable reviews a revised version with new songs by stephen 
schwartz opens at a larger offbroadway theater and eventually 
makes its way to broadway at one time during the 1970s there were 
30 companies of the musical playing around the world 
scardino first came to godspell in 1972 at the age of 24 he 
starred as jesus in the toronto company of the show and later came 
to new york for a twoyear run 
finally with shinsplints a sprained ankle and nodes on my 
vocal chords i gave up the ghost and left the show scardino 
says after it had been running five years offbroadway i was 
asked to open up the broadway company 
i was flattered so i wrapped ankles visited the throat 
doctor and went on says the director who started in show 
business at the age of 12 as an actor 
throughout its long run in the 1970s godspell a gentle 
freespirited retelling of the last seven days of jesus kept 
slowly changing 
the show became a little bloated and the simplicity 
disappeared scardino says unlike a regular show where someone 
directs it and the production stays that way johnmichael who 
died in 1985 was basically the overseer of this troupe of lunatic 
actors who had come out of an improvisatory style he encouraged 
the show to be flexible and free 
scardino agreed to direct the revival only after discussions 
with composer schwartz 
i wanted to stay true to the original intention of the show 
and still have the freedom to bring it up to date he says i 
wanted people to think they were watching the original the show 
they remembered even though it isnt 
besides changing the musicals prologue scardino updated a lot 
of other material in the show particularly the jokes and political 
references 
now there are jokes about jim and tammy bakker and the crisis in 
evangelism ronald reagan has also popped up as has the ubiquitous 
yuppie a section of the show that was spoken now has turned into a 
rap number 
weve brought it up to the 80s he says physically it 
looks the same as it did when it first opened but the idiom has 
been updated 
for the revival scardino hired young actors who had never done 
godspell before most had never seen it he has also used some 
of their suggestions they are authentically young such as 
incorporating a pee wee herman step into the choreography he has 
taken some of their references and things that have come out of 
their current frame of mind to create the show 
the things ive learned by playing jesus ive tried to pass 
along to jeffrey steefel who plays him in this show but without 
being dictatorial about it scardino says everybody else in 
the musical ill just give notes or suggestions with him i 
unconsciously start to act it out or show him and thats wrong he 
is the actor 
the original performers in godspell all came out of carnegie 
tech now carnegie mellon university they had been together for 
four years and had a strong background in an acting technique that 
involved story theater the telling of stories and the playing of 
games 
its a technique not taught much lately so scardino asked for 
and got an extra week of rehearsal to do theater games such as 
blindman trust exercises and circle games with the new actors 
they are exercises dedicated to creating an ensemble unit of actors 
and break down the social barriers 
its the only show in which you have to be deprogrammed when 
you leave it scardino laughs 
the director feels the musical will find a new audience today 
even though it has only been a decade since the show was last seen 
in new york plus get many of the people who saw it before 
im a 60s person the 40yearold scardino says we all 
thought we were searching for new definitions we thought we were 
revolutionaries either political or spiritual or whatever but 
there was a spiritual search alive and a rejection of material 
values or at least we thought so then we entered the 80s and 
weve come into yuppie materialism 
it was godspells naivete and honesty that attracted people 
in the 1970s scardino says adding that the musical had a fresh 
perspective on something that had lost meaning for people the 
gospel 
i think we are in a crisis of values now scardino says 
everybody seems to be involved now in another search for meaning 
or a new search for spiritual values its the pendulum swinging 
although it hasnt swung yet the kind of joy that godspell has

pedro a tiny 6yearold with big brown 
saucers of eyes cries in fear when he sees soldiers and often 
hides in the orphanage where he lives 
tomas 16 is the most aggressive child at another childrens 
home and capable of breaking anything when hes angry says the 
homes director 
angel a salvadoran boy about 14 saw his mother killed in the 
guerrilla war and ended up on the guatemala city streets sniffing 
paint thinner 
on a wooded hillside in el salvador a slightlybuilt 
babyfaced boy who uses the nom de guerre william has an m16 
slung over his shoulder now 15 he says he has been a guerrilla 
fighter for a year and a half 
all are survivors and victims of central americas armed 
conflicts 
the children who have seen violence even if they havent been 
direct victims in terms of physical violence will keep the trauma 
of the effect of war for a long time this can last for a 
lifetime said agop kayayan representative at the central 
american headquarters in guatemala city of unicef the united 
nations childrens fund 
were really talking about the way the next generation is 
going to act or is going to think of the way things are done in 
society 
few statistics are available to show how many children have been 
killed wounded or orphaned by eight years of war between leftist 
rebels and the usbacked government in el salvador by the 
fighting for the better part of 10 years in nicaragua and by the 
stillsimmering 27year conflict between leftist guerrillas and the 
army in guatemala 
in nicaragua 40000 children were orphaned the loss of one or 
both parents in the 197879 sandinista revolution that ended 42 
years of somoza family rule an additional 11361 children have 
been orphaned in the more than six years of fighting between 
usbacked contra rebels and sandinistagovernment troops 
children form a large part from 60 to 80 percent by some 
estimates of the more than 1 million people displaced in their own 
countries thousands of others are among those who have fled to 
neighboring countries or to the united states canada or europe 
a guatemalan court survey found more than 58693 orphans as of 
august 1986 but only 55 percent of guatemalan towns responded to 
the survey and the total number of orphans is estimated at 100000 
to 200000 
the salvadoran government agency charged with childrens welfare 
has no figures on the number of orphans in el salvador 
throughout the region but particularly in guatemala where half 
the population is indian many orphans are taken in by relatives 
others like angel the salvadoran boy now in guatemala fend for 
themselves 
young teenagers fight on both sides of the conflicts for 
guerrillas or for governments 
lino hernandez trigueros executive secretary of the permanent 
human rights commission in nicaragua said the commission has found 
12 and 13yearolds with the military on the remote caribbean 
coast military service is required for those 17 to 25 
reporters have seen children as young as 13 in the contra rebel 
ranks 
in the salvadoran countryside it is easy to spot children who 
appear years shy of the 18year draft age with the army as well as 
with the guerrillas like william 
where clashes are frequent casings of spent bullets often 
become the only toys children have play with 
the trauma of living with war in crowded refugee camps or in 
constant flight has many faces 
this can be seeing security forces as people who are going to 
kill or hurt rather than as security forces said unicefs 
kayayan 
seeing families relatives or neighbors killed can lead young 
people to be violent themselves he said the effect multiplies 
with the closeness of the relationship and the degree of violence 
a drawing by a thirdgrade guatemalan refugee girl at a camp in 
southern mexico shows soldiers shooting men tied to stakes 
decapitated bodies lie between them 
orphanage personnel asked that childrens names be changed for 
this article to avoid reprisals against them

a woman at the orphanage where 6yearold pedro lives says his 
hiding when he sees solders is understandable he spent most of his 
short life in guatemalas highland forests fleeing soldiers 
searching for guerrilla supporters his mother was killed 
when soldiers came to his village late last year pedro fell to 
the ground and covered himself with pine boughs his father and the 
group of women the boy was with escaped but pedro was discovered 
and wound up in the orphanage 
when he saw the little girls at the home he said he didnt 
like women because they had abandoned him the orphanage woman 
said when she took him to look for relatives among other displaced 
people she added he wouldnt go in because he saw the 
soldiers

mark connolly of childhope an international organization 
helping street children has known angel since not long after he 
reached the guatemala city streets in 1984 stealing and already on 
paint thinner at age 9 
one day he began telling connolly about nightmares he has of 
seeing his mother killed at their home in el salvador 
he vividly recalled to me the killing of his father mother 
and two brothers he said 
the next day soldiers found the boy asleep at home and brought 
his little sister and him to a base where his brother was a soldier 
soldiers came back to the base one day and said his brother 
had been killed then soldiers friends of his or his brothers 
took them to the border and told them to go across he said 
shortly after arriving in guatemala city he lost track of his 
sister one day the director says angel wants to go back to el 
salvador to find a younger brother 
he has been in and out of a home run by a religious group in the

in many children the trauma is hidden 
what you can say is that there have been many learning 
difficulties many difficulties in relating said nicole dagnino 
president of enfants refugies du monde a private french 
organization that works with refugee children in several countries 
parents who are refugees become depressed have no jobs lose 
their traditional contact with the land the child in addition to 
having to leave his home loses his father image 
they have lost all points of reference ms dagnino said 
a woman who works with refugee orphans said she had several 
children who go around setting fire to everything 
but while children in orphanages often fight with each other 
she said these dont 
it is as if they protect each other she said 
perhaps worse than the direct effects says kayayan is the 
money that military spending takes away from health education and 
other programs to help children and the destruction of those 
facilities 
adding to the problem is economic crisis in the alreadypoor 
region from both the wars and other factors 
unicef says infant and child deaths are on the rise in the 
region and nearly two out of three of the survivors suffer some 
degree of malnutrition 
a study by the guatemalabased nutrition institute of central 
america and panama found the nutrition in rural communities of 
guatemala had worsened significantly between 1985 and 1987 a 
period after the most recent peak in fighting 
in the war atmosphere of nicaragua and el salvador it is 
impossible to collect data the institutes dr hernan delgado 
said but it is reasonable to think that with the military and 
economic situations there is a worsening in the state of health 
about 40 percent of children under age 5 in the central american 
region are believed to suffer some form of malnutrition the 
average includes costa rica and panama where conditions 
traditionally are better 
in 1980 64 percent of the population was below the poverty line 
and 41 percent could not afford the minimum food basket 
but delgado said worsening nutrition levels or infant and child 
mortality were like the tip of the iceberg the culmination of 
a series of changes such as more illness or reduced physical 
activity 
it may be that it is not as important as all the change that 
occurs what that implies in all the children who didnt die he 
said

on the uninhabited atlantic island of 
fassa off guinea the trees began to shrivel 
when the government of the west african nation investigated it 
found the problem was 15000 metric tons of unspecified toxic ash 
shipped from philadelphia pa that had been dumped by a norwegian 
company on the island 
guineas government in conakry arrested norways honorary consul 
general sigmund strome on a charge of complicity in the dumping 
the guineans cracked down on toxic waste after seeing fassas 
trees shrivel but the prospect of multimillion dollar paydays is 
luring an increasing number of african countries into becoming 
dumpsites for millions of tons of toxic waste from industrialized 
western countries 
in guineas case alucoguinea a governmentcontrolled company 
signed a contract to accept 85000 metric tons of waste at 50 a 
ton the government canceled the deal in april and demanded that 
the waste on fassa be returned to the country of origin 
the government also arrested several of ministry of commerce 
employees who granted import licenses for the waste 
strome the honorary consul general has no formal diplomatic 
status the norwegian government said in oslo and was employed by 
norways klaveness shipping group which engaged the vessels for 
the waste shipments to guinea 
tom prestesulen a klaveness spokesman described the waste as 
slag ash and denied it was toxic the content of toxics are well 
below approved us levels he said 
the guinea case nevertheless stirred concern in neighboring west 
african countries 
it doesnt matter what amount of money they are offered 
said foreign minister omar sey of the gambia you dont know but 
you mortgage the entire history of your people 
you liberate your countries from colonialism and you talk 
about imperialism apartheid but what is more horrible than 
dumping nuclear and toxic waste 
sey said the gambia a country about the size of connecticut and 
sandwiched like a sausage by senegal has been approached by us 
and french companies who wanted a site to dump toxic wastes 
they have been offering handsome rewards a lot of money is 
involved sey said we are talking about hundreds of millions 
of dollars the gambia is a very poor country but i dont think 
any amount of money would lead us to agree to mortgage the future 
of our countries 
according to government officials and representatives of the 
united nations environmental program unep in nairobi nearly a 
dozen african countries either have signed or are negotiating 
contracts to accept industrial wastes or have been approached 
led by nigeria africa has been unusually candid about the 
problem calling names and pointing fingers 
we heard that benin had been considering accepting nuclear 
wastes from france and on hearing this we sent a delegation to 
the republic of benin foreign minister ike nwachukwu of nigeria 
told the associated press we were told that they had been 
approached but that they had turned it down and would not allow 
any dumping 
nigeria itself has not escaped the problem however 
the government announced june 11 that preliminary tests of waste 
secretly dumped in eastern nigerian by an italian company show the 
substances to be poisonous scientists urged that anyone who 
visited the dump site to undergo medical tests 
the government also said it had seized an italian ship in lagos 
harbor and ordered it to take the wastes back to italy 
a government spokesman yusufu mamman said some nigerians and 
italians had been arrested for the dumping but he did not identify 
them 
he told reporters five shipments of waste had been brought to 
nigeria from italy since aug 26 1987 with the latest arriving 
may 20 the shipments totaled 4766 tons of which about 2000 had 
actually be dumped he said 
earlier nigerias guardian newspaper reported that 10 european 
companies covertly dumped in the country more than 20 of the 
worlds most dangerous industrial toxic wastes including 
radioactive materials 
the newspaper said the wastes has been brought in falsely under 
a permit granted by the government for the import of chemicals for 
construction projects it added that the wastes dumped near an oil 
terminal at forcados 150 miles southeast of lagos included such 
poisonous materials as melamine wastes from norway and 
polyurethanes and ethyl acetate formaldehyde from italy 
while few african countries talk openly of their involvement in 
dumping they are not ignoring the problem 
in late may the government of the congo announced the arrests 
of five people including an adviser to the prime minister in what 
became known as the industrial waste affair 
political adviser dieudonne ganga environment director marius 
issanga gamissimi external trade director abel tchicou lawyer 
vincent gomes and artisan jean passi were accused of establishing a 
fictious company with the intent of covertly accepting toxic wastes 
ganga purportedly initiated contacts with the us embassy in 
brazzaville the congos capital on a plan for the congolese co 
to stock 1 million metric tons of industrial waste 
the company would have earned 42 million a year under a 
threeyear contract the government said officials said the five 
had admitted their guilt 
the us embassy has not commented on the affair 
prodded by nigeria the oganization of african unity oau at 
its recent silver jubilee summit session adopted a resolution 
condemning the dumping of industrial wastes in africa calling the 
practice a crime against africa and the african peoples 
barely a week later the european parliament in strasbourg 
france unanimously adopted a resolution banning largescale 
exports of toxic waste from western europe to third world countries

despite the public pronouncements few expect any quick 
resolution of the problem 
quite a lot of the business is going on somewhere in the 
twilight said jan huismans director of the genevabased 
international register of potentionally toxic chemicals an arm of 
unep i think it is economics i cant see any other benefit of 
receiving this waste 
money also is a factor for western industries which account for 
the bulk of the 300 million metric tons of industrial wastes 
produced annually worldwide 
stringent environmental laws in the west like those imposed by 
the us environmental protection agency demand onsite disposal 
facilities that can cost as much as 30 million and take years to 
build and to ship toxic wastes from california which churns out 
10 million metric tons of wastes a year across the united states 
to a landfill in new jersey costs about 800 a barrel 
industrialized countries also are under public pressure to keep 
toxic landfills away from rapidly expanding residential areas 
in return for 926 million the congo a nation of 18 million 
people agreed to accept 1 million metric tons for storage or 
incineration over eight years the heavily polluted chemical 
waste as it was described was to be shippped from the 
netherlands belguim luxembourg and west germany 
van santen the rottendambased cargo firm hired to transport 
the wastes made no effort to conceal the deal 
th looyschelder director of van santen said the firm saw a 
double advantage of transporting toxic waste to africa 
not only do we have a cheap way of disposing of waste but the 
third world will be provided with money knowhow and 
infrastructure he was quoted as saying 
the company said similar negotiations were under way with niger 
in northcentral africa 
but van santen was forced to put the congo deal on hold after a 
spate of negative publicity 
before the transports to africa would take place we would 
have taken samples and analyses of the chemicals involved to check 
whether the transports would be within the regulations of the 
various countries involved hans hulswit deputy director of van 
santen told the ap 
but now that the press has painted the picture of us being 
involved in illegal activities by imposing dangerous materials on 
third world countries against their will were bowing out 
huismans the un official said african countries arent 
prepared to handle the wests toxic wastes 
in principal there is nothing terribly wrong with dumping 
toxic wastes in africa providing the receiving countries can 
properly handle the wastes he said invariably most of the 
countries who accept the wastes are importing a problem that they 
initially may not know is a problem 
huismans a toxicologist said that most hazardous wastes 
shipped to africa are so vaguely described that it is impossible to 
know from their names whether they are dangerous or not 
parts of the south pacific and the caribbean long have been 
toxic wastes dumps as those landfills became full africa became 
the new dumping ground beginning five years ago 
unep has drafted a global convention on the control of 
transboundary movements of hazardous wastes which was discussed an 
an international toxic waste conference sponsored by unep june 610 
in caracas venezuela uneps executive director mostafa k tolba 
said it would be legally binding on signatory nations once approved 
by the 50nation group probably next year 
most of the countries are not equipped to handle such 
imports tolba said in a statement thats why we must work to 
get the international treaty into force to ensure adequate control 
of movements of hazardous wastes crossing frontiers 
we have received information on planned exports of millions of 
metric tons of hazardous wastes from european and us companies to 
third world countries such as guinea bissau the congo benin 
ethiopia peru argentina venezuela 
huismans urged preventative work on possible health hazards 
i dont think we should wait until such proof is found he 
said so far it has been difficult to prove that any wastes have 
led to serious effects on human health but it takes time for these 
things to develop 
said sey the gambian foreign minister 
i think people have a concept that africa is the jungle 
if you cannot dump it in north america just dump it in the 
jungle because it is just trees and animals and those africans 
dont matter

while most chemical or industrial waste 
finds a final resting place some goes off on long circuitous 
journeys to nowhere 
thats what happened with 2100 metric tons of wastes stored in 
12000 drums from an italian chemical company in february 1987 
fifteen months later it is back in italy aboard what italians 
call the ship of poison 
the waste was first loaded aboard a maltese freighter at the 
port of marina di carrara about 60 miles southeast of genoa and 
sent to tiny djibouti in northeast africa djiboutis authorities 
turned it away 
the vessel then took the cargo almost half a world away to 
venezuela where it was unloaded but people there protested and 
authorities ordered the waste removed 
it was put aboard a cypriot freighter and taken to syria after 
the ship was turned away by greece syrian authorities inspected 
the cargo said it might contain radioactivity and ordered it back 
to italy its place of origin 
the syrian freighter zanoobia now the ship of poison to 
italians took it to marina di carrara the zanoobia anchored off 
the port for a month and five crewmen fell ill after having lived 
with the cargo for four months 
they were taken to a hospital but released after treatment of 
ailments not further detailed 
italian officials then allowed the zanoobia to dock may 29 in 
genoa where another crewmen was hospitalized after complaining of 
nausea and abdominal pains 
the zanoobia remains in genoa while italian authorities decide 
when and how to remove its cargo and where to dispose of it in 
italy 
it the meantime health officials test the air and water around 
the vessel to be sure it does not contaminate the area they said 
they have not found any evidence of radioactivity in the cargo but 
they still are not sure exactly what the chemicals are 
the italian government has appropriated 33 million for the 
disposal but said the money would have to be repaid by jelly wax 
the company in milan that contracted to dispose of the chemicals in 
the first place

a key turning point was gorbachevs dramatic call in january 
1986 for the global elimination of all nuclear weapons by the year 
2000 including a firstphase scrapping of inf missiles in europe 
by 1990 
ten months later at a meeting in reykjavik iceland he and 
reagan agreed in principle to eliminate all but 100 inf missiles on 
each side they also came close to agreeing in principle to scrap 
all ballistic missiles a idea that went far beyond the inf 
proposals and triggered an avalanche of west european complaints 
that reagan had gone too far 
although the west europeans at that point were pressing hard for 
completion of an inf treaty the reykjavik talk of eliminating all 
ballistic missiles caused a serious political crisis in nato the 
europeans felt they had not been adequately consulted by the reagan 
administration on an issue that directly affected western europes 
security 
shortly after that summit jacques chirac then premier of 
france called on the european allies to create a new security 
charter to defend their interests 
the scope of the proposals put forward by both sides at the 
reykjavik summit in october seemed to shake the very basis on which 
our conception of ussoviet relations is founded chirac said 
his remark carried with it the weight of broad agreement among 
the west european allies that they should insist on playing a 
bigger political role 
one cannot remain forever a spectator to the americansoviet 
negotiations even if they are positive prime minister filipe 
gonzalez of spain told the french mewspaper le monde in an 
interview published feb 11 
this concern is rooted partly in the allies belief that the 
united states is losing some of its international political 
predominance and that economic strains induced by years of huge 
budget deficits may soon force it to pull some american troops out 
of western europe 
in the united states a feeling has grown in recent years that 
the europeans are bearing too small a share of the burden of 
western defense 
in june 1984 the us senate by a 5541 vote defeated a 
proposal to withdraw nearly onethird of the 326000 us troops 
based in europe unless the allies did more to improve nonnuclear 
defenses 
this triggered a new effort in nato spearheaded by carrington 
and former a us ambassador to nato david abshire to cooperate 
more on defense planning and in the development production and 
buying of armaments a key result of this was the conventional 
defense improvements initiative approved at a nato defense 
ministers meeting in may 1985 
talk of strengthening the european pillar of nato has been 
around since president john f kennedy coined the term in 1962 but 
it has taken on added urgency in recent years partly due to us 
economic problems 
a study by political leaders and defense experts from the united 
states canada and eight european nato countries published in may 
called for a highlevel alliance meeting early in 1989 to revise 
the transatlantic pact on which western security has rested for 39 
years 
a fundamental change has occurred in the useuropean 
relationship the study concluded 
it said the europeans should take more of the economic and 
political burdens of alliance leadership and that the united 
states should accustom itself to conducting nato business on more 
even terms with the europeans 
as perceptions about the military threat posed by the soviet 
union have changed in recent years transatlantic friction has 
grown over how to respond to security problems outside the nato 
area 
the us bombing of libya in april 1986 brought this conflict to 
a peak britain was the only nato country to explicitly support the 
us bombing raid which was described by reagan as a defensive 
response to libyan backing for terrorist attacks on americans in 
europe the french and spanish governments declined to permit us 
f111 fighterbombers to cross their airspace en route from britain 
to libya and back 
carrington says this marked the low point of his four years at 
nato 
it was quite nasty he said it brought to a head the 
american perception that the europeans were really not interested 
in anything that happened outside the nato area 
it also hardened a west european view of the reagan 
administration as a group of cowboys carrington said 
the strains eased over time helped by the decision of several 
west european countries including italy belgium and the 
netherlands to join the us navy in mineclearing operations in 
the persian gulf starting in 1987

anna maria horsford has turned a supporting 
role as thelma the unmarried 39yearold deacons daughter on 
amen into one of the most popular characters on the nbc hit 
comedy 
thelma whos been engaged and jilted 18 times has been 
described as a vampy virgin 
horsford said in an interview that she sees thelma as a 
reluctant spinster who even at 39 is still holding on to her 
virtue 
its always a challenge to a man to be first she said 
dont ever assume that virtuous girls are uninteresting 
horsford was born and raised in harlem the daughter of a 
businessman and attended new yorks high school for the performing 
arts she said she began to draw up a history for thelma as soon as 
she was cast 
shes unemployed unmarried and living at home with her father 
played by sherman hemsley she said i wrote it all down 
then i could see whats my attitude toward someone like that my 
first reaction was that she was spoiled by her father she doesnt 
do what she doesnt have to do 
i looked for her endearing qualities too shed been engaged 
many times so i looked back in my past at the girls who got the 
ring but never got to the altar i created a woman who is quiet 
strong manipulative and secure in the sense that her life has been 
consistent since childhood 
if daddy spoils her its the handsome rev reuben gregory 
played by clifton davis who puts her in a matrimonial mood so 
far her love is unrequited 
before amen horsford worked regularly in films including 
st elmos fire heartburn class crackers the 
fan and street smart plus in a number of television movies 
ive played a lot of strong women in films she said 
sometimes ive been a policewoman and carried a gun but i really 
hate guns and abhor screen violence my father was shot by a holdup 
man when i was 4 and thereafter he wore a gun to work i never 
dated in high school all the boys knew daddy carried a gun 
she said in her screen roles she has tried to portray strength 
through her presence i think a character who can scare you with 
his presence is much stronger than a person who needs a gun she 
said i try to show that in my acting 
because of the regularity of her work in movies she said she 
wasnt terribly worried about whether she would land the role in 
the network series she had tested for the role in new york then 
was called to los angeles to test opposite hemsley 
i came out on a sunday auditioned on monday and was told 
thered probably be a decision on tuesday well there was no word 
on tuesday or wednesday or thursday by then i was back in new 
york my agent called me at noon friday and said guess what you 
have the job 
nbc had made a reservation for her on a 4 pm plane that day 
i said oh no is this the way hollywood does it i flew back 
to la and went to work the next day 
horsford said she has learned that in television you have to 
come out ready with all your lines memorized 
i said im so grateful for every lesson for every showcase 
ive done she said you do a sitcom and you can use everything 
youve learned you dont have time to think of criticism because 
its so fast i think what makes a hit show is an actor giving a 
lot of his or her resource to a writer 
a producer hires you hoping that you can deliver but theres 
no way a producer can anticipate how the audience will respond to 
you the writers pick up little pieces of you and your personality 
and put it into the script an actors heartache is having a great 
line but then losing it because it didnt work in rehearsal in 
television if something doesnt work the first time theres no 
second chance 
when she moved to los angeles two years ago to start work on 
amen she found herself facing another problem she had to 
learn to drive 
im an expert now she said i went to driving school for 
seven weeks when i first came here i got very friendly with 
everyone at paramount studios you get humble and ask everybody for 
a ride i still have a soft spot in my heart too for all the men 
who let me drive and sat in the passenger seat while i was 
learning

theres a scene in big in which tom hanks finds a giant 
piano in the fao schwarz toy store in manhattan hanks who is 
really a 12yearold in an adults body begins dancing over the 
keys to pick out a tune along comes his boss robert loggia 
president of a toy company the pair tap out a joyful rendition of 
chopsticks and heart and soul with all the airy grace of 
fred and ginger 
the sequence is one of the many delights of big which 
defies the odds by scoring a home run despite being the fourth 
comedy within a year about a boy who turns into a man it is the 
most thoroughly enjoyable comedy since tootsie 
unlike the earlier films theres no scifi hocus pocus about 
big josh baskin david moscow is an undersized preteener who 
gets pushed around by bullies and is turned away from an amusement 
park thrill ride because of his size before a simplelooking 
fortune machine zoltan speaks he wishes to be big the next 
morning he is 
his mother is terrified to find this adult stranger in her 
house hanks flees to new york holes up in a fleabag hotel where 
he contemplates his predicament with his pal billy jared rushton 
the only one who knows about the transformation 
hanks finds work in a toy company and with his acute knowledge 
of what kids like ascends to an important position he encounters 
a predatory female elizabeth perkins and a vengeful executive 
john heard but he manages to elude both then perkins is moved 
by hanks innate sweetness and a romance of sorts ensues 
ending big must have posed a problem for writers anne 
spielberg and gary ross who also coproduced should hanks remain 
an adult and continue the romance and career or should he return 
as a boy to his grieving family the conclusion is totally 
satisfactory though getting there has some rough spots 
the plot inconsistencies are overbalanced by an absolutely 
stunning performance by tom hanks using only body language and 
quirky expressions he is irresistible as the boyman if the 
academy ever recognizes comedy as a worthy achievement hanks 
should be rewarded 
after a shaky start with jumpin jack flash penny marshall 
breaks through as a comedy director of rare skill all of the 
performers are topnotch especially the everfaithful robert loggia 
and youngsters moscow and rushton 
a 20th century fox release also produced by james l brooks and 
robert greenhut big is rated pg but it seems like ideal 
summer entertainment for the entire family

wall street cbsfox vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
when wall street hit movie theaters last year the real 
street was crashing and highrolling traders such as ivan boesky 
were being marched to prison 
anyone who thinks this movie offers any real insight into the 
quirks and greed that make stock market life so enticing will be 
disappointed 
one of the many implausible aspects of this film written and 
directed by oliver stone is that there isnt a single decent 
womans role it could be that the film is implicitly blaming 
testosterone for wall streets vices 
but who cares this movie is great silly fun fueled by superb 
acting from oscar winner michael douglas father and son martin and 
charlie sheen hal holbrook and terrence stamp theres even a 
terrific walkon by sylvia miles as a pushy east side real estate 
saleswoman 
douglas is suitably sinister as gordon gekko wall street 
dealmaker dreamweaver and crusher of innocent companies the 
younger sheen plays bud fox a young sammy glicktype broker who 
sees gekko as his ticket to the big bucks he will do anything to 
get into gekkos empire of beautiful women limousines cocaine and 
megadeals 
while at gekkos beach house he meets a beautiful but vacuous 
interior decorator played darryl hannah who has big money dreams 
of her own fidelity it turns out is not her strong suit nor 
are brains 
gekko spins out such wisdom as greed is good and every 
battle is won before it is fought 
fox ingratiates himself to gekko by becoming a corporate spy and 
feeding him insider information 
but when he finds himself embroiled in a takeover scheme that 
threatens to break up the airline for which his father works this 
proves too much even for the avaricious young fox

down in the groove columbia bob dylan 
 
columbia proclaims on the packaging of bob dylans latest album 
that he is a 1988 rock amp roll hall of fame inductee 
did they think someone out there would pick up the record and 
say i never heard of this guy but look hes in the rock n 
roll hall of fame how bad can he be 
most anyone browsing in the dylan section is going to be aware 
that his most recent knocked out loaded was pretty mediocre and 
that even the darkly brilliant empire burlesque that preceded 
it was an acquired taste 
dylan needs a strong accessible backtobasics record down 
in the groove is it with an asterisk 
dylan wrote only four of the 10 songs two of which were 
cowritten with the grateful deads robert hunter the dylan songs 
are superb and covers suit him so well they might as well be his 
the record is so strong because he hasnt insisted on filling it 
with his own material however weak 
instead he offers unique dylanesque treatments of standards 
including believe it or not shenandoah hes also backed by 
an allstar lineup of pals including eric clapton mark knopfler 
the grateful dead full force paul simonon of the clash steve 
jones of the sex pistols ron wood and clydie and bobby king 
perhaps the best cut on the album is silvio one of the 
dylanhunter collaborations with jerry garcia bob weir and brent 
mydland singing backup 
the other dylanhunter tune ugliest girl in the world 
shows our mans sense of humor intact the woman i love she 
gotta hook in her nose her eyebrows meet and she wears secondhand 
clothes she speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop i 
dont know why i love her but i just cant stop 
had a dream about you baby is fine hard rock one of two 
original songs dylan wrote for his movie hearts of fire which 
has not been released though the soundtrack album is available 
down in the groove opens with wilbert harrisons lets 
stick together 
when did you leave heaven is a crooners number and dylans 
strained wail is downright charming 
death is not the end is the other dylan original gospel 
tinged with a celtic dirge 
he closes with the stanley brothers haunting ballad of 
alienation rank strangers to me i wandered again to my home 
in the mountains where in youths early dawn i was happy and free 
i looked for my friends but i never could find them i found they 
were all rank strangers to me

how can a serious actor such as tom skerritt 
hold his own amid the pyrotechnics of poltergeist iii 
you dont even try in a special effects picture he admits 
aliens had the same feeling you simply do them to learn from 
the filmmaker what you get out of it is to learn about lenses how 
to use the camera effectively some of the tricks of the trade 
im more interested in being a director and in learning about 
that process than in being an actor in front of a camera its not 
a very exciting thing being an actor in front of a camera 
his attitude may help explain the skerritt film career he seems 
always to be working but he has never ascended to superstardom he 
and robert redford made their film debuts in the 1962 war hunt 
redford became an instant star skerritt didnt 
in 1970 skerritt appeared with elliott gould and donald 
sutherland in the landmark comedy mash while his costars 
went on to fame and fortune skerritt turned up in films such as 
run run joe and big bad mama 
shirley maclaine anne bancroft mikhail baryshnikov and leslie 
browne won academy award nominations for the turning point in 
1977 skerritt as maclaines compassionate husband did not 
again with the recent megahit top gun skerritt drew little 
credit for his powerful presence as tom cruises flight instructor 
if such happenstances bother tom skerritt he doesnt show it 
he continues taking jobs that interest him ranging from guest 
appearances on cheers to uncredited modeling of guess clothes 
in magazines the other day he was working on location at the 
university of southern california in a farce called hunchback 
it was originally titled the hunchback of ucla but that 
university declined to be associated 
skerritt is a newcomer to mgms poltergeist series playing 
the role of the late heather orourkes uncle he confesses he 
hasnt seen the first two films 
he didnt have any qualms about joining in the middle of the 
series 
i had a lot of confidence in the director gary sherman he 
said generally filmmaking is a matter of working with people 
whose work you enjoy enough to learn from he had mounds of 
sketches of the way he was going to shoot the picture all live 
special effects i thought this guy is an architectural genius 
indeed he had studied at architecture school in chicago 
skerritt still hasnt reconciled himself to the loss of heather 
orourke the young star of all three poltergeists 
she was an extraordinary person very intelligent very 
together very focused young lady he remarked eyes misting 
heather died on the operating table feb 2 at childrens hospital 
in san diego during intestinal surgery to relieve a congenital 
bowel obstruction she had completed filming of poltergeist iii 
last june 
a detroit native skerritt fell into acting at wayne state 
university and moved west to study at the ucla film school 
i never really took acting seriously he admitted i was 
more interested in the process of making films i did acting 
because i enjoyed it and found it therapeutic but i also felt the 
responsibility that if i was going to direct or write i should 
certainly know how to act its an economy a shorthand that you 
learn by doing i fell into making a living at it 
skerritts career has taken a number of wrong turns after 
mash he was offered a role in a proposed tv series based on 
the film he declined figuring it would be just another 
sitcom then his agents persuaded him to move to italy since 
clint eastwood and charles bronson had achieved stardom there 
skerritt stayed 3 years but the same lightning failed to strike 
in recent times he has appeared in such fleeting films as 
silence of the north space camp and maid to order but 
a top gun can offset such misses 
i read 15 pages of that script and i wanted to do it the 
actor said there was no doubt of its power in terms of 
commercial appeal with ridley scott directing and jerry 
bruckheimer and don simpson producing there was no way that was 
going to be anything but a terrific piece of film 
out of top gun came skerritts debut as a fashion model the 
guess jeans people called him for a magazine layout and he joined 
up 
to tell the truth i dont pay much attention he commented 
when people come up to me and say my god youve been in every 
magazine every periodical i have no idea i read time magazine 
the wall street journal and the new york times and raise my kids 
and mow the lawn pretty much 
thats no 1 isnt it you father children and you raise 
them you dont run from the responsibility as so many men seem to 
do nowadays i dont conceptualize this business as anything other 
than the way i make a living to feed my family and pay the rent 
its just a job

know anyone who plays the euphonium 
when was the last time you picked up your bassoon and blew a 
bouncy tune 
the euphonium a brasswind instrument with a mellow tone and 
the bassoon a woodwind instrument with a long curved stem are 
among some less popular instruments some musicologists fear may 
become as endangered as the whooping crane 
in an effort to reverse this trend the settlement music school 
is encouraging its students to play lesserknown instruments 
robert capanna the executive director of the school said the 
number of students playing such endangered instruments as the 
euphonium bassoon cello double bass harp oboe trombone tuba 
viola french horn and organ is declining 
he is concerned about the trend and said he wonders what the 
professional implications could be if it is not changed capanna 
noted there is intense competition for positions in orchestras 
however if more interest in some instruments is not developed 
that competition could wane 
ronald demkee associate conductor of the allentown pa 
symphony and the orchestra director at freedom high school in 
bethlehem pa said the quality of the performers is still high 
but there could be concern if fewer people study some instruments 
the people that are auditioning seem to be more prepared than 
ever he said however the number of bassoon players at the high 
school for example has dropped from five to one over the last 
several years 
schools across the country are reporting the same trend as the 
settlement school capanna said he attributed the swing in 
interest to cuts in school music programs 
kids at an early age are not getting that exposure of 
different instruments he explained 
settlement offers a class called meet the instruments of the 
orchestra and provides scholarships for students to play such 
endangered instruments as the euphonium a tenor tuba 
kids who are interested in music have a narrow frame of 
interest capanna said adding that piano and violin are by far 
the most popular instruments being studied we want to make kids 
aware that there are other instruments 
piano students are now encouraged to also take up the organ and 
violinists are also steered toward learning how to play the viola 
settlement sponsored a program in which it distributed 120000 
comic books and tapes to schoolchildren called quadrus and 
friends musical journey the books and tapes attempted to make 
children aware of how music touches their lives and how they can 
become involved in music if they have the desire 
the idea was to get kids to recognize there were people 
involved in good music capanna said 
the school of 6000 students aged 3 to adult is the largest 
community arts school in the nation it was founded 80 years ago 
the executive director said the enrollment has changed over the 
last decade ten years ago capanna said 25 percent of the 
students played wind and brass instruments the typical band 
instruments such as clarinet flute trumpet and the endangered 
instruments 
now he said 13 percent of the enrollment are studying those 
instruments he estimated that another 50 percent of the students 
are playing the piano and the remainder are studying voice or 
playing string instruments mainly the violin 
in the long run it will level out demkee said noting that 
some students will change over to the more needed instruments 
a lack of interest in some instruments can affect other music 
students capanna said 
because so many people are playing the piano and violin their 
musical experience wont be as rich there are limits to what the 
two instruments can play together and playing with a group of 
people enrichs a students experience he said 
when the student is part of an audience for a musical 
performance his or her appreciation will be greater if his or her 
musical experience is deeper capanna said 
the popularity of the suzuki method of teaching the violin also 
has shifted interest to the instrument he said the suzuki method 
was developed by a doctor in japan about 20 years ago and is a way 
of teaching youngsters how to play the violin before theyre even 
able to read music therefore the child is already playing the 
violin before he knows the other options available 
the method has since been applied to other instruments

reynolds price is a great believer in the power 
of the unconscious so when two characters he introduced to readers 
a quartercentury ago rooted themselves in his imagination he put 
away his novelinprogress and let them take over 
the result is good hearts atheneum 1895 in which we 
catch up on the story of rosa and wesley beavers the central 
characters of prices first novel a long and happy life 
in the 1962 work rosacoke mustian and wesley beavers crossed 
the line from innocence to adulthood in an isolated patch of rural 
north carolina in the newest work they are married middleaged 
and entrenched in raleigh she working as a college secretary and 
he as an auto mechanic 
price probably best known for kate vaiden his 1986 novel 
that won the national book critics circle award for best work of 
fiction was asked in a recent interview why he resurrected these 
characters after so long an absence 
i tried to start a novel about someone else and this idea 
kept coming forward to my mind as i was making notes for another 
subject and it seemed to be wise to go ahead and obey the 
impulse he said 
it wasnt as if the characters had been living in his head 
growing old with him he explained normally when i finish any 
given book i really sort of erase them in the computer let that 
file go but who knows what the unconscious mind is doing all that 
time 
i think an enormous amount of my work is done by that part of 
my mind and i would think that most of the creative writers that i 
know as well as a great deal of the scientific community find 
that a lot of their work is done by a part of their brain over 
which they have very little control 
price 55 is the author of seven novels and 10 other books 
including an impressive collection of essays a common room 
published last year except for a few years as a rhodes scholar in 
oxford england he has lived all of his life in north carolina 
like eudora welty and flannery oconnor two writers he greatly 
admires price has enjoyed staying put teaching at duke university 
in durham and writing about the kind of people he knows intimately 
good hearts opens with wesley fleeing his marriage in what 
amounts to a midlife crisis if the term can be used without 
derision and a tragic event that befalls rosa as a consequence 
the story is told from many characters points of view although 
rosas presence dominates due to her toughmindedness and a kind of 
radiance that price bestows upon her 
the idea of marriage as a sacred bond resounds throughout the 
novel a belief price says he shares with his characters 
as a basically religious person i myself feel certain kinds 
of human commitments matrimonial commitments parental 
commitments do indeed have a kind of sacred force to them and are 
broken or maligned at a very serious risk to the person who does 
it 
despite some dark moments good hearts ends with a sense of 
optimism and promise a trait common to many of prices works the 
author was asked if that is a conscious goal on his part 
i think its probably emotionally characteristic of the kind 
of person i am he said im someone who with a normal number 
of exceptions whos had a very lucky and a very happy life till 
now so i dont tend to assume the worst about things 
im also someone who feels that its one of the goals of a 
work of art to assist people onward in the world if what youve 
got to say really is that we should all get on the window ledge 
slit our wrists and fall eight floors i dont see much point in 
saying that thats not an errand worth doing in my opinion 
prices normal number of exceptions to his happy life 
includes being stricken by astrocytoma a cancerous nerve tumor in 
his spinal cord that has left him a paraplegic since 1984 he said 
that being confined to a wheelchair has at least had the advantage 
of allowing him more time to write 
one of the major things its taught me to be is very very 
patient when your legs are paralyzed youve either got to get very 
able to sit still and do things slowly and gradually and accept an 
awful lot of tiny frustrations or else youre going to go crazy 
fast 
he joked that cocktail parties are difficult because youre 
sitting there like a potted plant and the most boring person in the 
world corners you and you cant excuse yourself to go get an hors 
doeuvre 
hypnosis lessons he began taking for pain control led him to 
explore memory regression with his therapist which in turn led to 
his latest project a book of memoirs looking at the major 
emotional figures in my childhood and early youth 
eventually he hopes to get back to that novel that rosa and 
wesley chased away but hell let his unconscious dictate when

more than five years after his death 
country music star marty robbins is on home video as a singing 
cowboy roaming the west armed with a guitar rather than a pistol 
the drifter is rare footage shot in 1965 and 1966 that 
robbins hoped to use in a television show since it was done in 
black and white the program was never sold because color had just 
revolutionized the industry 
the show has previously been aired in only a couple of test 
markets said robbins son ronny who is overseeing the 
mailorder marketing of the video for marty robbins enterprises 
the fact that they were shot in black and white only adds to 
their uniqueness 
robbins laced much of his music with a macho western feel before 
he died of cardiac arrest on dec 8 1982 at age 57 
his best known song was el paso a gunfighter ballad in 1959 
that earned him a grammy award it is one of several tunes he sings 
in the video 
during his 30year career he wrote some 500 songs and had 18 
no 1 hits among them were my woman my woman my wife 
devil woman a white sport coat and a pink carnation 
el paso city the hanging tree some memories just wont 
die among my souvenirs and singing the blues 
some 30 of robbins 101 albums are still available 
there wasnt any kind of country song he couldnt sing and 
didnt have a hit with said ronnie pugh a researcher at the 
country music foundation 
he did cowboy songs hawaiian songs calypso songs he did 
love ballads he did rockabilly in the 50s and then did the 
nashville sound the smoother style in the late 60s and early 
70s 
i think his versatility was responsible for the longevity of 
his career pugh said he very successfully went with trends 
and set trends 
robbins performed on the grand ole opry from 1953 until his 
death almost 30 years later a friendly gregarious entertainer he 
bantered with the audience and often stayed at the grand ole opry 
house after the show ended to sign autographs for as long as an 
hour 
he was a fans favorite pugh recalled about robbins 
appearances on the opry he always got encores right up to the 
end the fans loved him 
robbins sang the title song to the clint eastwood movie honky 
tonk man which was released two weeks after robbins died he 
also appeared in 18 lowbudget movies and sang the theme for 
others such as the alamo and the hanging tree 
the sandyhaired mustachioed performer was chosen for induction 
into the country music hall of fame two months before his death 
two other members tex ritter and grandpa jones appear with him on 
the drifter 
among the songs performed on the video are el paso cool 
water tumblin tumbleweed streets of laredo and red 
river valley 
ronny robbins found the video material in a nashville bank vault 
after the bank kept sending bills for the storage 
they were in three big vaudevillelooking chests he said 
there was not even any dust on them the seal was totally intact 
it was like i opened a time capsule it looked like they had just 
been put in there yesterday 
daddy used to talk about the video market and how big it would 
be i didnt have the foresight to believe what he was talking 
about he was right everyone has a vcr now i think thats why he 
stored them 
the younger robbins recalled that his father who grew up in the 
phoenix area was always captivated by the old west 
i think he was a link with the past he wanted to be a part of 
he was such a big fan of gene autrys this was part of his life 
and this was his way to preserve part of it 
his grandfather was a quoteunquote texas ranger a poet a 
medicine man he looks like buffalo bill a caricature of the west 
it ingrained the early west in him and being from the phoenix area 
in the 1930s it was like the west 
wed drive home for christmas and wed get in texas and hed 
start singing songs you could see him lighting up and looking 
around he loved the mountains and the desert 
pugh says theres no country singer today as versatile as 
robbins was 
i dont see anybody like him now he said there are 
popular singers but they draw from one or two styles and go with 
that in his time red foley who died in 1968 was about that 
versatile but i cant think of anyone today that way

when diane wilkinson suffered whiplash in an auto 
accident 20 years ago the last thing she considered was going to a 
chiropractor 
my grandfather was an orthopedic surgeon says wilkinson 
53 the only thing i ever heard was stay away from them 
but reinjury of her neck nine years ago led to severe headaches 
neck spasms and faulty reflexes visits to an orthopedist a 
neurosurgeon and her family doctor provided no relief 
finally despite her reservations and her husbands opinion that 
chiropractic was hocus pocus wilkinson sought the help of a 
chiropractor 
the results have been darn near miraculous she says no 
pain no headaches full functioning 
others who have found relief including athletes like runner 
mary decker and tennis star ivan lendl echo wilkinsons glowing 
review and physicians are reluctant to criticize chiropractic 
after four chiropractors won an antitrust lawsuit against the 
american medical association 
but the profession still struggles for credibility 
we still meet lots of prejudices and unfair treatment says 
steve elliott past director of the texas chiropractic association 
the four chiropractors filed suit against the ama and other 
groups 11 years ago alleging they conspired to destroy the 
chiropractic profession a federal judge agreed in september and 
forbade the ama from discouraging members from associating with 
chiropractors the ama is appealing the ruling 
i see a lot of patients that deal with chiropractors and 
generally they are not accepted very well by the general medical 
community but they do help a lot of people said dr lawrence 
robbins a neurologist specializing in headache treatments in the 
chicago suburb of northbrook 
robbins and dr richard h sidell were the only two physicians 
willing to comment out of a dozen orthopedists and neurologists 
contacted in the chicago area doctors at northwestern university 
medical school and rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center 
declined comment as did the american academy of orthopedic 
surgeons 
its my feeling there are chiropractors who totally abuse what 
theyre doing but on the other hand ive worked with 
chiropractors who are totally honest and who are doing a perfectly 
reasonable job said sidell an orthopedic surgeon 
it has been only 15 years since an ama official called 
chiropractors rabid dogs and killers in the midst of a 
systematic campaign by the nations largest organization of doctors 
to squelch chiropractic 
yet chiropractic is thriving the number of us practitioners 
grew from 13000 in 1970 to more than 30000 in 1985 the last year 
for which figures are available according to the american 
chiropractic association 
chiropractic derived from greek words meaning effective 
hand is based on the theory that disease may be caused by 
interference with nerve function which practitioners try to 
correct by manipulating the spine and other joints 
chiropractors differ from physicians in that they perform no 
surgery and prescribe no drugs preferring to let the body try to 
heal itself after full nerve function is restored 
it is 93 years since canadian immigrant daniel david dd 
palmer cured the deafness of his janitor in iowa by manipulating 
his spine his experience with the janitor who had become deaf 
after wrenching his back led to palmers development of 
chiropractic principles and establishment of the first school to 
teach them in davenport in 1898 
there are now 15 us chiropractic colleges accredited by the 
council on chiropractic education students must complete 4200 
classroom hours of medical education over four years similar to 
medical school 
the curriculum includes anatomy physiology nutrition 
pathology public health clinical and laboratory diagnosis 
gynecology obstetrics pediatrics xray technique and 
interpretation geriatrics psychology and ethics 
the standards are getting greater each year said dr 
william l ramsey vice president for academic affiars at logan 
college of chiropractic in st louis to be accepted into an 
accredited chiropractic school students generally must have a 
c average in two years of undergraduate study including 
biology chemistry and physics 
far from the stereotype of the medical school dropout 
chiropractic students are more typically people who have already 
established credentials in nursing physical therapy teaching and 
dentistry ramsey said twentytwo percent of students have 
masters degrees or better 
elliott said stories abound about chiropractics efficacy 
from wonderful miracle cures to horrible tortures 
fortunately its not like that he said during a radio 
interview in liberty texas where he practices most people have 
an idea that we just work on backs and that we pop necks or pop 
backs but our main emphasis is to check out the overall 
integrity of the structural parts of the body 
treatment may relieve conditions ranging from constipation to 
workrelated injuries to sciatica a lowback pain that shoots into 
the leg and scoliosis a sideways curvature of the spine he said 
chiropractic is trying to gain credibility with something it has 
never had scientific proof of its effectiveness said steven wolk 
of the foundation for chiropractic education and research in 
arlington va the lack of research arises from a fundamental 
problem of funding he said 
wolk said mainstream medical research has been financially 
supported largely by the federal government and pharmaceutical 
companies neither of which has had any interest in exploring 
chiropractic 
to fill the void the foundation has earmarked 5 million over 
the next six years to commission independent research into two 
areas where chiropractic seems to hold the most promise low back 
pain and headache 
until large clinical studies can be done patients will have to 
rely on their own best judgment about disagreements over 
chiropractic that prevail in the medical community and about the 
varying skill levels among chiropractors 
as chicagoarea sports trainer bob gajda told tennis magazine 
you have 64 percent that tend to be average and you have 10 
percent that tend to be geniuses and then you have the lower end 
of the spectrum that should be shot in front of a mexican jail

from an abandoned blimp base scientists are 
peering beyond the stars and studying how the earth moves 
their work guides ships at sea satellites in space and even a 
cab driver in chicago and could someday help predict earthquakes 
they also found that the generally stable miami area is rising a 
fraction of an inch a year 
on the grounds of the us naval observatorys richmond station 
south of here are optical and radio telescopes a visiting german 
laser system and soon a gravity meter all designed to pinpoint 
locations and distances 
were observing continental drift changes in the earths 
crust and movements along fault lines as well as the earths spin 
and wobble says alice babcock one of 10 civilians at the 
station and its director as far as i know this network is the 
only source of such measurements 
the station which costs less than 500000 a year to run is 
part of a nasa network used by the united states soviet union and 
other satellitelaunching nations to program guidance systems and 
pinpoint locations 
the data is being fed into a growing worldwide satellite network 
that will become the definitive source for navigators it is not 
only available to ships planes satellites and submarines but to 
motorists via computerized maps 
i met a chicago taxi driver who had a receiver mounted in his 
cab he said it was quicker and more accurate than using a map 
says ms babcock there are even handheld receivers can pinpoint 
location and headings for hikers explorers and rescue teams 
richmond set up in 1949 at a world war ii blimp base also has 
the only backup to the master clock at the us naval observatory 
in washington a basis for accurate time measurement all over the 
world the cesiumfueled clocks at richmond which measure time by 
the radioactive elements rate of decay are checked constantly 
against those in washington to prevent errors 
the exact time is shared with other points by bouncing the 
information off satellites even at the speed of light phone lines 
are useless for comparing the readings because switching stations 
can slow the signals 
however most of the staffs time is spent looking upward the 
60foot diameter radiotelescope seeks out quasars small sources of 
intense radio emissions billions of lightyears away at the edge of 
the visible universe 
if one of them seems to be moving we know its really the 
earth thats wobbling says ms babcock the measurements are 
constantly checked and rechecked to see how the earth and points on 
its surface are changing 
in addition researchers from the wettzell station in west 
germany are using a mobile laser telescope to fire green light 
beams at a twofoot orbiting lageos satellite covered with 40 
fourinch mirrors the beam bounces 3500 miles back to show up on 
a screen in a trailer crammed with electronic equipment 
you can do a lot of things with this information its a very 
accurate position fix for a satellite or for points on earth 
says german scientist walter etling distances over 1000 miles can 
be calculated to within an inch or two using this method he says 
the richmond scientists plan to install by years end a gravity 
meter a metal ball suspended in a magnetic field that can measure 
minute changes in mass below it and ms babcock hopes to install a 
laser system that can bounce beams off mirrors left on the lunar 
surface by us and soviet moonwalkers 
the new systems may eventually have to replace the observatorys 
optical telescope which will become as useless as washingtons 
when encroaching development lights up the night skies and makes 
stargazing impossible 
ms babcock has no doubt ever more exotic measuring sticks will 
be available in this field the technology is changing so fast 
we never really get to a standard system

experts hope a boat found near a pharoahs 
pyramid will answer questions about ancient egypt but theyre not 
studying the way it was built theyre looking at the wood its 
made of 
there are 2 centuries of information in one piece of wood 
from that boat says peter i kuniholm a cornell university 
archaeologist and treering expert who is studying pencillike 
cores drilled out of the planks of the 30footlong boat probably 
buried more than 3800 years ago in dashur 
it and three similar boats were buried near the pyramid complex 
of senwosret iii so he could use them in the afterlife says diana 
craig patch the carnegie museum of natural history egyptologist 
industrialist andrew carnegie bought the boat in 1901 and 
shipped it from egypt to pittsburgh two of the others are at the 
egyptian museum in cairo and the third is at the field museum of 
natural history in chicago 
kuniholm hopes rings in the samples will pinpoint the boats age 
and create a framework to help date egyptian objects and determine 
when events occurred 
dendrochronology the science of tree ring dating was 
established in 1930 when andrew e douglass of the university of 
arizona studieaille said 
you take living trees of a particular species in a particular 
area and you measure the pattern of wide and narrow rings he 
said you can then go back to ancient timbers from buildings for 
example and measure the ring patterns and if they overlap in 
time you should be able to link those patterns together 
youre basically piecing together this master pattern which 
is anchored at the present day

only in recent years though has enough wood been collected 
from medieval ruins ice layers artifacts and other sources to 
date objects more than 5000 years old said michael gl baillie 
of queens university in belfast ireland 
the science increasingly is revealing more than just the age of 
objects including data about the weather or environment 5000 
years ago the spacing of rings represents time intervals when 
trees were alive and growing the width of each ring reflects the 
weather each growing season and comparison of many samples from 
one region gives a climate pattern 
you take living trees of a particular species in a particular 
area and you measure the pattern of wide and narrow rings 
baillie said you can then go back to ancient timbers from

the deposits that clog the bodys arteries 
contributing to heart disease and other problems may result in 
part from hormones produced by the arteries themselves new 
research suggests 
our results illustrate that the cells of the blood vessel wall 
are not mere bystanders in disease of the blood vessel wall but can 
play an active role by secreting important hormones says dr 
peter libby of tufts university 
deposits on the artery walls contribute to heart attacks high 
blood pressure and other circulatory problems these deposits 
known as plaque are made of fat as well as overgrowth of smooth 
muscle cells 
the new research shows that muscle cells taken from plaques 
produce a powerful hormone plateletderived growth factor that 
stimulates the muscle cells to grow if so arteries may become 
clogged because their cells are both producing this hormone and 
responding to it by growing why is still unclear 
plateletderived growth factor was first isolated from 
platelets blood cells that help to form clots however research 
has shown that other cells can also make this hormone 
the study reported in the new england journal of medicine was 
conducted on cells in test tubes researchers say cells in the body 
may act differently

experts hope surrogate mothers will 
help save the endangered florida panther 
the implantation of 10 embryos one of them half panther in 
two texas mountain lions marks the second use of in vitro 
fertilization in cats says tom logan of the state game and 
freshwater fish commission the success rate for the procedure in 
humans is about 17 percent since its only been done to one other 
cat and since that was only a month ago theres no way of telling 
what the odds are for our two surrogate mothers 
researchers mixed 50 eggs from three texas mountain lions with 
sperm from a florida panther and two mountain lions to get the 
embryos which were implanted june 3 by dr melody roelke at the 
university of florida veterinary school 
we should be happy if even one embryo is carried to full term 
and is born said roelke of the florida panther reintroduction 
project pregnancies in the cats are 93 days long 
mountain lions are used because they are nearly identical 
biologically to panthers and because wildlife laws forbid the use 
of endangered animals in any experimental program experts believe 
no more than 30 panthers remain 
the first in vitro attempt was last month at the national zoo 
logan said that involved a leopard cat said roelke

neurological disorder that affects 500000 americans 
parkinsons is a progressive destruction of nerve cells victims 
suffer tremors and increasing muscle stiffness until they cannot 
move normally 
in the experimental therapy a small cluster of brain tissue is 
removed from an aborted fetus and injected into the patient near 
the base of the brain in animals the fetal cells develop into 
nerve cells that produce dopamine a central nervous system

researchers say theyre on the trail of a gene 
that could lead to a blood test to identify people vulnerable to 
alcoholism 
a study of 30 families each with at least two alcoholic male 
siblings showed a possible link between alcoholism and the mns 
blood group a genetic marker determining blood type says shirley 
y hill of the university of pittsburghs western psychiatric 
institute amp clinic 
eventually we may be able to screen people and tell them how 
great their risk is of being an alcoholic ms hill says 
among members of any one family the alcoholics mns blood group 
had similarities not apparent among the blood group in the 
nonalcoholics she says we dont know what the gene is it 
could be a gene that affects the way people react to alcohol the 
way the brain reacts it could be a gene thats important in 
developing a compulsive personality 
research points to the existence of such a gene but not its 
location studies show that children of alcoholics face four times 
the risk of becoming alcoholics themselves even when separated 
from the alcoholic parents at birth and adopted by a nonalcoholic 
mother and father ms hill says 
the findings are to be published in the journal alcoholism

toward tightening the requirements for deciding whether mutual 
funds can describe themselves as noload funds 
in noload funds which many investors prefer no sales fee is 
charged but since 1980 noload funds have been allowed to use 
some of the money from investors to pay for certain sales and 
promotional expenses 
the commission voted 40 friday to ask for comment on a proposal 
that would tighten regulation of how these expenses are assessed 
against mutual funds it would also prohibit funds that assess 
these hidden charges from describing themselves as noload funds

still pictures and written words may capture 
high school and college graduates best memories but a video 
yearbook is whats needed to really go beyond the sounds of 
silence students and industry executives say 
there are a number of pitches we use said bob levitan 
president of durham ncbased yearbook enterprises it brings 
those black and white photos to life by capturing the excitement 
and emotion that a print yearbook cant always do 
levitan said his company like others in the field dont try to 
undercut sales of the traditional yearbook but offer the video as a 
supplement 
videos cost between 20 and 40 depending on their length which 
can range from 30 minutes to 90 minutes 
a yearbook which must go to print midway through the second 
half of the school year cannot always include things like senior 
prom and graduation 
yearbook enterprises works with about 50 colleges and high 
schools in teaching students how to use video equipment and buying 
the rights to songs that young filmmakers want to use as background 
music 
its educational said levitan who filmed duke universitys 
yearbook for two years before graduating in 1983 students grew 
up watching mtv this is an opportunity to create with video 
theyre creating their own mtv 
one student attracted by the idea was john zager an 18yearold 
senior at lawrenceville prep 
he has coordinated filming and sales of his schools video 
yearbook which sells for 3995 for the past two years he said 
sales expanded this year because more students became aware of a 
videos knack to recapture the feeling of student plays and 
homecoming football games 
theres something about sitting down and watching events in 
color said zager of wayne it gives you an honest sense of 
the school 
princeton junior caroline havens who worked on her schools 
30minute video agreed 
this is a more living type of yearbook said the 20year 
junior from new london conn we dont try to downplay 
traditional yearbooks but this is a lot more lively 
the video yearbook companies take different approaches at 
campus camera a new jersey company cofounded by two former 
cameramen from an atlantic city television station the philosophy 
is leave the filmmaking to us 
our quality of equipment is equivalent to a tv station 
coowner david pashuck said i wouldnt hand that over to a 
student 
pashuck said students also might tend to only film their 
friends outside cameramen prevent that and guarantee a quality 
product 
and pashuck and his partner have enjoyed their first year with 
the two schools mainland regional high school in linwood and 
mater dei high school in middletown that theyve worked with 
pashuck said campus camera like other video yearbook 
enterprises will grow in the years ahead by capitalizing on 
peoples expanding familiarity with video equipment 
steve sullivan the 30yearold head of dallasbased video 
yearbook inc said the job brings smiles in addition to profits 
ive been doing some of the shooting myself sullivan said 
the excitement you forget about it once you get out of high 
school this is one way to keep it forever

for ashland oil inc 1988 has been one 
public relations disaster after another 
first there was an oil spill then there were complaints about 
pollution now a federal trial has gone against it 
it all started jan 2 when a 4milliongallon storage tank 
collapsed near pittsburgh sending more than 700000 gallons of 
diesel fuel into the monongahela and ohio rivers in one of the 
worst inland oil spills in us history 
two weeks later the company was fined 95000 for violating air 
pollution standards at its catlettsburg refinery 
state air quality officials received 80 complaints from nearby 
residents during three weeks in february and march 
in midmarch a report by the federal environmental protection 
agency said ashland had violated regulations at its hazardouswaste 
dump near the refinery 
but perhaps the biggest public relations problem of all hit 
friday when a us district court jury in covington ruled that the 
company engaged in racketeering in 1980 when it made payments to 
foreign government officials to obtain crude oil 
the jury awarded nearly 70 million to former vice presidents 
bill mckay and harry williams who said they had been fired for 
refusing to take part in the payments and for telling us 
government agencies about the money 
ashland oil which is kentuckys largest corporation and the 
nations largest independent oil refiner said it would appeal 
whether the awards are whittled down by higher courts remains to be 
seen but the company expects any payment to be covered by a 75 
million policy with home insurance co 
money aside however observers say ashland has an image problem 
the public perception is that something must be wrong if it 
the case has gone this far said larry lad an assistant 
professor of management at indiana university 
louisville attorney charles h zimmerman jr said some lawyers 
following the case figured ashland would win by persuading jurors 
its past business practices were commonplace 
zimmerman said the jurys decision may reflect some anger among 
consumers there is the feeling that big business the fortune 
500 companies have gotten away with murder he said 
a public explanation might improve ashlands image suggested 
gerald meyers former chairman of american motors corp and author 
of when it hits the fan a book on corporate crises 
the way to lose in the court of public opinion is to hide 
behind your lawyers meyers said 
he said the burden of repairing the companys public image rests 
with its current chairman john hall nobody is as believable as 
the chief executive officer meyers said 
thats a notion hall reinforced in january when he drew 
national praise for publicly discussing the massive oil spill 
ashland spokesman dan lacy said saturday that he thinks hall 
will make a statement although it wont come until the company 
files legal motions related to fridays decision ashland has 10 
days to do so 
lacy said the public relations problems have masked an otherwise 
good financial year for the company 
in the six months that ended march 31 ashland earned 67 
million not including a onetime gain of 31 million compared 
with 22 million a year earlier revenue also rose to 39 billion 
from 32 billion in 1987 
if you really want to know how the year has been for the 
company it has been very good lacy said i think the 
shareholders are pleased by the performance of the company 
ashland has interests in petroleum coal chemicals and 
construction

foreign ministers of the 12nation european 
economic community on monday approved an accord establishing formal 
relations with the sovietled council for mutual economic 
assistance or comecon 
the agreement was initialled by eec and comecon officials last 
week in moscow it is to be put into force at an official signing 
ceremony in luxembourg on june 25 
the pact sets the stage for exchanges of information but doesnt 
establish bilateral trade relations 
it marks the communist blocs first official recognition of the 
eec since the common market was created 31 years ago for years 
moscow and its communist allies virtually ignored the eec calling 
it a quasimilitary extension of the americanled nato alliance 
the eec and comecon have been negotiating the terms of a joint 
declaration on mutual recognition since september 1985 
eec member nations include britain west germany france 
italy ireland luxembourg belgium netherlands denmark greece 
spain and portugal 
moscows partners in comecon are poland romania hungary 
bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany cuba vietnam and mongolia 
trade between eec and comecon members totaled about 50 billion 
last year about half of which was between the eec and the soviet 
union according to the june issue of eastwest publications a 
brusselsbased newsletter 
the eec has sought to emphasize bilateral contacts with the 
comecon member countries rather than bloctobloc relations this 
is mainly because the common market says comecon does not have 
equivalent authority to decide trade and other issues for its 
members 
last week the soviet union and east germany submitted formal 
requests to open their own bilateral diplomatic relations with the 
eec 
the eec hopes to wrap up a bilateral trade and cooperation 
agreement with hungary this year during their luxembourg meeting 
the foreign ministers gave the eec negotiators new instructions for 
the hungary talks

takeover strategist carl c icahn says he 
discussed a joint acquisition of texaco inc with two canadian oil 
concerns and that citibank verbally agreed to finance such a deal 
the disclosures were contained in a weekend deposition of 
texacos largest shareholder conducted by attorneys for the oil 
giant reported today by the wall street journal 
the deposition was part of escalating legal maneuvers between 
icahn and texaco over his attempt to buy the company for 60 a 
share which values it at 146 billion 
icahn and texaco have been engrossed in an acrimonious takeover 
dispute since last month the latest episode in the troubled oil 
giants attempt to normalize following its prolonged 
bankruptcycourt ordeal 
the investor who owns 148 percent of texaco stock is 
conducting a proxy fight for five seats on the companys board in 
an effort to pressure management into letting shareholders vote on 
his takeover offer results of the proxy contest will be disclosed 
at the companys annual meeting this friday 
icahn disclosed to texaco lawyers that in the last two weeks he 
held separate discussions toward a possible takeover partnership 
with gulf canada ltd and husky oil ltd icahn also said a citibank 
representative assured him that financing a texaco takeover was 
eminently doable 
his disclosures could substantiate texacos claim that icahn has 
improperly failed to disclose the extent of his takeover talks with 
other parties icahn has denied any wrongdoing 
other court documents unsealed at the request of the new york 
times indicate icahn once tried to arrange the purchase of a large 
stake in texaco held by the investment firm kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co to canadian investor marc belzberg but the deal 
never happened because of a price disagreement 
texaco attorneys say those documents suggest icahn may have 
improperly attempted to find allies for coordinated purchases of 
texaco stock as part of a broader plan to take over the company 
icahn has denied such charges in the past 
on friday icahn said he was forming a new holding company to 
act as his sole vehicle for acquisitions including a bid for 
texaco he said the holding company intended to raise up to 325 
billion through an offering of stock and debt securities 
the icahn group of companies also will contribute equity to the 
holding company including its 361 million shares of texaco and 
its interests in trans world airlines inc and acf a leasing 
company 
icahn began acquiring texaco stock last year when the company 
was mired in bankruptcycourt proceedings and its stock was trading 
20 lower than the current price of about 51 a share 
texaco sought federal bankruptcy protection in april 1987 when 
it faced a record 1053 billion judgment to pennzoil co awarded 
by a texas jury that found texaco improperly interfered with 
pennzoils attempt to buy getty oil co texaco settled with 
pennzoil two months ago by paying it 3 billion and has proposed a 
postbankruptcy recovery involving the sale of 5 billion in assets

opec ministers today met informally to 
discuss whether to change their existing oil production quota amid 
speculation that the talks have stalled 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries on sunday 
adjourned its regular midyear conference to allow the 13nation 
cartels oil ministers to informally discuss disagreements 
the conference began saturday and will resume tuesday 
the ministers have been considering whether to change an 
existing agreement among 12 of the members that limits their oil 
production to 1506 million barrels a day 
that quota which was extended in december and expires june 30 
was aimed at supporting oil prices at 18 a barrel 
iraq has refused to sign the agreement because it wants an 
output quota equal to that of iran iraq at war with iran since 
september 1980 was granted a quota of 154 million barrels a day 
in a previous agreement irans daily quota is 2369 million 
barrels 
some opec members want to cut production to push oil prices up 
while others want to increase output or at least hold it steady to 
take advantage of an expected increase in demand later this year 
but analysts believe opec is so deeply divided it will extend 
the existing agreement for at least three months 
we are working on compromise indonesian oil minister 
ginandjar kartasasmita said today there are agreements on most 
of the issues 
he said he strongly believed the cartel would make a decision 
either tuesday or wednesday 
there will definitely be an agreement added saudi arabian 
oil minister hisham nazer 
but ministerial sources from two countries also said sunday that 
the cartel expecting a stalemate was most likely to extend the 
current production quota 
theres a degree of disappointment and confusion said alan 
sinclair an oil analyst at the london investment firm smith new 
court ltd 
adding to the confusion was the departure of two arab oil 
ministers with one expected to return by tuesday but the other 
saying he might not 
mana saeed oteiba the united arab emirates oil minister said 
sunday he was returning to his country for consultations with his 
government and that he might or might not return he gave no reason 
for his sudden departure 
kuwaiti oil minister ali khalifa sabah will leave today but 
will return in time for the tuesday session members of his 
delegation said 
observers speculated that sabah was going to london to appear 
before the british governments monopolies and mergers commission 
about kuwaits purchase of more than 20 percent of british 
petroleum co earlier this year 
the fact that oteiba must consult with his supeiors is very 
reminiscent of a stall its awfully convenient isnt it said 
peter gignoux managing director of the international energy 
department at shearson lehman hutton inc in london 
oil markets were disappointing today with the spot price of 
north sea brent blend the most widely traded international crude 
oil falling to 55 cents to 1530 a barrel and then held steady on 
the spot market 
the 13 members of the cartel are algeria ecuador gabon 
indonesia iran iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia 
united arab emirates and venezuela

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that states indirectly may tax interest paid to financial 
institutions from investments in federal home loan bank bonds 
the court citing the lack of a substantial federal 
question rejected a challenge to a maryland bank franchise tax 
the maryland national bank challenged the tax seeking a refund 
of 197310 it paid under protest to the state for the years 1979 
through 1982 
during that period the bank reported 282 million in interest 
from fhlb bonds 
the sum was included in the banks net earnings that were 
subject to marylands franchise tax which is imposed on financial 
institutions for the privilege of doing business in maryland 
the difficulty over whether earnings from fhlb bonds are taxable 
arises because of two apparently conflicting federal laws 
a 1932 law that created the fhlb generally exempts the bonds 
from taxes 
but a law enacted in 1862 permits states to levy a 
nondiscriminatory franchise tax on stocks and obligations of 
the united states government that generally are exempt from state 
and local taxes 
the maryland court of appeals upheld the state franchise tax 
ruling in october that the 1862 law takes precedence 
the state court based its ruling in part on a 1975 opinion by 
the general counsels office of the federal home loan bank board 
the state court said a franchise tax paid for the privilege of 
doing business in the state is not the same as a direct tax on a 
banks income 
the state court also said the tax does not violate the 
constitutions supremacy clause which binds states to adhere to 
federal law 
the case is maryland national bank vs state department of 
assessments 871080

wheat futures were lower from the start reflecting weekend 
rains in the droughtstricken northern plains analysts said

he noted that the november soybean contract for delivery of 
newcrop beans fluctuated within a 9cent range in the sessions

the supreme court today barred states from 
banning all direct mail advertisements sent by lawyers to potential 
clients 
the court by a 63 vote ruled in a kentucky case that states 
violate freespeech rights when they prohibit lawyers from 
soliciting business by sending truthful and nondeceptive letters to 
people they know face particular legal problems 
writing for the court justice william j brennan said states 
may require lawyers to file copies of such soliciting letters with 
a state agency authorized to penalize actual abuses 
but brennan said the potential for abuse does not justify a 
total ban as imposed in kentucky 
our recent decisions involving commercial speech have been 
grounded in the faith that the free flow of commercial information 
is valuable enough to justify imposing on wouldbe regulators the 
costs of distinguishing the truthful from the false the helpful 
from the misleading and the harmless from the harmful brennan 
said 
he was joined by justices byron r white thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun john paul stevens and anthony m kennedy 
the three dissenters chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia said it was time 
to overturn the 1977 supreme court decision that first overturned 
the legal professions longtime ban on any type of lawyer 
advertising 
rather than continuing to work out all the consequences of 
the 1977 rulings approach we should now return to the states the 
legislative function that has so inappropriately been taken from 
them in the context of attorney advertising oconnor wrote for 
the three 
the courts 1977 decision said a total ban on lawyer advertising 
violates freespeech rights 
like other commercial speech however lawyer ads are 
constitutionally protected only when truthful and nondeceptive 
the court in 1978 expressly prohibited lawyers from seeking 
business through inperson solicitation of people known to have 
legal problems 
but today the court said that in some cases solicitation 
through direct mailings must be allowed 
admittedly a letter that is personalized to the recipient 
presents an increased risk of deception intentional or 
inadvertent brennan said but merely because targeted 
directmail solicitation presents lawyers with opportunities for 
isolated abuses or mistakes does not justify a total ban on that 
mode of protected commercial speech he added 
kentuckys total ban fashioned by the states supreme court 
follows the american bar association model rule that directmail 
solicitation be banned when a significant motive for the lawyers 
doing so is the lawyers pecuniary gain 
the aba model now declared constitutionally unsound has been 
adopted by idaho nevada north carolina washington and wyoming 
three states arizona arkansas and indiana adopted 
directmail bans more restrictive than the aba model they also now 
are likely to fall in the face of a freespeech challenge 
in kentucky the ban on targeted directmail ads was challenged 
by richard d shapero a louisville lawyer 
shapero had wanted to send a letter to potential clients against 
whom foreclosure lawsuits had been filed but he was told that 
mailing such a solicitation would violate the state lawyerethics 
rules 
shaperos case now returns to the kentucky supreme court for 
further study 
the case is shapero vs kentucky bar association 87l6

united states fell for the second straight week to 889 down nine 
rigs from the previous week baker hughes inc reports 
after jumping 13 two weeks ago the count fell by seven in the 
tally announced last week 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs producing oil 
the rig count totaled 814 a year ago 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
the rig count reached a peak of 4500 active rigs in december 
1981 which was the height of the oil boom but oil prices plunged 
to less than 10 per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the 
rig count went with it dropping to 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states oklahoma lost 11 rigs kansas

the supreme court today allowed banks to use 
subsidiaries to engage in underwriting and dealing in some 
securities 
the court over two dissenting votes let stand a ruling that 
such activity does not violate a 1933 law aimed primarily at 
protecting the financial stability of banks by restricting them 
from speculating in stocks and bonds 
justices harry a blackmun and sandra day oconnor voted to hear 
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such 
review 
the 1933 federal law the glasssteagall act was passed by 
congress in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929 
the law placed various restrictions on banks in large measure 
to protect deposits from being squandered on wall street 
in recent years the wall of separation between commercial and 
investment bank activities has been lowered 
at issue in the case acted on today were rulings by the federal 
reserve board allowing some of the nations leading banks to use 
subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in municipal revenue bonds 
mortgagerelated securities and commercial paper the latter is a 
form of iou used by corporations to finance shortterm debt 
the federal reserve board last year said bank subsidiaries may 
underwrite and deal in such securities as long as they do not 
exceed 5 to 10 percent of the subsidarys gross revenue 
the board said that is in line with the glassstegall acts 
requirement that banks may not affiliate with an organization 
engaged principally in underwriting or dealing in securities 
the boards rulings were challenged by the securities industry 
association a trade group of underwriters brokers andd securities 
dealers 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in february upheld the 
federal reserve board decisions and the reagan administration 
urged the justices to leave intact the appeals court rulng 
justice department lawyers said the federal reserve board acted 
properly and that any change in banking regulations should be left 
to congress 
the government noted that a moratorium congress imposed on the 
type of banking activities involved in the dispute expired in 
march and congress has not renewed it moreover legislation is 
pending to repeal parts of the glasssteagall act 
reacting to todays decision edward i obrien president of 
the securities industry association said we are disappointed 
the supreme court decided not to hear our appeal to prevent banks 
through affiliates from engaging in a wide range of securities 
but we are pleased the federal reserve itself has erected a 
series of firewalls to prevent banks from taking excessive 
risks within the securities arena which would further weaken banks 
and thus endanger the nations economy obrien said 
charles pistor president of the american bankers association 
said this is another hole in the anticompetitive glasssteagall 
act and another important victory for consumers but before large 
numbers of bank customers will benefit we need to repeal the 
glasssteagall act and allow all banks to offer securities 
services 
the case is securities industry association vs federal reserve

a poll released monday found that only four of 
1500 americans could name the japanese prime minister while 90 
percent of 2000 japanese knew the us president was named ronald 
reagan 
for the record the japanese leader is noboru takeshita the 
leader of japans dominant liberal democratic party who succeeded 
yasuhiro nakasone as prime minister seven months ago after serving 
as finance minister in nakasones cabinet 
the poll was conducted jointly in may by the tokyo broadcasting 
system and cbs most of the questions involved trade issues 
seventytwo percent of the americans polled said they favored 
protection for domestic agricultural markets while about 60 
percent of the 2000 japanese surveyed said the same about their 
markets 
fortythree percent of americans said japans barriers on 
imports of us beef and citrus fruit were improper and only 14 
percent considered them fair 
among japanese respondents 59 percent said the restrictions 
were fair and 29 percent unfair 
the network released the survey results on its news programs one 
day before deputy us trade representative michael smith reopens 
stalemated talks with japanese officials over beef and orange 
imports in tokyo 
japan has said it will phase out beef import restrictions over a 
threeyear period but needs a 70 percent tariff on us beef to 
keep prices in line with domestic levels us officials want a 
substantially lower tariff 
us negotiators are also expected to urge japan to liberalize 
its citrus market in three years instead of the fiveyear period 
proposed by tokyo 
the margin of error in the poll was not specified

a us supreme court ruling monday on 
vaccine liability likely affects only a small group of 
pharmaceutical manufacturers but may substantially change how the 
government approves future inoculations industry analysts said 
the nations high court said those harmed by a vaccine can sue 
the government agencies that approved its use 
this is very good for the vaccine companies but there are not 
that many of them said richard vieter a drug industry analyst 
with merrill lynch co one might look ahead to vaccines such as 
aids vaccines and other biotech applications though 
it seems the government will have to exert quite a bit more 
care in the approval process to prevent placing the government in a 
liability situation vieter said 
the court in a 90 vote reinstated a suit by the parents of a 
pennsylvania boy who contracted polio after receiving a dose of a 
federally approved vaccine manufactured by lederle laboratories of 
wayne nj a subsidiary of american cyanimid 
richard stover an analyst with smith barney in new york said 
the question of whether the government can be held liable for 
approving drugs and vaccines that eventually harm someone has been 
hotly debated for years 
it should be very significant for that part of the industry 
and lederle in particular he said 
martha homma a spokesman for lederle said the companys top 
executives and legal department want to study the decision before 
issuing a comment 
lederle shares the majority of the vaccine production business 
in the united states with merck co of rahway nj american home 
products wyeth division of new york and cdc life sciences inc a 
canadian company 
officials from american home products and merck co also 
declined to comment though one merck executive said its about 
time the government is held accountable for the approval process 
mark grayson a spokesman for the pharmaceutical manufacturers 
association said the groups legal department also wants to study 
the decision before any statement is made 
justice department lawyers argued before the court that if such 
damage suits are allowed the us food and drug administration 
which currently tests and licenses vaccines may be forced into the 
business of insuring them jeopardizing the entire drugapproval 
process 
the polio vaccine orimun a form of sabin oral vaccine was 
administered to 3monthold kevan berkovitz in 1979 three months 
later the child contracted polio and is now paralyzed partially 
deformed and can breathe only with the help of a machine 
the vaccine was approved by the federal government in 1963 the 
berkovitzs suit was rejected by the 3rd us circuit court of 
appeals in philadelphia in 1987

us trade figures and the toronto economic summit

after falling more than 7 an ounce in europe republic national 
bank of new york quoted gold at 44970 a troy ounce as of 4 pm 
edt up from 449 late friday 
foreignexchange dealers attributed the sluggish trading partly 
to their own reluctance to speculate about the dollars movement 
prior to the commerce departments report on the us trade deficit 
for april due tuesday morning 
the trade numbers are a powerful influence on the dollar because 
they have become the most visible symbol of the united states 
unrelenting appetite for imports a sensitive political and 
economic issue 
the nations deficit shrank to a threeyear low of 97 billion 
in march surprising many traders and giving the dollar a 
substantial boost but some fear the march number was grossly low 
and the april deficit could therefore be unexpectedly high despite 
a strengthening of us exports in recent months 
estimates on the april deficit ranged from below 9 billion to 
above 145 billion 
each number has exasperated traders because it is so 
unpredictable said frank watson vice president and chief 
corporate dealer in swiss bank corps new york office but last 
months numbers were so good that the chances of a surprise seem 
sort of big 
varick martin vice president of foreign exchange at union bank 
of switzerlands office in new york said another big restraint on 
trading is the summit of leaders of seven industrialized 
democracies starting sunday in toronto 
i cant expect anything to happen to the dollar even with 
the trade numbers until the toronto summit is over he said 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 12519 japanese yen up slightly 
from 12485 yen late friday later in london the dollar was quoted 
at 12510 yen by the time trading concluded in new york the

earlier in london gold fell to 449 from 45620 late friday in

thousands of migrant workers are picking 
strawberries after waiting weeks for crops to ripen and straining 
the resources of social service agencies who provided them food and 
shelter 
cool weather slowed the ripening of the strawberry crop which 
traditionally is ready for harvest by june 1 officials said an 
unusually heavy influx of 20000 migrant workers many from mexico 
and central america have been waiting for the work to begin 
warm weather over the weekend ripened many fields in the 
northwestern portion of the state and others are expected to be 
ready for picking soon oregon is the nations secondlargest 
strawberry producer after california 
a lot of fields just turned red over the weekend because of 
the good weather tom graven a division field supervisor for the 
state employment division said monday 
roy malensky owner of oregon berry processing co in hillsboro 
west of portland said it was too early to say how many of the 
migrants would be put to work because picking hasnt begun yet in 
many fields 
last year it started with a bang and kept on going this year 
its starting slowly and wont get into full flow till this 
weekend he said 
social service agencies have made repeated appeals for food and 
blankets for the migrants who hav been living with as many as 50 
others in one room 
the salvation army one of several charitable organizations 
helping feed and clothe the migrants has distributed more than 277 
tons of food and more than 100000 worth of clothing blankets and 
items such as soap detergent and cooking utensils 
once the harvest is in full swing it will considerably 
decrease the demands upon us said titus herman spokesman for 
the salvation army in portland 
i know that many of them still have obligations to contractors 
and in some cases to farmers for food titus said of the pickers 
maybe for the next couple of weeks they still will be 
technically without any money but beyond that they will have money 
and chances are the social services will be able to step out of the 
situation maybe not completely but considerably were already 
seeing a decrease in demand 
the 1987 strawberry crop ripened early and 20 percent of it was 
left in the fields because of a picker shortage growers complained 
that pickers were confused over the new immigration law and refused 
to cross the border 
the state still produced a bumper crop of 94 million pounds that 
sold for a record 315 million 
this year migrants began arriving as early as april some say 
they mistakenly were told they had to file immigration legalization 
documents by may 4 the deadline for aliens not involved in 
agricultural work 
the agricultural workers have until nov 30 to file the papers 
after that employers who hire illegal migrant workers will face 
stiff penalties

cantario petroleum ltd said monday it 
had proposed to top amoco canadas 418 billion bid for dome 
petroleum ltd but a dome executive said his company declined to 
consider the proposal because it was conditional and dome had 
questions about the financing 
brian little a dome executive told reporters that cantarios 
proposal included a condition that dome cancel its agreement to be 
acquired by amoco canada petroleum co before cantario made its 
formal offer 
the previouslyundisclosed proposal was revealed on the first 
day of a fairness hearing before justice gregory forsyth of the 
alberta court of queens bench forsyth is to decide whether to 
allow amoco to close the acquisition deal that dome shareholders 
approved last week 
when forsyth asked which parties objected to the deal a lawyer 
representing toronto businessman abdul rehman told the judge that 
his client acting as an agent for cantario had proposed to pay 
about 49 billion for dome last june 
rehman was in the courtroom but refused to answer reporters 
questions about cantario or its bid 
the lawyer garold switzer told forsyth he would argue that the 
cantario bid should have been disclosed to shareholders before they 
voted on amocos offer last week shareholders who voted 88 
percent in favor of accepting amocos offer were not informed of 
the offer 
little said the cantario offer wasnt disclosed because we 
didnt think there was anything to disclose 
dome asked cantario to remove the condition on its offer and was 
ready to review it little said but cantario said its bid was 
valid only if the amoco deal ended 
little said cantario told dome it had a line of credit with a 
major canadian bank but that the chairman of the bank denied the 
line of credit existed he said dome went back to cantario and was 
told cantario was trying to arrange credit with another bank but 
never got back to dome 
when asked by reporters why cantario hadnt gone public with its 
bid before now switzer said his client had hoped one of the other 
parties to the amoco deal would succeed in blocking it

chinas industrial output should grow by 163 
percent during the first three quarters of this year while the 
inflation rate could reach 13 percent during that time according 
to an official report 
the china daily quoted wu minglu economist for the national 
research center for the development of science and technology as 
saying industrial output will total 236 billion in the first nine 
months of the year 
at the end of april chinas industrial output value was 179 
percent higher than at the same time last year the fastest growth 
in two years 
the chinese government has expressed concern about the rapid 
growth rate and tried to clamp down on credit and the beginning of 
new construction projects 
the high growth rate led by expansion of light industry has 
strained government finances and depleted scarce raw materials 
needed for key heavy industry projects 
in 1987 industrial output rose by 165 percent while the gross 
national product grew by 94 percent 
chinas commodity retail volume was up by 231 percent and 
retail prices rose 107 percent in the first quarter of this year 
both highs for the past several years 
wu said that as the state moves to end price controls over more 
commodities inflation will continue to rise hitting 12 percent in 
the second quarter and 13 percent in the third 
chinese economists regard inflation spurred by rising consumer 
demand and the removal of price controls on some food products as 
the most serious issue confronting the nations economic reforms

a federal court jury for the first time held 
a cigarette company partly responsible for the death of a smoker 
finding monday that liggett group inc failed to warn the public 
about the dangers of cigarettes and violated its promise to produce 
a safe product 
the jury awarded 400000 to antonio cipollone whose wife rose 
died of lung cancer in 1984 but rejected his claim of a conspiracy 
among the three tobacco companies that produced the products his 
wife used 
the damage award was based on the jurys finding that liggett 
violated its expressed promise to consumers to make a safe product 
thus contributing to mrs cippollones death 
it also found that liggett failed to warn the public about the 
dangers of cigarettes but awarded no damages because it found mrs 
cipollone 80 percent responsible for her death 
liggett lorillard inc and philip morris inc were exonerated 
of conspiring to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking 
the jury awarded no punitive damages 
mrs cipollone who was 58 when she died smoked chesterfield 
and lampm cigarettes both made by liggett before congress required 
the us surgeon generals health warnings on cigarette packs in 
1966 she smoked for 40 years later using brands made by lorillard 
and philip morris 
the tobacco companies have claimed for the last 20 years that 
they are invincible said alan darnell an attorney for 
cipollone this shows they are not they are just like any 
other company 
liggett attorney james kearney said he was pleased by the 
verdict the jury specifically rejected any claims of punitive 
damages he said the floodgates have been closed even firmer 
than they were before 
cipollones main attorney marc z edell said he was unsure 
whether the verdict would lead to more tobacco liability suits 
i think the jury for whatever reason didnt like rose 
cipollone thats the problem they never met rose cipollone he 
said 
however liggett attorney donald cohn said he regarded the 
jurys award of 400000 as sympathy and said he would appeal 
edell cipollones attorney said he would ask the judge to 
overturn the jurys decision that liggett pay no damages for the 
suffering of mrs cipollone that money would have gone to her 
estate unlike the 400000 that goes to cipollone 
cipollone 64 of lakehurst said he was glad the trial was 
over and im glad the verdict came out halfway a win 
it wasnt 100 percent im glad that we won partial but its 
a start he said 
asked if his wife would be happy about the jurys findings he 
said i dont really know she started the suit and i told her 
id continue til the end 
the jury began deliberations last tuesday as the forewoman 
answered each question from the court clerk a gasp rose from the 
courtroom packed with industry lawyers analysts and reporters 
this is basically a victory for the defense cohn said 
the tobacco industry with 35 billion in revenue waged an 
extensive and expensive defense against the suit fearing that a 
loss could unleash a flood of multimillion dollar liability 
lawsuits 
cipollones attorneys had said the case was especially 
significant because they got permission to introduce numerous 
secret corporate documents that spoke of a gentlemans 
agreement not to do cancer research of an industry strategy to 
create doubt about the health charge without actually denying 
it and of a research program designed so that results cannot 
harm the industry 
the companies said statements in the documents represented the 
views of individuals and were taken out of context 
us financial markets were closed when the verdict was 
returned one analyst suggested tobacco stocks might suffer early 
in tuesday trading but the decision would be considered an industry 
victory in the long term 
i consider this a major plus for the cigarette companies it 
is a loss but not a major loss said allan kaplan a tobacco 
industry analyst with merrill lynch 
during the fourmonth trial cipollone charged that lorillard 
liggett and philip morris misled the public about the dangers of 
cigarette smoking and contributed to mrs cipollones death 
the companies contended that she knew the risks but chose to 
smoke anyway they also argued that smoking is not a proven cause 
if cancer and that her type of cancer hasnt been linked to 
cigarettes anyway 
to support the suits contention that liggett violated its 
promise to consumers edell introduced examples of liggetts 
advertising from the 1950s one said rosalind russell says lampm 
filters are just what the doctor ordered another ad said 
nose throat and accessory organs not adversely affected by 
smoking chesterfields another said play safe smoke 
chesterfields 
on wednesday the jury asked to see a copy of testimony she gave 
to lawyers the year of her death and trial testimony by an 
addiction expert who certified mrs cipollone was dependent on 
cigarettes 
on friday they asked if the 1984 surgeon generals report on 
smoking and health was in evidence and whether they could see it 
it was not and the judge said they could not 
the suit filed in federal court aug 1 1983 is one of only a 
dozen or so to go to a jury hundreds of others were dismissed or 
faded away in the face of the overwhelming legal strength of a 
wellheeled industry another hundred are pending with lawyers in
