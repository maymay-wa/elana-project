technicians used glue for a quick fix 
on atlantis nose wednesday and began loading the space shuttle with 
fuel for a thursday launch on a topsecret military mission an 
approaching storm loomed as the only obstacle to liftoff 
the glue was a lastminute substitute for two bolts on an access 
panel that could not be tightened replacing them would have meant a 
delay 
after deciding the glue would hold nasa rolled back the service 
tower which has surrounded the shuttle clearing the way to fill the 
huge external fuel tank with a halfmillion gallons of liquid oxygen 
and liquid hydrogen 
fueling is under way thats all we can say at this point 
nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said at 1135 pm 
the start of fueling another of many milestones leading to a 
launching followed a lateevening weather assessment by shuttle 
managers 
the bolts were two of 10 that secure a 24by18 inch access cover 
on the right side of the shuttles nose the access plate which is 
covered by 14 of the shuttles heat protection tiles is normally 
removed before flight to fuel a tank for the steering rockets the 
shuttle uses while in orbit 
the problem surfaced as workmen replaced the cover 
we have to have to have assurance that panel isnt going to 
come off in flight said lisa malone a kennedy space center 
spokeswoman 
weathermen meanwhile continued to predict that there was an 80 
percent chance the weather would not permit atlantis to be launched 
on thursday 
the forecast was for low clouds winds up to 23 mph and a 40 
percent likelihood of rain 
there is a possibility that a front will come through and 
things will clear out said capt tom strange an air force 
weatherman there is a slight chance of that 
if there is sufficient clearing it will come toward the end of 
the threehour launch opportunity that begins at 632 am est 
strange said he predicted that friday morning looked slightly 
better but that winds would still be a problem 
saturday is looking a little bit better he said 
atlantis pilot guy s gardner an air force lieutenant colonel 
practiced emergency landings on the space centers threemile runway 
thursday in a plane specially outfitted to handle like the shuttle 
the four other military men on the mission shuttle commander 
robert l gibson and mission specialists richard m mullane jerry 
l ross and william m shepherd flew in t38 jets around the cape 
to acclimate their bodies to flight 
the shuttle reportedly is carrying a 500 million spy satellite 
called lacrosse which nearly fills the 60foot long cargo bay 
sources say it is to be dropped overboard and placed in a 
worldgirdling orbit that takes it over 80 percent of the soviet 
union 
its intelligence gathering ability is such according to sources 
that it can gather detailed radar images through clouds and 
darkness to help verify compliance with arms control agreements 
it eventually will serve as a radar eye to guide americas b2 
stealth bomber 
at this space center the launch control room will be manned only 
by personnel with top secret clearances and the flight will be 
directed from another secure control center at nasas johnson space 
center in houston once the satellite is released its radioed 
commands will come from an air force facility in sunnyvale calif 
all spacetoground communication will be encoded and there will 
be only the barest of public announcements in contrast with the 
launchtoliftoff eavesdropping that is usual on shuttle missions 
lt col joe purka an air force spokesman said the odds were 
only one in five that the weather would meet minimum requirements 
for landing on the runway should an emergency develop in the early 
minutes of flight 
the forecast was for clouds at 4000 feet over the runway 
mission rules say clouds can be no lower than 8000 feet 
the rules include winds of no more than 19 mph from the south or 
28 mph from any direction no rain at the pad or in the flight path 
and no thunderstorms within five miles

knock em out john if jerry clower 
isnt right back on route 4 in the very backwoods the country humor 
king visits in tall tales of his youth in rural mississippi 
clowers back with the ledbetters the eubanks the prize hounds 
and his raccoonchasing cousins its where his mama cooked chicken 
for the preacher and his uncles prize cows were gunned down in a 
bird hunt gone sour 
his new house in the eastfork community between liberty and 
mccomb in southern mississippi must share the title home with 
yazoo city where he and his wife of 41 years raised four head of 
children and where clower began his career as a country humorist 
but it was right here at route 4 liberty where i first saw the 
light of day clower said of his return to rural amite county 
we lived in yazoo city for 35 years and we have a lot of friends 
there but after we put the last of our kids in college mama and i 
decided to go back home 
the clower home is a twostory structure with large white 
columns a great big brick porch hardwood flooring and a 
fireplace clower said 
my mother lives right here in the old home place and my 
brother sonny who choked the rat to death at rat killin time is 
here too said clower a member of the grand ole opry who has 
traveled the globe spreading smiles about life growing up in the 
country 
its where we used to take corn to the grist mill and sugar 
cane to the molasses mill clower said times have changed and 
now we go to the store to buy our meal and molasses but the sun 
still comes up in the same place and the amite river is still 
running 
clower said he is considering naming his 20th album with mca 
records let there be liberty 
more people have died over that one word liberty than any 
word in the history of mankind said clower who played football 
at mississippi state before joining the navy in world war ii and 
earning three battle stars and a unit citation for bravery before 
age 19 i know what it takes to keep freedom 
the move does not mean clower will be cutting back on a schedule 
that includes about 200 concerts a year 
im just as surprised about my success as a lot of other 
people clower said i was at the north carolina state fair in 
raleigh the other day and the guy who introduced me told me this was 
the largest crowd at the fair on a sunday night in 121 years 
when you keep bringing them in like that youve got to keep 
going out there and doing what you love to do 
but the humorist said he was already enjoying his return to amite 
county 
theres a special feeling about this place he said i woke 
up the last two mornings and a couple of deer have been standing in 
the back yard theres just no place like home

with little hope of winning the 
presidency venezuelas minor political parties are seeking to make 
inroads in congress in national elections dec 4 
they are counting on a major defection from the nations two main 
parties 
the small parties acknowledge that their 23 presidential 
candidates including a handful of leftists a witchdoctor some 
retired military officers and a former central bank president 
dont have a chance in the presidential balloting 
but they say widespread voter discontent with the governments 
accion democratica ad and the main opposition party copei will 
be shown in splitticket voting that could yield a congress of 182 
deputies and 44 senators with no single party in control 
it would mean a major change in recent venezuelan voting patterns 
with longerterm effects as the nation slowly decentralizes its 
political system they said 
people are not happy with ad or copei but they recognize their 
candidates have the best chance to win the presidency but their 
true electoral preference will be shown in the congressional vote 
said freddy munoz secretary general of movement to socialism mas 
venezuelas third largest electoral force 
most political analysts agree small parties the larger of which 
are left of center are likely to post gains in congress 
they note that voters associate the countrys economic slump 
about to enter its eighth year with centerright copei and 
centerleft ad 
the crisis caused by low oil prices began under a copei 
administration and has continued under current ad administration of 
president jaime lusinchi 
polls indicate that while over 75 percent of the electorate 
express a preference for either ads frontrunning candidate carlos 
andres perez or copeis eduardo fernandez only half the eligible 
voters have decided to vote for one of the two parties 
congressional slates 
the disaffection has been exacerbated by unexciting campaigns ad 
politicians bemoan the triumphalism of the partys candidates 
who have depended on perezs popularity to sweep them into office 
rather than campaigning for themselves 
mas on the other hand adopted a campaign strategy that 
deemphasized the campaign of its presidential candidate former 
guerrilla teodoro petkoff in favor of its congressional candidates 
the ticketsplitting would be a major change from recent 
venezuelan voting patterns 
in the six elections since 1958 ad and copei alternated in the 
presidency since 1973 the two parties combined have garnered not 
less than 88 percent of the presidential vote 
minor parties had just 27 seats in the last 200member house of 
deputies including 10 from mas ad had 113 seats and copei 60 and 
some of the small parties ally themselves with ad or copei 
but even if mas gets around 15 percent of the congressional vote 
as some analysts predict it likely would have little impact on the 
direction of venezuelan politics in the short term 
with venezuelas overwhelmingly strong executive branch 
congressional action is normally limited to making minor adjustments 
to presidential initiatives 
but ticketsplitting could mean a revival of mas and the ability 
of small national or regional parties to survive until the 
presidential election in 1993 
their survival takes on more significance as the big parties 
reluctantly allow some decentralization of power to take place

paul bocuse has failed to win a guidebooks highest 
rating of four toques or hats but frances most famous chef hasnt 
lost his head 
for many in this country where food is a national obsession 
bocuse remains the emperor of cuisine despite the rating of 
three toques by the 1989 edition of the gaultmillau guidebook 
which deemed his food not in step with the times 
bocuse shrugged off the criticisms with imperial calm 
for me there is only one guidebook thats the michelin he 
said in a telephone interview from his paul bocuse restaurant at 
collongesaumontdor outside of lyon 
michelin known as the bible of gastronomy with 630000 copies 
sold annually is considered conservative it gives only a terse 
listing of addresses ratings and sometimes a few dishes and 
ratings up to a top of three stars 
the 1989 edition does not come out until march but for nearly 30 
years bocuse has enjoyed the top threestar status one of just 18 
restaurants in france with the honor last year 
gaultmillau with 200000 copies published yearly hits the 
bookshops earlier its text is peppered with colorful comments 
including feisty criticism as well as praise 
bocuse had rated four toques since 1973 but this time 
gaultmillau gave his knuckles a severe rap rating 26 other chefs 
higher 
were not putting down bocuse said christian millau 
editorinchief of the guidebook its just that bocuse has stayed 
the same while other chefs are getting ahead he really hasnt 
changed his menu in five years 
my clientele is 80 percent lyonnaise replied bocuse they 
still like the sea bass in crust the truffle soup the chicken 
poached in a bladder 
bocuse shot to fame after he was awarded the legion of honor by 
president valery giscard destaing in 1975 and supervised a menu for 
the award dinner in the elysee palace featuring the famous truffle 
soup 
he appeared on magazine covers and television shows 
globetrotting as no chef had ever done before 
it became a heady time for other chefs too who started 
emulating bocuse as celebrities some like pierre troisgros later 
awarded the legion of honor himself stayed close to the stock pots 
the frequent absences of bocuse from his restaurant began to irk 
diners and critics such as christian millau 
you cant run all over the world and still keep a perfect 
restaurant said millau he does have good chefs to replace him 
but its not the same food or atmosphere 
just back from japan where he has several luxury food shops 
bocuse didnt deny the charge yes i travel and my staff of 70 
is the top but i dont consider millau a serious critic 
ive never seen him pay his bill his book and magazine are 
truffled with ads hes mediaoriented and only interested in news 
and money 
inspectors from the michelin guide bocuse said are impartial 
anonymous and really inspect 
millau says bocuse is a restaurateur not a chef he only goes 
to market for the tv camera 
then he added dont get me wrong i really like the man he 
played a formidable role as a locomotive for other chefs an 
ambassador of cuisine abroad but he became a deity and the others 
dont need that any more 
as for nouvelle cuisine a term coined by gault and millau and 
often applied to bocuse the chef says he scorns it 
i ignore it bocuse says ive never done it my cuisine is 
one of tradition of produce and seasons this respect for tradition 
is coming back 
millau said newer chefs have dared to innovate produce cuisine 
with personality 
the latest creators getting ahead of bocuse are jacques chibois 
at the royal grey in cannes marc veyrat at the auberge de leridian 
in annecy and others millau said bocuse is a classic you 
cant put him beside the innovators

six million to 7 million people are expected to 
contract aids by 1991 far fewer than previous estimates because 
highrisk groups are taking precautions the world health 
organization said 
in march 1987 who said 50 million to 100 million people could be 
infected by 1991 with the hiv virus that causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome that report said even that estimate will be 
conservative if hiv penetrates and spreads through south america and 
asia 
in its statement tuesday who said the worldwide total of 
officially reported aids cases climbed to 129385 in 142 countries 
in november an increase of 41 percent from october 
it estimated that the true number of aids victims was twice the 
reported number and that 5 million to 10 million people worldwide 
already may be infected with the hiv virus it estimated an 
additional 6 million to 7 million would be infected in the next 
three years 
the virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers the disease 
has no known cure 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood 
products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or 
syringes by drug abusers aids can also be passed from mother to 
child at or before birth 
who has seen evidence for optimism in the question of peoples 
behavior said jonathan mann director of the organizations 
special program on aids 
we have seen dramatic evidence of behavior change in 
highrisk groups such as female prostitutes male homosexuals and 
intravenous drug users of some countries mann told a news 
conference 
he said for example that in san francisco in 1982 the 
infection rate for homosexual men was about 15 percent a year but 
the figure now is 1 percent because many gay men have begun taking 
precautions such as using condoms and reducing the number of sex 
partners he said 
in amsterdam the comparable figure has dropped from 10 percent 
in 1983 to less than 1 percent mann said 
but he cautioned that the evidence is clear that the danger is 
widespread and is continuing to spread 
mann also said who is a bit optimistic that hiv will spread 
less than earlier predicted because worldwide education programs 
have been successful in informing people how to avoid getting aids 
the world two years ago didnt know very much about aids 
mann said but he said surveys in some countries show that at least 
95 percent of those questioned know about aids and know that it can 
be transmitted sexually

hundreds of dominicans are risking 
their lives boating across dangerous waters to find jobs in the us 
commonwealth of puerto rico so they can send money and presents home 
for christmas 
do you know how sad it is to approach christmas with children 
and family and have nothing to give them to eat no clothes not 
even a ball it breaks my heart said dominican fisherman ramon 
antonio sanchez 
sanchez was one of 232 dominicans caught by authorities in a 
fiveday period that began last thursday 
officials say it is the largest number arrested in puerto ricos 
history and that the number of people attempting the passage has 
increased in the weeks before christmas 
an untold number make it across the treacherous waters of the 
90mile mona passage which separates the dominican republic from 
puerto ricos western shores 
border patrol chief joe b bennett estimates only about 10 to 15 
percent of those entering the island are caught he said 2617 
dominican aliens have been arrested since april 
bennett said the federal agency set up a year ago to deal with 
the growing problem lacks resources and manpower to guard 30 miles 
of puerto ricos western coastline 
this is too big an area to handle with what weve got said 
bennett 
he said the border patrol has only 17 agents two boats and one 
plane but that police and us coast guard often pitch in 
we dont expect it to stop before christmas he said 
in addition to a poorly guarded coastline dominicans are 
encouraged to make the trip because so many are sheltered and fed by 
puerto ricans bennett said 
to discourage the travelers the dominican government has run tv 
warnings about drownings and vicious sharks eating people whose 
boats capsize 
but they didnt deter 30yearold sanchez 
he and a group of 45 dominicans were caught over the weekend 
after their boat smashed against a reef near mona island midway 
between the dominican republic and puerto rico 
he said his group spent all their money to build a wooden 
yola as the fragile motorboats are called sanchez said a bleak 
economic picture this holiday season prompted the group to flee the 
dominican republic where inflation has risen about 60 percent and 
unemployment climbed to 30 percent in the last year 
sanchez said he would risk the trip again given the chance 
if hunger is going to kill me i prefer to be killed escaping 
or be eaten by sharks because what i want to do is work but there 
are no jobs there he said 
nidia marmolejo torres 29 ventured the trip wearing just shorts 
and tshirt she said she needed to feed her five children and was 
hoping to work as a maid or picking coffee beans 
i was willing to risk my life for this she said i see my 
children suffering and its killing me 
many dominicans sell their refrigerators ovens tv sets to come 
up with the 500 to 3000 that organizers demand for the trip 
us officials say thousands of dominicans who make it to puerto 
rico then go to the united states where about 1 million dominicans 
live entry is easier from the commonwealth because puerto ricans 
are us citizens and have american passports

nicaraguan president daniel ortega announcing 
a onemonth truce extension with contra guerrillas said he will 
take a waitandsee attitude toward the next president of the united 
states 
while the us government doesnt show a changed attitude 
toward nicaragua we cant change our own readiness up to and 
including the possibility of invasion by american troops we are in 
constant and permanent alert ortega said tuesday 
other nicraguan officials have said they expect a more 
pragmatic attitude toward nicaragua from george bushs 
administration ortega said he hopes bush will accept as a reality 
that we survived all the efforts of a superpower to destroy the 
nicaraguan revolution 
ortega who is in mexico city for the inauguration thursday of 
presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari said he had no plans to 
meet secretary of state george shultz who will represent the united 
states 
president reagan has steadfastly supported the contras since he 
took office in 1981 but congress has refused to provide money for 
weapons since march 
both the leftist sandinista government and the contras have 
accused the other of violating the ban on offensive military action 
but nicaragua has unilaterally extended the march 21 ceasefire on a 
monthtomonth basis 
the usbacked rebels called contras say the truce is 
indefinite and need not be formally extended every month 
ortega at a news conference at the nicaraguan ambassadors 
house said the guerrillas have violated the truce and characterized 
recent sandinista army operations as defensive in nature 
the nicaraguan president said the inauguration gives central 
american presidents a chance to discuss problems on an informal 
basis and said they should arrange a future meeting without 
preconditions 
presidents jose napoleon duarte of el salvador jose azcona hoyo 
of honduras and vinicio cerezo of guatemala also are to attend the 
inauguration but not oscar arias of costa rica 
arias won the 1987 nobel peace prize for a central american peace 
plan that was agreed upon aug 7 1987 but has stalled 
the sandinistas and the contras signed a ceasefire agreement 
march 23 under which the rebels were to stop fighting in exchange 
for democratic reforms in nicaragua both sides suspended offensive 
military operations and a formal truce took effect april 1 
talks on details of the truce agreement broke off and no 
negotiations have been held since september most contra fighters 
have left nicaragua for camps in honduras

to court papers 
the us customs service in papers filed in us district court

to ship 18 million in military electronic and communications 
equipment to iran this year 
federal law bans the sale of many of the items to that country 
according to the affidavit 
aero marketing based in virginias fairfax county was being 
investigated as part of a sting operation centered in new york 
where an undercover customs agent was posing as an exporter customs 
officials said 
no criminal charges have been filed against the company or its 
officers but a customs official said the investigation was 
continuing 
according to court documents the customs service searched aero 
marketings office on nov 8 and a warehouse it rents on nov 14 and

asked manteau to ship 10 sophisticated radios to south africa a 
transaction that would violate federal law the radios were sent to 
frankfurt where the customs service took possession of them

the united states often has denied visas to 
suspected subversives seeking un credentials but the united 
nations started protesting strenuously only when president reagan 
began barring soviet and plo speakers 
under the 1947 headquarters agreement between the united states 
and the united nations washington must grant visas to diplomats on 
un business and let them operate missions in new york 
the state department has denied visas to suspected spies and 
propagandists seeking un credentials as diplomats and journalists 
reagan hardened the us stance in the 1980s not only refusing 
them credentials to work in the un but preventing them from 
visiting un headquarters to speak 
the united states blocked soviet foreign minister andrei gromyko 
from addressing the united nations in 1983 after the soviet union 
downed korean airlines flight 007 in which 269 people died 
new york and new jersey refused to allow gromykos plane to land 
at their commercial airports 
soviet diplomats and the united nations defended gromykos right 
to speak but gromyko canceled his visit 
on saturday the state department denied a visa to yasser arafat 
chairman of the palestine liberation organization saying he 
condoned terrorist attacks 
un legal counsel carlaugust fleischhauer said monday that 
decision violates the headquarters agreement 
fleischhauer said that in the past the united nations did not 
take a position on rejected visa requests where the requesting 
state itself for reasons of its own did not pursue the matter 
during the cold war years the us regularly rejected visa 
applications of suspected spies from the soviet bloc and the 
requests were withdrawn 
an iranian who had been convicted of an attempt to assassinate 
the shah of iran was denied an entry visa in 1954 
in 1981 the state department refused a visa for an iranian 
deputy foreign minister who it said was involved in the 1979 
takeover of the us embassy in tehran the request was withdrawn 
earlier this year most un nations accused the united states of 
violating the headquarters agreement by attempting to evict the 
plos un mission in manhattan 
in june a judge ruled against the justice departments effort

he said 
the explosions ripped large craters in the ground and shattered 
windows up to 10 miles away 
the first trailer was filled with an estimated 30000 pounds of 
ammonium nitrate which is used to make dynamite explode more 
evenly authorities said the second trailer was storing about 
15000 pounds of the material a third explosion occurred moments 
later in what was believed to be a portion of the first trailer that 
had been blown apart 
its the worst thing ive ever seen said battalion chief 
marion germann 
debris was scattered over several acres around the construction 
site in south kansas city and onto nearby us 71 said police

firefighters were already at the construction site when the 
explosions rocked the area about 4 am two security guards at the 
site had called them when they noticed a pickup truck on fire knabe

investigators said they suspected the fires were arson but had 
no clear motive they said the fires did not appear to be 
professionally set 
labor union officials and contractors said there had been no 
problems at the site where demolition is occurring to clear a path 
for a highway 
security guards reported seeing someone and went to investigate 
knabe said when they returned they found one of their pickup 
trucks burning and called firemen 
three firefighters arrived with a pumper truck at 345 am knabe 
said they noticed another fire in the construction trailer and 
called for more help 
by the time the second pumper with three more firefighters 
arrived the pickup fire was out and both trucks went to the other 
fire 
germann was about to order the firefighters to pull back when the 
first blast occurred mills said 
he saw a strange burning pattern said mills he was just 
in the process of ordering his firefighters out when the explosion 
hit 
germann estimated the firefighters wer about 30 to 40 feet from 
the burning trailer 
the explosions occurred at a construction site on the southern

when the 1988 november sweep results enter the 
record books there will be a big asterisk next to them because of 
the writers strike that delayed the tv season 
but the month will most likely be remembered for the last of the 
bigevent network miniseries 
according to the ac nielsen co with a couple of days left 
nbc had won the november sweeps by about 2 rating points despite 
abcs war and remembrance an 18hour megaseries that ended up a 
rating of 186 and a share of 29 
each rating point equals 904000 households with television the 
share is a percentage of sets in use 
even the competing networks expected the winds of war sequel 
to do somewhere in the mid30 shares abc reportedly guaranteed 
advertisers a 202 rating and will have to give them free commercial 
time to make up the difference abc executives had predicted theyd 
lose 20 million on the miniseries even if it met the guarantees 
the poor performance of the first 18 hours of war and 
remembrance casts doubt on whether the remaining 1214 hours will 
run next may as tentatively planned it also once again casts doubt 
upon the value to networks of such bigbudget timeconsuming 
programs 
abc meanwhile will offer the first 18 hours on videocassette 
next week 
as of the end of prime time sunday nbc had 2point lead on abc 
for the sweeps win november is one of four months a year when 
network affiliates local ratings are measured for purposes of 
negotiating advertising rates the networks usually load up their 
schedules with special programming to help affiliates this 
november however the first sweeps period of the new season was 
dampened by delays caused by the writers strike abc and cbs still 
have regular series that have yet to premiere this season and abc 
rushed war and remembrance onto the air to fill gaps 
nbc won the week that ended sunday with an average primetime 
rating of 150 abc had 130 and cbs 120 
the week included thanksgiving on thursday nbcs biggest night 
for ratings as a result the cosby show barely made the top 10 
but two nbc movies in the line of duty the fbi murders and 
take my daughters please made the top 10 
an atypical week in news due to football preemptions gave 
nbc its first victory in the news race since sept 14 1987 nbc 
nightly news had a rating of 105 and a 20 share the cbs 
evening news had a 102 and 20 and abc world news tonight had 
a 100 and 20 
the toprated primetime shows last week were golden girls 
nbc 60 minutes cbs in the line of duty the fbi murders 
nbc empty nest nbc murder she wrote cbs tied with 
roseanne abc take my daughters please nbc whos the 
boss abc alf nbc amen tied the cosby show both 
nbc 
the nexttothelast installment of war and remembrance 
ranked 12th the final installment was ranked 16th

a judge tuesday turned aside a challenge to boston 
universitys proposal to take over chelseas troubled public 
schools ruling against teachers concerned that local officials were 
abdicating their responsibilities 
suffolk superior court judge walter steele without comment denied 
the massachusetts federation of teachers request for an injunction 
blocking any agreement between the university and the school 
district which has 3300 students 
later tuesday the chelsea school committee voted 52 to 
tentatively agree to accept a contract with the university 
they university officials have to be given a chance said 
morris seigal a committee member who voted in favor of the 
contract we do not have any other alternative 
the contract could be made final in two weeks university 
officials said 
union lawyer bruce miller said he was disappointed by the judges 
ruling and predicted it would not be the last legal battle 
rather than dealing with the question of education were going 
to be dealing with the question of litigation he said 
in what would be a groundbreaking arrangement the private 
university is proposing to run the public school district for 10 
years chelsea a town of 26000 just north of boston has the 
lowest percapita income and the highest school dropout rate in the 
state 
university educators are proposing to revamp the curriculum 
supervise the building of new schools and create special programs 
such as counseling for pregnant teenagers 
chelsea school committee chairman bruce robinson said chelseas 
deteriorating finances make the proposal a necessity its an 
ambitious plan he said were going to have to give bu some 
slack 
the union had argued that the proposal should be stopped saying 
state law forbids putting a taxfunded institution into private 
hands miller said allowing school officials to sign a contract with 
the university while the constitutional issue is debated would give 
bu a strong foothold in the school system 
but walter greenspan representing school officials said it was 
not possible for a judge to rule on the legality of the proposed 
agreement until it had been signed 
after the judges ruling but before the school committee meeting 
member liz mcbride argued against an immediate vote on the proposed 
agreement she said negotiations with the university are not 
finished and describing bus offer of help as fine if they want to 
come in as a partnership but not as a dictatorship 
committee member lydia walata said she didnt believe a consensus 
existed on the issue since some members were unhappy at the way bu 
has made its proposals 
its sort of like a bull in a china shop she said

a 6foot steel rod that impaled a 
construction worker after a threestory fall may prevented him from 
plunging six more floors to a certain death doctors said 
the bar which measured 18 inches pierced jakie dale klabers 
belly and groin monday but it probably kept him from plummeting to 
the ground outside a parking garage said drs tom harris and brian 
zachariah 
the rod basically arrested his fall said harris a 
thirdyear resident in emergency medicine who treated klaber at the 
scene 
zachariah another thirdyear resident said that without the 
rod the 50 yearold crane operator would definitely have died in 
the accident at the whittenberg engineering and construction co 
site 
klaber was reported in serious condition after the rod was 
removed during an operation at humana hospitaluniversity of 
louisville officials said 
klaber was hoisting a halfton wooden concreteform panel from 
inside a control cab on top of the ninestory garage when a gust 
apparently blew the 8by12foot panel into the wooden cab knocking 
it and klaber over the buildings edge according to witnesses and a 
whittenberg vice president 
klaber still inside the control cab fell headfirst 36 feet to 
the sixthfloor parking deck which juts out farther than the top 
three floors he fell almost vertically onto the steel rod located 
within 2 feet of the garages edge 
firefighters rescuing klaber cut through the bar with a torch 
and with the rod still imbedded in his body lowered klaber to the 
ground in a basket

police used a battering ram to break through the 
fortresslike doors of a chicago gangs headquarters seized four 
guns and 69 grams of cocaine and arrested a man wanted on a murder 
warrant 
the police raid monday was sparked by a manhunt for anthony fort 
22 the eldest son of imprisoned el rukn founder and leader jeff 
fort 
anthony fort wanted on a murder warrant was taken into custody 
later that day but police tuesday found his alibi was legitimate 
and he was not charged with the thanksgiving death of a woman lt 
philip cline said 
cline said fort however also was carrying a gun illegally at 
the time of his arrest and was named in several bond forfeiture 
warrants so other charges are pending 
the headquarters known as the el rukn grand major mosque was 
raided by police and chicago fire department personnel who tore 
apart walls and flooring in a search for weapons ammunition and 
drugs 
investigators found the guns drugs and three or four gallons of 
a codeinebased medication commonly known on the street as 
syrup police captain frank radke said tuesday 
we confiscated all their records also radke said 
reputed el rukn members arthur proctor 47 charles green 46 
and duane price 30 were arrested and charged with weapons 
violations and illegal possession of narcotics police said 
police were followed by officials from the gas and electric 
companies who shut off the utilities for nonpayment of bills 
police said the water was also shut off to the building which once 
was a south side movie palace 
anthony fort is wanted in the slaying of katie vines 27 who was 
shot in the head early thanksgiving day police said 
two reputed el rukn members christopher brooks 22 and darryl 
howard 26 were arrested thursday in the womans slaying and 
charged with armed robbery and murder 
the el rukns formerly known as the blackstone rangers and the 
black p stone nation maintain they are a moslem religious group and 
that the raided building is a mosque

south africa is sending tons of 
nonlethal aid to mozambique to protect and help repair a 
hydroelectric project damaged by rebels who have received covert 
military support from pretoria 
the supply ship drakensberg unloaded 139 tons of equipment 
monday including tents radios underwear and 21 trucks two more 
voyages are to bring the total deliveries by early 1989 to 4 
million 
south african officials said it was the first visit by one of 
their navy vessels to mozambique in its 13 years of independence 
they said the aid represented one of the largest foreign grants ever 
made by south africa 
the equipment is for a mozambican military force to be formed to 
protect the 560 miles of power lines from the cahora bassa dam on 
the zambezi river in western mozambique to the south africa border 
work on nearly 600 electrical pylons damaged by mozambican rebels is 
to begin in four months and take 18 months to complete 
mozambican energy minister antonio branco declared at a dockside 
ceremony that restoration of cahora bassa could contribute to a 
climate of stability and development in southern africa 
he refused to discuss mozambican allegations that some south 
african aid still reaches mozambique guerrillas mozambican 
officials believe that mutual undertakings like the cahora bassa 
agreement will pressure sections of the south african military 
suspected of supplying arms to the rebels 
relations between the neighboring countries worsened in the early 
1980s when south african soldiers raided mozambican targets housing 
members of the african national congress the main guerrilla group 
fighting the pretoria government 
at the same time mozambican national resistance guerrillas 
fighting their marxist government covertly received south african 
miltary supplies 
the 1984 nkomati accord pledging south africa to end support for 
the rebels if mozambique expelled anc guerrillas faltered amid 
accusations that south africa broke the pact 
south africas desire to mend fences and mozambiques need for 
economic help led the two countries to try again through new 
agreements on trade employment and technical assistance 
cahora bassa one of the worlds largest hydroelectric projects 
has been severely affected by guerrilla activity since it opened 13 
years ago the dam was built by portugal once mozambiques colonial 
ruler 
if it reached full operation the dam could supply power to a 
large part of southern africa 
south africa which generates 60 percent of africas electricity 
presently has a power surplus but deputy economic affairs minister 
george bartlett said cahora bassa electricty could enable south 
africa to defer construction of costly coalfired power stations 
until the 21st century 
he said mozambique could receive 55 million a year in fees for 
the electricity

albert and judy linkenberg started with 
1200 cans of shaving cream and finished with a house filled 2 feet 
deep with mintysmelling cream and 10000 
the kentucky couple lathered up radio station wlrsfm for the 
fivedigit shave by fulfilling the stations contest challenge 
what would you do for 10000 
a committee chose the shavingcream idea because it created an 
atmosphere that was fun but safe said toney brooks president of 
radio one which owns wlrs 
if the linkenbergs were unsuccessful the station would have let 
the runnerup try his stunt swimming across the ohio river with a 
bottle of wine and glasses cemented to a card table on his back 
brooks said 
before the linkenbergs began their stunt monday the carpet and 
the furniture in their twobedroom onestory bungalow were covered 
with plastic 
this was judys idea linkenberg declared at one point 
the linkenbergs with help from friends and relatives emptied 
the last can more than five hours later 
the linkenbergs though thousands of dollars richer will have to 
subtract taxes cleanup costs and 880 for the 1200 cans of colgate 
regular menthol and aloe shaving cream 
they hope to use the money to refinance their homes 30year 
mortgage or buy a car to replace their 1962 chevy nova

while the son of a chicago congressman was 
living and running for political office there he was on the payroll 
of the district of columbias delegate to congress an arrangement 
in apparent conflict with both house rules and illinois election 
laws 
according to records of the house of representatives walter e 
fauntroy the districts nonvoting delegate to the house hired 
thomas john savage the son of rep gus savage dill on sept 8 
1987 and kept him on the payroll through june 30 1988 except for 
a sixweek unpaid leave in february and march 
records show that on dec 13 1987 while he was an employee of 
fauntroy savage filed a petition with the illinois board of 
elections to run in the march 15 1988 primary for state 
representative in the petition he swore that i reside at 10846 
south halsted st chicago and that he was legally qualified to 
hold such office 
illinois election laws say a candidate for two 2 years 
preceding election must be a resident of the district he is to 
represent 
savage also was paid 5600 during this period for working on his 
fathers reelection campaign federal records show 
if savage were working in chicago at the time he was on 
fauntroys payroll he would stand in apparent contradiction of 
house rules 
a house ethics committee guide for congressmen stipulates that 
house staff assistants can be paid only for services performed in 
washington dc or in the state or district that the member 
represents 
in an interview savage denied that he held a noshow 
congressional job 
i was in washington fulltime except maybe for a couple of 
weekends from september 1987 on he said it was impossible 
that i was there in chicago weekdays 
but a former worker in rep savages chicago office said thomas 
savage was doing work for his father there while he supposedly was 
in washington 
the illinois residency law is strictly enforced for example tim 
wright a candidate for the state legislature was removed from the 
primary ballot last spring he owned a house in the district he 
wanted to represent but had not lived in it for two full years 
house payroll records show that except for the sixweek unpaid 
leave in february and march 1988 savage was paid as a legislative 
assistant to fauntroy until june 30 1988 earning 21398 for the 
10month period 
savage said he spent most of the fall of 1987 in washington 
lived in chicago while on the leave returned to washington after 
the march 15 primary and stayed here until he left fauntroys 
payroll 
he claimed his job was to enlist support among house members for 
a fauntroy bill that would grant statehood status to the district of 
columbia however he could not name any members he had lobbied 
fauntroy did not return a reporters repeated phone messages left 
at his office last week and monday and tuesday rep savage also did 
not return several phone calls 
thomas savage maintained that a chicago apartment he shares with 
his wife drella fulfilled the state election boards residency 
requirement he said that while working in washington he stayed at 
his fathers apartment and his wife remained in chicago 
among those who place the younger savage in chicago during the 
time he was on fauntroys payroll is nelson rice who defeated him 
in the primary 
he was here every damn day he was available accessible 
said rice unless he had free airplane flights back and forth 
there was no way he could have been in washington 
juanita bratcher a reporter for the chicago daily defender who 
covered thomas savages campaign said she frequently saw him around 
chicago during the period he was on fauntroys congressional payroll 
in addition a former worker in rep savages chicago office said 
thomas savage made almostdaily appearances during the time he was 
supposedly working in washington 
i saw him there five or six days a week during the fall said 
the former worker who spoke only on condition of anonymity in 
december he was there every day 
campaign spending records filed by rep savage with the federal 
elections commission say his son was owed 9200 by the campaign 
and had received 5600 between sept 4 1987 and when he left 
fauntroys payroll last june the younger savage said the money was 
for work done in prior elections 
the fec records list only amounts paid and owed campaign workers 
and do not detail when the work was performed 
the younger savage is also not listed in the official 1988 house 
telephone directory which includes all congressional staff 
assistants the directory is issued each march and includes anyone 
on the congressional payroll at the end of the preceding year 
savage was hired by fauntroy just a month after his father hired 
lezli baskerville a fauntroy aide ms baskerville was given a job 
with a subcommittee rep savage chairs according to house records 
and committee officials 
but baskerville was removed from the public works and 
transportation committee job after it was learned she was not 
showing up for work committee officials said

concern about the reliability of the safety 
alarms on commercial jetliners is responsible for the governments 
suggestion for a new device in 3700 aircraft an alarm to warn 
pilots their alarm isnt working 
the federal aviation administration announced tuesday that it 
plans to require airlines early next year to install a warning light 
in all of their jetliners to tell pilots if their takeoff alarm 
system is out of commission 
the takeoff alarms variations of which are found in all 
commercial jetliners are supposed to guard against a plane taking 
off without being properly prepared such as having its wing flaps 
in the wrong position 
the alarm which in some planes sounds a loud horn and in others 
a computerized voice often is the last defense against a pilots 
oversight aviation experts say 
but in at least two recent crashes the alarms apparently didnt 
work as they should have and a spot check earlier this year of 
boeing 727 aircraft found 35 cases in which the alarms either failed 
or did not operate properly according to the faa 
the faa said in its proposed order tuesday that the new warning 
lights which would light up if electrical power to the takeoff 
alarm system is interrupted must be clearly visible to everyone in 
the cockpit 
the modification which likely would be made during a planes 
routine maintenance so as not to interrupt normal service would 
apply to aircraft manufactured by boeing mcdonnell douglas 
lockheed and airbus industrie the european consortium as well as 
foreign manufacturers of smaller jets such as fokker and british 
aerospace 
youre talking about the entire us passenger fleet of large 
jet airplanes faa spokesman fred farrar said he estimated the 
added device would cost about 1050 per plane 
airlines have until february to comment on the proposal after 
which the faa is expected to issue a mandatory requirement fairly 
quickly officials said while the air carriers will have another 
year to comply many probably will begin immediately to make the 
modification in some aircraft 
the alarm systems have been a focus of attention in two major 
airline crashes within the last 15 months 
on aug 16 1987 an alarm on a northwest airlines jetliner 
failed to sound even though the flight crew forgot to position the 
wing flaps of their mcdonnell douglas md80 prior to a takeoff from 
detroits metro international airport the plane crashed killing 
156 people and investigators blamed the failure to set the flaps 
which help in gaining lift 
investigators also are examining the possibility of an improper 
flap setting in the crash of a delta air lines boeing 727 near 
dallas last august in which 14 of the 108 people aboard were killed 
the importance of the alarms was underscored at a hearing tuesday 
in irving texas into that crash officials said the wing flaps 
found in the wreckage were retracted instead of extended for 
takeoff but that the alarm hadnt sounded 
the national transportation safety board determined in its 
investigation of the detroit crash that the alarm on that plane did 
not sound because electrical power was interrupted investigators 
could not determine conclusively what caused the power interruption 
the safety board said 
at the time however the air line pilots association maintained 
there was a possible inherent problem with the alarm systems that 
made them susceptible to electrical failure 
the ntsb said it could not determine whether the power 
interruption was due to such a defect

private shipyards are pushing the federal 
commission studying possible military base closures to target some 
of the navyowned shipyards that compete against them 
john j stocker the president of the shipbuilders council of 
america argues in a letter to the special commission that in 
these times of severe budget constraints the closure of nonnuclear 
government shipyards would result in significant budget savings to 
the us treasury 
the navy commanded in 1946 a fleet of 1115 naval ships 
supported by 11 naval shipyards employing 93600 civilian 
employees stocker wrote at the end of fiscal 1987 the navy 
had an active fleet of 568 ships supported by eight naval shipyards 
employing 72400 workers 
stockers letter dated nov 28 and obtained tuesday was sent to 
former sen abraham a ribicoff one of two men cochairing the 
commission on base realignment and closure 
legislation signed by president reagan last month authorized the 
12member citizens commission to review the nations military bases 
and to decide which are outmoded and can be closed at a projected 
annual savings of 2 billion to 5 billion 
the panel has until dec 31 to report its findings to defense 
secretary frank c carlucci who may forward the list to congress if 
he wishes should he decide to do so congress can veto the entire 
list but cannot act to protect individual bases as it often has in 
the past 
the allornothing procedure is viewed as offering the best 
chance in more than a decade to actually close unneeded military 
bases over the objection of local congressmen 
the shipbuilders council represents corporate shipyards around 
the country the private yards have seen orders for construction of 
commercial ships disappear in recent years leaving the navy as 
their main source of business 
the navys yards at the same time have begun to modernize and 
are underbidding private industry for repair and overhaul contracts 
the private yards assert they cant compete in such bidding 
contests because the government yards arent trying to make a profit 
the navys eight yards are located in long beach calif puget 
sound wash philadelphia pa mare island calif pearl harbor 
hawaii charleston sc norfolk va and portsmouth nh 
of those eight two are not equipped to handle overhauls or 
repairs to nuclearpowered ships philadelphia and long beach and 
they were singled out by stocker as prime candidates for closure 
the navy had no immediate comment saying it had not seen 
stockers letter in the past however it has argued the public 
yards are uniquely critical because they provide basic capacity 
needed in the event of a war or other emergency 
the commission has refused to discuss its internal deliberations 
or the material it receives from various organizations

sen george mitchell the new senate majority 
leader first reached a national audience when he bucked a tide of 
sympathy for oliver l north and said the marine lieutenant colonel 
had no monopoly on patriotism 
north had stolen the televised spotlight at the 1987 irancontra 
hearings as he repeatedly attacked those in congress who had 
vigorously opposed the reagan administrations policy of military 
aid to nicaraguas contra rebels 
he appealed for congressional aid to the contras for the love 
of god and the love of country 
mitchell a former federal prosecutor and district court judge 
counterattacked but in a characteristic calm manner 
please remember that others share that devotion and recognize 
that it is possible for an american to disagree with you on aid to 
the contras and still love god and still love this country just as 
much as you do mitchell told north 
in america disagreement with the policies of the government is 
not evidence of lack of patriotism he declared 
for mitchell that moment under the crystal chandeliers of the 
senate caucus room represented his debut on the national scene 
but he already was being lionized by senate democrats 
as chairman of the senate democratic campaign committee mitchell 
engineered the stunning 1986 upset that saw democrats regain the 
senate control they had lost in ronald reagans 1980 presidential 
landslide 
his reward instant influence and clout on the democratic side of 
the aisle and appointment as the senates deputy president pro 
tempore a largely honorary post but an important mark of the high 
regard of democratic senators 
now the senates majority democrats have passed to mitchell the 
gavel of leadership being relinquished by senate majority leader 
robert c byrd dwva who is stepping down to become chairman of 
the senate appropriations committee 
twenty seven democrats voted for mitchell on the first ballot in 
the partys caucus tuesday twenty eight others split evenly between 
sens daniel k inouye dhawaii and j bennett johnston dla 
mitchell was then elected by acclamation 
mitchells elevation to the senates top leadership post gives 
him control of the chambers agenda as the 101st congress begins its 
work and as presidentelect george bush launches his administration 
and announces his policy and legislative goals 
it marks a new beginning after byrds long tenure as party 
leader many senate democrats hope mitchell can use it to project a 
positive forwardlooking image for their party in the wake of its 
three successive defeats in for the presidency he has vowed to 
share his authority with colleagues saying i do not intend to be 
a oneman band 
mitchell 55 has been active in maines democratic politics 
since 1968 and is a protege of sen edmund s muskie dmaine whom 
he served as administrative assistant in the early 1960s 
mitchell suffered a number of political setbacks including 
defeat in a bid for governor in 1974 but with muskies backing he 
was appointed first as us attorney for maine then as a federal 
district judge 
when muskie resigned from the senate in may 1980 to become 
secretary of state under former president carter he recommended 
maines democratic governor appoint mitchell to fill the vacancy 
two years later mitchell won the seat in his own right by a 
commanding 61 percent of the vote he won a second term this year by 
an even more impressive 81 percent 
in the senate mitchell compiled a largely liberal voting record 
and became a leading critic of the reagan administrations 
environmental record 
at the irancontra hearings he compared norths glittering 
marine corps record in vietnam and the patriotism of the immigrants 
on whom he had conferred citizenship as a judge 
my mother was an immigrant my father the orphaned son of 
immigrants he said their opportunities were very limited 
because neither of them had any education they worked at very 
menial tasks in our society 
and he told north that when he asked new immigrants why they 
wished to live in the united states many of them said the reason 
was that in america you can criticize the government without 
looking over your shoulder 
mitchells father was a utility company laborer who later worked 
as a janitor his mother an immigrant from lebanon worked at a 
woolen mill in waterville maine where the family lived 
their son graduated from maines bowdoin college in 1954 and from 
georgetown university law school in 1960

bolstered by higher world prices us farm 
exports are expected to continue to grow in value in 1989 rising 
about 1 billion to 365 billion according to the latest 
agriculture department projections 
however export volumes are forecast to shrink by 8 percent in 
fiscal year 1989 in response to declines for some farm products hard 
hit by last summers drought 
the projected increase in export values would mark the third 
straight year of growth american farm exports rose from 263 
billion in fiscal year 1986 to 279 billion in 1987 to 355 
billion in 1988 
the volume of sales probably will fall to 136 million metric tons 
in 1989 down from a sixyear high of nearly 148 million metric tons 
in the year ended sept 30 according to richard w goldberg acting 
undersecretary of agriculture for international affairs and 
commodity programs 
goldberg delivered what he described as a bright agricultural 
trade forecast at tuesdays opening session of usdas agricultural 
outlook conference an annual event in which government analysts 
outline prospects for the coming year for farmers and agribusiness 
export volume is forecast smaller as the us share of world 
trade shrinks for droughtaffected products goldberg said 
overall the united states is expected to account for 48 percent 
of world total grain trade in 1989 down from 50 percent 
one of the hardest hit commodities is soybeans with the us 
share of world soybean trade forecast to drop to 35 percent in 1989 
from 49 percent 
rice corn and horticultural products are among the few 
commodities expected to see increases in 1989 export volumes with 
wheat and wheat flour falling about 2 percent to 402 million metric 
tons 
but with global grain stocks drawn down largely because of the 
drought in north america goldberg said that world prices for wheat 
corn and soybeans should be their highest since 1985 
goldberg said a 26 billion increase in the value of us grain 
and feed exports will offset declines for cotton and oilseeds in 
1989 
for us agriculture the challenge in the coming year will be 
to sustain the momentum in overseas sales which has been regained 
over the past few years said goldberg this will require more 
competitive prices aggressive market development persistent trade 
policy efforts and a marketoriented trade philosophy 
imports of agricultural products into the united states are 
expected to remain about the same as 1988s record 21 billion that 
means that the us agricultural trade surplus should rise about 1 
billion in 1989 reaching about 155 billion in contrast the 
surplus stood at only 54 billion in 1985 
goldberg said projected production increases in 1989 probably 
will not prevent further drains on global farm product stocks and he 
pointed out that the european community is offering a tremendous 
incentive to its farmers to produce through its system of export 
subsidies 
the united states will have a problem competing with such 
subsidized competition unless we have the supply to be competitive 
if us prices arent competitive other nations especially the 
subsidizing ones will expand their production to fill the gap 
said goldberg 
he forecast that japan and south korea would continue to buy more 
us farm products in 1989 and that sales to taiwan would remain 
about the same as record amounts this year 
goldberg projected continued large imports of us corn and 
oilseeds by the soviet union in 1989 but said that wheat sales 
probably would not match 1988s record 9 million tons he said a 
drop in crop production in china should strengthen the demand for 
food grain exports and that higher wheat prices could push the 
value of wheat sales to more than 800 million in 1989

farmers and agribusiness should expect to see 
continued growth in the us economy in the year ahead with a 
potential for falling inflation according to a member of the board 
of governors of the federal reserve system 
wayne angell an economist and partner in a kansas farm before 
joining the federal reserve in 1986 said tuesday he was 
relatively optimistic about the prospects for the economy 
in remarks to the usdas agricultural outlook conference angell 
said a reasonable goal over the medium term would be to reduce 
inflation by about onehalf to 1 percentage point a year and i 
believe this can be done while unemployment remains in the 5 to 6 
percent range 
among the biggest questions about the economic future are the 
chances for reducing the us trade and budget deficits but angell 
said he didnt think the imbalances would derail the current 
sixyear economic expansion

a soviet space official says moscow may push 
back the planned launch date of an unmanned mission to mars to 
incorporate improved technology in both the spacecraft and the 
robotic rover that will retrieve samples of the red planet 
genrich a avanesov of the space research institute of the soviet 
academy of sciences told a space conference tuesday that it may be 
in the soviets interest to put off the planned 1994 mission for 
about two years 
technically we do have the possibility to send a mission by 
1994 with a martian rover but were not sure its worth doing 
avanesov said after a presentation to the conference on space 
automation and robotics it may be worth doing a more intellectual 
mission later 
asked whether funding for the mission was a problem he said 
money is a problem today for us too 
avanesov emphasized that no official decision has been made on 
the timing of the mission 
rescheduling the mission would enable the soviets to use findings 
of a us mission to mars that is planned for 1993 on that mission 
an unmanned probe called the mars observer is to take photographs of 
mars surface while orbiting the planet for about two years 
the soviet mission will send a robotic rover to explore the red 
planets surface and return samples of its soil and atmosphere to 
earth 
experts in both countries have agreed that unmanned missions to 
probe the surface of mars will be necessary before a manned mission 
can be launched but it will take several years to develop the 
necessary automation and robotics 
no research breakthroughs seem to be required but a great deal 
of applied research and technology development and demonstration 
will be needed lew allen director of nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory said in a paper presented to the conference 
a martian rover will need to be able to avoid hazards on the 
planets surface when it lands negotiate the terrain preserve soil 
and atmospheric samples and rendezvous with its launcher he said 
we see that the rover should be an intellectual one with 
sophisticated automation avanesov said the question of the 
autonomy is a very serious one and should be specially 
considered 
the national aeronautics and space administration is considering 
a second unmanned mission to the planet to follow the mars observer 
aaron cohen director of nasas johnson space center told the 
conference 
he said a mission could be launched in 1998 to land a robotic 
rover on the surface of mars gather samples of soil rock and 
atmosphere and return the samples to earth in 2001 
the delivery and return phases offer many technical and 
engineering challenges he said it taxes our automation 
capabilities 
soviet plans to explore mars culminating with a manned mission 
around 2010 to 2015 are the top priority of moscows space program 
avanesov said adding we think this mars project will give us 
broad opportunity for international cooperation 
his paper to the conference said the united states and soviet 
union could work together on certain aspects of a mars program 
including organization of a joint groundbased network of data 
reception joint data interpretation creation of a joint data bank 
on the martian atmosphere and other exchanges of information 
soviet and nasa officials have met twice this year in washington 
to exchange information they also are making plans to fly american 
instruments on future soviet missions and soviet instruments on 
future us flights

government and private analysts said today the 
outlook for world wheat markets looks strong next year and offers 
us producers a good opportunity to make gains 
more land worldwide is expected to be devoted to wheat production 
in 1989 because of strong crop prices and government incentives 
including easing of landidling restrictions for farmers in the 
united states said bruce r weber an economist with the 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
in prepared remarks for delivery at todays session of the usda 
agricultural outlook conference weber forecast that total harvested 
areas for wheat could rise 5 percent to 6 percent above 1988 levels 
to 230 million to 232 million hectares worldwide a hectare is a 
metric measure equalling nearly 2 acres 
if the recent upward trend in yields continue the world should 
easily harvest a 1989 wheat crop in excess of 500 million metric 
tons said weber how favorable the growing season is will 
dictate how close the crop comes to the record 530 million harvest 
of 1986 
weber noted that recent wheat use globally has exceeded 530 
million metric tons which has caused stocks worldwide to decline 
because production is likely to fall below wheat utilization weber 
said this sets the stage for another strong year for world wheat 
trade 
usdas world agricultural outlook board projects that us wheat 
and flour exports will decline in volume in fiscal year 1989 to 402 
million metric tons from 415 million but the value will rise to 
59 billion from 46 billion in 1988 a metric ton is 11 tons 
richard gady vice president of economic research for conagra 
inc recommended that the government respond to world wheat demand 
by lowering from 10 percent to 5 percent the acreage reduction 
requirements for us farmers to participate in the wheat program in 
1989 that would permit expanded us production 
he also urged aggressive use of the export enhancement program 
under which the government subsidizes grain sales to offset 
competition from the european community and other suppliers 
it appears that the wheat market is in a cyclically stronger 
period as world surpluses have been reduced and the demand 
environment is improved said gady this should provide us 
producers an opportunity to put productive acres back to work and 
expect a reasonable return 
us corn plantings in 1989 could rise by 8 million to 10 million 
acres because of government program changes and next years crop 
could fall between 77 billion to 83 billion bushels according to 
david b hull an ascs economist this years crop was 467 billion 
bushels down 34 percent because of the drought 
hull said he expected barley and oat crops to increase more than 
75 percent next year and be about double 1988 amounts grain sorghum 
production should return to normal next year he said this years 
grain sorghum crop was 546 million bushels down about 26 percent 
from 1987

one navy serviceman was killed and another was 
seriously injured on the uss nimitz in the north arabian sea early 
wednesday when a fire apparently was started by an accidental firing 
of an aircraft gun a defense department spokesman said 
six aircraft on the nuclearpowered carrier were damaged by the 
blaze said army maj john smith the incident occurred at 248 am 
748 pm tuesday est 
the identities of the two men were not immediately released 
pending notification of next of kin smith said 
the fire apparently started when a gun on an a7e aircraft 
accidentally fired during routine maintenance smith said the round 
of ammunition struck an a6 aircraft which ignited and the blaze 
spread to other nearby planes he said 
smith said it was not immediately known whether the death and 
injury were caused by the gunshot or by the blaze which was brought 
under control within 20 minutes 
the spokesman said he did not know how badly the planes were 
damaged an investigation into the incident has begun he said 
the 95000ton carrier based at the puget sound naval shipyard 
in bremerton wash is the flagship of a carrier battle group in 
the indian ocean operating area smith said the carrier would 
continue on its current mission 
the 1092footlong carrier normally carries a crew of more than 
6000 and more than 80 aircraft according to the navy 
named for fleet admiral chester w nimitz commander of the us 
pacific fleet during world war ii the uss nimitz was commissioned 
in 1975 
on aug 19 1981 nimitz jets downed two libyan jet fighters 
following an attack on nimitz aircraft in the gulf of sidra

the air force has dismissed ice buildup on the 
wings as the cause of a crash nov 17 of a b1b bomber in south 
dakota and says there is no need to consider adding wing deicing 
equipment to the longrange aircraft 
we do not have any evidence that icing was a contributor to the 
b1b crash at ellsworth air force base pentagon spokesman fred 
hoffman said downplaying a published report last week in the 
chicago tribune 
the report said the b1b may have been downed by excessive ice 
on its wings 
pentagon officials speaking on condition they not be named told 
the associated press on tuesday that the ice detection system on the 
plane did not indicate the bomber had experienced a dangerous 
buildup of ice 
there was some icing one source said there was ice on the 
wings of another b1b that landed just before this one but it 
wasnt a problem 
wing icing was not considered a potential problem when 
designing the aircraft and there never has been any operational 
evidence that wing icing is a problem hoffman added 
we have no plans to study the addition of deicing equipment 
added lt col rick oborn an air force officer and pentagon 
spokesman that hasnt even been considered 
the 280 million b1b like many types of military aircraft does 
not have any builtin deicing equipment for its wings it does 
however carry an antiicing system for its four engines and an ice 
detection system for the wings 
capt jay defrank an air force spokesman said the rationale for 
leaving deicing equipment off the b1b was simple 
the b1b can fly at such high speeds at low altitude that it 
normally melts what would buildup on the wings he said 
and if you know youre facing icing conditions you normally 
fly to another base or move to a different altitude the plane has 
an ice detection system for the wings 
the b1b that crashed nov 17 was practicing instrument landing 
approaches it was attempting to land shortly after another b1b 
made a successful approach and for reasons unknown came in too low 
and clipped a utility pole and power lines 
the four crewmen survived after ejecting from the plane 
in a related development hoffman said the air force would look 
into allegations by some rockwell international corp employees that 
flawed parts might have been used in building the b1b bombers 
but the air force does not have any evidence at this time which 
corroborates the assertions by former rockwell employees that 
substandard parts were used in the construction of b1s hoffman 
said 
however the air force is investigating or is looking into 
these allegations 
a copyright report monday by wbnstv in columbus ohio quoted 
workers as saying substandard parts disappeared after being rejected 
by plant inspectors the employees said they believe those parts 
subsequently were used in building the bombers to meet production 
schedules

the energy department says it must push back 
the restart of its k reactor at the savannah river plant to next 
spring or summer because of safety concerns delaying production of 
a critical component of nuclear weapons 
the three reactors at savannah river are the only operational 
facilities in the united states capable of producing two critical 
nuclear weapons materials tritium and plutonium 
none of the three reactors at savannah river has produced weapons 
material since last april 
but just last month energy department officials said the plant 
would begin a phased restart of the k reactor in december and could 
resume production of tritium in january 
tritium decays at the rate of 55 percent per year and 
administration and congressional sources say stockpiles will be 
depleted badly within six months to two years although the exact 
numbers are classified tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen 
is used to boost the yield of nuclear weapons 
energy secretary john s herrington has told congress that the 
united states is awash in plutonium when asked by the 
associated press when tritium would be in critical short supply 
herrington said i think we are ok with spring and summer but 
he declined to give an exact date 
we are hoping to start the k reactor in the spring summer 
herrington said we are not going to start up or operate a reactor 
that we are not satisfied is totally safe 
since october engineers with the energy department and the 
operating contractor the ei du pont de nemours amp co have been 
developing much more stringent operating and safety criteria 
were not slipping we are using more caution ok herrington 
said i am satisfied with the progress i think our startup 
criteria our modifications and our upgrade are proceeding well i 
do not want to put a predicted date on the startup

a racist murder that led to a 7 million 
civil verdict against the nations oldest ku klux klan group is 
moving to the us supreme court for a decision on whether defense 
lawyers can bar blacks from juries 
defense lawyers say they doubt the high court will review whether 
they can challenge every prospective black juror in order to put 
together an allwhite panel for klan defendants 
but prosecutors in alabama joined by other states contend the 
issue needs to be reviewed to prevent racial discrimination and give 
prosecutors equal standing with defense lawyers when picking a jury 
in a racially oriented case 
the argument is not whether you have an allwhite jury the 
argument is whether you can strike anybody because of race said 
university of virginia law associate professor pamela karlan 
a recent supreme court ruling barred prosecutors from such 
racially tainted jury selection tactics the question the court 
might face if it decides to hear the case is whether the ruling can 
be extended to apply to the defense a deadline for briefs was set 
for today 
defense attorneys are allowed to use any means within the law to 
get their clients off and this has included striking potential 
jurors whom they believe would be prejudiced against their clients 
the case in question began march 21 1981 when michael donald a 
19yearold black mobile man was abducted at random from a city 
street beaten to death and his body hanged in a tree kkk members 
henry francis hays and james tiger knowles were arrested in 
connection with the slaying 
hays was convicted of capital murder and received the death 
penalty knowles pleaded guilty to a federal charge of violating 
donalds civil rights and received a life prison sentence 
last year donalds mother beulah mae donald won a 7 million 
lawsuit against the united klans of america resulting in her 
acquisition of the kkk headquarters building in tuscaloosa she sold 
the building to a stockbroker mrs donald 67 died earlier this 
year 
mobile county prosecutors also filed murder charges against hays 
father bennie jack hays and the younger hays brotherinlaw 
frank cox during trial last february the elder hays collapsed in 
court prompting a mistrial 
but before the two can be retried attorneys want the high court 
to answer the question about jury composition can defense attorneys 
use peremptory challenges to strike all blacks from a jury simply 
because of their race 
the court has not yet decided whether to hear the question which 
has roused the interest of at least 40 prosecutors nationwide 
mobile county district attorney chris n galanos said in an 
interview wednesday 
in new york a spokeswoman for brooklyn district attorney 
elizabeth holtzman said she filed a friendofthecourt brief in the 
case monday night holtzman argues that prosecutors and defense 
attorneys should be on equal footing in eliminating jurors said the 
spokeswoman nancy young 
galanos said he attempted in pretrial proceedings without 
success to block defense attorneys from using peremptory challenges 
to exclude blacks from the jury solely because of their race 
in the end the jury in the coxhays trial had only one black 
who became an alternate juror before the mistrial 
galanos said the chance for a supreme court review could have 
been enhanced if alabama appeals courts had issued opinions in the 
case instead of nocomment denials 
coxs attorney neil hanley said tuesday he had filed a onepage 
brief in the case standing firm on legal precedent he cited the 
case two years ago known as batson vs kentucky in which the 
supreme court ruled 72 that the prosecution in a criminal trial of 
a black defendant could not use peremptory challenges to strike all 
blacks in the jury pool 
the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment applies to 
states and prohibits governmental discrimination thats it 
hanley said 
hanley doesnt expect the high court to hear oral arguments on 
the jury composition question but you never know 
karlan who has followed the batson case said the high court 
probably would let the argument percolate in the lower courts 
awhile longer she said the high court specifically left the 
question open in batson 
the state of alabama has asked the high court to extend the 
batson decision to defense counsel because racial discrimination in 
jury selection whatever its source violates the constitutional

a former us marine charged in a string 
of sex murders in california was ordered extradited to the united 
states where he could face the death penalty if convicted 
the lawyer for 27yearold charles ng said he will appeal the 
ruling issued tuesday after a sixweek hearing 
justice marguerite trussler of alberta court of queens bench 
said ng should be extradited on 19 of the 25 offenses he is charged 
with in california 
ng is charged with murder kidnapping and burglary in connection 
with the deaths of 12 men women and children 
eleven of the deaths involved sex slayings at a rural cabin in 
calaveras county 120 miles east of san francisco the 12th involved 
the death of a san francisco disc jockey 
in her decision ms tussler cited evidence from ngs alleged 
partner in the crimes leonrd lake 
ng came to canada after lake was picked up for shoplifting in san 
francisco and committed suicide lake later was linked to the deaths 
or disappearances of several people that investigation led to the 
charges against ng 
i am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt based on all the 
evidence that there was a general conspiracy that related to 
weapons money and sexual gratification the judge said 
defense attorney don macleod has said appeal arguments could take 
the case all the way to the supreme court of canada which could 
take up to five years 
the defense is seeking to invoke a provision in the canadaus 
extradition treaty that says extradition may be refused unless the 
requesting state guarantees the fugitive will not be executed if 
convicted canada does not have the death penalty 
ng who was born in hong kong and educated in british private 
schools is serving a 4year sentence at a maximumsecurity federal 
penitentiary in prince albert saskatchewan for shooting a security 
guard in the hand in december 1985 during a shoplifting attempt at a 
department store in calgary 
ms trussler told a hushed courtroom she was satisfied on 
evidence filed during a sixweek extradition hearing that the 
offenses charged in the state of california are extraditable with 
one exception 
the exception was a charge of accessory to murder 
the judge dismissed five other charges of kidnapping and 
conspiracy to kidnap because no evidence was shown of transportation 
of the three people involved as required under canadian law 
the judge said she would issue a warrant keeping ng in prison in 
canada until he is turned over to us authorities 
in sacramento calif gov george deukmejian urged canadian 
officials to act quickly on the court ruling 
deukmeijian said delays would make the prosecution of ng in the 
united states more difficult there are few crimes in modern times 
that are more heinous as the atrocities attributed to charles ng 
deukmejian said

a devastating chemical explosion that 
killed six firefighters at a highway construction site and shattered 
windows 10 miles away was caused by arson police said 
detectives questioned four people to evaluate their alibis in 
tuersdays predawn fire that triggered the blast but no arrests 
have been made said sgt gregory mills a police spokesman 
fire bells tolled throughout the city for the six firefighters 
who were killed when a construction trailer loaded with 30000 
pounds of ammonium nitrate exploded ripping a large crater in the 
ground and virtually obliterating a fire truck 
another explosion occurred 40 minutes later in a nearby trailer 
that stored 15000 pounds of the material which is used in highway 
construction projects to make dynamite explode more evenly 
a lot of guys just find it hard to believe said fire capt 
owen gilchrist no one wants to another five or 10 minutes there 
could have been 20 or 30 guys down there 
mills said investigators determined arson from the presence of 
two separate fires burning almost simultaneously at the site one 
blaze in a small pickup truck started in the cab the second began 
500 feet away in the trailer containing the explosives he said 
police said they had no motive for the arson but did not rule 
out that the fires could have been set as a prank a special squad 
of six homicide detectives and one arson detective was working on 
the case 
labor union officials said there had been no problems at the 
site where workers had been blasting to clear rocks for a highway 
project the only reported crime had been a vandalized bulldozer 
last month police said 
two pumpers manned by the six firefighters had been called to the 
site by security guards who noticed two prowlers in the area and saw 
the pickup on fire said fire department spokesman harold knabe 
according to fire department transcripts a dispatcher informed 
firefighters that explosives were in the area as they approached the 
scene battalion chief marion germann had just pulled up in a car 
about a quarter mile from the scene and was in the process of 
ordering his firefighters out when the explosion hit mills said 
he saw a strange burning pattern the police spokesman said 
germann estimated the firefighters killed in the blast were about 
30 to 40 feet from the burning trailer 
the blasts left two large craters 30 to 40 feet wide and 6 or 7 
feet deep and a smaller one about 15 feet across and 4 feet deep 
thousands of windows were blown out of businesses homes schools 
banks and hospitals up to 10 miles away 
the remains of one fire truck is sitting very close to one 
crater knabe said there is another vehicle of some sort a 
large red truck the other fire truck there is absolutely no 
evidence that it was ever there 
one witness a few miles away cindy denning said that when the 
flash of light brightened her bedroom she thought nuclear war had 
begun 
i woke up and my first reaction was its nuclear war or else a 
gas explosion in my building i thought the building probably was on 
fire she said 
apartment buildings including ms dennings and nearby houses 
were evacuated for several hours by authorities who feared more 
explosions mills saiddebris was scattered over several acres 
around the construction site and onto nearby us 71 
the dead firefighters were identified as capt gerald c 
halloran 57 capt james kilventon jr 54 firefighters thomas m 
fry 41 luther e hurd 31 and michael r oldham 32 and robert 
d mckarnin 42 a fire apparatus operator

afghan guerrilla leaders will meet 
with the soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov in saudi 
arabia this weekend an insurgent spokesman said 
the meeting signifies that they recognize us as a legitimate 
force in afghanistan hamed karzai spokesman for the liberation 
front of afghanistan guerrilla group said tuesday 
the leader of the front sibghatullah mojaddedi will attend the 
meeting along with burhanuddin rabbani leader of the 
jamiateislami group and chairman of the sevenparty guerrilla 
alliance based in pakistan karzai said 
moscows decision to send vorontsov who also became soviet 
ambassador to afghanistan last month shows they are willing to 
reach a political understanding karzai said 
moslem guerrillas backed by the united states began fighting in 
afghanistan after a communist coup in april 1978 soviet military 
forces entered the country in december 1979 
under a unmediated agreement the soviets began withdrawing 
their estimated 115000 soldiers may 15 half were confirmed to be 
out by aug 15 and the agreement requires the rest to be gone by 
feb 15 1989 
the insurgents were not parties to the negotiations or the 
withdrawal agreement and have asked repeatedly for direct talks with 
the soviet union 
karzai said the agenda of the meeting in saudi arabia is 
flexible but he and several other guerrilla representatives said 
the form of a postwar government was not on it 
determining the form of government is the right of the people 
of afghanistan and it will not be compromised karzai said 
he said the willingness to meet with the insurgents indicates a 
decline in kremlin support for the afghan government of president 
najib 
they realize they have no alternative they have to abandon 
najib he said 
guerrilla leaders have refused najibs offers of a powersharing 
arrangement

norman collins was speeding toward the 
construction site when he heard the blast he had feared and felt his 
car shake 
collins the president of mountain plains construction inc of 
kansas city kan had been awakened minutes earlier by a security 
guard at the highway construction site where his company was doing 
work a storage trailer was burning and collins knowing it 
contained the explosive ammonium nitrate made sure the fire 
department was called and raced to the scene 
halfway there he felt the blast 
i was afraid of what it was he said 
in the earlymorning darkness tuesday six firefighters died when 
30000 pounds of the chemical used as a dynamite additive in 
construction exploded at the site in south kansas city 
the firefighters were extinguishing an arson fire in a pickup 
truck when they noticed the blaze in the trailer two pumper trucks 
drove up an access road to the blaze and the firefighters were 
killed instantly when the trailer containing the chemicals exploded 
a few miles away when the flash of light brightened her bedroom 
cindy denning thought the worst 
i woke up and my first reaction was its nuclear war or else a 
gas explosion in my building i thought the building probably was on 
fire she said 
when ms denning looked out the window she saw what resembled 
something out of a war movie people in nightclothes some 
carrying children and possessions shouting and scrambling to get 
into cars in the cold 
police cars with loudspeakers drove through another apartment 
complex a halfmile away from the construction site across a heavily 
wooded ridge warning residents to evacuate for fear of a second 
explosion 
the second blast was not as loud as the first but it still 
sounded like a volcano erupted said apartment resident tamara 
taylor she and her husband kerry grabbed their 9yearold 
daughter and fled 
all the glass in the apartment broke everything exploded in 
midair mrs taylor said i heard the police say the word 
evacuate and that was all i needed to hear it scared the living 
daylights out of me 
the explosions which created two huge craters at the 
construction site knocked out electricity for blocks in the 
surrounding area many people in the metropolitan area thought they 
had felt an earthquake or a natural gas explosion 
neighborhoods just to the north of the blast site looked as 
though they had been ravaged by riots thousands of windows were 
blown out of businesses homes schools banks and hospitals up to 
10 miles away property damage was expected to total in the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars 
at the 4acre motel threequarters of a mile from the blast site 
doors were blown off hinges scores of windows were broken and the 
explosion blew a lock out of a door 
its just like a bomb really said motel clerk dee 
cornelius property you can fix up but those poor firemen 
flags flew at halfstaff around the city and fire bells tolled at 
9 pm to mark the worst loss of life in the history of the kansas 
city fire department 
firefighter john seise who was manning an emergency shelter at a 
nearby apartment complex for people who had to evacuate their homes 
knew all six of the dead firefighters 
i tell you what i havent come to grips with it seise said 
i just cant get it off my mind you never realize how vulnerable 
you are in this business until something like this happens

quarterback joe montana and his wife made an 
emotional televised appeal to the kidnapper of a 9yearold girl who 
is the object of an intense fbi search that has yielded few clues 
and left police baffled 
the san francisco 49er star said tuesday the thought of losing 
one of his two daughters to a kidnapper just about brings tears to 
our eyes to watch another parent going through that is just 
devastating to us we just pray that it never happens to us and 
that hopefully these children will come back 
michaela joy garecht was abducted nov 19 from a supermarket 
parking lot near her home in hayward across the bay from san 
francisco an 8yearold girl who was with michaela described the 
man as white 18 to early 20s 6 feet tall with shoulderlength 
blond hair and a pockmarked or pimpled face 
were here as parents to ask the kidnapper of michaela to 
please release her said montana said responding to an unusual 
request from the fbis san francisco office 
authorities also announced an intensive effort to find michaela 
by sending 40000 information packets to truck stops hospitals and 
police departments nationwide they include recent photos of the 
blondhaired blueeyed youngster and an artists sketch of the man 
who took her 
jennifer montana said she thinks about the kidnapping every day 
when shes with her children alexandria 3 and elizabeth 23 
months 
we went looking for a christmas tree last night she said 
i called out to my daughter who was running to other trees i 
tried to keep a close eye on them but theyre monsters and theyre 
everywhere 
i called out for alexandria and she didnt answer she said 
i called her twice and she didnt answer immediately that 
kidnapping goes through my mind i said you answer me right 
now and i hear in the distance yes mama and my heart starts 
to pump again thats the way it is 
montana said he and his wife have become very cautious about 
their children and we urge everybody else to be 
fbi spokesman chuck latting said the agency contacted montana 
because we thought this would be a very appropriate public figure 
that people would stop and listen to he was extremely receptive to 
doing this 
latting couldnt recall another kidnapping case in which an 
unrelated celebrity was asked to make a public appeal for the return 
of the victim 
this is a totally different type of kidnapping than usual 
latting said its a child and theres no demand for ransom and no 
correspondence its just a snatch off the street 
dick held special agent in charge of the san francisco office 
said its highly unlikely that michaelas kidnapper is looking for 
money so it puts law enforcement in a position where were really 
totally dependent on the public to get involved 
more than 100 police officers and fbi agents earlier this week 
searched the wooded hills nearby without finding any evidence 
at least a dozen fbi agents are working full time on the case 
latting said along with at least two dozen more investigators from 
hayward and neighboring police agencies 
we have never had an investigation of this magnitude hayward 
police officer ray alsdorf said

a moderate earthquake jolted alaskas most 
populous area but there were no immediate reports of damage 
officials said today 
the tremor which registered about 54 on the richter scale 
struck at 1156 pm ast tuesday and was centered about 80 miles 
west of anchorage said bill zitek of the alaska tsunami warning 
center in palmer 
the quake was felt throughout anchorage and very strongly in 
palmer where it woke everybody up he said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every 
increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude thus a 
reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 
65 
an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale can cause considerable 
damage and 6 can be severe 
the quake which killed 131 people in alaska in 1964 registered 
84 richter and the san francisco earthquake of 1906 was estimated 
at 83

israeli soldiers ambushed two heavily armed 
guerrillas in southern lebanon and killed one but the second 
escaped a military spokesman said today 
no israeli soldiers were hurt in the gunfight the spokeman said 
the clash occurred late tuesday southeast of the lebanese 
village of barashit in the israelicontrolled security zone in 
southern lebanon the spokesman said barashit is about five miles 
from israels northern border 
the israeli force noticed during a routine patrol that a squad 
was moving southeast of barashit the military spokesman said 
speaking on condition of anonymity the force stormed the squad 
and one guerrilla was killed another escaped 
the dead guerrilla was armed with hand grenades submachine guns 
and rocketpropelled grenades the army spokesman said 
it was not immediately clear whether the guerrillas were headed 
to israel to launch an attack on an israeli settlement the army 
spokesman said 
last month eight israeli soldiers were killed when a car bomb 
exploded in the security zone not far from the israeli border 
israel carved out the security zone a narrow strip of land 
running along the northern border when it withdrew the bulk of its 
forces from lebanon in 1985 israeli troops now patrol the area 
together with the south lebanon army an israelibacked militia

leaders of 25 major us jewish groups urged 
israeli leaders to oppose a proposal to grant orthodox rabbis sole 
power over conversions to judaism 
the delegation met with prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign 
minister shimon peres on tuesday the first day of a twoday visit 
to israel to protest the socalled who is a jew legislation 
four religious parties emerged as power brokers in the nov 1 
election they won a promise from shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
that a likudled government will pass the measure 
such legislation has been proposed in various forms including as 
an amendment to the law of return which defines who may become an 
israeli 
the law now defines jews as those born to a jewish mother or 
converted to judaism the amendment would add the phrase converted 
according to orthodox regulations 
most affiliated american jews belong to the reform and 
conservative streams of judaism and many consider such legislation 
a symbolic repudiation it would prevent reform and conservative 
converts from emigrating to israel under the law of return 
rabbi daniel syme of stamford conn vice president of the 
reform movements union of american hebrew congregations said the 
delegates told shamir and peres of the tremendous anger 
frustration and disillusionment felt by american jews over the 
proposed changes 
syme called shamirs reaction a nonresponse a lack of 
recognition of the significance of the issue he said shamir made 
no promises 
shamir later met with orthodox rabbis from the united states who 
backed the proposed legislation 
shamir has said he would keep his promise to the religious 
parties even if peres leftofcenter labor party joined a likudled 
coalition and rendered the religious parties superfluous 
before the religious parties struck a deal with the likud they 
engaged in negotiations with labor which offered wideranging 
concessions on the who is a jew issue 
in his meeting with the american delegation peres acknowledged 
his error in seeking an accommodation with the religious parties 
syme said 
he indicated he was prepared to remove the religious agenda 
from the table of negotiations and in effect challenge the prime 
minister to join him in that commitment syme said 
peres said later on israel radio i explained to them that we 
shall vote against the change in the law of return 
the american delegates said they proposed to shamir and peres a 
three to fiveyear moratorium on religious legislation to give 
orthodox rabbis and diaspora jews a chance to work out a compromise 
the delegates represent most major american jewish groups 
including reform conservative orthodox and secular organizations 
more than 30 meetings with israeli politicians and religious leaders 
were scheduled during the twoday visit

his house was a crumbling shell and most of 
his belongings were broken or gone but tornado victim robert d 
keys managed some humor as he surveyed what had been his bedroom 
get a load of this he said tuesday holding up a sopping 
paperback book entitled how to survive the 80s 
i guess it taught us something 
survival was uppermost in the minds of keys and hundreds of 
others who began putting their lives back together after rampaging 
tornadoes cut a destructive swath through heavily populated northern 
raleigh early monday 
two raleigh residents were among the four killed in the state 
157 were injured in the night of terror that state officials said 
caused an estimated 100 million in damage 
survivors voiced gratitude for life and health as they salvaged 
what property they could and looked to the future 
youve got to joke a little bit cry a little bit grunt and 
grumble but then move on said keys associate professor of 
crop science at north carolina state university 
affected neighborhoods were beehives of activity on the sunny 
cool day tuesday sightseers gawked police watched abandoned houses 
for looters and crews replaced lost road signs the buzz of chain 
saws pounding of hammers and roar of heavy machinery at times 
drowned out conversations of residents who traded stories of their 
brush with death as they worked 
keys said he his wife and two daughters jumped out of bed and 
dashed like frightened jackrabbits to the small firstfloor 
hallway seconds before a twister tore into their splitfoyer house 
no one was hurt the roof and secondfloor walls were blown away 
but the first floor was left standing despite heavy interior damage 
when keys ventured upstairs he saw that a sturdy 50foot oak 
had tumbled across his bed if wed still been there it would 
have been goodbye he said 
nearly unrecognizable under limbs and debris in keys back yard 
was wreckage of a 34foot motor home that had been parked on the 
street in front of his nextdoor neighbors house lee dimond and 
her family were trying to attach a tow truck to a twisted car 
blocking access to the motor home 
we only moved in two weeks ago said ms dimond 23 an 
employee of ge mortgage insurance co soon she and her sister 
daisy will move into an apartment with their three dogs a fourth 
died in the tornado and a few salvaged belongings 
it didnt get my closet so ive got some clothes she said 
but just about all the furnitures gone were going to try to get 
my washer and dryer started

manager told one disenchanted tenent

in bed when the tornado hit were tossed down a 60foot embankment

marcos is healthy enough to face criminal racketeering charges in 
new york but marcos attorney refused to say whether the exiled 
philippine president would seek a second opinion 
we received word that dr francis weld decided the president 
was healthy enough to travel to new york said spokesman gemmo 
trinidad but we have received no official report on the matter 
and im going to have to refer all other questions to our lawyers 
im with the president i see him every day and its clear he 
is not well not healthy enough to travel no matter what the 
doctors say he added 
trinidad said he did not know when the 71yearold marcos was 
expected to appear and would not disclose his reaction to the news 
defense lawyers contend marcos is too frail to make the 10hour 
flight and a hearing is scheduled monday before judge john keenan in 
new york 
marcos attorneys have said they would seek medical tests by 
neutral physicians if their client was judged fit to travel but 
san francisco attorney john bartko said tuesday the defense team 
would read the full report before making its next move 
wed advised him that there would undoubtedly be various 
opinions about the state of his health bartko said until we 
read the full report well reserve judgment about what we should do 
next 
marcos has been using a wheelchair since he and his wife imelda 
were indicted oct 21 on criminal racketeering charges accusing them 
of plundering the philippines treasury and stashing much of the 
money in the united states

the same day as his wifes court appearance marcos was examined 
for about three hours at tripler army medical center here weld a 
cardiologist at new yorks columbia presbyterian hospital refused 
then to comment on his findings 
marcos fled to hawaii in february 1986 after a militarycivilian 
revolt ended his 20year rule and catapulted corazon aquino to the 
presidency 
in an interview with the associated press early this month 
marcos said he doubted whether he would live through a criminal 
trial raising the health issue that his attorneys have frequently 
said would play a major role in the case

commuters climbed aboard military trucks for an 
unusual ride to work today after the government called out the army 
to carry people stranded by a bitter transit strike 
two out of four regional express train lines were paralyzed for a 
third straight day by a maintenance workers strike called by the 
communistled general confederation of labor 
disruptions have spread to the metro and city buses but most 
metro lines were functioning normally and the transit agency 
reported about 60 percent of the buses were running 
more than 200 military vehicles were on hand to help get people 
to work but even with up to 25 people crammed into a truck the 
fleet can only carry a fraction of the capacity of the express 
trains 
i feel like a victim said computer operator houria 
bendahmane after a twohour ride from the suburb of st 
germainenlaye west of paris we were wellassisted but frankly 
it was not too comfortable it was cold and windy and wet 
commuters arriving in trucks at the porte dorleans at the 
southern edge of paris said it took 90 minutes on clogged highways 
for what is normally a 30minute ride on the train 
these are military trucks usually used for logistical 
transport but were trying to make them as comfortable as 
possible jeanpierre de valence spokesman for the military 
governor of paris said on french radio im sure that with good 
humor everyone will understand its something interesting 
at the porte de vincennes in eastern paris soldiers who just 
finished working the morning rush hour reported a cheerful 
atmosphere 
people took it very very well there was joking and 
storytelling between the passengers and the soldiers said 
patrick a soldier who refused to give his last name it lifted 
everybodys morale 
more military vehicles were headed to the capital and officials 
said several hundred private buses were also being chartered to 
replace the missing trains 
michel rousselot head of the paris autonomous transit agency 
said early today after 14 hours of meetings with representatives of 
the labor federation and six other unions that the agency was 
sticking to the salary offers the unions have rejected 
the federation the dominant union at the transit agency is 
demanding increased safety measures and acrosstheboard pay 
increases of 170 per month 
the transit agency has offered immediate monthly raises of about 
25 plus bonuses ranging from about 17 to 100 per month for next 
year the agency is offering an increase of 22 percent 
the current average monthly salary is about 1100 
after the meeting the labor federation and a smaller union the 
french democratic confederation of labor both called for the strike 
to continue while the other unions said they would consult their 
members 
president francois mitterrand said tuesday on national television 
that the government acted wisely in calling out the army rather 
than give in to a small number of persons cabable of blocking an 
entire system

alain juppe secretarygeneral of the rightist rally for the

cats are leading a dogs life here as 
city council has ruled that leash laws pertaining to rover also 
apply to fluff and mittens 
under a law that effective friday all cats in naperville must be 
inoculated and wear identifying collars in addition if the cats go 
outdoors and set foot on any street alley or other public place 
they must be on leash 
the same rules adopted on a 51 vote late monday apply to dogs 
but the leash requirement was already part of the existing animal 
control ordinance 
violators face fines of 35 to 200 and the threat of 
confiscation of cats authorities will attempt to contact the owners 
of any seized cats through registered letter but after seven days 
the animals could be put to death 
its absurd said james vandendorpe who spoke out against 
the proposal at the meeting my family has had our cat for eight 
years and hes always worn a collar but theres no way hes going 
to become used to a leash at his age 
the new cat laws were supported by members of the naperville 
humane society and by village animal control officer kim johnson 
who said she needed it to combat various cat nuisances 
its pretty hard to get people to understand that dogs cant 
run at large and poop in your garden but cats can said police

the president of estonia today defended his 
republics fight for greater autonomy after legislators denounced 
its declaration of sovereignty during heated debate over proposed 
constitutional changes 
arnold ruutel addressed the 1500member supreme soviet on the 
second day of the parliaments debate over reforms put forward by 
president mikhail s gorbachev last month gorbachev says the 120 
articles of legislation are the first major step toward a political 
system based on law not central dictate 
ruutel told fellow deputies that economic and environmental 
problems prompted estonias declaration of sovereignty nov 16 over 
all internal affairs and its demand to review all new soviet 
legislation 
ruutel said he appreciated some of the amendments to gorbachevs 
proposed reforms that were announced tuesday as well as plans to 
widen and defend the sovereign rights of republics in the next 
stage of reform but he indicated estonia still is not satisfied 
with the plan being debated 
the reforms are to be voted on thursday 
in particular ruutel said estonia would prefer to retain its 
current supreme soviet or parliament rather than having the 
nations 15 republics create a congress of peoples deputies 
the congress concept is the base of gorbachevs political reform 
after nearly three hours of open session the presidium the 
nations highest executive body and two committees of the supreme 
soviet met in closed session to discuss suggestions made by deputies 
ruutel did not mention statements of other estonian leaders who 
have indicated they plan to ignore last weeks action by the 
presidium of the supreme soviet nullifying estonias sovereignty 
declaration 
many deputies echoed some of estonias complaints about the 
restructuring but most of the speakers berated the small republic 
for passing a constitutional amendment giving it the right to veto 
soviet laws 
the estonian action undermines the unity and principles of our 
multinational state said a deputy from vladimir a town about 
120 miles east of moscow 
these are antisocial actions the deputy said 
some deputies apparently misunderstood estonias action 
one speaker complained the republic had already canceled all 
soviet laws 
most national newspapers have published criticism of the estonian 
action without explanation of the changes made by the republic in 
its law 
at tuesdays session gorbachev bowed to criticism of his 
proposed reforms saying he would accept tighter limits on 
presidential power and try to accommodate the republics seeking 
greater autonomy 
it is obvious that some of the provisions of the bills were not 
formulated precisely enough and caused quite a few critical remarks 
in the course of discussions gorbachev told the supreme soviet 
some have said the draft laws actually stengthen the presidency 
which gorbachev assumed on oct 1 and strengthen moscows power 
over that of the soviet republics 
legislators left the parliamentary session tuesday night with 
their first written copies of the 88 changes made by kremlin leaders 
a remarkable response to the criticism of the original reforms 
gorbachev said the amended draft gave the supreme soviet the 
right to veto decrees of the presidium the highest executive body 
and of the president himself 
some officials including the presidents of the latvian and 
lithuanian republics and the communist party chief of georgia 
called for more changes 
many deputies supported gorbachev but the objections came from 
such disparate locations as leningrad the ukraine and the obscure 
autonomous region of bashkiria 
in my constituency a barometer would find a large storm around 
the changes to the constitution said a deputy from zaporozhets 
identified only as zhilovsky 
citizens were particularly concerned about curbing the power of 
moscow ministries whose factories pollute with impunity and 
eliminating a plan to allow organizations like the communist party 
and trade unions to elect onethird of the new congress of peoples 
deputies he said

plague and waved banners calling for dismantling the six american 
installations here 
leto villar vice chairman of the movement told the crowd the 
government was mounting an anticommunist propaganda campaign but 
we know that communism is not the cause of poverty 
leftists have accused the police and military of cracking down on 
legal leftwing organizations including the may first movement two 
leaders of a movementaffiliated transport workers union were 
arrested last week and charged with inciting sedition after leading 
a strike of passenger jeep operators 
the military says the movement is a communist front but union 
officials deny the charge 
during one speech about 10 youths wearing handkerchiefs over 
their faces walked to the middle of the podium carrying a sign 
supporting the kabataan makabayan or nationalist youth the youth 
wing of the banned communist party of the philippines 
earlier about 200 hooded youths shouted revolution 
revolution and threatened manilas police chief during a rally 
marking the 24th anniversary of the founding of the nationalist 
youth 
protesters scattered after the brief rally and police made no 
arrests 
the military said unidentified gunmen fired tuesday on a 
passenger jeep in mindanaos lanao del norte province killing five 
women the military said the slaying may have stemmed from a family 
feud 
also tuesday a woman was killed in lanao del norte when two men 
believed to be moslem rebels fired on a truck carrying about 20 
hitchhikers 
in a third incident suspected communist rebels shot to death a 
soldier and a civilian riding a motorcycle tuesday in surigao del

riot police hurling tear gas broke up a 
march today by hundreds of students and workers who tried to reach 
the presidential palace to demand the arrest of former president 
chun doohwan 
also today political leaders considered a recommendation by a 
presidential panel that drastic curbs be placed on the national and 
military intelligence agencies to end their domestic spying and keep 
them out of politics 
thousands of riot troopers in green combat fatigues and visored 
helmets blocked the protesters with shields as they tried to march 
towards the palace arrest chun doohwan punish president roh 
taewoo protesters yelled 
police scuffled with protesters after they marched out of a city 
center subway station where they first held an evening rally to 
demand roh be removed from office and chun be put on trial for human 
rights abuses 
unable to break through the police lines 1500 protesters then 
marched through the main shopping district yelling slogans and 
scattering leaflets 
a few firebombs were hurled at a government office but did not 
cause any damage riot police moved in to disperse the marchers with 
tear gas grenades 
dozens of protesters hurled firebombs and rocks at police in a 
brief clash as other marchers fled 
there were no reports of arrests or injuries 
the protest was smaller than major protests nov 19 and 26 when 
thousands of people demanding chuns arrested clashed with police in 
seoul 
about 200 students demanding chuns arrest battled police with 
firebombs in a separate protest wednesday in songnam on seouls 
southern outskirts 
chun a former general who took power with military backing went 
into internal exile last week after apologizing to the nation for 
alleged corruption and human rights abuses under his rule 
roh appealed for mercy for chun but opposition and dissident 
groups insist the former president answer questions about the 
alleged corruption 
several of chuns close associates and relatives have been 
convicted of or charged with corruption and other offenses the 
former president has denied he was involved in any corruption 
government officials had no immediate response to recommendations 
made tuesday by the public administration reform commission which 
was set up by roh to recommend government changes 
the commission said the agency for national security planning 
formerly known as the korean central intelligence agency should 
confine its domestic activities to fighting espionage and 
subversion it should not be used for political purposes and should 
operate under the law the agency said 
the agency has been criticized harshly by the people because of 
its political maneuvers and abuse of power which resulted in human 
rights violations said shin hyunhwack chairman of the 
commission 
the commission also recommended confining the militarys defense 
security command to gathering and analyzing military intelligence 
the national security agency which would still conduct overseas 
intelligence operations is a large shadowy organization that often 
has played a major role in enforcing the rule of past authoritarian 
governments 
both intelligence agencies have traditionally play major roles in 
domestic politics 
roh in a speech to the nation saturday pledged to revise the 
tough national security laws often used by the agencies 
roh a former general who won presidential elections in december 
has pledged to remove authoritarian controls 
other recommendations included limiting the number of domestic 
offices of the national security agency reducing its authority 
within the government and subjecting the agency to government 
auditing 
government sources meanwhile indicated a new cabinet and other 
major changes would be announced by early next week up to 11 
ministers could be removed because of their ties with chun 
according to press reports

jetliner testified today that mohammed ali hamadi came into the 
cockpit carrying a gun seconds after a us navy diver was shot 
aboard the aircraft 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is being tried on murder and 
air piracy charges in the 1985 jetliner hijacking he has admitted 
hijacking the athens to rome flight with an accompllice and 
diverting it to beirut lebanon

during the ordeal in which 39 americans were held hostage for 17 
days 
describing the circumstances of stethems shooting the copilot 
46yearold philip g maresca told the court i was able to peek 
out of the corner of my eye and i thought i was able to determine 
that a passenger was being dragged to the front of the plane 
then i heard a gunshot a short time later about 10 to 15 
seconds later hamadi came into the cockpit with a gun in his hand 
then uli direckson the flight purser came in very distressed 
and said one of the passengers had been killed maresca said 
fighting back tears as he described the scene 
the divers parents richard and patricia stethem listened 
quietly during the testimony the elder stethem took notes as he has 
done regularly since the trial began on july 5 
hamadi sat nearly motionless listening to an arabiclanguage 
interpreter translate marescas testimony other witnesses have 
testified they believed hamadi killed steham but no one has said 
they saw him do it 
outside the highsecurity courtroom scores of police some 
carrying machine guns patrolled the area 
during his testimony maresca said he did not see the shooting 
because hamadi said look forward and not behind and not to pay 
attention to any noise

airports in the area 
maresca said he felt hamadi was the leader of the two hijackers 
us officials have identified the other as hassan ezzeddine 
another lebanese shiite moslem 
hamadi appeared to me and it was a very strong impression 
that he was the leader he spoke on the radio he grabbed the 
microphone most of the time he did most of the beatings of the 
crew maresca said 
he was more volatile very excitable the other hijacker tried 
to restrain hamadi when he was extremely abusive hamadi had the gun 
most of the time and he made most of the demands on us maresca 
said 
in keeping with court policy on security for former hijacking 
hostages maresca was not asked to give his current address 
before marescas testimony chief judge heiner mueckenberger 
accepted a defense motion made last week that hamadi be given a 
psychiatric examination the defense claims hamadi was mentally 
disturbed at the time of the hijacking 
the judge said hamadi would undergo three days of phsychiatric 
tests soon 
hamadi was arrested jan 13 1987 at frankfurt airport after 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage

a nationwide furor over 
segregation intensified today after one rightwing town council 
voted to consider a curfew for blacks and two removed portraits of 
the president from their chambers 
the conservative party which depicts president pw bothas 
limited reforms as capitulation to the black majority provoked the 
controversy by implementing strict segregationist policies this week 
in some of the dozens of municipalities it won in local elections 
oct 26 
three towns in transvaal province carletonville boksburg and 
brakpan voted in recent days to ban blacks from public facilities 
that were integrated in recent years such facilities include public 
parks toilets and sports centers 
the carletonville council went a step further tuesday night 
ordering a study of whether a curfew should be imposed barring 
blacks from the mining town at night 
conservative party officials said curfews would be reintroduced 
in any towns where its councils felt the security of whites was 
threatened 
in carletonville and springs a small industrial city 25 miles 
east of johannesburg the conservativecontrolled councils voted 
tuesday to remove photographic portraits of botha from their 
chambers they replaced them with the municipal coat of arms 
in one ward in boksburg voters cast ballots today for a town 
council vacancy in a byelection viewed as a referendum on the 
segregation issue 
a conservative party candidate was competing with an independent 
backed by bothas national party which has denounced the 
restoration of petty apartheid even though it has made no moves 
to repeal the legislation allowing segregation of local amenities 
the conservatives resegregation campaign has drawn criticism 
from business leaders and sports officials as well from 
antiapartheid leaders in boksburg blacks have begun a consumer 
boycott of whiteowned businesses and some have withdrawn accounts 
from local banks 
liberal politicians while joining in denunciations of the 
conservative party decisions have noted that many public facilities 
are segregated in municipalities controlled by the national party 
exactly the same bigotry and selfishness is tolerated and 
condoned by nat leadership said douglas gibson transvaal leader 
of the liberal progressive federal party 
foreign minister pik botha acknowledged some whitesonly signs 
remain on public facilities in nationalistcontrolled cities but 
said we are in a process of removing them 
the conservative party knows very well it is endangering white 
security said botha who is not related to the president their 
own supporters will in the near future have to pay the price for 
their unnecessary emotional outburst of racism 
a presidential council tuesday rejected a bill proposing to 
enforce residential segregation laws and recommended it be redrafted 
to ease penalties and decriminalize some offenses 
the bill was referred after a deadlock in parliament where it 
was passed by the national partydominated white chamber but 
rejected by the asian and mixedrace chambers 
under apartheid south africas majority 26 million blacks have 
no representatives in parliament and no vote in national affairs

areas of poland inhabited by more than 12 million people officials 
said today 
the report summarized in the leading newspapers was called a 
judgment of effectiveness and directions of action in the field of 
shaping and protecting the environment the party daily trybuna 
ludu said it should be called judgment of uneffectiveness 
according to the report poland ranks second in europe in sulfur 
dioxide emission most polish rivers lack drinkable water most 
beaches on the baltic sea have been closed and the amount of 
industrial wastes in the country has increased by nearly half in the 
past five years 
a spokeswoman at the academy the countrys foremost research 
institution said the report was prepared by a committee of the 
academy earlier this year and was now being made public 
there has been a complete breakdown of the state of natural 
balance in 27 areas inhabited by onethird of polands 38 million 
people the newspaper zycie warszawy said in its summary of the 
report 
it shows in a degradation of the natural order incapability 
by the environment for selfcleansing and an increase of diseases 
resulting from the state of the environment 
the report said that economic losses stemming from environmental 
problems were also huge amounting to 10 percent of the countrys

a toddlers fiveorgan transplant was 
smoother and much easier than the only other time such surgery 
was performed and she should do as well as a liver recipient 
doctors say 
rolandrea dodge 3 of fruitland nm was awake today and was 
being weaned from the respirator said childrens hospital of 
pittsburgh spokeswoman sue cardillo shes a very bright little 
girl im sure if she could shed be asking whats going on 
rolandrea was in the hospitals intensive care unit in critical 
condition which is considered normal after multiple transplants 
she received a liver pancreas stomach small intestine and part 
of a large intestine during a 16hour operation that ended tuesday 
afternoon her spleen also was removed in the experimental surgery 
rolandreas heart was functioning normally after the operation 
and her new liver was producing bile said dr satoru todo who 
headed the surgical team at childrens hospital of pittsburgh she 
also was moving her hands and legs to the delight of her parents 
branden and cyndi dodge 
the prognosis is very difficult to say but im expecting it to 
go well todo said tuesday 
at this point you dont know where you are other than that you 
got through the surgery very successfully said dr william 
donaldson the hospitals medical director 
the operation went smoothly except for one episode when the 
chilled organs which came from an unidentified young victim were 
inserted into rolandreas 30pound body todo said her body 
temperature dropped dramatically and her heart stopped beating for 
about a minute 
surgeons restarted her heart with cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
the only other fiveorgan recipient tabatha foster 3 of 
madisonville ky underwent the operation at childrens hospital 
last november she died six months later of a blood infection but 
survived longer than any of the three americans who had had 
abdominal transplants involving two or more organs 
this time it went smoother and much easier this baby doesnt 
have any previous surgery as tabatha did todo said 
doctors plan to give rolandrea less antirejection medication 
than they gave tabatha so her immune system is stronger and she is 
less susceptible to infection todo said 
there is no reason why she should not fare as well as liver 
transplant patients he said we have to be very careful 
about 80 percent of the hospitals liver transplant children 
survive the first year 
rolandrea who is known as rolly arrived at childrens hospital 
in midoctober to be evaluated for a multiple organ transplant 
rolly was born with an incurable disease called intractable 
secretory diarrhea which prevented her intestines from absorbing 
food and liquids she had to be fed intravenously although she was 
allowed occasional nibbles of candy potatoes and other solid food 
aside from brief outings rolly has spent her entire life in 
hospitals doctors in new mexico said she wouldnt survive long 
unless she underwent a multiple organ transplant 
the girls liver began failing about three months ago as a result 
of her highprotein intravenous feedings and her skin became 
jaundiced because of bile pigments in the blood 
doctors began administering an experimental drug on nov 9 in 
hopes of allowing her intestines to absorb food and liquids but it 
was unsuccessful said hospital spokeswoman sue cardillo 
doctors decided a week ago to proceed with a multiple organ 
transplant as soon as a suitable donor was found 
dodge 27 a coal miner said shortly after arriving in 
pittsburgh that it was difficult deciding whether to allow rolly to 
undergo the operation but he said its the only hope that weve 
got left

the government today threatened to close 
the yugoslav consulate following a fourday diplomatic row over the 
shooting of a croatian teenager during a demonstration 
prime minister bob hawke demanded full cooperation from 
yugoslav authorities after 16yearold joseph tokic was wounded in 
the throat sunday when a security guard inside the consulate fired 
on hundreds of demonstrators 
it is appropriate we put directly to the yugoslav authorities 
what the implications of noncooperation are he said hawke said 
there was no question of the guard being allowed to return to 
yugoslavia and if any charges were to be filed they would be made 
in australia 
foreign minister gareth evans threatened to close the consulate 
following a vigorous diplomatic wrangle over police access to the 
guard accused of shooting the protester police were allowed to 
interview the guard tuesday 
evans said closing the consulate was under serious 
consideration and warned of adverse consequences between australia 
and yugoslavia if the guard did not surrender to police to face 
criminal charges 
he called the incident intolerable and warned any plea for 
diplomatic immunity would be rejected 
hawke earlier made a stern plea to new immigrants to leave their 
racial problems behind he said do not turn australia into a 
battleground 
australia with a population of 165 million has a large 
yugoslav community 
yugoslavia lodged a strong protest over what it called a lack of 
police protection during the incident and has not issued a formal 
apology for the shooting leading to criticism from australian 
newspapers and politicians 
the statements by the prime minister and his foreign minister 
follow a fourday standoff over access to the security guard 
identified as matijas zoran yugoslav consulgeneral stanojlo glisic 
defended the shooting on grounds he was at risk when demonstrators 
jumped the walls 
i would like you to face that mob with four people outside and 
rest inside he said one demonstrator took a rubber hose and 
struck me on the face so the security guard realized it was 
dangerous i was almost halfblinded by the chaos 
police upgraded their presence at the consulate following a bomb 
scare they linked to sundays demonstration a police official said 
all cars in and out of the consulate were being searched in case 
yugoslav authorities tried to spirit zoran the security guard out 
of the country 
tokic remained in stable condition at st vincents hospital 
doctors said they were contemplating a second operation to remove 
the bullet from his throat the boys parents said they expected 
their son to regain use if his voice in about one week and called 
him a very very good boy

the kremlin ideology chief says the new policy of 
greater openness will not be extended to books by alexander 
solzhenitsyn the nobel prizewinning author thrown out of the 
country for his antigovernment views 
the novels are not beneficial to society vadim a medvedev said 
at a news conference tuesday 
what we have here is a struggle against our system as such 
i am against the publication of a number of works by solzhenitsyn 
and in the first place such works as lenin in zurich and the 
gulag archipelago he said 
to publish solzhenitsyns works would mean to in effect 
undermine the foundations on which todays life rests medvedev 
said 
medvedev the newest member of the ruling politburo is regarded 
as one of those closest to president mikhail s gorbachev 
under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness many 
prohibited works have been published 
some writers artists and activists in informal political groups 
have urged that solzhenitsyns works be published and that he be 
allowed to visit the soviet union 
the author was expelled from the soviet union in 1974 and lives 
in cavendish vt 
medvedev is considered a theoretician of many social and economic 
reform policies but his statement made clear there still are limits 
on the amount of openness allowed under gorbachevs reforms 
solzhenitsyns novel one day in the life of ivan denisovich 
was published in 1962 during the thaw allowed by nikita s 
khrushchev after the death of stalin but the remainder of his major 
works remain unpublished in his native land 
gulag archipelago solzhenitsyns masterpiece is a chronicle 
of soviet political repression lenin in zurich is part of a 
cycle of books solzhenitsyn still is completing about the 1917 
bolshevik revolution and traces the life of vladimir i lenin in 
exile in the years just prior to the soviet takeover 
medvedev was chosen kremlin ideology chief in a shakeup of top 
communist party and government jobs by gorbachev this year 
medvedev said that in solzhenitsyns work a position is being 
developed which radically contradicts our social and political 
system our understanding of the world of history our attitude 
toward lenin

major environmental groups today presented more 
than 700 recommendations to presidentelect george bush calling at 
the top of their list for action to combat global warming from the 
greenhouse effect 
one recommendation is for a big increase in required fuel 
efficiency for automobiles 
the coalition of 30 environmental groups organized as 
blueprint for the environment also called for raising the 
environmental protection agency to full cabinet status and 
increasing its budget by about 20 percent the fiscal 1989 budget 
contains about l5 billion for epa operations 
in all the coalition proposed increased spending of about 55 
billion for a variety of environmentbenefiting programs including 
2 billion for mass transit 
the groups recommended 129 billion in tax increases most of 
that from higher taxes on gasoline and other fuels they asked 
spending cuts totaling 22 billion including an end to what they 
said were subsidies to the nuclear power industry 
thomas b stoel jr a staff attorney of the natural resources 
defense council who served as chairman of blueprint for the 
environment said humanitys exploitation of the worlds energy 
and other resources global warming of the atmosphere pollution of 
the air water and land and poisoning of the worlds oceans 
threaten to choke off worldwide economic progress indeed they 
threaten the physical viability of the planet itself 
he said the united states was no longer the leader on 
environmental issues and that regaining that status will be the 
first and most important task for presidentelect bush 
many scientists believe that the globe faces a warming of 3 to 8 
degrees fahrenheit on average by the middle of the next century 
this warming is caused by the trapping of the earths heat by 
gases emitted into the atmosphere by human activity most 
importantly carbon dioxide from burning fuel that trapping of heat 
is called the greenhouse effect 
peter aa berle president of the national audubon society said 
that to counter such a warming and to combat other air pollution 
problems such as acid rain bush should order that improved energy 
efficiency be the top priority of the energy department 
berle said setting such a priority would require increasing 
emphasis on renewable technologies such as solar systems and raising 
the fuel efficiency of us automobiles to 45 miles per gallon from 
the current requirement of 265 mpg 
stoel had breakfast with bush this morning and presented a 
summary of the groups recommendations which were contained in 16 
volumes being distributed to the bush transition team for study and 
use by various departments 
bush has made environmental protection a theme of his campaign 
calling for among other things new controls on the sources of acid 
rain if the governments current 5 billion fiveyear clean 
coal demonstration projects dont bring enough pollution reduction 
other groups in the coalition include defenders of wildlife the 
wilderness society the sierra club the national wildlife 
federation friends of the earth and the izaak walton club

a senior iranian official has denied 
allegations that iranian authorities recently executed thousands of 
political prisoners tehran radio reported today 
the radio monitored in nicosia quoted deputy foreign minister 
mohammad javad larijani as saying that only those who have taken 
arms against the islamic revolution or tried to kill people have 
been tried and executed 
speaking at a news conference in the iranian capital tuesday 
larijani said that allegations of executions of antigovernment 
elements in iran were propaganda statements from world imperialist 
powers the radio said 
larijanis remarks followed an islamic republic news agency 
report monday that six clerics and three other men were executed 
earlier this month after a religious court found them guilty of 
being implicated in various offenses 
irans main opposition group the mujahedeen khalq or peoples 
holy warriors claimed tuesday that 5000 political prisoners have 
been executed in iran since august 
the iraqibased group said in a statement that the executions 
were carried out on orders from iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
the mujahedeen claim made in a statement telexed to the 
associated press in nicosia from the groups headquarters in 
baghdad iraq could not be independently confirmed but it followed 
a un report issued earlier this month condemning iran for a wave 
of executions of opposition leaders after accepting a ceasefire 
in its war with iraq 
dissident iranian sources have claimed that the executions are 
part of a continuing power struggle within the government they 
claim infighting has intensified since the aug 20 ceasefire 
between iran and iraq

a closed court hearing on secret documents 
irancontra prosecutors want to use as evidence against oliver l 
north was convened today after security officers checked the 
courtroom for electronic bugs 
us district judge gerhard a gesell took the bench behind 
closed doors after court security officials used electronic 
equipment to sweep the courtroom to satisfy themselves that no 
listening devices had been planted 
the hearing began a day after gesell upheld all but one of the 
key charges that the former national security council aide illegally 
diverted usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels and 
lied to congress 
with virtually all the pretrial motions disposed of the judge 
today turned his attention to the equally difficult issues posed by 
the thousands of pages of classified government documents each side 
wants to use as evidence in the trial 
north attended the hearing with his attorneys brendan v 
sullivan jr and barry simon a plainclothes security agent who 
usually accompanies the retired marine lieutenant colonel to court 
was not allowed in the courtroom 
the secret proceeding was convened to consider norths objections 
to deleting sensitive references from 350 classified documents 
covering 1000 to 2000 pages that independent counsel lawrence e 
walsh wants to use as evidence in the case 
north contends the references to foreign countries and us 
intelligence agents are needed for his defense along with the 
contents of 40000 other ages of classified documents 
walsh accusing north of trying to provoke dismissal of the 
charges by threatening to disclose the secrets wants gesell to bar 
the former national security council aide from using any of the 
material at trial 
gesell on tuesday struck a wirefraud allegation one of the 
three central charges against north because he found it was a 
purely cumulative count that would require a complicated and 
confusing legal instruction to the jury 
the dismissal suggests the wirefraud charges against norths 
codefendants also may be dropped eventually the codefendants 
former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers 
albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v secord are 
scheduled to be tried separately 
the judge rejected norths arguments that the conspiracy and 
embezzlement charges were legally flawed saying the indictment 
clearly alleges a conspiracy which involved concealing the very 
existence of the profits of the enterprise from the start and hiding 
from congress information relating to the conspirators assistance 
for the contras 
gesell also denied defense motions to dismiss six charges that 
north lied to congressional committees in 1985 and 1986 by falsely 
denying that he was covertly helping the rebels in violation of the 
boland amendments 
he said norths facial attack on the constitutionality of the 
boland amendments is misplaced the series of provisions named 
for rep edward boland dmass prohibited direct us military aid 
to the contras 
norths understanding as to the constitutionality of boland in 
no way affords an excuse for his alleged misconduct or entitled him 
to obstruct the way the government was in fact functioning 
gesell said 
nor can north justify his conduct because of doubts expressed by 
the reagan administration that the boland amendments applied to 
activities of the national security council staff gesell said 
if prosecutors deliver on their promise to prove that president 
reagan ordered his white house staff to obey the boland amendments 
norths alleged unauthorized deviation from such limitations must 
be viewed as contrary to lawful government functions he ruled 
the judge also rejected the defense contention tht congress 
exceeded its powers in questioning the national security council 
aide about his efforts to help the contras 
north did not refuse to answer congressional queries on the 
grounds that congress had no constitutional right to query national 
security council officials gesell said in fact he is alleged 
to have asserted his and the nscs full compliance with the boland 
amendment 
the judge also rejected a defense argument that the charges 
infringe on the presidents exclusive power to conduct diplomacy and 
intelligence operations 
in ruling on 34 of norths 37 pretrial motions gesell has 
upheld 14 of the 16 original charges against the retired marine 
lieutenant colonel it appears unlikely that he will grant three 
remaining defense motions to dismiss the charges north lied to 
congress on other legal grounds 
gesell in a separate order refused to bar walsh and his 
associates from todays hearing saying that granting norths 
request would alter the purpose of the hearing and result in 
further and wholly unnecessary delay of the trial which he 
previously indicated may start in late january

two of the 17 terrorists convicted in the 1983 car 
bombings of the us and french embassies are expected to be 
released quietly when their prison terms end shortly informed 
sources said today 
officials at the interior and information ministries had no 
comment 
members of the proiranian islamic jihad organization of beirut 
have demanded the release of the 17 from kuwaiti jails in return for 
the freedom of american and other foreign hostages held in lebanon 
the embassy bombings left five dead and 86 injured 
the two terrorists the sources referred to were 25yearold iraqi 
national abdulmohsen rashash abbas and 30yearold nasser matar 
dahash whose family lives in kuwait without official citizenship 
in march 1984 the two were sentenced to fiveyear prison terms 
with hard labor by the state security court after being found guilty 
of possessing arms and explosives without a license the sentence 
also called for their deportation when the prison term ends 
other officials who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed 
that the two were to be released after fulfilling their jail term 
they said that kuwait does not want to discuss this publicly 
the sentences were the most lenient meted out for the bombings 
three of the others who faced the more serious charges of 
masterminding and carrying out the attacks were condemned to death 
although the executions have not been carried out the rest were 
given sentences ranging from life to 1015 years hard labor 
according to legal sources the two will be deported to a country 
of their choice once released their prison terms would be 
calculated from the time of their arrest in december 1983 the 
sources said 
all the defendants were believed to be members of the underground 
islamic aldaawa party a proiranian group that was operating 
underground in iraq kuwait lebanon and elsewhere in the middle 
east 
nine americans are among the 14 hostages believed held in 
lebanon peter winkler 32 a swiss red cross employee was abducted 
by three unidentified gunmen nov 17 no group has claimed 
responsibility for the kidnapping 
the longest held foreign hostage is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was abducted march 
16 1985 
kuwait has refused to bow to the demand to release the 17 
terrorists despite threats by islamic jihad and a series of other 
terrorist acts that included a 1985 car bombing attack on the 
motorcade of the emir sheik jaber ahmed sabah the ruler escaped 
with minor injuries 
the hijackers of a kuwaiti airways plane in april also demanded 
the release of the 17 terrorists but kuwait refused the plane was 
hijacked april 5 two kuwaiti passengers were killed in the 16day 
ordeal which ended when the hijackers surrendered in algeria and 
were given safe conduct 
since august when iran and iraq began a ceasefire in their 
8yearold war ties between iran and kuwait have been improving 
iran had accused kuwait of aiding iraq in the war

nearly a year ago that a jewish settler was convicted of killing a 
palestinian the defendant israel zeev claimed he fired in 
selfdefense 
leaders of the settlement movement meanwhile called on the army 
to take harsher steps against arab rioters deporting those who 
throw stones and barring anyone arrested for protesting from ever 
holding a job in israel 
it seems to me we have a war going on here but it is being 
treated like a demonstration said haim granit a brigadier 
general in the reserve army who lives in the west bank settlement of 
elkana the army must be given orders so they can handle this as 
they should

a lawsuit filed on behalf of female high school 
seniors accuses the state education department of sex discrimination 
for using standardized test scores as the basis for awarding 
scholarships 
the classaction lawsuit filed tuesday in federal court 
challenges the states decision to award 25000 scholarships to the 
1989 graduating class based solely on the scholastic aptitude test 
the education departments exclusive use of sat scores violates 
due process because it is arbitrary and irrational and violates 
equal protection under the law because it discriminates against 
women said robert levy an american civil liberties union lawyer 
between 1977 and 1987 state regents and empire scholarships were 
awarded annually to students who scored high on the sat a national 
standardized test taken by collegebound high school seniors 
because boys score an average of 60 points higher than girls 
boys won more state scholarships 72 percent of the empire and 57 
percent of the regents awards 
to remedy the discrepancy the state decided to use gradepoint 
averages as well as sat scores to award scholarships to the 1988 
graduating class the percentage of boys winning scholarships 
dropped to 50 percent of regents and 62 percent of empire awards 
but next year the state wants to again use sat scores only 
department spokesman christopher carpenter said the use of 
gradepoint averages was problematic 
the diversity of school districts around the state makes it 
virtually impossible to come up with a single grade system 
carpenter said 
the 41 million scholarship program is the largest in the nation 
based solely on performance rather than need 
the lawsuit names as plaintiffs 10 female high school seniors 
the girls club of america and the national organization for women

with a flat no secretary of state george 
p shultz today rejected a move in the united nations that he 
reverse himself and grant plo chairman yasser arafat a visa to speak 
to the general assembly 
he said that his decision barring arafat was based on us law 
and that the controversy shows how easy it is for people to forget 
the devastation which terrorism can wreak on a country 
shultz repeated his assertions that arafat was an accessory 
to acts of terrorism by the palestine liberation organization 
against americans and israelis at the same time shultz rejected a 
british reporters suggestion the interational row raised by the 
decision could be a blot on his last days as secretary of state 
i operated within the framework of a law here shultz 
replied if the thing i am remembered for is most of all a strong 
and a great resolve to resist and combat terrorism i wont feel 
thats a blot on my record ill feel that is a proud 
accomplishment 
the general assemblys legal committee voted 1212 tuesday night 
to ask the state department to grant arafat a us visa only the 
united states and israel were opposed 
that was an indication of how lopsided the vote was likely to be 
today when the 159member general assembly takes up an 
arabsponsored resolution deploring shultzs decision 
asked if he would reverse himself shultz replied no 
the subject dominated an interview he gave over the us 
information agencys worldnet program to reporters in western 
europe they asked more questions about arafats visa than the 
suggested topic the meeting soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will 
have in new york next wednesday with president reagan and 
presidentelect george bush 
while defending the decision shultz stressed that palestinian 
arabs had a central role to play in mideast peace efforts we want 
to see a good dialogue with the palestinians shultz said 
he recalled his efforts to meet with palestinians in jerusalem 
during trips to the region this year all those invited following 
plo instructions did not show up 
shultz said the palestine national council the legislative arm 
of the plo had taken some significant steps during its recent 
meeting in algiers but he said the plo should go further and 
recognize israels right to exist 
if they can do it implicitly why cant they do it

nov 24 
the journalbulletin providence ri on the stealth bomber 
the stealth bomber has yet to fly if forthcoming tests are 
successful however there is no good reason not to add it to the 
arsenal 
many factors will make the stealth bomber particularly 
expensive possibly 500 million per jet the defense department 
wants 132 of them 
yes the price is rather steep and yes opponents are already 
lining up against the stealth hoping to shoot it down for costing 
too much 
we believe that congress and the white house can disagree 
reasonably on how many stealth bombers need to be built and how 
quickly they must be deployed 
but stealth has received bipartisan support in the past it 
deserves bipartisan support in the years to come

farmington nm daily times on bushs promise not to raise 
taxes 
all kinds of experts are trying to convince the american people 
that presidentelect george bush wont be able to keep his campaign 
promise to reduce the federal budget deficit without increasing 
taxes 
republicans and democrats alike in the nations capital are 
joining the big spenders chorus that keeps singing the old song 
proclaiming deficit reductions cannot be achieved with federal 
spending cuts alone 
to bushs credit he takes the position that revenues already are 
adequate enough to fund necessary federal programs 
the key words of course are necessary federal programs 
after bush is inaugurated jan 20 we urge him to stick to his 
campaign promise 
the people should demand that the us senate and house of 
representatives toe the mark when it comes to reducing the budget 
deficit and holding the line on taxes

portland maine press herald on the irancontra trials 
the criminal justice system not politics should determine the 
fate of lt col oliver north and others who may soon be going to 
trial over their role in the irancontra affair 
conservative leaders see the impending trial less as a legitimate 
judicial exercise than a political showdown between the executive 
and legislative branches of government 
wrong it is nothing less than a reaffirmation of the principle 
that no one no matter how highly placed is above the law 
since the trial isnt scheduled to get under way until after 
reagan has left the oval office it looks as though a presidential 
pardon isnt in the cards not for this president anyway 
the question to be answered now is not whether north served the 
political aims of the white house well or poorly during the 
irancontra affair but whether he broke laws in the process 
and that as the president himself admits is best determined 
in the courts

one of the biggest problems every vice president faces is simply 
finding something worthwhile to do 
britains prince charles faces a similar dilemma the heir 
apparent to the throne recently celebrated his 40th birthday since 
his mother queen elizabeth ii is only 62 currently in good 
health and not particularly inclined to abdicate charles may have 
to wait a decade or two to become king 
while he is waiting the prince who is a year younger than vice 
presidentelect dan quayle has found some meaningful and 
worthwhile work to occupy his time 
charles regularly visits innercity slums schools and factories 
he organized project fullemploy to prepare young urban blacks for 
jobs persuaded some london companies to offer jobs to people who 
have dropped out of school and plays an active role in helping the 
poor gain title to their own homes through sweat equity 
if bush means what he says and if quayle runs out of meaningful 
work to do bush might suggest that his vice president look to 
charles example it should be an eyeopening experience for quayle 
who is a son of wealth and privilege and it might do some good for 
the country

the mail tribune medford ore on the b1b bomber 
former president jimmy carter deserves credit for being on 
target when it came to the b1b bomber program 
recently a b1b bomber crashed and burned while trying to 
land 
the crash came two days after the air force said it had cleared 
63 of the nations 98 b1b bombers to return to service the entire 
fleet had been grounded since nov 8 when a b1b crashed and burned 
at dyess air force base in texas 
the b1b was intended to modernize the longrange bomber 
fleet until the recently unveiled b2 stealth bomber could become 
fully operational 
critics say the bomber cannot fulfill its assigned mission of 
flying deep into soviet territory with a payload of nuclear bombs 
they say it is too slow it consumes too much fuel and it is too 
heavy for pilots to handle safely 
today the nation is paying and paying for president 
reagans decision to overrule carters veto of funds for the b1b

los angeles times on the thaw in sinosoviet relations 
the world may be about to witness the sort of fundamental 
strategic realignment that happens only once or twice in a 
generation 
without fanfare relations between the soviet union and china 
have warmed to the point where the worlds two great communist 
powers are ready to undertake their first highlevel exchanges in 
decades 
if chinese foreign minister qian qichens trip this week to 
moscow turns out as well as expected it will lay the groundwork for 
a historic summit in 1989 between soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and deng ziaoping chinas senior statesman the first 
since nikita s khrushchev traveled to beijing in 1959 
as relations between moscow and washington have warmed the 
chinese have felt left out of deliberations over intermediate 
nuclear missiles and other matters important to them 
us strategists believe that reduced tensions between china and 
the soviet union may eventually make the whole region more secure 
but the sinosoviet split has been such a fixture for so long that 
once it disappears other readjustments may be in store

the capital times madison wis on delinquent farm loans 
imagine if your holiday mail included a 200page packet from the 
federal government with this grim choice fill out this material or 
lose your farm 
the farmers home administration sent out the packets the week 
after the election to farmers who were delinquent on their loans 
it took the fmha five months to put together all this material in 
response to a 1987 law now it wants farmers to respond in 45 days 
45 days that coincide with the holiday season 
while the cold and calculating may say that those who cant hack 
it ought to get off the farm that attitude ignores both the 
vagaries of the farm economy and the wider threat to rural america 
in the steady demise of small farms 
it also ignores the human pain involved when the farmer not only 
loses a job but a home and land often passed on from generation to 
generation 
a group of 14 members of congress is seeking to extend the 
45day response period so that beleaguered farmers at least have 
more time to search out their options under the new federal rules 
the extra time could help some farmers cope with the complexity 
of the law and perhaps could give them a chance to survive 
economically through 1989

the duluth minn newstribune on president reagans veto of the 
ethics bill 
maybe president reagan didnt like the nickname of the ethics 
bill he killed last week with a pocket veto 
it was informally called the never again mike deaver bill 
taking on the name of reagans former aide and close friend who was 
convicted of illegal influence peddling lobbying after he left the 
white house 
whatever his reason reagan refused to sign the bill that would 
have imposed tougher curbs on lobbying by both former administration 
officials and for the first time imposed the same restrictions 
on former members of congress 
the reagan administration has a dismal record when it comes to 
conflicts of interest and this would have been one final 
opportunity for the president to say enough it stops here 
instead he said business as usual

the honolulu starbulletin on the us denial of a visa to yassir 
arafat 
secretary of state george shultzs decision to deny a visa to 
the palestine liberation organizations yasser arafat to visit 
united nations has raised the hackles of many arab leaders 
but it also sends a useful message concerning the united states 
resolve to combat terrorism 
shultz has done the right thing in our opinion by underscoring 
his and the nations policy of repelling terrorists and those who 
abet their aims 
organizations which take part in or foster acts of terrorism are 
simply going to have to do more for peace and cooperation before 
they reach the un bargaining table

the west palm beach fla post on uscanadian trade 
canada has voted for free trade with the united states now its 
up to leaders on both sides of the border to see that this concept 
is not distorted for ends that are political rather than economic 
the overriding issue in last weeks national elections was the 
treaty signed in january by prime minister brian mulroney and 
president reagan under which all remaining tariffs on trade between 
the two nations will be phased out over a 10year period beginning 
jan 1 
properly implemented the treaty can open up new opportunities 
for both nations removing the economic barriers from what already 
is the worlds longest border free of military barriers

the wenatchee wash world on the englishonly movement 
it is time to put the brakes on the englishonly bandwagon a new 
idea branded englishplus has a lot more to recommend it 
concern about this issue arises because three more states 
passed englishonly amendments to their state constitutions earlier 
this month during the big national election they joined 13 other 
states that had already passed englishonly laws of their own 
while much of the nation has perceived these laws as relatively 
harmless in the past there is a growing sense that theres more 
to this legislation than just promoting english 
racist comments are surfacing which make it clear some backers of 
englishonly laws are more worried about keeping certain segments of 
the population down than they are about lifting language skills up 
 
in response to this negative approach taken by englishonly 
groups opponents have coined the new slogan englishplus to 
demonstrate their commitment to teaching english while preserving 
minority languages 
we should even go beyond that by encouraging more americans to 
learn other languages especially japanese chinese and spanish to 
deal most effectively with the entire pacific rim over the next few 
decades

vice presidentelect dan quayle said today he 
would make no recommendation to his homestate governor on whom to 
appoint to his senate seat although he did not turn aside 
suggestions that he favors rep dan coats for the post 
quayle in an interview with the associated press also said he 
was intentionally moving slowly on major staffing decisions during 
this transition period in contrast to presidentelect george bush 
who is rapidly picking top aides 
to rush right into it i think i could in fact be regretting it 
down the road ive got time theres no time pressure on me ive 
got to be ready by jan 20 quayle said 
quayle who was meeting later today with indiana gov robert d 
orr said he hopes orr will make the senate appointment relatively 
soon he said he had not made a specific recommendation nor 
will i 
but asked about coats quayle did not reject a reporters 
suggestion that the indiana republican was his personal choice 
coats represents the congressional district that quayle represented 
from 1976 to 1980 and he was quayles district representative in 
fort wayne ind during that period 
obviously i think a lot of dan coats he worked for me for 
four years hes been a very good congressman from my old 
congressional district he took my seat weve had a long and strong 
personal and professional relationship quayle said 
he has said he will resign effective jan 2 to allow his 
appointed successor seniority over other incoming senators orrs 
office has said the republican governor is expected to wait at least 
two weeks before making a selection 
the turtlelike pace of quayles transition aides say reflects 
that a politician moving from the legislative to the executive 
branch of government inevitably needs some educating 
moreover the vice presidentelect apparently is in no hurry to 
make appointments without bushs acquiescence 
hes not going to rush it said dan evans the head of 
quayles transition team whose friendship with the indiana senator 
goes back nearly 20 years 
quayles transition team operates from a white federalstyle 
town house off pennsylvania avenue near the old executive office 
building where quayle eventually will work as vice president 
the town house customarily is set aside for the use of former 
presidents and the walls are adorned with photographs of gerald 
ford jimmy carter and richard nixon the quarters are elegant if 
cramped with barely enough room for secret service agents posted in 
the narrow hallways press aides on the second floor must move to 
the lobby if the senator wishes to use the conference room that 
serves as their makeshift office 
those drawbacks aside evans says quayles transition is moving 
ahead as it should and quayle is selecting his staff in 
consultation with presidentelect bush and his staff 
he isnt waiting for approval or disapproval but in keeping 
with the collegiality of the decisionmaking process decisions will 
not be made in a vacuum evans said in a recent interview 
bush moved quickly to pick his chief of staff john sununu and 
many of his top cabinet officials an announcement on quayles chief 
of staff who will head a team of roughly 100 people is expected in 
early december 
evans himself is said not to be in the running nor are any of 
the top handlers that traveled with quayle during the campaign 
many of them veterans of previous white house jobs have said they 
now prefer private life evans wont say whether quayle is looking 
for a washington insider indiana crony or someone from his senate 
staff 
dozens of high quality resumes and hundreds of unsolicited 
resumes have come into the transition office evans says but quayle 
is educating himself on the executive branch before he makes his 
staffing decisions 
and although quayles staff organization will be patterned after 
bushs vice presidential office there is one top adviser who 
doesnt appear on any official flow chart that is marilyn quayle 
the senators wife who occupies an office in the transition 
building and who probably will have space in the vice presidential 
office as well 
there is no adviser senior to her evans says 
quayles work day usually begins shortly after 7 am when he 
arrives to prepare for breakfast meetings it ends 12 or 13 hours 
later after more meetings perusal of briefing papers and an 
occasional blacktie dinner 
his meetings have read like a roster of the conservative elite 
heritage foundation president ed feulner outgoing rep jack kemp 
rny conservative columnists george will william f buckley jr 
and william safire former united nations ambassador jeane 
kirkpatrick and paul weyrich of the free congress foundation 
evans rejects the notion that quayle is being used by the right 
to further its agenda for the incoming administration the 
conservatives he says were simply the first ones to call 
dan quayle is a conservative but he is the instrument of no 
particular group evans says

a un committee overwhelmingly denounced 
the us refusal to let yasser arafat into the country and urged a 
reversal of the decision in a harsh resolution sent to the general 
assembly today 
the 1212 vote tuesday evening by the assemblys legal committee 
indicated how lopsided the vote in the full assembly is likely to be 
the united states and israel opposed the resolution which 
recommended the state department issue a visa to the palestine 
liberation organization leader so he can address the general 
assembly on the palestinian issue 
arafat in sudan for talks on the middle east situation was 
quoted as calling the us decision not to grant him a visa 
illegal 
in kuwait the no 2 man in arafats fatah plo faction called on 
arab states to withdraw their us ambassadors for the remaining 
weeks of the reagan administration to protest the us decision 
withdrawing the arab ambassadors from washington for 45 days 
will be the simplest expression of a panarab reaction against the 
rudeness of the united states and its secretary of state george 
shultz said salah khalaf addressing a rally tuesday night 
britain abstained from tuesdays un vote because it opposed 
strong language in the resolution european nations joined the arab 
and nonaligned countries in supporting the measure 
the legal committee formally called the sixth committee has 
delegates from all 159 member nations but not all were present for 
the vote 
the plos permanent observer at the united nations zuhdi labib 
terzi said arab nations would offer another resolution to move the 
general assembly to geneva if the first resolution passed 
it would be the first time the general assembly has shifted its 
session in protest although special sessions have been held in 
geneva 
clovis maksoud the arab league ambassador said he had enough 
votes to reconvene the general assembly in geneva 
francois giuliani spokesman for un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar said no figures were available on the cost of the 
move but other un sources said it would be relatively modest one 
source suggested it could be about 150000 
that would cover the cost of flying a few new york un personnel 
to geneva site of the headquarters of the defunct league of 
nations it has facilities for sessions of the 159nation assembly 
most nations were expected to assign their geneva ambassadors to 
the session diplomats said 
the general assembly on tuesday delayed its annual debate on the 
palestinian problem originally scheduled thursday friday and dec 
6 to allow arrangements for arafat to speak elsewhere 
on saturday the state department rejected arafats application 
for a visa to address the general assembly this week saying he 
condones and encourages terrorism that set off an international 
uproar and demands that arafat be allowed to speak 
under the 1947 usun headquarters agreement the united 
states pledges not to impede the travel or work of un diplomats or 
guests the plo holds nonvoting observer status at the united 
nations and is an honored invitee 
it is considered the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people and is invited to speak in all debates on the 
palestinian issue and the middle east 
behindthescenes negotiations sponsored by the british failed to 
remove the caustic language from the resolution which said the 
united states was in violation of the host country agreement 
the committee said it deplores the refusal to grant arafat a 
visa 
british ambassador sir crispin tickell said his delegation 
supported arafats right to speak and said the united states should 
have shown respect for the united nations by honoring the host 
country agreement 
but tickell said the committee should have respected the united 
states by removing the harsh language from the resolution the arab 
sponsors refused

eleven people were killed in clashes between 
armenians and azerbaijanis in ethnic violence in at least five 
cities in armenia official sources said today 
the deaths reported by the official armenian news agency 
armenpress on the basis of official government information raised 
the death toll in more than a week of ethnic violence to at least 18 
leon azruyan an editor at the news agency said in a telephone 
interview that the 11 dead included 10 azerbaijanis and one 
armenian the figure included clashes in cities throughout armenia 
that occurred nov 2229 but only were reported officially today 
he said 
the armenian was killed in the city of goris in southeastern 
armenia by azerbaijanis who fired into a crowd of armenians holding 
a rally azruyan said two people were seriously wounded and the 
attackers slipped away he said 
in the city of kalinino in far northern armenia an azerbaijani 
fired into a crowd of armenians but they threw stones at him one 
hit him in the head and killed him azruyan said 
he said the other deaths occurred in the cities of kirovakan 
krasnoselsk and spitak in northern armenia but that there was no 
detailed information on how many died in each city or what the 
circumstances were 
the previous seven deaths officially reported all occurred in the 
azerbaijani city of kirovabad 
four soldiers were killed protecting the armenian population from 
crowds of azerbaijanis and three civilians were shot and killed 
there by soldiers for violating curfew regulations 
military law and a strict curfew have been imposed in the 
armenian capital yerevan the azerbaijani capital baku and cities 
around both republics 
baku and yerevan were reported by official and activist sources 
to be relatively quiet today 
trouble began in the caucasus republics in february when the 
predominantly armenian population of the nagornokarabakh region of 
azerbaijan began agitating for annexation by armenia 
azerbaijan and the central soviet government have rejected 
annexation 
mass demonstrations followed in armenia and at the end of the 
month ethnic rioting broke out in the azerbaijani city of sumgait 
killing at least 32 people 
the latest unrest began in midnovember azerbaijanis accused 
armenia of sending settlers into nagornokarabakh to increase the 
armenian majority there forcing azerbaijanis out of work and 
refusing them food and medical supplies 
on tuesday the president of azerbaijan suleiman tatlev blamed 
armenians for starting the latest outbreak of violence 
tatlev said violence began when armenians sacked and burned 
azerbaijani homes in nagornokarabakh and instigated mass firings of 
the azerbaijani minority about a month ago 
he told reporters at tuesdays meeting of the supreme soviet 
national parliament that about 4000 azerbaijanis fled to baku and 
officials found the leadership of nagornokarabakh unwilling to 
solve the problem

blood tests given residents of the 
mining port of skagway where soil with among the nations highest 
lead contaminations was found indicate there is no immediate health 
threat state officials say 
but the state department of environmental conservation said 
tuesday it will require cleanup of the contaminated soil to make 
sure there are no problems in the future 
dick stokes the agencys regional supervisor called the results 
encouraging 
but he added regardless of the blood results so far there 
still is a lot of lead and zinc in the soil were very lucky that 
no more has been ingested than it has but its still there and we 
still think cleanup is going to be necessary 
for decades trucks and trains carrying ore from lead and zinc 
mines have rumbled into skagway a town of 700 people north of 
juneau in the alaska panhandle most recently the huge mine at faro 
in canadas yukon territory has been moving ore trucks through 
skagway every halfhour 24 hours a day 362 days a year 
lead contamination in soil at the oreloading terminal on the 
edge of town reached about 57000 parts per million making it one 
of the worst known sites of lead contamination in the nation state 
environmental officials have said 
in town lead was tested at about 28000 ppm at one site and 
about 20000 ppm at another the federal government generally 
requires cleanup of sites with more than 1000 ppm of lead 
lead poisoning can cause high blood pressure and neurological 
problems children and pregnant women are particularly susceptible 
to health damage 
the state offered voluntary blood and urine tests to the towns 
residents the report released tuesday said that of the 161 blood 
samples and 40 urine samples taken only five showed lead levels 
greater than normal 
the report said those five were from people who worked at the 
oreloading terminal and that they already undergo regular 
monitoring for lead levels 
it also said there was no need for additional tests or routine 
monitoring of skagway visitors or residents other than those who 
work at the terminal 
environmentalists said such onetime blood tests are not 
definitive 
im glad that most of the results arent high enough that 
immediate intervention is required but i dont think its 
appropriate for the health department to say no further tests are 
warranted said kristine benson of the alaska center for the 
environment

a young man who blamed his life of 
crime on his name adolph hitler clark has pleaded guilty to a 
charge of thirddegree murder and also learned his middle name is 
hilbert 
clark 18 pleaded guilty tuesday in the slaying of a man who was 
trying to buy cocaine he faces up to 12 years in prison 
meanwhile chief assistant public defender bill white presented 
circuit judge john d southwood with a copy of clarks birth 
certificate showing the young mans middle name is actually hilbert 
and not hitler 
clark said in an interview last year that he used his middle name 
as an excuse for his criminal activity 
after i learned who hitler really was i decided people 
expected me to live up to his name he said 
his father theodore clark said he named his son adolph after 
the boys uncle and thought hitler would be a good middle name 
after seeing the document southwood ordered the criminal 
information changed to reflect clarks correct name 
white said after the hearing that the combination of the 
mispronunciation of hilbert and the familiarity of the nazi leaders 
name apparently led to clark being called adolph hitler clark 
clark pleaded guilty to being one of two gunmen who shot terry 
lamar combs 35 on aug 2 as the man was negotiating to buy cocaine 
prosecutors dropped a seconddegree murder charge against clark 
on the condition that he plead guilty to the lesser offense and 
testify against codefendant anthony michael cobb 18

mice prone to developing a blood cell cancer 
gained partial protection from a human gene that influences blood 
cell development suggesting that developmental genes may affect 
vulnerability to cancer researchers say 
such genes may make a difference in how long normal cells remain 
susceptible to turning malignant they said 
the work is reported in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature by philip leder michel nussenzweig and emmett schmidt of 
harvard medical school with colleagues there and at the childrens 
hospital of los angeles 
they worked with mice that carried a human cmyc gene which puts 
them at high risk for developing a blood cell cancer called preb 
cell lymphoma preb cells are those that will develop as b cells 
an important part of the bodys diseasefighting immune system 
those mice were bred with others that carried a different human 
gene one that makes b cells skip an early stage in their 
development 
some progeny from these matings inherited both human genes and 
their lymphoma rates were compared to those that carried only the 
cancercausing gene results showed that the gene that speeds 
development caused both a delay and a reduction in the tumors 
researchers said 
by 117 days of age half the mice that carried only the 
cancercausing gene had developed lymphoma but none of the mice 
with both genes had developed it after a year more than 90 percent 
of the first group had developed tumors compared to only 40 percent 
of the mice with both human genes 
the developmental gene apparently hampered development of cancer 
by speeding up the maturation of preb cells leaving fewer at 
stages most susceptible to the cancercausing gene researchers 
suggested 
in general a diverse group of genes that produce either an 
acceleration or pause in cell development may influence the rates 
and time of onset for cancer researchers said

the carcasses of 48 of the endangered 
kemps ridley turtles have washed ashore in south georgia and north 
florida this fall 
this is pretty much a crisis said charles maley of the 
georgia department of natural resources this is the most weve 
ever had in a year 
ten kemps ridley turtles turned up dead on georgia beaches in 
october and 11 have been reported so far in november maley said 
in florida 27 carcasses have been found on amelia island the 
northernmost island on the states east coast since oct 28 
according to jan johnson floridabased coordinator for the national 
sea turtle campaign of the environmental group greenpeace 
we usually find one or two in fall months ms johnson said 
according to ms johnson kemps ridleys are considered the 
rarest and most endangered of all sea turtles they are also one of 
the smaller species with the females shells averaging about 30 
inches long she said only 400 to 600 nesting females are believed 
to exist worldwide 
ms johnson said she believes the kemps ridleys which migrate 
south to a nesting beach at rancho nuevo mexico fell victim to 
commercial shrimp boats shrimpers sometimes accidentally catch sea 
turtles in their nets and drown them

order shortly after 8 am it planned to issue an opinion explaining 
its reasoning later 
the commission had been scheduled monday to tell federal

two days because of chappells lawsuit 
a veteran of 20 years in congress chappell lost to james by 732 
votes in a recount of the nov 8 general election 
messages were left for chappell today but the telephone calls 
were not immediately returned 
we are delighted we had a victory for the people of the 4th 
district james said adding that he had 11 lawyers research the 
law to attempt to disenfranchise the voters of the 4th district 
is tantamount to being unamerican 
james said in a telephone interview from washington that he hopes 
chappell will concede and help with an easy transition 
chappells lawsuit sought to have flagler countys election 
results invalidated claiming the county elections supervisors 
office missed a sevenday deadline after the election to file 
returns with state officials 
state law requires that returns be ignored if they arrive after 5 
pm on the seventh day after an election but the canvassing 
commission said it would be unjust to disqualify voters because of a 
technicality 
without the countys 10907 votes chappell would have won by 288

his occasional briefings for the media 
they are huge agribusinesses now and whatever reason there was 
for having an exemption 50 years ago when perhaps they were smaller 
those reasons dont seem to exist today he said 
repeating a call he has made often he said he hoped congress 
which moved toward ending the insurance industry exemption this 
year will complete action next year 
discussing directions that should be taken by the new 
administration oliver also suggested a review of the unfair 
competition faced by forprofit firms from the commercial arms of 
notforprofit entities 
asked for an example he cited pharmacies operated by hospitals 
competing with privately owned pharmacies 
why should not all commercial enterprises be subject to the 
same antitrust tax and other legal obligations oliver said 
olivers term as chairman of the agency which supervises the 
antitrust laws jointly with the justice department has expired 
however he remains in office until a successor is named or he is 
reappointed he has said he is available to retain the post should 
presidentelect george bush want him to do so

agricultural workers who are in the country illegally have until 
midnight to apply for immigration amnesty a deadline that is 
passing quietly and is tainted with charges of fraud 
federal immigration offices around the country braced for a 
lastminute rush as the last call is made for the illegal aliens 
applications for us residency 
under a special provision of the 1986 immigration law foreign 
farmhands must prove they harvested fruits vegetables or other 
perishable crops in the united states for at least 90 days in a 
oneyear period that ended may 1 1986 to be eligible 
more than half of the applications filed for the special 
agricultural workers program have come from california followed by 
florida with about 10 percent and texas with about 8 percent 
significant numbers have also been filed in the northwest arizona 
and new york 
under the initial phase of the legalization program that ended 
may 4 temporary residency was granted to more than 17 million 
illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the united states 
since jan 1 1982 
the immigration and naturalization service had estimated that 
600000 farm workers would apply for the latest program the figure 
topped 1 million by the first week of november and up to 200000 
more are expected before the filing period ends said aaron bodin 
who heads the program in washington dc 
but in a last desperate chance to become legal us residents 
many farmworkers are using fraudulent documents to prove they worked 
here to qualify 
many farmhands unable to obtain the needed documents turn to 
labor contractors who hire illegal immigrants for a fee many of 
these contractors provide the documentation bodin said 
mary lopez the californiabased director of the martin luther 
king jr farmworkers fund said shes heard of people paying up to 
800 for a phony letter 
in denver donald h russell ins district director said more 
than 20 percent of the documents filed by the over 17000 applicants 
in colorado wyoming and utah were fraudulent 
but we havent reviewed a lot yet russell said we expect 
it will go higher 
in the western states in recent weeks 70 percent of applications 
filed have been recommended for denial officials said 
although it appears many will ultimately be approved immigration 
officials say the final denial rate may be as high as 50 percent 
in the northeast more than 40 percent of the almost 20000 
applications were fraudulent said amy otten an ins spokeswoman in 
burlington vt 
fraud was high throughout the eastern region especially in 
larger metropolitan areas ms otten said 
the deadline comes without the fanfare the one in may during the 
last month of that yearlong application period the ins as well as 
private groups put out the word on radio television billboards 
newspapers and pamphlets 
but even as the agricultural program ends quietly lines outside 
ins centers have lengthened in the past week or so officials say 
today was the longest line weve had since may 4 henry 
mcgehee legalization center director in el paso texas said 
tuesday but it wasnt nearly as long as the ones we had then 
longer lines have been reported in the lower rio grande valley 
where there are more farms and farmworkers 
in phoenix officials said more than 52000 farm workers were 
expected to apply by the deadline 
the number has greatly exceeded what we anticipated at the 
beginning of the program said richard perry deputy director of 
the phoenix ins district 
farm workers queued up early today at the ins office in 
albuquerque nm but betty garcia the offices acting supervisor 
said the scene was not hectic 
its nothing like the may 4 close of general amnesty garcia 
said 
she said more than 4000 people had applied at her office for 
amnesty under the agricultural program 
new jersey immigration officials also expected to tally large 
numbers of applicants today 
its kind of like april 15 with taxes said jack lonergan 
ins assistant district director for exams lots of people will 
wait until the last minute 
in florida applications jumped from 200 a day to as many as 
1200 in the last few weeks the ins said 
its really increased in the past week said perry rivkind 
district director one day last week we had 1200 in tampa alone

nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev who have had 
a testy relationship in the past will attend a luncheon next week 
while their husbands meet elsewhere in new york it was announced 
today 
the meeting would occur at the same time as the session 
tentatively set for governors island where president reagan 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and vice president george bush 
are to confer over lunch next wednesday 
the two women whose frosty relationship has become a sideshow in 
superpower gatherings will attend a gathering hosted by marcella 
perez de cuellar the wife of the un secretary general javier 
perez de cuellar 
mrs reagans spokeswoman elaine crispen said that other 
americans and soviets will be invited to the lunch including 
barbara bush and helena shultz it will be held at mrs perez de 
cuellars residence in new york city mrs crispen said 
mrs reagans spokeswoman said the first lady planned to travel 
to new york for a private dinner with friends on tuesday evening and 
that she did not expect to change that schedule 
she plans to return to washington wednesday evening with the 
president mrs crispen said 
the testy relationship between mrs reagan and mrs gorbachev was 
apparent during their last meeting in moscow during the spring 
summit between reagan and gorbachev as they openly competed for the 
spotlight during their tours of moscow and leningrad 
mrs reagan has said she found the soviet first lady to be 
somewhat abrupt during their past encounters 
in an interview published nov 13 in the los angeles times mrs 
reagan was asked whether she found mrs gorbachev to be rude 
by our standards i suppose yes she replied now by her 
standards it might not be 
its just coming from two completely different cultures and 
trying to get together for the first time and maybe one not 
understanding how the other works she said 
mrs reagan also said she believes that there was way too much 
attention paid about that whole thing 
ever since the two women first met over tea at the first 
superpower summit in geneva in november 1985 there have been 
persistent reports that they did not get along 
mrs reagan did not accompany her husband to the hurryup summit 
held in reykjavik iceland in october 1986 but mrs gorbachev did 
a move that reportedly irked the first lady 
their differing styles clashed during the washington summit last 
december when mrs gorbachev repeatedly interrupted a white house 
tour to talk with reporters about subjects ranging from us history 
to sociology 
in moscow mrs gorbachev again spoke at length to reporters 
while cutting off mrs reagans attempts to do so 
mrs reagan insisting i want to say something i want to say 
something now ok finally got her chance to chat with reporters 
after the soviet first lady backed away

money has been rolling in since word got 
out that a small catholic college was stuck with 94000 cookbooks 
and a printers bill for 400000 after a fundraising project went 
awry 
i call it felix culpa its a latin expression meaning happy 
fault that is used frequently in monastic circles said sister 
judith oconnell assistant development director for our lady of the 
elms college 
sister judith said wednesday hundreds of mail orders have been 
arriving daily at the womens college since to the sisters 
chagrin their plight was publicized in midnovember 
people do care she said those in topeka kan and 
houston texas have been particularly kind but weve gotten orders 
from 20 states 
although too swamped to give an exact number she said more than 
5000 orders have already been filled and some companies have 
approached the sisters about distributing the book 
if it keeps up we could sell all the cookbooks she said 
we really do believe in miracles and the response to that story 
has become part of our miracle 
the sisters of st joseph who run the 750student college had 
hoped to raise 1 million for scholarships through sales of the 
350recipe book in good taste at 10 a copy but a year later 
they had sold only 6000 copies 
sister mary dooley college president acknowledged that the 
100000copy printing may have been over optimistic 
weve gotten such lovely letters from all sorts of people 
said sister judith 
one man sent a check for 500 for 25 books he said that he had 
been educated by one of the sisters that is now working at the 
college she said another tried to cheer the sisters by tucking a 
book of poetry into his order 
some said they were touched by a small school committed to 
providing an education for people who wouldnt otherwise be able to 
afford college sister judith said others said they just 
believed in religious education or were cookbook collectors but in 
large part it is really a tribute to sisters all over the country 
and the way these women have touched peoples lives

leaders of the leftleaning labor party 
today voted to turn down a bid to enter into talks with the rival 
likud bloc on forming a coalition government 
the vote of 6157 by the partys executive bureau came after the 
partys leader foreign minister shimon peres argued in favor of 
entering into negotiations with the rightwing likud headed by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir there was one abstention 
israel radio broadcast an immediate reaction from a spokesman in 
the prime ministers office saying there will be a government 
headed by shamir 
an offer by likud for a joint government came after shamirs 
talks with ultraorthodox parties bogged down in the small parties 
demands for cabinet posts and their call for controversial religious 
legislation 
likud offered labor two major cabinet posts defense and either 
finance or the foreign ministry 
party spokeswoman michal cohen said both peres and defense 
minister yitzhak rabin the partys no 2 man argued for joining in 
the talks 
but many labor members argued that the party would have to give 
up its principles to join in a government with likud such as the 
joint cabinet of the last four years 
in the opposition we can represent an alternative argued 
labor secretarygeneral uzi baram who said that otherwise labor 
would be giving a farreaching approval to likud policies 
the outgoing cabinet was paralyzed on the peace process because 
of conflicts between the dovish labor and the hardline likud but it 
succeeded in pulling together on important economic steps that 
halted inflation 
others labor members such as parliament member chaim ramon said 
that shamir would be unable to form a government without labor 
meaning peres could wind up forming his own government with small 
parties 
ramon a leader of the younger members of the party said before 
the vote if we win this there is a good chance mr peres is 
going to be prime minister for the next four years 
israel radio reported today that agudat israel one of the 
religious parties that shamir is trying to woo into his government 
was calling on peres to form a government 
but shamir also convinced the ultraorthodox shas party that he 
would carry through with promises to the religious parties after 
shas also threatened to reject any likudled coaltion 
shamir needs 61 seats in the 120member knesset to control a 
coalition 
likud won 40 seats in the 120member knesset in nov 1 elections 
labor won 39 
the shas and agudat israel parties control 11 seats in the 
knesset or parliament enough to make or break a narrow coalition 
likuds efforts to meet orthodox demands for joining the 
government have angered both nonreligious jews in israel who form 
the majority and foreign jews 
american jews who follow mostly reform or conservative judaism 
were irate at orthodox parties demands to narrow the definition of 
who is a jew many israelis were upset by orthodox demands to close 
down movies and sports stadiums on the sabbath 
when shamir tried to bring labor into the government the 
ultraorthodox parties balked fearing they would lose promised 
cabinet posts and their power to make fundamentalist jewish causes 
part of government policy

american telephone amp telegraph co said today 
it will cut its basic interstate longdistance rates by an average 
of 38 percent on thursday the same day that local phone costs will 
rise 60 cents per month 
atampts cut totaling 697 million annually reflects lower costs 
for its connections to the local network while residential and 
small business customers will be paying a larger share of the costs 
to maintain the local phone network 
the rate reduction is atampts seventh since 1984 when the company 
was broken up by an antitrust lawsuit during those five years the 
companys prices for basic interstate longdistance have dropped a 
total of 38 percent 
during that time however 260 has been added to the monthly 
bills of subscribers to lower the local network subsidies paid by 
longdistance companies that monthly expense will rise to 320 on 
thursday 
atampt estimates that subscribers who make at least 16 a month in 
interstate longdistance calls would save enough money to offset the 
higher subscriber line charge the average residential customer 
spends 866 per month on interstate longdistance calls the 
company said those totals do not include intrastate longdistance 
calls 
atampt filed its reduced rate request with the federal 
communications commission in october an atampt spokeswoman said the 
commission did not disapprove the proposal so the new rates will go 
into effect as planned 
other long distance companies have said they are reviewing the 
latest atampt reductions 
under atampts proposal 
basic longdistance rates for calls of more than 124 miles will 
drop 38 percent smaller cuts would be seen for interstate calls of 
shorter distances which account for about onequarter of atampt 
interstate calls 
rates for reach out america atampts longdistance calling plan 
for residential customers will be cut 49 percent 
atampt wats rates will drop 4 percent and the company will 
restructure the service to bill calls individually based on time and 
distance rather than by the current hourly pricing method this 
price reduction would take effect jan 1 a month later than the 
others 
rates for atampts three pro wats calling plans for business 
customers will be cut 38 percent overall megacom wats rates will 
drop 47 percent and megacom 800 rates would decrease 48 percent

commuters huddled in open army trucks wednesday for 
a wet and cold trip to work but most said they were relieved to 
have a ride as a strike by paris transit workers stretched into a 
third day 
two out of four regional express train lines were paralyzed by a 
maintenance workers strike called by the communistled general 
confederation of labor 
city buses and the metro also have had disruptions but most 
metro lines were running normally and the transit agency reported 
buses running at about 60 percent of normal 
beginning about 630 am more than 200 military vehicles hit 
the road each crammed with up to 25 people struggling to get to 
work on the cold rainy morning 
its original its practical and it works which is more than 
i can say for the express trains said erik saliou a financial 
adviser from nanterre west of the capital who arrived in one of 
the soggy green transport trucks at the la defense complex in 
western paris 
it has been enormously difficult getting to work he said 
tonight ill take a bus if i can find one or this truck if i can 
find it ill take what i can get 
the trucks brought in from eastern france and from french bases 
in west germany along with a thousand soldiers carried only a 
fraction of the 600000 people who normally commute on the express 
trains more military vehicles were en route to paris 
officials said several hundred private buses were also being 
chartered to replace the trains 
many people opted to drive causing huge traffic jams commuters 
arriving in trucks at the porte dorleans at the southern edge of 
paris said it took 90 minutes on clogged highways for what is 
normally a 30minute ride on the train 
at the porte de vincennes in eastern paris soldiers who worked 
the morning rush hour reported a cheerful atmosphere soldiers at la 
defense said the same 
people were very nice they were just happy to get here said 
sgt th lagniel of the 135th transport regiment in karlsruhe 
west germany for us this gives us contact we wouldnt ordinarily 
have with the civilian population 
not everyone viewed the unusual commute in a positive light 
i feel like a victim said computer operator houria 
bendahmane after a twohour ride on a cold metal bench from a 
western suburb 
ms bendahmane climbed out of the truck holding down her short 
skirt with one hand and a supporting bar with the other while 
setting a highheeled foot gingerly on a stool held by a young 
lieutenant she was followed out of the truck by an elderly woman 
wearing sneakers and carrying dress shoes and a banker in a navy 
cashmere coat who climbed down and rushed away 
we were wellassisted but frankly it was not too comfortable 
it was cold and windy and wet it was noisy ms bendahmane said 
michel rousselot head of the paris autonomous transit agency 
said after 14 hours of meetings with representatives of the labor 
federation and six other unions the agency was sticking to the 
salary offers rejected by the unions he said no end to the strike 
was in sight 
the federation the dominant union at the transit agency is 
demanding increased safety measures and acrosstheboard pay 
increases of about 170 per month 
the transit agency has offered immediate monthly raises of about 
25 plus bonuses ranging from about 17 to 100 for next year the 
agency is offering an increase of 22 percent the current average 
monthly salary is about 1100 
after the meeting the labor federation and a smaller union the 
french democratic confederation of labor both called for the strike 
to continue while the other unions said they would consult their 
members 
president francois mitterrand said tuesday the government acted 
wisely in calling out the army rather than give in to a small 
number of persons cabable of blocking an entire system 
the opposition conservatives in the national assembly introduced 
a censure motion condemning the social policies of socialist premier 
michel rocard 
in recent weeks nurses postal employees government office 
workers and other public service staff have staged strikes all 
seeking wage increases higher than those called for in rocards 
policy of economic rigor 
jacques malladur a taxi driver waiting to pick up commuters at 
la defense blamed the unionized civil servants for the deadlock in 
the strike 
they can go on forever with no risk of losing their jobs he 
said referring to the protection from layoffs enjoyed by public 
sector workers 
this is a military action he said but then this is war

three iranians seized in lebanon by 
christian militiaman six years ago are becoming an important element 
in efforts to free western hostages held by lebanese kidnappers 
loyal to iran 
senior officials in tehran have offered in recent months to use 
their influence with the lebanese shiite moslems holding westerners 
if the hostages governments helped locate and free the iranians 
hashemi rafsanjani irans military commander and parliament 
speaker addressed this remark to washington last week if you are 
interested in having your people held hostage in lebanon released 
then tell the phalangists christian militia to release our people 
who have been in their hands for years 
mohammad javad larijani iranian deputy foreign minister told 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany on tuesday 
there arent just american hostages in lebanon there are also 
iranian hostages who are in the hands of christian militiamen 
informed lebanese sources have said the iranians were believed 
killed soon after their abductions like hundreds of other moslems 
and christians seized by the other side in lebanons 13yearold 
civil war 
one purpose of genschers trip to tehran was to mediate the 
release of western captives his good contacts in iranian leaders 
were a key factor in the release of three west germans held in 
lebanon 
nine americans are among the 14 western captives in lebanon 
peter winkler a swiss employee of the red cross employee was 
abducted by three unidentified gunmen nov 17 but there has been no 
claim of responsibility 
held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
christian militiamen seized the three iranians and their lebanese 
shiite driver who had an iranian passport in july 1982 at a 
checkpoint 25 miles north of beirut during the israeli invasion of 
lebanon 
they were identified as ahmad motevaselian commander of the 
iranian revolutionary guards based in the bekaa valley of eastern 
lebanon charge daffaires hussein musavi and kazem akhavan a 
correspondent for irans official islamic republic news agency 
the checkpoint at the extreme norh of lebanons christian 
enclave was controlled at the time by the lebanese forces the main 
christian amilitia 
nothing was heard of the iranians until aug 31 when samir 
geagea now commander of the lebanese forces confirmed the militia 
had seized them 
geagea added that he could find no trace of the missing men when 
he took over the 6000member militia in 1986 after a bloody 
factional battle 
he accused his predecessor elie hobeika of kidnapping the 
iranians and taking them to his beirut headquarters for 
interrogation because they were foreigners 
their car was found abandoned in tripoli a predominantly moslem 
port 50 miles north of beirut several days after they disappeared 
geagea said he did not explain how it got there 
hobeika ousted as lebanese forces commander in january 1986 was 
widely believed to have led proisraeli christian militiamen who 
massacred hundreds of men women and children in beiruts sabra and 
chatilla refugee camps in september 1982 
the slaughter apparently was in revenge for the bomb 
assassination several days earlier of presidentelect bashir 
gemayel a maronite catholic which the lebanese forces blamed on 
palestinian guerrillas 
after two visits to beirut in august seeking word of the 
iranians the right rev john brown said their fate remains a 
mystery 
i havent found any concrete evidence that will suggest to me 
beyond doubt that they are alive or dead said brown the anglican 
bishop of the persian gulf and cyprus 
he was sent to lebanon by archbishop robert runcie spiritual 
head of the church of england to show the iranian government that 
the christian church has a compassionate interest in moslem victims 
of the war in lebanon as it has in the fate of christian people 
whove been taken 
the bishop had visited tehran earlier seeking help in freeing 
britons held in lebanon they include runcies personal envoy terry 
waite who disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his hotel in 
moslem west beirut to negotiate with kidnappers holding americans 
brown said senior officials in tehran made clear they would use 
their influence with the kidnappers after the fate of the iranians 
was determined

authorities said wednesday they will 
improve security at a nuclear reactor after marines posing as 
terrorists staged a mock attack last week 
the 20 marines needed only seven minutes to get to the petten 
reactor vault which houses uranium suitable for making nuclear 
bombs news reports said 
the research reactor near this northwestern village is operated 
by the european economic community 
economic affairs ministry spokeswoman jane zuidema said the time 
it took to stage the mock attack was too short for an outside 
security unit to come to the scene adding that private security 
guards in the building were unarmed the exercise was part of a 
program to check responses to new terrorist techniques that 
might be used against the nations four nuclear reactors ms 
zuidema said she did not say what new security measures were 
adopted

american women still do most of the cooking 
laundering and housecleaning but men have accepted an increased 
share of other household chores such as pet care gardening and 
dealing with bills a university study shows 
overall american women do two hours of housework for every one 
hour put in by a man according to the report by sociologist john p 
robinson of the university of maryland 
robinsons findings based on his 1985 survey of 5000 men and 
women compare to earlier similar studies at the university of 
michigan which said that women performed a 3to1 share of housework 
in 1975 and nearly 6 to 1 in 1965 
all three analyses found four primarily female tasks cooking 
meals cleaning up after meals housecleaning and laundry 
men dominated two areas yard work and home repairs robinson 
found 
and two areas where women previously did the majority of the work 
physically dealing with bills and the combined category of 
gardening and pet care were about evenly divided in the most 
recent report 
several important trends account for shifts in who does how 
much housework robinson said these include declines in the share 
of households with children a smaller share of marriedcouple 
households and the increasing number of women in the paid workforce 
robinsons study is reported in the december edition of american 
demographics magazine which concentrates on population and 
statistics issues 
in 1985 robinson found men averaged 98 hours of housework 
weekly while women put in 195 hours 
the 1975 study found men working 70 hours a week on home tasks 
compared to 217 hours for women 
and a decade earlier men spent 46 hours a week on housework 
compared to 270 hours for women 
but despite the increasing male share of the load men and women 
still tended to observe traditional separations of tasks for 
example in 1965 some 98 percent of washing and ironing was done by 
women while by 1985 that was only down to 88 percent women did 87 
percent of cooking in 1965 and 77 percent in 1985 
on the other hand men did only 32 percent of the billpaying 
chores in 1965 but increased their share to 52 percent by 1985 
and men did 53 percent of the gardening and pet care in 1985 up 
from 33 percent two decades earlier 
women with children under age 5 averaged 225 hours of housework 
weekly in 1985 compared to 199 hours for women with children over 
age 5 and 179 hours for childless women all three figures are down 
from prior years 
the studies show that getting married in 1965 increased a womans 
housework time from 155 hours weekly to 316 hours men on the 
other hand eased their burden a bit averaging 47 hours when 
single and only 45 hours after getting married 
by 1985 marriage increased the housework for women from 149 
hours to 224 hours while men worked 79 hours on housework when 
single and 111 hours after getting married 
in 1965 a housewife averaged 34 hours of housework a week 
compared to 178 hours for women with paid jobs by 1985 that had 
declined to 236 hours for the women at home and 147 hours for 
those with jobs

for the first time in at least 13 years denver met 
federal cleanair standards for the entire month of november but 
officials say it was the weather and not motorists driving habits 
that made the difference 
the weather pattern responsible for denvers clean air also has 
been blamed for subnormal moisture in eastern colorado a 
development officials say could jeopardize the winter wheat crop 
each day that passes without a highpollution day in metropolitan 
denver further extends the record for the seasons first violation 
the record was broken nov 6 
although antipollution programs such as highoxygen fuel sales 
and voluntary nodrive days are under way the credit for the clean 
air goes to an atmospheric current that typically reaches denver 
just a few winters in each decade said national weather service 
forecaster steve markkanen 
most of us consider this pattern ideal markkanen said it 
brings the mountains a lot of snow gives denver little or no snow 
and doesnt let much pollution build up in denver 
wed like it to continue all winter with some luck it could 
last a couple of months he said 
markkanen said that by late fall colorado usually is under the 
spell of an arctic weather pattern called the continental polar 
this year that air stream has been passing 1000 miles north of 
denver and in its place has been the maritime polar current which 
leaves heavierthannormal snowfall in the high country but skips 
much of the colorados eastern plains 
little snow is beneficial because that means higher ground 
temperatures colder surface temperatures combined with warm air 
flowing from the mountains west of denver help create temperature 
inversions that trap pollutants at ground level 
but the lack of snowfall in eastern colorado could mean trouble 
for the 25 million acres of winter wheat planted on the eastern 
plains 
precipitation in november was about 40 percent lower than normal 
prompting worries that farmers could face a dry winter officials 
said

pentagon secrecy ominous weather and 
a general feeling of anticlimax have discouraged tourists and 
journalists from flocking here for the atlantis shuttle launch 
i think its really a combination dick young head of the 
nasa news bureau at the kennedy space center said wednesday sts 
26 the sept 29 discovery launch was the first postchallenger 
flight and a lot of people were out here just to see if the shuttle 
could fly and weve proved that it could 
because the atlantis is carrying a military cargo the department 
of defense sharply restricts information another reason for fewer 
journalists young said nasa expected fewer than 500 journalists 
in contrast with the nearly 2500 who covered the discovery launch 
the first shuttle flight since the jan 28 1986 challenger 
disaster 
abc nbc cbs and cnn planned live coverage of the launch but 
their morning and evening news shows wont be anchored from the 
space center as they were for the discovery mission 
dan rather is staying in new york and were covering here with 
about onefourth the number of people said mark kramer cbs news 
producer for special events i believe the edge is off the story 
however kramer said he couldnt foresee any shuttle launch in 
the near future that wont be carried live on network television 
only cnn was on live when the challenger exploded after liftoff 
killing the seven astronauts aboard 
about 250000 spectators lined roads and beaches to watch 
discovery lift off but far fewer people were expected this time 
even before an approaching storm front threatened to postpone the 
launch by a day or more 
hotels along the space coast that were packed for discovery 
had plenty of vacancies and local authorities not worrying about 
traffic jams or crowd control said only a few extra deputies would 
be on duty at launch time 
because of the secrecy nasa was not setting up its customary vip 
viewing site for celebrities and other special guests 
left moot for now was a dispute between journalists and nasa over 
the postchallenger decision to restrict the number of news media at 
the launch site nasa citing safety concerns in case of a launch 
accident allowed 1800 journalists at the complex less than four 
miles from the launchpad the others had to watch from a secondary 
press site about seven miles from the pad 
young said the restriction policy will be reviewed if such a 
large contingent of journalists turns out for a future launch

a satellite company said wednesday the 
soviet union appears to be making nuclear weapons fuel again in an 
area east of the urals that was contaminated and abandoned after a 
nuclear accident 30 years ago 
the soviets apparently think it is a logical step to have 
activity that is contaminating in a contaminated area and they 
seem to have the means to get people to work there said christer 
larsson head of the swedishbased space of media network 
larsson said satellite photos taken by the spot and landsat 
satellites in 1987 and last summer showed the kysthym complex is 
back in operation and a new facility is being expanded nearby 
in a 100squaremile area around it all villages were abandoned 
there was no farming and many were overgrown with vegetation he 
said 
the satellite images also showed the flow of water through lake 
kyzyltash was cut off to keep contaminated water out of the tech 
river system larsson said 
the soviet union started its nuclear weapons program in the 1940s 
at the kysthym complex to produce plutonium a main component of 
nuclear arms 
it is widely believed there was a massive release of radiation at 
kysthum during the winter of 195758 the cause of the accident is 
unknown and the soviet authorities have refused to confirm it ever 
happened 
the company quoted zhores medvedev an emigre soviet biologist 
who 21 years ago reported the accident to the west as saying his 
countrymen dumped nuclear waste into small lakes in the area 
filling them up almost completely 
medvedev who lives in london also was quoted as saying he heard 
from soviet nuclear safety officials that a second major accident 
occurred in the area in 1967 this could not however be confirmed 
by the satellite photos larsson said 
the satellite company said the new nuclear facility lies three 
miles northeast of the kysthym complex it is believed to be part of 
a new set of military reactors constructed after 1977 it is not 
listed in any official publication the satellite photos showed that 
it was expanded in 1987 and 1988 but was not in operation when the 
photos were taken 
but a major flow of hot water into lake kyzyltash showed the 
kysthym complex was operational the company said the hot water 
would indicate it was being used for cooling reactors 
the company showed photographs of the area to journalists but did 
not make prints immediately available saying they were for sale

states do not trample on indian rights by 
taxing companies that produce oil and gas from tribal reservations 
new mexico officials told the supreme court wednesday 
attorney general harold d stratton of new mexico said the state 
taxes do not discourage production or prompt producers to look off 
the reservations for deposits 
the taxes in no way hindered economic development he said 
but daniel h israel a lawyer for cotton petroleum corp said 
the state taxes have a chilling effect on the ability of the 
tribes to lease their land to private businesses 
inevitably offreservation development is more attractive 
because of the lighter tax burden he said 
the justices who heard 60 minutes of arguments are expected to 
announce a ruling in the case by july the outcome is likely to be 
important to western states seeking guidance on what power they have 
over tribal resources 
cotton petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some 
15000 acres of land on the jicarilla apache reservation in new 
mexico 
the company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent 
of its production and new mexico levies five taxes on the company 
amounting to 8 percent of its production 
cotton petroleum challenged the two biggest state taxes on ground 
they unlawfully overlap the tribal levies violating constitutional 
interstate commerce protections the company noted that oil and gas 
producers in the state with deposits taken from nonindian land only 
are taxed 8 percent of production 
the company also said the state taxes are preempted by the 
constitution because they conflict with federal laws aimed at 
promoting indian selfdetermination 
the company said it paid 23 million in taxes to new mexico from 
1981 through 1985 but only received 89000 in services from the 
state 
the new mexico court of appeals upheld the state taxes last year 
stratton has said the case may very well set the course of 
indianstate jurisdiction in the future he said there are more 
than 250 cases nationwide that could be affected by the outcome 
one issue the justices could decide is whether a tribe is 
entitled to be treated in some instances as a state 
israel said wednesday the court should afford that treatment to 
indian reservations in a limited sense only 
he argued for example that the jicarilla tribe should have 
primary power with regard to its resources thus limiting new 
mexicos authority 
but stratton said that approach could open the way to widespread 
confusion 
how we could treat tribes as states troubles me he said 
noting there are some 250 reservations nationwide 
the jicarilla tribe is not a direct participant in the case 
although it has filed a socalled friendofthecourt brief 
expressing its views 
the case is cotton petroleum corp vs new mexico 871327

sen claiborne pell chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee said wednesday the time is ripe for 
cuba and the united states to take small steps aimed at moving 
them toward more rational and normalized relations 
pell also said radio marti which beams news and entertainment 
broadcasts to cuba exacerbates relations between the two 
countries and should be curtailed 
the rhode island democrat commented after a trip to cuba which 
included a private threehour meeting with president fidel castro 
when apprised of pells comments senelect connie mack rfla 
told reporters that normalizing relations with cuba or cutting back 
on radio marti was a bad idea 
absolutely not said mack whose state has a large 
cubanamerican population this is not a time to show concessions 
weve got to keep the pressure on castro 
but pell said he believes the international climate favors moves 
toward warming relations with the communist island state 90 miles 
from us shores 
peace is busting out all over the world he said we are on 
the verge of a settlement in angola with the withdrawal of cuban 
troops the soviets are committed to withdrawing from afghanistan 
and ussoviet relations are vastly improved 
i return from this trip believing it is an appropriate time 
to attempt to move toward more rational and normalized relations 
with cuba pell said the policies of both governments have 
become sterile it is time to break the log jam 
he proposed opening talks between the two countries to discuss 
the many issues that divide them 
the cubans expressed sincere interest in my suggestion that 
relations can be improved by each country taking small steps to 
demonstrate good will and upon which other progressively more 
difficult but mutually beneficial steps can be taken 
pell said he is considering introducing legislation to lift the 
current embargo on the delivery of medicines and medical supplies to 
cuba as a step in this spirit of moving toward a normalized and 
rational relationship 
he said cuba might respond by releasing the remaining longheld 
political prisoners in that country and by cooperating with the us 
coast guard against narcotics trafficking 
he also suggested that restrictions be eased on telephone calls 
between cuba and the united states and that more cubans especially 
doctors and technicians be permitted to visit the united states 
we should begin with the little things while working toward the 
more difficult issues like cuban involvement in central america 
and the full embargo so that hopefully the climate could be 
created making possible a relationship that would better serve us 
foreign policy interests pell said 
he said castro got really excited when the issue of radio 
marti was raised in the talks and denounced the broadcasts as an 
infringement of cuban sovereignty 
pell said castro did not explicity state that he wanted better 
relations with the united states and emphasized the problems and 
irritants in the relationship 
but he said castro did say that they were interested in going 
from one small step to another 
in another development wednesday president reagan met with 
ricardo bofill founder and former head of the cuban human rights 
committee in a meeting his spokesman said underscores the 
presidents continued support for human rights in cuba 
the president commended mr bofills efforts on behalf of human 
rights and added that they serve as an inspiration for activists 
worldwide white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
fitzwater said the committee an independent human rights group 
hostile to the castro government was a factor in leading to a 
un human rights commission visit to investigate the situation in 
cuba

a day after he was elected majority leader 
sen george mitchell said today that democrats and republicans 
should move past their campaign attacks to face their biggest shared 
problem the federal deficit 
the campaign is over we have serious problems important 
challenges facing the country the maine democrat said as he met 
with his republican counterpart sen bob dole of kansas 
both pointed to the budget shortfall as congress top priority 
but each stuck to his partys position 
mitchell said bush should submit his own proposals to cut the 
deficit before congress negotiates with the white house on such 
touchy topics as spending cuts and tax increases 
dole said bush could wait letting president reagan submit his 
fiscal 1990 budget next month and then when the new president takes 
office make his own recommendations for changes 
appearing separately the speaker of the house rep jim wright 
called on bush to reject his advisers suggestions and quickly give 
congress his plan for cutting the deficit as a way of calming 
jittery financial markets 
democrats want to force bush to be specific on how he would cut 
the deficit without raising taxes and still keep his other campaign 
promises to boost spending in such areas as education day care and 
environmental cleanup 
bush has been silent on the question of whether he will submit 
his own spending plan or simply go directly into negotiations with 
congress over the 1990 budget 
while republicans agreed with democrats today on the need to work 
together republicans made it clear tuesday that they will point out 
differences between themselves and the liberal mitchell 
i think its a very good choice george is very liberal and it 
will push the senate to the left said sen orrin hatch rutah a 
conservative whoever won that race was destined to be the 
spokesman for the democrats in america 
it seems to me the democrats have decided to move toward the 
left wing of the party and decided to do so with considerable 
momentum said richard lugar rind this could make it easier 
for bob dole as our leader to obtain majorities 
they are swimming against the tide of national politics he 
said 
mitchell 55 of maine was elected tuesday by the democrats of 
the next senate handily defeating rivals daniel inouye of hawaii 
and bennett johnston of louisiana mitchell won 27 votes on the 
first ballot compared with only 14 each for the others and he then 
was declared the winner by acclamation 
the former federal judge and prosecutor emerged from tuesdays 
secret meeting and sounded a tone of caution and compromise 
declaring that the democrats would develop an agenda and wait with 
interest and enthusiasm for the proposals of the next 
administration 
we hope to move forward on a broad range of issues he said 
citing the federal deficit health care day care and the 
environment 
dole rkan a colleague of mitchells from the senate finance 
committee who was reelected to his post by gop colleagues on 
tuesday 
ill be able to work with george mitchell said dole he is 
a very bright able and articulate senator 
mitchell received congratulatory telephone calls tuesday from 
president reagan presidentelect george bush and sen dan quayle 
rind the vicepresident elect mitchell and bush discussed plans 
to meet soon 
as majority leader mitchell is in charge of the legislative 
schedule a power that will put him at the center of every important 
issue hell bring to the role a far different style from that of 
the man hes succeeding robert c byrd dwva 
byrd the democrats leader for the past decade is known for his 
intricate behindthescenes legislative maneuvering mitchell is a 
relative newcomer to the senate he was first appointed in 1980 
and is more comfortable on television and in public debate 
his voting record received an 85 percent rating from the liberal 
americans for democratic action compared to a 14 from the american 
conservative union 
mitchells opponents followed senate courtesy after the election 
praising and defending the new leader 
he will be a great spokesman who will put a personal stamp on 
the senate and help the party predicted sen harry reid dnev 
who had supported inouye 
i think hell do a competent job hes judicious i think he 
will make a good spokesman articulate thoughtful said howell 
heflin dala who supported johnston 
whomsoever leads the party i think is going to try to keep it 
in the mainstream said lloyd bentsen dtexas who was the 
democrats vice presidential nominee 
bentsens texas colleague republican conservative phil gramm 
said the choice showed that the democrats had not learned the lesson 
of michael dukakis losing candidacy 
the fact that the only candidate who called himself a liberal 
that the only candidate from the northeast won is an indication 
that the 1988 elections were not an aberration he said it 
reflects the heart and soul of the democratic party 
byrd steps down from his majority leader post to take the title 
of president pro tempore of the senate a largely ceremonial post 
which puts him third in succession to the presidency the real plum 
for byrd is that he also will be chairman of the powerful senate 
appropriations committee which approves spending by government 
agencies 
both inouye and johnston will continue to be powerful senators 
with inouye remaining as part of the leadership structure and 
becoming chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee on 
defense

electionyear political foes george bush and 
jesse jackson exchanged compliments today at the white house and 
bush declared this wasnt a bury the hatchet meeting because 
there was no hatchet to bury 
he said the two men have a relationship that transcends 
politics 
presidentelect bush a republican and jackson who sought the 
democratic presidential nomination had spoken critically of each 
other during the long campaign 
however bush said today the campaign is over i have no 
arguments with the way that rev jackson conducted himself toward 
me 
there will be times when i will ask for his suggestions 
during the bush administration he said he has some very good 
ideas 
bush said that the issue of willie horton the murderer whose 
furlough from a massachusetts prison was used in gop campaign ads 
came up during todays meeting and that he told jackson he had not 
intended to make it a racial issue 
jackson asked how he felt about bushs explanation repeated his 
view that the tv ads did incite racial fears but said bush had 
assured him that was not his intention 
the democrat said the most important aspect of the meeting was 
the openness by presidentelect bush to discuss a broad range of 
matters 
earlier today bush met with leaders of environmental groups and 
displayed an attitude that one of the leaders said showed a night 
and day difference from the reagan years 
spokesmen for the blueprint for the environment a coalition 
of some 30 environmental groups that presented bush with detailed 
proposals were uniformly positive in characterizing bushs response 
to their goals 
however they acknowledged they had received no commitments from 
him other than that he would consider their proposals and would 
assign key cabinet nominees to meet with them 
one of the environmental groups leaders jay hair of the 
national wildlife federation said he had told the vice president 
mr bush read my lips protect the environment 
hair said bush reacted positively to the wordplay on his own 
notaxes campaign phrase replying i will i will 
john adams president of the natural resources defense council 
said that based on the positive reaction of bush and his aides to 
the group its hard to believe that president bush will not 
address these issues we will be on his team 
hair said its simply night and day from the reagan years 
during which bush served as vice president hair said the early 
1980s were a time of ideological shrillness antienvironmental 
actions and lack of stewardship in the administration i didnt 
sense any of that this morning 
the leaders said bush did not directly address their proposed 5 
billion in increased spending on environmental programs with 
emphasis on actions to deal with a global warming trend or the 
total 19 billion in revenue increases that they proposed through a 
combination of cutbacks and taxation measures 
bush did not meet with reporters after the session with the 
environmental groups leaders 
his meetings with them and with jackson are part of a 
fencemending effort that has included a session with vanquished gop 
rival bob dole and a planned meeting on friday with dukakis the 
defeated democratic presidential nominee 
bush spokesman steve hart said the jackson meeting was in 
keeping with what george bush has traditionally done which is to be 
open and talk to people that are interested and concerned 
in another overture to a prominent democrat bush called the 
senates newly chosen majority leader george mitchell of maine to 
congratulate him shortly after tuesdays secretballot election 
among senate democrats 
also on tuesday bush told senate republican leaders that he will 
seek speedy confirmation of his cabinet 
participants in a private meeting at the capitol said bush told 
the senators he hopes any honeymoon period with congress can 
yield a federal budget compromise 
sen alan simpson rwyo said bush indicated he wanted to meet 
with a bipartisan group to discuss his thoughts before 
submitting a budget outline of his own 
however sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate 
finance committee and the 1988 democratic vice presidential 
candidate said bush should send his own budget to the lawmakers 
this will be his first test of leadership he has to show what 
he believes in national defense medicare revenues he has to 
speak to the principal points of the budget thats part of the 
price of leadership bentsen said

a tax lawyer advised staffers of lyndon h 
larouche jr to file federal tax returns even though it was not 
clear that the law required larouche to a witness at the political 
mavericks conspiracy trial testified today 
richard welsh a larouche finance officer said he met with the 
tax lawyer to see whether larouche was obligated to file returns 
even if he had no income and all his expenses were paid for by 
organizations that were part of his political movement 
welsh told the jury he was told that the assistance to larouche 
should be treated as ordinary business expenses by the companies 
and not as larouches personal income 
a federal grand jury has charged that larouche conspired to 
defraud the internal revenue service by not declaring the personal 
and household expenses he received as income and by not filing 
federal income tax returns since 1979 
welsh said the tax lawyer recommended that a tax return be 
filed not because it was required but because larouche was a 
controversial public figure and filing the returns would be kind 
of a public relations act 
welsh said the tax lawyer told larouche staffers it was a gray 
area it was not clear liability existed 
welsh said that although returns were prepared after 1979 they 
were not filed because they included only arbitrary estimates of the 
amounts that could be attributed to larouches personal and 
household expenses 
in earlier testimony welsh said larouche has been the leading 
thinker for his politically extreme movement but never asserted 
strong financial control over its operations 
i dont recall him involved in daytoday financial 
operations welsh a larouche financial official for 14 of his 15 
years with the movement said tuesday testifying under a grant of 
immunity from prosecution 
welshs testimony distancing larouche from his financial 
operations could be crucial when jurors decide whether he and six 
associates conspired to avoid repayment of loans the movement 
received 
that is the main charge against all seven defendants in the us 
district court trial larouche also is charged with conspiring to 
defraud the internal revenue service by failing to pay taxes after 
1979 
larouche showed little emotion as welsh described the threetime 
presidential candidate as the founder and leading thinker of the 
movement and the primary person who defines broad policies 
general objectives and political goals 
the movement relies on conspiracy theories to explain world 
events and it often alleges that figures such as henry kissinger 
and queen elizabeth participate in those conspiracies larouche 
backers who advocate a quarantine for aids victims also have been 
accused of harboring antisemitic beliefs 
while denying that larouche had a heavy hand over finances welsh 
said those who did handle the books including himself had 
launched an ambitious plan to straighten out the movements 
financial mess in 1986 
the witness said the program which he dubbed project apollo 
came to a quick halt on oct 6 1986 when federal and state law 
enforcement authorities raided larouches leesburg va 
headquarters and seized just about every scrap of paper having to 
do with any financial record 
welsh said the project was set up to either repay loans convince 
lenders to convert them to gifts or persuade the contributors to 
ease the terms of the loans 
but he told jurors the raid wasnt the only development that 
jolted the repayment plan 
in april 1987 he related the three main larouche organizations 
that owed lenders money were placed in involuntary bankruptcy the 
federal government action froze the groups ability to conduct any 
financial transactions 
to make matters more complicated welsh said several banks froze 
larouche organization accounts after it became public knowledge that 
a federal grand jury in boston was investigating the movements 
financial dealings in a separate case from the trial here 
the grand jury indictment says more than 30 million in loans 
were made to larouche organizations welsh said some 5 million were 
repaid adding that the indebtedness was reduced by 15 million 
during project apollo before it was stopped 
under questioning from assistant us attorney kent robinson 
welsh said larouche was buying expensive virginia properties at a 
time when millions of dollars in loans went unpaid 
welsh said a larouche real estate company spent about 4 million 
on land for a security training facility for a summer camp for 
children of larouche employees and a farm where larouche and his 
wife helga live when in the united states 
during the same period around may 1986 larouche wrote a woman 
who was seeking repayment of nearly 113000 in loans that she could 
not be repaid because no discretionary funds were available

an academy of sciences report said 12 
million poles live in areas devastated by pollution and urged 
tighter regulation to clean up what one scientist on wednesday 
called europes dirtiest country 
most beaches on the baltic sea have been closed industrial waste 
output increased by nearly half in the past five years and most 
polish rivers lack drinkable water according to the study published 
in newspapers wednesday 
poland ranks second in europe in sulfur dioxide emissions said 
the report by the academy the nations most foremost research 
institution 
there has been a complete breakdown of the state of natural 
balance in 27 areas inhabited by onethird of polands 38 million 
people the newspaper zycie warszawy said in its summary of the 
report revealed during a tuesday meeting of the academys governing 
presidium 
the newspapers summarized the findings of a report a judgment 
of effectiveness and directions of action in the field of shaping 
and protecting the environment by the scientific committee man 
and environment at the academy 
the report assessed environmental protection policy over the last 
20 years and criticized legislation current solutions and lack of 
public awareness about the threat 
the analysis showed that actions currently being undertaken are 
insufficient and have not restrained a permanent deterioration of 
the environment said geology professor stefan kozlowski 
secretary of the committee 
it is an extremely urgent matter it is getting worse day by 
day we are the dirtiest country in europe kozlowski said in a 
telephone interview 
it should be called judgment of ineffectiveness the 
official communist party daily trybuna ludu said of the report 
the report said economic losses stemming from environmental 
problems were also huge amounting to 10 percent of the countrys 
annual national revenue 
an increase in disease resulted from the state of the 
environment the report said it quoted a study of the carcinogenic 
influence on living tissues of dusts in the air of the silesia 
region in southern poland where the mining and metallurgy industries 
are concentrated 
symptoms include cancerous processes or genetic deformations 
it said 
the communist government newspaper rzeczpospolita suggested 
increased enforcement of environmental laws and other legal remedies 
should be used to improve the environment 
one of the ways of acting is to pay more attention to 
lawabidingness in the sphere of the natural environment it said 
it also suggested passage of new laws amendments and regulations 
trybuna ludu said fines for environmental violations were too 
small 
in recent weeks government officials have been expressing 
increasing concern about the environment and the newly appointed 
government of prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski has said that 
addressing environmental problems will be a top priority 
in one of its first acts the government permitted the closing of 
a chromiumproducing factory near wroclaw in silesia for 
environmental reasons 
there is a budding independent environmental movement with at 
least two groups of activists freedom and peace and the polish 
ecological party activists welcomed the report 
its good that ecological losses are finally the subject of 
public discussions its good that people are finally being made 
aware of the situation weve been saying that all the time said 
freedom and peace leader jacek czaputowicz

senate majority leader george mitchell 
declaring the campaign is over sat down with republican 
counterpart bob dole on wednesday to begin work on their legislative 
agenda at the dawn of the bush administration 
mitchell elected leader of the senates 55 democrats on tuesday 
went to doles capitol office for private discussions and a later 
lunch with leaders of both parties 
mitchell a liberal from maine played down his ideological 
differences with the new bush administration the campaign is over 
and weve got serious problems important issues facing the 
country he told reporters 
we look forward to cooperating mitchell said 
asked what advice he would have for presidentelect bush 
mitchell said im going to listen to him and try to be 
accomodating to his concerns 
clearly the presidentelect having assumed the leadership of 
the nation will want to put forth his own ideas mitchell said 
i think we should wait and see what the presidentelects plans 
are 
mitchell was also referring to the fiscal 1990 budget which the 
administration will send to the 101st congress shortly after it 
convenes next january 
dole who was reelected as republican leader on tuesday said 
bush probably will wait until president reagan formally proposes the 
next budget before acting 
the presidentelect has a little problem dole of kansas 
said hes not the president yet 
perhaps what he may do is let the reagan budget come up and 
then submit some recommendations dole said that makes sense 
however dole cautioned we cant wait too long the american 
people want bush to succeed they want mitchell to succeed 
but dole said they dont want to wait much more than six or 
seven months 
by custom by tradition by law and by common curtesy he 
should be allowed to set his agenda mitchell said of bush 
meanwhile mitchell said senate democrats are acting to 
develop and identify our own agenda 
we anticipate there will be substantial overlap he said 
citing mutual concerns over the deficit and other issues 
mitchell and dole were joined by other party leaders elected 
tuesday for the lunch which also included discussions of committee 
assignments in the upcoming session later in the day mitchell was 
calling on house speaker jim wright a fellow democrat to discuss 
party issues and priorities 
meanwhle four of the five new democratic members of the senate 
met with reporters and with sen john kerry dmass who was 
chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
kerry called the groups election an affirmation of basic 
democratic values by the voters noting it was the first time in 
50 years that the party winning the white house lost seats in the 
house and senate 
if there is a mandate it is to deal with education our 
competitive posture housing health care and child care kerry 
said noting that those were issues that not only the democrats but 
also the winning republicans in this election had run on 
in one way or another the four new democrats herb kohl of 
wisconsin bob kerrey of nebraska joseph lieberman of connecticut 
and richard bryan of nevada repeated those themes as their 
priorities in the 101st congress 
i won because i expressed the mainstream of the democratic 
party lieberman said i promised the people of connecticut i 
would fight for the things that matter to them and to their 
families

the reagan administration said wednesday that a 
speech by romanian president nicolae ceausescu failed to ease fears 
that the bucharest government was going to raze thousands of 
villages and force residents to move into sterile regimented 
communities 
the romanian program of socalled rural systemization has 
been a matter of serious concern to the united states as well as to 
a growing number of western european governments and even several 
of romanias neighbors state department spokesman charles redman 
told reporters 
redman was commenting on a speech that ceausescu gave on monday 
to the romanian communist party central committee in which he 
appeared to back away from the widely criticized plan that would 
have razed as many as 7000 villages 
the us has publicly and privately deplored this policy which 
is being carried out without apparent participation or consent of 
the affected population and we will continue to do so redman 
said 
the plan calls for the resettlement of residents of the razed 
villages in new housing in agroindustrial centers 
western and hungarian critics have said the plan threatens to 
destroy the cultural traditions of 17 million ethnic hungarians in 
romania as well as ethnic germans and others 
in his speech ceausescu cited the need to preserve a number of 
communes to prevent depopulation of the countryside 
redman said ceausescus speech sought to rationalize the policy 
in terms of improved rural living standards and economic 
efficiency 
however it did nothing to allay widespread fears that the plan 
is forcing large numbers of romanians of many ethnic origins to 
give up their traditional ways of life and cultural patterns to live 
a sterile regimented economically unproductive existence redman 
said 
he said village destruction so far appeared to have occurred near 
the capital of bucharest and had yet to be extended to such areas as 
transylvania and banat where the ethnic german and hungarian 
populations are centered

vice presidentelect dan quayle wooed by 
members of his partys right wing since the election said wednesday 
he wont be their socalled spear carrier in the bush 
administration 
in a wideranging interview with the associated press quayle 
also hinted that he may spend more time than his predecessors in 
presiding over the senate which is controlled by the democrats 
on a personal note he said he had learned from the verbal gaffes 
he committed during the campaign to curb a tendency toward talking 
too much verbosity leads to unclear inarticulate things he 
said 
quayle also said he would make no recommendation as to who should 
replace him in the senate but he did not reject suggestions that he 
favors rep dan coats the former aide who represents his old 
congressional district 
his comments about the conservatives who have beaten a path to 
his transition office were his strongest public rejection of the 
notion that he would become a link between the republican partys 
far right and the new administration quayle himself is an ardent 
conservative who has largely supported reagan administration 
positions during his eight years in the senate 
ive worked with a number of conservatives in the past a lot 
of good friends are conservatives but im not the point man for the 
conservatives in this administration you wont see me being the 
socalled spear carrier for all the socalled conservative issues 
quayle said 
he said theres not a pennys worth of difference in 
philosophy between him and presidentelect george bush who in the 
past has been perceived as more moderate 
quayle also hinted that he may take a more active role in his 
official capacity as president of the senate presiding over the 
democraticcontrolled chamber more frequently 
its certainly an option he said 
the presiding officer has substantial discretion as to which 
senator to recognize for the purpose of offering amendments bills 
and motions normally the chair is occupied by a member of the 
majority party a republican in charge could spell contention 
between democrats and the administration 
clearly the constitutional role of being president of the 
senate is something ive got to sit down and decide on how im going 
to allocate my time there have been suggestions to me by many 
that i consider spending more time in the senate than my 
predecessors have i have not made a decision on that quayle said 
quayle said he and bush have not spoken substantively about his 
role in the administration but he added that he wouldnt mind if he 
has to spend time fulfilling largely ceremonial duties such as going 
to state funerals 
there is ceremony for the funerals but you can also do a lot 
of work you can meet a lot of people you can have some meetings 
and youd be surprised at the kind of information and contact that 
is made beyond the ceremonial requirements he said 
he met wednesday with retiring indiana gov robert d orr a 
republican who will appoint quayles replacement in the senate 
quayle intends to resign effective jan 2 so his replacement can 
have seniority over other incoming senators 
orr has not said whom he will appoint and quayle said he made no 
recommendation to the governor but he did not reject a reporters 
suggestion that he favors coats who was quayles district 
representative in fort wayne ind while quayle was in the house 
from 1976 to 1980 
obviously i think a lot of dan coats he worked for me for four 
years hes been a very good congressman from my old congressional 
district he took my seat weve had a long and strong personal and 
professional relationship quayle said 
he said the presidential campaign during which he made a number 
of celebrated gaffes and was besieged with questions about his 
military service academic record and personal life made him a 
stronger person 
i know my strengths better than when i started i also know 
probably some of the weaknesses and errors that ill have to work 
on he said he said that he is far more careful of what i say 
today than six months ago 
i also try to discipline myself when i get into a situation 
and im trying to think of the answer instead of being verbose 
which is a tendency that i have to be concise because verbosity 
leads to unclear inarticulate things

tax records reported that for the fiscal year ending june 30 
public contributions to the oldtime gospel hour totaled 407 
million the lowest level since the 198182 fiscal year 
we have made a conscious effort in the past year to look for 
other sources of income realizing that contributions can and will 
drop depending on climate of the country demoss said 
combined with indirect public support which demoss said included 
deferred giving estate planning and grants total contributions 
were 442 million comparable with 198586 levels the ministrys 
total revenues increased from 609 million in 198687 to 637 
million in 198788 he said 
while contributions may drop in a given year we feel like we 
can maintain a pretty stable bottom line which were most concerned 
with demoss said the key thing is that even though direct 
public support dropped by as much as 10 million total revenues are 
up as far as were concerned and as far as any business or company 
would be concerned the bottom line is the bottom line and thats 
encouraging 
demoss said separate sex scandals involving former ptl leader jim 
bakker and television evangelist jimmy swaggart may have contributed 
to the decline in contributions 
i think wed be a lot more concerned about a bottom line drop 
of 10 million than we are about a difference in contributions he 
said we are prepared and preparing for the possibility that 
contributions may be harder to come by year after year and we need 
other income sources 
the newspaper said records also show falwell as president of the 
televised gospel hour received a 25000 raise bringing his annual 
salary to 125000 he also continued to receive 33000 in benefits 
from the ministry

a court found a usborn jewish settler guilty 
of manslaughter wednesday in the shooting death of an arab shepherd 
the first such conviction of an israeli in the nearly yearlong 
palestinian uprising 
five palestinians were reported shot in clashes with soldiers in 
the occupied territories hospital officials said 
in arab east jerusalem two firebombs were thrown at the us 
consulate but caused no damage or injuries consulate spokesman 
david good said 
good said the two gasolinefilled bottles were tossed over a 
surrounding wall and hit the side of the building but the firebombs 
burned out harmlessly he said 
the settler israel zeev 38 was found guilty in jerusalem 
district court for the may 5 shooting death of 28yearold jude 
abdallah awad in a field near the jewish settlement of shillo in the 
west bank 
another palestinian was wounded 
zeev who claimed he fired in selfdefense after the shepherds 
threw stones could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison 
yakov weinrott zeevs attorney said he probably would appeal 
the verdict but would wait until after the sentencing sunday to make 
a decision 
a relative who asked not to be identified said that zeev was 
raised in chicago and is the father of six children 
the may 5 incident began when a jewish woman spotted several arab 
shepherds in a field between the arab village of turmus aiya and 
shillo 18 miles north of jerusalem 
she called for help and zeev came and fired at the shepherds 
witnesses told reporters that zeev fired without provocation they 
said the victim knew zeev and shouted israel dont shoot 
district judge tzvi cohen was quoted on israel radio as saying 
reality is not a western and concluding that israel zeev had 
to know theres a possibility of somebody getting hurt when he fired 
from the hip 
at least 316 palestinians and 11 israelis have been reported 
killed in the uprising since it began dec 8 1987 it is not known 
how many victims may have died from civilian gunfire 
pinhas wallerstein a jewish settler leader is still being tried 
in the slaying of a 17yearold palestinian in january 
police recommended last week that rabbi moshe levinger a founder 
of the settlement movement be tried in the shooting death of a 
shopkeeper during a sept 30 stonethrowing clash no action has 
been taken 
leaders of the settlement movement meanwhile called on the army 
to take harsher steps against arab rioters 
it seems to me we have a war going on here but it is being 
treated like a demonstration said haim granit a brigadier 
general in the reserve army who lives in the west bank settlement of 
elkana 
the group urged the deportation of palestinians caught throwing 
stones and a ban on employment of anyone arrested for protests 
about 15 million palestinians live in the west bank and gaza 
strip which israel has occupied since the 1967 middle east war 
on wednesday troops shot and wounded five palestinians in 
stonethrowing clashes in the occupied areas arab hospital 
officials said 
the army confirmed that one person was wounded in the west bank 
refugee camp of el ain near nablus and said it was checking the 
other reports 
also wednesday police released three israelis suspected of 
setting a fire that burned three arab laborers to death as they 
slept in a shack near tel aviv in august 
police freed the suspects after holding them for 90 days israeli 
radio said police did not have enough evidence to bring charges

charities are having a tough time this year 
hiring the bell ringers so familiar to holiday shoppers in part 
because the economy is strong 
its ironic but when the national economy is better we have 
trouble in two ways finding people willing to ring bells at 
minimum wages and discovering that donors tend to give less said 
titus herman a spokesman for the salvation army 
the salvation army and volunteers of america both depend on bell 
ringers to solicit change from holiday shoppers volunteers often 
local celebrities and members of service clubs help out in short 
stints but the paid ringers handle most of the work 
herman said the salvation army usually employs about 175 bell 
ringers in portland it is short at least 67 ringers this year 
lisa crawford of the volunteers of america said she had enough 
ringers to cover downtown portland but it had been difficult to 
find people for work in the suburbs even when bus transportation 
was offered 
i could use five or 10 more but i cant find them crawford 
said 
groups in other states also were encountering similar problems 
joy buersmeyer business manager for the salvation army in boise 
idaho said a shortage of ringers was made worse due to competition 
from businesses for people willing to work at minimum wage 
jim grassley salvation army spokesman in seattle said it was 
touch and go finding enough forhire bell ringers 
there is a concern finding people reliable enough and 
trustworthy enough to stand there and ring bells grassley said 
its a tough job but the kettles are important both for the 
dollars they raise and as a silent reminder that someone is out 
there trying to do something to help others showing that someone 
cares

bad communication with congregations and 
pastoral immorality have led an increasing number of southern 
baptist churches to fire their ministers denomination officials say 
a recent survey found that each month an average of 116 of the 
approximately 37000 churches in the southern baptist convention 
fire their pastors said norris smith the forcedtermination 
consultant for the southern baptist sunday school board 
other reasons given for the firings which are up 31 percent over 
a 1984 survey were performance dissatisfaction power struggles and 
personality clashes he said 
smith said he was surprised to find that the controversy in the 
southern baptist convention between moderates and conservatives was 
not a big factor 
smith said that in many denominations a pastor who is having a 
problem can be transferred to a more receptive parish by the 
denominations hierarchy but baptist congregations hire and fire 
their own pastors 
the 1984 study done by the southern baptist conventions sunday 
school board surveyed only fired ministers smiths survey 
interviewed directors of missions who in the southern baptist 
denomination may direct mission work in several churches in an area 
and frequently are called on to mediate church controversies 
a lack of communication between the pastor and church leaders was 
cited in 134 percent of the firings the most frequent reason given 
by directors of missions for forced terminations smith said both 
sides usually communicated poorly and lacked systems to deal with 
conflict 
immorality was the primary cause in 129 percent of forced 
terminations that category included sexual immorality theft or 
mismanagement of church money and problems of personal integrity 
smith said various subjective reasons accounted for 446 percent 
of the terminations 
details of the survey were reported by the baptist press the 
conventions news service

the associated press and the new york 
times rejected on wednesday a defense department demand that 
military officials be granted the right to confiscate film from 
remote cameras in the event of an accident during the launching of 
the space shuttle atlantis on a secret military mission 
as a result they were denied permission to install remote 
cameras in an area near the launch pad to take closeup pictures of 
the liftoff which is scheduled for thursday 
some other news organizations accepted the pentagon requirement 
under protest and were allowed to place their cameras in sites near 
the launch pad 
atlantis fiveman crew reportedly is to deploy a topsecret spy 
satellite and the defense department and nasa have placed a secrecy 
veil over most details about the mission 
on wednesday hours before representatives of news organizations 
were to be taken to remote sites to set up their cameras the air 
force asked each to sign an agreement on placement of remote 
camera 
the agreement said in part 
i understand that the mission is classified therefore in 
consideration of permission to place cameras as requested i agree 
that should an onpad accident or other event create a risk that 
classified material might be exposed to view representatives of dod 
may retrieve the film from my cameras process it and review it to 
determine if any classified information is revealed or compromised 
i understand that any film which is determined by dod to reveal 
or compromise classified information will be retained by dod but 
all other film will be returned to me as quickly as possible 
harold g buell the aps assistant general manager for news 
photos said the pentagon demand was an unacceptable intrusion on 
coverage of the space shot he said agreements made with nasa after 
the challenger disaster covered the situation 
we have no intention of acquiescing in the kind of military 
censorship the air force seeks buell said 
he noted that the government has cameras in identical remote 
positions could determine immediately should the photographs 
disclose secrets that would harm national security and thus could 
seek withholding of such photographs if the need arose 
that would protect classified information buell said 
asking news organizations in advance to agree to give their film 
to the government is not the way to do it 
carolyn lee picture editor of the new york times said the times 
refused to sign the agreement and also was denied the use of remote 
cameras 
the ap had planned to set up eight remote cameras in a security 
area ranging from about 1500 feet to 2500 feet from the launch 
pad they are activated by the sound of the shuttle lifting off 
under normal circumstances news organizations are able to 
retrieve their film about 3 hours after launch the photos capture 
only the first few seconds of the flight 
news agency photographers also take pictures of the launch from a 
press site four miles from the pad and from various locations 
outside the kennedy space center 
news groups never had a problem with their remote cameras until 
the challenger explosion 73 seconds after liftoff on jan 28 1986 
the cameras did not photograph the explosion but nasa officials 
felt the pictures might offer some clue to what went wrong they 
confiscated news agency remote film and turned it over to a team 
investigating the accident after protests from the news groups the 
film was returned several days later 
following that incident nasa and the news groups signed an 
agreement that no matter what happened on launch the groups would 
have normal access to the remote camera film turning it over to 
nasa investigators only after using the material they needed 
eventually the agencies would get their film back 
but with atlantis carrying a secret payload the defense 
department through the air force insisted on authority to 
confiscate any film that might expose classified material

ethnic clashes between azerbaijanis and armenians 
killed 11 people including a moslem mullah raising the death toll 
in more than a week of violence to at least 18 official media 
reported wednesday 
the report by the official armenian news agency armenpress that 
10 azerbaijanis and one armenian had been killed threaten to raise 
tension even higher in the southern soviet region where many cities 
already are under military rule and strict curfews 
the armenian capital of yerevan and the azerbaijani capital of 
baku both under military rule were reported to be tense but calm 
official media in both cities reported thousands of refugees were 
streaming across the border to their ethnic homelands 
leon azruyan the night editor in charge of the armenpress news 
agency said in a telephone interview that the deaths announced by 
officials wednesday included people killed in clashes in several 
armenian cities between nov 2229 
an azerbaijani mullah fired into a large open meeting of 
armenians in the city of kalinino in far northern armenia late last 
week but they threw stones at him one hit him in the head and 
killed him azruyan said 
one armenian was killed in the city of goris in southeastern 
armenia near the azerbaijani border when attackers fired into a 
similar crowd he said 
two people were seriously wounded and the attackers slipped away 
azruyan said 
he said other deaths occurred in the cities of kirovakan 
krasnoselsk and spitak in northern armenia but that there was no 
detailed information on how many died in each city or what the 
circumstances were 
they were the first deaths reported in armenia in the recent wave 
of violence four soldiers were killed protecting armenian residents 
of the azerbaijani city of kirovabad and soldiers shot and killed 
three civilians there for violating curfew violence also was 
reported in nakhichevan an azerbaijani enclave situated between 
armenia and the iranian border 
trouble began in the caucasus republics in february when the 
predominantly armenian population of the nagornokarabakh region of 
azerbaijan began calling for annexation of the area by armenia 
azerbaijan and the central soviet government have rejected 
annexation 
mass demonstrations followed in armenia and at the end of 
february ethnic rioting broke out in the azerbaijani city of 
sumgait killing at least 32 people 
the area has remained tense since then and the latest unrest 
began in midnovember azerbaijanis accused armenia of sending 
settlers into nagornokarabakh to pad the armenian majority there 
of forcing azerbaijanis out of work and refusing them food and 
medical supplies 
in moscow at a meeting of the supreme soviet parliament that is 
considering a reform of the political structure armenian president 
grant voskanyan chastised his azerbaijani counterpart suleiman 
tatev for what he said was azerbaijans unwillingness to compromise 
he is categorically rejecting any possibility of a 
compromise voskanyan said if the azerbaijani leaders showed 
the political maturity to condemn the crimes in sumgait as crimes 
against nature then there would not have been a kirovabad and 
nakhichevan 
official yerevan radio in a report monitored in london by the 
british broadcasting corp said more than 20000 ethnic armenian 
refugees from azerbaijan had arrived since nov 22 
it said many had arrived in armenia without clothing money or 
documents and in need of medical treatment it said empty houses 
had been requisitioned to shelter them and appealed to yerevan 
residents to help care for the refugees 
official sources in azerbaijan reported that thousands of 
azerbaijanis had arrived there from armenia they said meetings and 
protests wer e going on despite the military rule but that the 
situation was returning to normal

leaders of the 12 european economic 
community nations meet this week to review progress toward their 
ambitious goal of forging a singlemarket eec by the end of 1992 
the twoday summit in greece that starts friday is the first 
since british prime minister margaret thatcher told her partners in 
september that she can never accept a united states of europe 
mrs thatcher favors removing barriers hampering free trade but 
wants eec borders to remain for security reasons she does not want 
a single market to lead to a monetary union with a single currency 
and a central eec bank after 1992 
but french president francois mitterrand west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and her nine other partners say the eec must precisely 
go down that road if it is to compete effectively with japan and the 
united states 
the single market plan has also worried the eecs two main 
trading partners 
greek deputy foreign minister theodore pangalos said the meeting 
on the resort island of rhodes will reassure washington and tokyo 
that europe wont turn protectionist 
the spirit in which the draft summit declaration has been 
formulated will have the effect of reassuring these unjustifiable 
fears of a fortress europe pangalos said this week 
the leaders will also review eastwest relations and the middle 
east situation after the nov 15 declaration of the palestine 
national council the palestinian parliamentinexile proclaiming 
an independent palestine 
greek prime minister andreas papandreou the summit chairman may 
ask the eec leaders to meet with palestine liberation organization 
leader yasser arafat greece has suggested an eecarafat meeting 
before but to no avail 
last week the eec nations welcomed the councils implicit 
recognition of israel called for an international middle east peace 
conference but stopped short of recognizing the palestinian state on 
israelioccupied territories 
jacques delors president of the eec executive commission said 
the summit must produce a major initiative on eastwest 
relations to coordinate efforts by eec nations to extend trade 
credit to the soviet union 
in recent weeks several eec nations including west germany 
have granted some 8 billion in such credit to moscow 
mrs thatcher goes to rhodes pleased that her sept 20 bombshell 
speech in bruges belgium launched a debate about the future of the 
eec aides said 
delors said if britain does not fall into line its partners may 
go it alone in creating a monetary union he told the european 
parliament this month there was a deep political disagreement 
over the future of the eec 
i cannot exclude a crisis delors said on british television 
this week 
the summit will assess progress to date in creating a single 
market officials said such a market is said to boost economic 
growth in the eec by 5 percent lower prices by 6 percent and create 
some 2 million jobs 
under a 1985 treaty this requires adopting 279 eec laws 40 
percent of which have already been enacted 
among the proposed laws is a bid to harmonize value added taxes 
britain and denmark oppose a proposal for two bands of vat rates 
from 4 percent to 9 percent for some goods and from 14 percent to 19 
percent for others britain sees vat on food and childrens clothing 
as politically unattractive and heavily taxed denmark fears a loss 
of revenue and believes taxes on alcohol and tobacco must remain 
high for health reasons 
mrs thatcher facing a persistent terrorism problem in northern 
ireland is adamant that border checks can be abolished for goods 
and services but for security reasons must remain for travelers 
pangalos said greece will also guide the summit to discuss ways 
of establishing eecwide social policies dealing with among others 
workers rights this includes creation of a european company 
statute that provides for worker participation in management an 
issue mrs thatcher opposes

the us patent office indicated the massachusetts 
institute of technology will receive a patent on a process for 
making flexible ceramic superconductors moving superconductor 
technology closer to the marketplace mit officials said wednesday 
the patent office issued a notice of allowability last week 
signaling it will award the patent within a few months said john t 
preston director of mits technology licensing office 
preston said mit has licensed exclusive rights to the patent to a 
company founded last year by four of the institutes faculty 
members mit officials refused to disclose the terms of the 
licensing agreement with the company american superconductor corp 
of cambridge 
ever since two researchers at an international business machines 
inc laboratory in switzerland discovered ceramic superconductors in 
january 1986 scientists around the world have been racing to 
develop and apply the new materials the ibm researchers georg 
bednorz and alexander mueller won the 1987 nobel prize in physics 
for their discovery 
the advantage of ceramics is that they attain superconductivity 
the ability to conduct electricity with virtually no resistance or 
energy loss when cooled with liquid nitrogen to about 300 degrees 
below zero fahrenheit 
previous superconductors had operated at no higher than 418 
degrees fahrenheit requiring cooling in liquid helium which is 
more expensive and difficult to handle than liquid nitrogen 
eventually scientists hope to develop superconductors that will 
work at room temperature which could revolutionize the computer 
transportation and power transmission industries 
a major stumbling block is that the materials developed so far 
are brittle and tend to break when wrapped into coils or pressed 
into sheets 
mits process combines the ceramic superconductors with a noble 
metal such as silver gold platinum or palladium forming a 
composite that is relatively flexible in addition mit officials 
said the composite is more resistant to oxidation and more easily 
connected to sources of electricity than previous materials 
the process was developed by mit professors gregory j yurek and 
john b vander sande two of the founders of american superconductor 
corp yurek said in an interview that the company plans to enter 
joint ventures with corporate partners in a wide range of industries 
to explore commercial uses as soon as possible 
while the earliest practical applications are probably five years 
away yurek said theres no doubt these materials are going to 
have a very large impact on society 
he predicted that the first uses would be in computer shielding 
small motors and satellite sensing devices but that later 
applications would be more diverse 
were talking about powerful desktop computers medical 
imaging geological exploration power transmission 
transportation he said even the popular idea of levitating 
trains is not unrealistic it will in fact happen

former sen john g tower the leading 
candidate to be the new secretary of defense works as a consultant 
for five major defense firms congressional records and a tower 
associate said wednesday 
the companies which include some of the nations largest defense 
contractors build an array of weapons ranging from nucleartipped 
missiles to airplanes 
before retiring from the senate in 1985 tower was chairman of 
the armed services committee a post in which he oversaw pentagon 
spending during his 24 years as a senator he was a strong 
supporter of a variety of weapons including those built by the five 
companies 
tower did not return telephone calls wednesday but richard 
billmire a tower associate said the former senator was on an 
annual retainer from martinmarietta textron ltv aerospace and 
defense co rockwell international and british aerospace 
tower amp associates the consulting firm formed by tower 
registered with congress last feb 2 as a lobbyist according to 
senate records 
according to billmire tower registered as a lobbyist because he 
had been asked by the white house to help lobby the senate for 
approval of the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty 
tower would not be required to register as a lobbyist in his 
capacity as a consultant for the defense companies unless he lobbied 
congress on their behalf 
billmire who works for tower amp associates said we registered 
because the white house asked for our help on the inf treaty and we 
were working as consultants for these companies at the same time 
the companies make some components which go into systems that are 
used for weapons affected by the treaty 
tower wanted to be absolutely clear and up front about his 
connections with the companies and he didnt want anybody saying 
that the reason tower was saying this or that about the treaty was 
because it would have helped one of his clients billmire said 
after retiring from the senate tower was named by president 
reagan as a member of the us team negotiating with the soviets for 
deep reductions in the us and soviet arsenals of longrange 
weapons 
after resigning that post the former senator formed tower amp 
associates 
billmire declined to say what the firm was paid by the five 
companies but tower might be expected to have received more than 
50000 annually from each according to a defense contractor who 
spoke wednesday on condition he not be named 
tower is also a member of the board of directors of the us 
subsidiary of british aerospace 
his work for the five firms was first revealed by new york 
newsday 
tower remains the leading candidate to become secretary of 
defense in a bush administration and has met several times with 
presidentelect george bush sources said wednesday 
although bush is expected to name tower the public announcement 
is being delayed while representatives of the two men negotiate over 
who might be named to other pentagon jobs said the sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity

despite threatening weather nasa 
pressed ahead today toward a thursday launching of atlantis secret 
satellite mission but a new problem cropped up two stripped bolts 
on the spaceship 
the space agency reported that the 21man mission management team 
decided during an afternoon meeting to proceed with the countdown 
even though weather officials were reporting that an advancing storm 
reduced the odds of launch to one in five 
another look would be made at the weather before technicians 
began fueling the shuttles fuel tanks late tonight 
meanwhile nasa said that two bolts had been broken on a panel 
that allows technicans access to a cluster of small jet engines used 
to steer the shuttle in orbit a statement said the bolts were 
broken during installation of the panel 
the panel in front of the crew cabin is covered by 12 
protective thermal tiles 
this panel is being bonded in place and managers will have 
indications of the integrity of the bond by early evening the 
nasa statement said 
a source who requested anonimity said that if the bond did not 
hold the launch might have to be postponed a day or two while other 
corrective measures were taken 
nasa does not want to fly the shuttle if there is a chance the 
panel could fall off if it did reentry heat could destroy exposed 
systems and possibly lead to severe shuttle damage and possible 
danger to the crew 
a leaking tire on the shuttles main landing gear was a less 
bothersome concern 
the management team met to assess the worsening weather forecast 
which called for winds up to 24 mph heavy clouds and the 
possibility of light rain at the planned launch time the problem 
with the bolts surfaced during this meeting 
because all details of the flight are classified nasa has said 
only that the planned launch time was between 632 am and 932 
am sources said liftoff was set for about 7 am 
capt ken warren an air force spokesman said the biggest 
problem was a prediction of a heavy cloud layer over the runway here 
where atlantis would land if there were an emergency shortly after 
liftoff 
it is not looking very good for a returntolaunchsite 
abort warren said 
mission rules call for a cloud ceiling above 8000 feet over the 
runway the forecast is for 4000 feet strong crosswinds also could 
be a deterrent warren said 
warren said the weather odds for a launch itself were 60 percent 
but they dropped to 20 percent with the emergency landing 
requirements factored in 
the problem was a cold front carrying thunderstorms stretching 
from the great lakes to the gulf coast which warren said should 
reach the cape canaveral area early thursday 
if the forecast apeared hopeless launch managers most likely 
would delay the liftoff before technicians start pumping more than 
half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into 
atlantis external fuel tank that was scheduled to start late 
tonight 
at the launch pad nasa reported the countdown was on schedule 
early today the clock was stopped for a planned 16 hour 20 minute 
hold at the 11hour mark the hold provides time for contingency 
catchup and to provide rest for members of the launch team 
the military astronauts were to be kept up to date on the weather 
today during a series of briefings on the status of their spaceship 
flight operations and the secret defense department satellite 
atlantis will be commanded by navy cmdr robert l gibson the 
pilot is air force lt col guy s gardner and the mission 
specialists are col richard m mullane and lt col jerry l ross 
of the air force and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
sources report the 500 million lacrosse satellite will obtain 
allweather highresolution radar images of military targets in 
eastern europe the soviet union and elsewhere in the world and 
eventually will serve as a radar eye to guide americas b2 
stealth bomber 
following a meeting tuesday the management team headed by 
astronaut bob crippen said preparations for launch were going very 
well but added it was closely watching the weather 
strict weather limits have been imposed in the wake of the 
challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts shortly after 
launch on jan 28 1986 
the rules include winds of no more than 19 mph from the south or 
28 mph from any direction no rain at the pad or in the flight path 
and no thunderstorms within five miles 
the managers also said in their brief statement that they werent 
concerned about the tiny landinggear leak which technicians have 
been monitoring for weeks but sources said that if the launch is 
delayed a week the shuttle would have to be rolled back to a hangar 
for a tire replacement a move that could delay the flight several 
weeks 
because of the classified nature of the mission precise details 
of the countdown are not being disclosed 
there also will be a news blackout once atlantis is in orbit the 
silence will be broken only if there is a major problem 
the pentagon said the secrecy is necessary to make it more 
difficult for soviet satellites and spy ships prowling off cape 
canaveral to learn about the satellites mission 
however the soviets through the tass news agency have said the 
satellite will spy on the soviet union and serve as the radar watch 
for the stealth bomber

george bushs chief recruiter assured the 
public wednesday that the new president wont bring armies and 
legions of political hacks with him when he takes the reins of 
government next month 
even if bush were inclined to dispense patronage that way there 
simply arent that many openings in high places transition 
personnel chief chase untermeyer said 
untermeyer also predicted it may take longer to fill positions 
in this administration than ever before because of the extensive 
financial and security clearances required 
there are 4307 fulltime political jobs in the government but 
bush will not get to fill them all next year untermeyer said at a 
news conference 
many reagan appointees who have already been asked to submit 
their resignations will not be tossed out on the street come jan 
20 he said 
instead the presidentelect wants most to stay on until his 
headhunters complete the task of finding all the fresh faces 
that bush has promised to bring to washington untermeyer said 
eventually most of the holdovers will get their walking papers 
this is not ronald reagans third term it will be george 
bushs first term said untermeyer 42 a former assistant navy 
secretary for manpower 
untermeyer whom bush has already said will be his white house 
personnel chief sought to dispel the notion that the patronage 
possibilities for the new president are boundless 
he said political appointees comprised only 00014 percent of the 
governments civilian work force or oneseventh of 1 percent 
this i think would surprise a lot of people who imagine that 
when any new administration comes in line that there are armies and 
legions of political hacks who are ready to take over all the 
federal agencies around the nation and the world he said 
the fourstar main line jobs that require senate 
confirmation pay salaries that start at 80000 and reach 99500 
for cabinet officers 
also on wednesday four persons were named as the transition 
office contacts for three departments and the veterans 
administration they are 
energy department b reid detchon 40 a bush speechwriter 
health and human services department margaret d garikes 29 a 
campaign policy analyst and former trial attorney for the federal 
energy regulatory commission 
labor department richard w porter 29 a campaign domestic 
policy analyst and former lawyereconomist for the chicago 
consulting firm of lexecon inc 
veterans administration retired air force col antonio lopez 
54 a campaign deputy research director 
by untermeyers count there are a total of 5807 political 
appointments if bush does not expand the schedule c appointees 
to cabinet departments and agencies beyond the current 1601 
the 5807 jobs include a maximum of 691 senior executive service 
slots for political appointees 
but 1600 of them are parttime appointments to boards and 
commissions many of them prestigious but not highly remunerative 
and not all of the 4307 fulltime political appointments will 
come open next year 
they include the 860 federal judges who are appointed for life 
and usually turn over at the rate of 56 a year 135 ambassadorships 
only about 50 of which are usually given to noncareer foreign 
service officers and 138 regulatory agency chiefs about 35 of whom 
are chosen each year 
untermeyer acknowledged that apart from the highlevel transition 
officials gathering names and preparing lists of people for bush to 
choose the presidentelects son george jr was heading a 
separate screening team looking out for the interests of longtime 
bush loyalists 
he said that back in 1981 in the early days of the reagan 
administration it became apparent that some of the spear 
carriers the people whod worked precincts or driven cars for the 
candidate or done all the usual dirty fingernail work of politics 
were not being thought of 
there are such people in every campaign there certainly are 
people in the world of george bush said untermeyer the 
presidentelect got where he is retail by remembering people one 
at a time and we dont aim to forget them 
that doesnt mean jobs for all of them he added some will wind 
up on invitation lists to events at the white house or the 
christmas card list

a campaign to reopen the case of four irish people 
serving life terms for bombings in britain got a boost wednesday 
when two senior retired judges published an attack criticizing their 
convictions 
in a fullpage article in the times of london lords devlin and 
scarman said evidence that surfaced since the trial of the 
guildford four should be heard by a jury including testimony by 
two ira men who claimed they were responsible 
instead an appeals court judge rejected the evidence and denied 
a retrial 
our constitutional law on which our freedoms depend has been 
disordered wrote devlin and scarman former law lords who 
constitute the highest court in britain 
an array of public figures including lawmakers newspapers 
former government ministers and the heads of both the anglican and 
roman catholic churches in britain have called for a retrial or 
outright acquittal 
the case could have implications for joint angloirish attempts 
to combat the irish republican army it comes amid persistent 
complaints that british courts are biased against irish suspects 
and at a time when the two countries are again quarreling over the 
extradition of ira suspects to britain 
the convictions under criticism are those of carole richardson 
29 patrick armstrong 36 paul hill 34 and gerry conlon 33 
on oct 22 1975 after a fiveweek trial londons old bailey 
central criminal court jailed them for life for ira bombings a year 
earlier at two pubs at guildford 30 miles southwest of london five 
people were killed in one pubs while the other was evacuated in time 
armstrong and hill received additional life terms at the same 
trial for an ira bombing nov 7 1974 at a pub at woolwich in 
southeast london in which two people died 
the pubs were all frequented by soldiers the iras prime target 
in its war to rid northern ireland of british rule and unite it with 
the irish republic 
in 1977 the appeal court rejected the plea of innocence of the 
guildford four but in 1986 former home secretary merlyn rees 
publicly questioned the convictions and last year an allparty 
delegation of legislators called for a review of the case 
they argue the convictions were based solely on confessions that 
may have been extracted with beatings and drugs they also said two 
ira men convicted in another case joe oconnell and brendan dowd 
claimed after the trial that they carried out the bombings and had 
never heard of the guildford four and that at least one of the four 
had an alibi 
scarman and devlin reasoned that since the appeals court does not 
have juries the guildford four could not have the confession of 
oconnell and dowd weighed by a jury as should have been their 
right 
were they oconnell and dowd lying that was a question 
for a jury as it certainly would have been if the evidence had been 
given at the trial they wrote 
they did not criticize the trial procedures saying the judge and 
jury behaved scrupulously and they did not say whether they 
supported outright acquittal or a retrial

chinas foreign minister travels to moscow on 
thursday for the first sinosoviet foreign ministerlevel talks on 
russian soil in 31 years 
qian qichen and his soviet counterpart eduard shevardnadze are 
to lay the groundwork for another landmark a 1989 summit that will 
bring a formal end to three decades of hostility and mistrust 
between the worlds two great socialist powers 
qians twoday visit is to focus on the war in cambodia which 
has been the main roadblock to an early summit between president 
mikhail s gorbachev and chinas senior leader deng xiaoping 
china has demanded that the kremlin use its influence to prompt 
soviet ally vietnam to withdraw its troops from cambodia where they 
have been fighting chinabacked resistance forces for the past 10 
years 
deng and communist party chief zhao ziyang have said a summit 
could take place in the first half of 1989 depending on the pace of 
progress on cambodia at the foreign ministers talks 
shevardnadze is slated to visit beijing probably in january for 
what could be the final meeting before the summit date is set 
the last sinosoviet summit was in 1959 when nikita s 
khrushchev accompanied by foreign minister andrei gromyko met with 
mao tsetung in beijing on the occasion of communist chinas 10th 
anniversary celebrations 
no chinese foreign minister has gone to the soviet union for 
talks since chou enlai then also prime minister in 1957 
china and the soviet union split in 1960 after mao accused 
khrushchev of revisionism and compromising with the capitalist 
west the soviet union responded by withdrawing soviet engineers and 
technology from hundreds of joint projects dealing a painful blow 
to chinas fragile industrial base 
relations reached a nadir in 1969 when the two sides battled 
along their disputed border mao called on the nation to prepare for 
allout war and each side stationed at least 1 million troops along 
the frontier 
the two countries began political normalization talks in 1982 
opening the way for an easing of tensions and a gradual increase in 
trade scientific and cultural exchanges 
last year border talks were resumed after a nineyear suspension 
and the foreign ministers have met the last two years during the 
united nations general assembly session 
however china continues to stress there are three obstacles 
to full political and partytoparty relations cambodia moscows 
occupation of afghanistan and soviet troop strength on the chinese 
border 
the soviet unions decision to leave afghanistan and its 
withdrawal last year of an army division from mongolia have shifted 
chinas attention to the cambodian question 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said last week the 
soviet union has indicated on many ocasions its willingness to work 
for an early settlement to the kampuchean cambodian question 
but she called on moscow to make further practical efforts to 
get vietnam out of cambodia 
in a commentary on qians visit the official xinhua news agency 
said the normalization of relations between beijing and moscow 
conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries and 
desires of the two peoples 
it said both the soviet union and china are carrying out 
acrosstheboard reforms to speed up the development of their 
national economies which require a peaceful external environment 
and goodneighborly relations in particular 
however it stressed that normal relations do not mean a 
comeback of alliance ties such as that in the 1950s when china was 
heavily dependent on the soviet union for economic assistance and 
followed the moscow line on international issues

billion to 60 billion this year compared with the record level of 
571 billion in 1987 that is the difference between cash receipts 
and cash expenses during the calendar year

4 percent increase about the same as last years increase for 
1989 department economists are projecting food cost hikes in the 
same range about 3 to 5 percent

the same as a month ago and up from 62 in november 1987 those are

a fundraising calendar featuring 12 officers in 
mildly racy poses and brandishing weapons is under attack from the 
police chief for glorifying guns 
the calendar produced by the police union to raise funds for 
charity shows officers pointing guns directly at the photographer 
in several shots including the cover photo in one picture an 
officer is holding a machine gun while a different photo shows a 
female officer in a police tshirt and black fishnet stockings 
holding a pumpaction shotgun 
in todays violent society i dont think anyone should glorify 
guns said police chief morris redding who initially approved the 
fundraising idea 
after viewing the finished product i was disappointed 
redding said tuesday i was hoping it would show the officers in a 
more professional light 
but detective ken cullifer treasurer of the international 
brotherhood of police officers local 623 which produced the 
calendar said it was perfectly natural for the officers to be 
pictured with guns 
if you were a plumber youd be standing there with a 
plunger cullifer said police carry guns so we used guns as 
props 
despite reddings statements police spokesman cal jackson said 
he knew of no plans by the department to block calendar sales 
union officials said the police chiefs approval was not 
necessary for officers to appear in the calendar 
if the 5000 calendars that were printed sell the union plans to 
publish a calendar yearly cullifer said the 7 calendars have been 
selling well 
a message from the police union on the calendar says it was 
produced to raise funds and to show you the public a different 
side of the police officers who serve you every day throughout the 
year 
profits will go to the atlanta disabled officers fund and one 
other yettobenamed charity 
i hope no one takes it too seriously said detective lisa 
roey of the sex crimes unit were just trying to show that police 
are people too and we do people things just like everyone else

a fire at a plastics factory left 60 
firefighters overcome by toxic fumes and prompted officials to 
evacuate up to 800 people authorities said 
twelve firefighters remained hospitalized wednesday 
the conditions were unusual fire capt james bielby said of 
tuesday nights fire we had strong winds driving those chemicals 
right at our guys they went right to work and strapped their air 
packs on but you get a certain amount of that stuff just by being 
around the fire it only takes a few breaths 
bielby said his department had lost track of records indicating 
dangerous chemicals were stored at divorce plastics inc because it 
had changed hands 
it used to be a garage door manufacturer but we werent made 
aware of it he said its one of those cases where everythings 
against you 
as many as 800 residents were evacuated as 55gallon drums 
containing the chemical isocyanate exploded during the blaze which 
erupted about 8 pm officials said they were allowed to return to 
their homes about 3 am wednesday 
bruce dorland of the genesee county coordination center said 
residents were evacuated as a precaution because isocyanate used 
by the company to manufacture plastic automotive bumpers could be 
harmful if swallowed or absorbed through the skin 
the firefighters were listed in good condition 
the fire caused about 3 million in damage and was under 
investigation

surrealist painter salvador dali remained 
in extremely critical condition wednesday but his secretary said he 
asked to listen to bach violin concertos when he woke up after a 
quiet night 
the 84yearold artist is suffering from severe heart trouble 
aggravated by blood clots in the lungs according to doctors at the 
quiron clinic 
they limited the number of visits to the painter after too many 
government officals called on him tuesday 
maria teresa brugues dalis personal secretary said dali had a 
quiet night and asked to listen to classical music particularly 
the violin concertos of composer johann sebastian bach 
one of five doctors attending the painter said the fact there had 
been no change in dalis condition since tuesday is a positive 
sign even if it does not clear away the uncertainty about his 
future condition according to the spanish news agency efe 
however his extremely critical condition should not be minimized 
to create false expectations about a strong recovery said the 
doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity 
dali was taken to the hospital in his hometown of figueras about 
60 miles north of barcelona on sunday after he developed pneumonia 
and heart trouble on monday night he was rushed to the intensive 
care unit of the quiron clinic 
the flamboyant artist one of the founders of the surrealist 
movement is the last member of a generation of spanish painters 
that included pablo picasso who died in 1973 and joan miro who 
died a decade later 
dali has lived in seclusion and suffered from frequent bouts of 
depression since the death in 1982 of his wife gala 
in 1984 dali was severely burned in a fire at his home in the 
hamlet of la pera 40 miles south of figueras and was hospitalized 
for three months since then he has been bound to a wheelchair fed 
through a nasal tube and attended by nurses round the clock 
after his 1984 hospitalization dali moved to a residence 
attached to his theatermuseum in figueras in 1986 doctors gave 
him a pacemaker

the vice presidential mansion may need some 
alterations before the quayle family can move in vice 
presidentelect dan quayle said wednesday echoing a sentiment 
expressed two days earlier by his wife marilyn 
but quayles staff was quick to say the family is not finding 
fault with the victorian residence on the grounds of the naval 
observatory and is actually pleased at the prospect of living there 
quayle said the mansion is not configured for a family with three 
children it does have six bedrooms but some of those serve as 
offices and servants quarters and some do not have closets 
theres just not enough bedrooms there for the children so we 
probably wont be able to move in right away after the bushes move 
into the white house quayle said in an interview 
mrs quayle told senate wives the same thing on monday but an 
aide said she had not seen the house at the time since then she 
has toured the house with mrs bush and is quite eager to move 
in said spokesman jim carroll 
she thinks it is a beautiful place and acknowledges they have 
to make some modifications to accommodate three young children but 
is quite pleased with the residence he said 
the quayles will continue to live at their home in mclean va 
until they can move into the official residence their three 
children tucker 14 benjamin 12 and corinne 10 will continue 
attending public schools in virginia for the time being quayle said 
in 1975 the federal government spent about 311000 to convert 
the mansion on embassy row into an official vicepresidential 
residence the vice presidents who have used the house did not have 
schoolage children at the time 
nelson rockefeller refurbished the mansion but did not live 
there walter mondale did not redecorate the house 
friends of the bushes raised more than 100000 in 1981 to 
redecorate the residence and refurbish public rooms used for 
official entertaining

the head of the nuclear regulatory commission 
said wednesday that us nuclear power plants have grown safer and 
more efficient over the last four years 
the remarks by chairman lando w zech jr came at ceremonies to 
dedicate an 18story headquarters building for the nrc in suburban 
rockville md 
he noted that in 1984 nrc began trend analysis of the key 
nuclear parameters used to monitor reactor operation safety from 
1984 until now there has been a clear and definite improvement 
zech said there had been reductions in unplanned automatic 
shutdowns other safety system alarms and exposure of workers to 
radiation 
along with this improvement in critical safety performance 
indicators we have seen improvements in plant reliability and 
availability zech said recent data shows an increase in the 
average capacity factors for us reactors from about 59 percent in 
1986 to almost 67 percent in 1988 
the capacity factor represents the actual output of a plant 
compared to what it would generate if it operated at full power all 
the time 
nrc spokesman john kopeck later provided the following specific 
figures for the performance indicators cited by zech 
significant operating events meaning major problems 24 
per operating reactor in 1985 16 in 1986 and 08 in 1987 
unplanned automatic shutdowns 524 per reactor in 1984 504 in 
1985 396 in 1986 and 324 in 1987 
safety system actuations 276 per reactor in 1984 26 in 1985 
204 in 1986 and 168 in 1987 
precursor events signaling the possibility of a major accident 
a nationwide total of 17 in 1984 10 in 1985 and 6 in 1986 
radiation exposure 714 manrem in 1984 574 manrem in 1985 
431 in 1986 and 425 in 1987 
manrem is a measure of radiation exposure for large numbers of 
people for example when 100 people receive an average exposure of 
001 rem that would result in a figure of 1 manrem 
spokesmen for antinuclear groups questioned zechs assessment 
kenneth bossong of public citizen a washingtonbased public 
interest group founded by consumer advocate ralph nader said 
its a mixed bag there are some positives and there are some 
negatives its not fair or accurate for zech to say everything is 
looking better because its not 
for example bossong said on the radiation issue what he said 
is true as far as it went but its not complete the average dose 
per worker at nuclear power plants has decreased since 1984 but the 
number of workers exposed on the other hand has increased 
he said the number of workers exposed has increased from 93000 
in 1985 to slightly more than 100000 in 1986 and 104000 workers in 
1987 
michael mariotte director of the nuclear information and 
resource service another washingtonbased public interest group 
said there may be a slightly improving track record however 
theres no reason to be smug about it it seems like every time 
they think something has been solved they find a new problem 
the new 286000squarefoot nrc headquarters building purchased 
by the government for 475 million provides space for about 1400 
nrc employees it marks an effort to consolidate operations of the 
agency which previously were dispersed among 10 separate buildings 
a second structure is to be built at the same rockville site by 
1991 to accommodate the rest of the agencys washington area 
employees

george bush sat down wednesday with jesse 
jackson the man who only a few months ago he dubbed a hustler 
from chicago and said he will be looking to the democrat for 
suggestions during his presidency 
while bush made no policy commitments to jackson or to a group of 
environmentalists with whom he met earlier it was a day of positive 
reviews for the presidentelect 
jackson said he was convinced bush has an earnest desire to 
send forth a moral tone in his presidency 
and one of the environmental leaders jay hair of the national 
wildlife federation said bushs receptivity was a night and day 
difference from the reagan white house years of ideological 
shrillness antienvironmental actions and lack of stewardship 
bush and jackson after a meeting sought by the former democratic 
presidential candidate played down their differences and their 
harsh campaign criticism of one another including allegations by 
jackson and others that part of bushs presidential campaign incited 
racist fears 
the campaign is over i have no arguments with the way reverend 
jackson conducted himself toward me and i hope its the same with 
him on a personal basis bush said 
there will be times in my presidency when i will ask for his 
suggestions he has some very good ideas on a lot of subjects 
that are of keen interest to our country 
during the presidential campaign republican bush once called 
jackson a loose cannon and on a campaign trip to nebraska in 
may vowed he would return to the state because im not going to be 
outhustled by the hustler from chicago or that traditional liberal 
democrat from massachussets the latter a reference to gov 
michael dukakis who defeated jackson for the democratic presidential 
nomination 
jackson joked wednesday that he and bush had talked about the 
republican moving begrudgingly but with a lot of excitement toward 
liberalism 
he brought three of his children to the lunch meeting in bushs 
office and they ate with bushs oldest son george 
on another subject bush sidestepped reporters questions on 
stories of disagreement within his staff on the possible naming of 
former sen john tower of texas as defense secretary 
stay tuned bush said repeating his favorite refrain on 
pending administration nominations all is tranquil within his 
staff he laughed 
meanwhile samuel k skinner chairman of the regional 
transportation authority in the chicago area emerged as bushs 
likely choice for transportation secretary a government source 
commenting on condition he not be named said skinner talked to bush 
transition staffers in washington on tuesday and probably would meet 
with bush next week 
as for the environment representatives of a coalition of 30 
environmental groups said they were impressed with the positive 
reception from bush and his aides when they presented him with a 
700proposal blueprint for the environment 
hair said he had told the vice president mr bush read my 
lips protect the environment he said bush reacted positively to 
the wordplay on his own notaxes campaign phrase replying i 
will i will 
jackson also invoked that famous bush line when bush laughingly 
told him to be careful what he said to reporters because im 
listening carefully 
watch my lips jackson said jovially 
among the issues bush and jackson said they discussed were drugs 
arms control south africa allegations of racism against bushs 
republican presidential campaign and foreclosure warnings sent by 
the reagan administration to thousands of family farmers 
on the farm foreclosures jackson said bush had promised to have 
his staff meet with a group of farmers with whom jackson has been 
talking about the problem 
the two men also talked about the decision by secretary of state 
george shultz to deny us entry to palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat to address the united nations 
bush reiterated that as vice president he continues to support that 
and other administration policies 
jackson said bush has given himself room to take his own 
position on the matter after becoming president 
jackson who once said bush was morally unfit to lead the 
country said he hoped bush would keep his pledge to seek a kinder 
and gentler nation 
he brushed aside a question about his campaign criticism of bush 
and he dealt only briefly with his contention that bushs emphasis 
on the furlough of black convicted murderer willie horton during the 
campaign incited racism 
we put that in perspective we didnt dwell on it that as a 
campaign strategy is behind us said jackson 
bush told jackson it was not his intention to stir racial fears 
by using the horton furlough against dukakis whose state of 
massachusetts let horton out 
it is important that the president be sensitive to signals and 
to messages sent jackson said im convinced he has an earnest 
desire to send forth a moral tone i certainly hope he will follow 
through on that commitment 
bush praised jacksons years of work in the war on drugs 
noting the two have met on occasion during bushs vice 
presidency the presidentelect said weve had a relationship 
that transcends politics and it addresses itself to national 
issues

surgeon general c everett koop presented his 
offices highest award wednesday to the surprised director of the 
smoking policy institute a notforprofit organization based in 
seattle 
robert a rosner said he was in washington to consult with 
officials of the environmental protection agency and accepted koops 
invitation to drop by for what he thought was a courtesy call 
instead koop had arranged for a television film crew to record 
the presentation to rosner of the surgeon generals medallion 
rosner said afterward that koop had encouraged him to form the 
institute after the two worked together on some antismoking video 
tapes in 1985 
during the presentation koop said rosner had a special ability 
to go into the workplace and get people to accept nosmoking rules 
and more importantly to like it 
rosner said his institute which exists mostly on foundation 
grants and contributions has worked with about 400 private 
companies to develop plans to eliminate smoking in the workplace 
he said he attributes his success largely to having a great 
deal of empathy and concern for the way smokers get treated in this 
society 
there are two kinds of serious pollution in this country 
said rosner who added that he has never been a smoker himself 
one is air pollution from the ends of lit cigarettes and the other 
is noise pollution from the mouths of nonsmokers 
rosners emphathetic approach we dont present it in a 
valueladen context is reflected in a booklet his institute has 
just completed for blue cross and blue shield which expects to 
distribute 1 million copies

in the 30 years since fire at our lady of the 
angels school took the lives of 92 children and three teachers the 
neighborhood is changed the school rebuilt stronger safety 
measures are in effect at schools nationwide 
but scars remain and sadness returns in the memories of those who 
survived the elementary school disaster 
i suppose its a memory that will never go away said jean 
kobus mother of two children who escaped the blaze 
it was midafternoon on dec 1 1958 when the fire broke out 
authorities think it started in a pile of trash in a stairwell 
smoke and flames traveled quickly up the open stairwell 
spreading out on the top floor and trapping many of the schools 
1300 students and teachers in their rooms 
the fire alarm went off and children were hanging out the 
windows yelling fire it was just mass pandemonium recalled the 
rev john kobus mrs kobus son who was a 7yearold secondgrader 
at the time 
efforts by firefighters teachers and some neighbors couldnt 
lessen the death toll that stands as the third worst in the citys 
history 
in the aftermath sprinkler systems were installed in schools 
with woodbased construction edward prendergast chief fire 
prevention engineer with the chicago fire department said wednesday 
school systems nationwide also began requiring enclosed 
stairwells alarm systems more fireresistant material and more 
fire drills 
kobus now director of pastoral care at chicagos st mary of 
nazareth hospital remembers escaping from his firstfloor classroom 
and being wet and cold outside 
but his mother recalls the anxious moments of uncertainty as she 
and her family searched for her children 
we started running toward the school she said in an 
interview wednesday from her suburban glen ellyn home if wed 
meet anybody wed ask if they knew milt then a seventhgrader or 
john and theyd say no 
just outside the school you could see the crowd was anxious 
and frightened she said 
my father finally found john who was kind of wandering 
around she said 
milton now an executive with a technology school had been 
huddled with others in a secondfloor classroom until a firefighter 
knocked in the door and made the children form a human chain to 
walk to safety mrs kobus said 
milts grandmother found him his face black with soot and took 
him home 
the effect on the italian neighborhood was devastating mrs 
kobus remembers visiting homes and talking to grieving mothers she 
estimates she went to at least 25 funerals 
i felt guilty talking to them because i felt that my children 
were safe and i thank god for that and they had to lose theirs 
she said 
all those closed coffins pictures on the coffins it was the 
saddest thing in the world to see 
sister mary fogarty was principal of thennearby st marys high 
school and was sent to the county morgue to identify the three 
teachers killed childrens bodies and anxious relatives also were 
arriving she said 
she remembers a stunned silence among many family members she 
consoled 
they were so shocked and so crushed she said i dont 
think they could work up hysteria 
we have never gotten over it she said of herself and others 
in the sisters of charity of the blessed virgin mary order of nuns 
which still runs the new our lady elementary school with 520 
students 
the italian neighborhood has changed and is now mostly black and 
hispanic said the rev michael gabriel pastor of the nearby our 
lady of the angels church 
he said a service to commemorate the victims will be in his 
church sunday 
despite the years that have gone by he said our faith is the 
only consolation in a tragedy like this

environmentalists gave george bush a wish list 
of more than 700 recommendations wednesday topped by a plea for 
action on fighting global warming and were cheered by his response 
the difference between wednesdays reception and the past eight 
years of the reagan administration was like night and day said 
jay d hair president of the national wildlife federation and one 
of the six leaders of environmental groups who spent 45 minutes over 
breakfast with the presidentelect 
i am an environmentalist bush proclaimed in the campaign 
among specifics bush has endorsed the goal of no net loss of 
wetlands has urged new acid rain controls if the governments 5 
billion fiveyear clean coal demonstration programs prove 
disappointing and has said he plans to sponsor an international 
conference on global warming 
the few environmental groups endorsing candidates backed bushs 
opponent michael dukakis and some that made no formal endorsement 
still attacked bush for his leadership of the regulatory reform task 
force early in the reagan administration 
but all that seemed forgotten in the warm glow surrounding a 
crowded postbreakfast news conference arranged by a coalition of 30 
environmental groups organized under the name blueprint for the 
environment 
bush said we would be rather surprised and really pleased with 
some appointments he planned to make in the near future according 
to tina hobson executive director of renew america a group 
concentrating on energy efficiency bush also said he would arrange 
preconfirmation meetings of his nominees with environmental leaders 
hair said he told the vice president mr bush read my lips 
protect the environment and bush reacted positively to the 
wordplay on his own notaxes campaign phrase replying i will i 
will 
we will be on his team said john adams of the natural 
resources defense council 
hair said the early 1980s were a time of ideological 
shrillness antienvironmental actions and lack of stewardship in 
the administration though bush was the secondranking member of 
that administration hair said i didnt sense any of that this 
morning 
the greenhouse effect warms the earth when gases notably 
carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels trap infrared radiation 
that normally would escape into space 
most scientists agree that the earth has warmed by almost one 
degree fahrenheit over the past century and the warming will 
accelerate to another three to eight degrees sometime in the next 
century the major remaining uncertainty is over timing with some 
estimates putting such a warming by 2030 and others in 2075 or later 
when it came to the greenhouse effect bush knew what we were 
talking about said adams who called it the single most serious 
problem facing the world because of the massive shifts in crop 
patterns weather and seacoast changes that could follow 
though bush gave no commitments on that or any issue he was 
concerned and he was prepared to take action said adams 
the greenhouse effect is clearly the top priority of the group 
the first four of 61 recommendations singled out as important enough 
for a separate listing all dealt with it in one way or another 
promotion of an international agreement ending use of chemicals 
that destroy the ozone layer reforestation and aggressive energy 
conservation programs 
the environmentalists who have spent a year drawing up 
recommendations in 16 green books for distribution to affected 
government departments and agencies also called for tax and fee 
increases and other tax law changes that would increase government 
revenues by 171 billion spending cuts totaling 22 billion and 
spending increases aimed at benefiting the environment totaling 55 
billion 
the new taxes would include a 10cent increase in the current 
92centspergallon gasoline tax to raise 10 billion 
the new spending would include 2 billion to improve mass transit 
and 325 million or 20 percent more for the environmental protection 
agency which the group said should be elevated to cabinet status 
the recommendations encompass just about every federal action 
environmentalists have sought in recent years reveal some 
duplication and are bound to prove hard to carry out in some 
instances 
some of the proposals such as the elimination of irrigation 
subsidies and moneylosing timber sales have been rejected by 
congress several times 
new opposition came quickly on wednesday from the us chamber 
of commerce which said in a statement from harvey alter manager of 
resources policy that the recommendations were incomplete 
alarmist misleading and intellectually dishonest 
the blueprint should be rewritten around a broad environmental 
consensus of goals followed by an honest attempt to construct 
strategies that will meet these goals in a timely and costeffective 
fashion alter said

boston universitys proposal to overhaul chelseas 
impoverished public schools is close to a contract but opponents 
promise to fight private management of the taxfunded system 
the unprecedented offer was made three years ago when chelsea 
began looking for outside help the 3400student district has the 
highest dropout rate in the state and has not built a school since 
1923 
on tuesday suffolk superior court judge walter steele denied the 
massachusetts federation of teachers an injunction stalling the 
contract with the university although he noted there are questions 
about its legality 
union lawyers said they would pursue their legal challenge 
maintaining that the contract would usurp local officials 
authority particularly in the hiring and firing of teachers 
the chelsea school committee nevertheless voted 52 tuesday night 
to tentatively accept the universitys offer to run the district for 
10 years officials said they expect to have a finished contract 
within the next few weeks 
john zimini president of the chelsea board of aldermen which 
would have to approve the contract defended the proposal wednesday 
we have to step out of the 19th century and get into the 20th 
century zimini said 
i think that it takes an awful lot of courage on the part of 
the city to say hey look weve tried our best the moneys just 
not there he said unfortunately in our society any kind of 
change is always a fear factor 
the workingclass town on boston harbor with its influx of 
hispanic and southeast asian immigrants has been strained 
financially by a 1980 state taxlimiting law 
zimini said he cannot predict how aldermen will vote but 
believes the contract will eventually be approved it also requires 
approval by the legislature 
its not over yet said paul devlin president of the 
massachusetts federation of teachers a decision as critical as 
the constitutionality of privatizing a public school system should 
be made by the higher courts 
university officials maintain they wont be taking the public 
schools private but will simply be managers who have to answer to 
the school committee 
the university proposes to revamp the curricula build new 
schools provide mothers and pregnant teenagers counseling on 
nutrition and childrearing tailor learning plans to individual 
students and set up afterschool programs 
the state board of education has voted against the proposal in 
its present form saying it could not accept failure to require the 
university to open its books the boards approval is not needed 
but its recommendation could influence legislators

jesus hernandez clutched the papers he hoped 
would give him permanent residency status in the united states and 
said wednesday he believed the government is trying to help us 
the 25yearold from jacisco mexico and his 20yearold 
brother jose were among the illegal alien agricultural workers who 
lined up in oklahoma city to beat a midnight deadline for seeking 
immigration amnesty 
i have been here for four years and i like it hernandez 
said oklahoma is a real nice state 
although he said he now works drawing designs for a monument 
company in enid hernandez said he and his brother harvested crops 
before that they will have to prove that to the satisfaction of 
immigration and naturalization service investigators to be eligible 
for us residency 
a special provision of the 1986 amnesty law set a midnight 
deadline for illegal alien agricultural workers to prove they 
harvested perishable crops in the united states for at least 90 days 
in the oneyear period that ended may 1 1986 if they do so they 
will receive temporary residency later they may apply for 
permanent residency 
hernandez said he did not have too much trouble making it to 
oklahoma in 1984 
i took a bus to the rio grande river and then walked 
hernandez said i walked for two days and two nights until some 
friends came for me in a car they brought me to oklahoma and here 
i am 
hernandez brother stayed in the background among the 50 or more 
applicants waiting in the ins office as hernandez spoke the brother 
shook his head no when asked if he would like to add anything 
some illegal aliens have expressed concern about the amnesty 
program fearing it was just a ruse to get them to come out of 
hiding so they can be deported 
i dont think so hernandez said when asked whether he 
thought the government was fooling the aliens i think they are 
trying to help us i think they want to help us

blocking the way with shields as the two sides pushed and shoved 
each other but protesters were unable to break through

district yelling slogans and hurling leaflets into crowds of 
onlookers on the sidewalks a group of students hurled firebombs at 
a government office but did not cause any damage 
riot police attacked the march from the rear hurling tear gas 
grenades into the column of protesters dozens of students fought 
back with firebombs and rocks during a brief clash but most 
protesters ran for cover 
police had no word on arrests or injuries 
the protest was smaller than major protests nov 19 and 26 when 
thousands of people demanding chuns arrest clashed with police in 
seoul thousands of people watched the protest wednesday but very 
few gave any sign of sympathy or support 
some 200 students demanding the former presidents arrest battled 
riot police with firebombs in a separate protest wednesday in 
songnam on seouls southern outskirts 
dissident groups are demanding chun be arrested and tried for 
human rights abuses and corruption under his authoritarian rule

nation for abuses under his rule and saying he would turn over 
millions of dollars in personal assets to the government he has 
denied any personal wrongdoing

checking to determine if any of chuns relatives or associates had 
diverted official funds to australia the embassy said the checks 
were being made at the request of the south korean government

by the public administration reform commission for drastic curbs on 
the agency for national security planning to end its use in domestic 
politics 
the agency formerly known as the korean central intelligence 
agency and the military intelligence have traditionally play major 
roles in domestic politics both agencies have operated against 
antigovernment groups of all kinds 
a former army chief of staff chung sunghwa said wednesday 
during national assembly hearings that chun and other top military 
officers seized power after staging a mutiny in december 1979 
chung accused the former president of acting out of greed for 
power and said the incident almost sparked a major confrontation 
within the military 
chun and roh were among a group of generals who took power 
following the october 1979 assassination of president park chunghee 
by his intelligence chief in a dispute over handling protests 
chun and roh have said they acted to save the nation from chaos 
and had no thoughts of taking power chun was a close protege of 
president park 
chung who was army chief was arrested by chuns military 
intelligence command for possible complicity in parks death he was 
later dismissed from the army in disgrace after being demoted to the 
lowest rank of private 
chung first made his accusation against chun and roh during 
presidential elections in december last year roh won the election

syrian troops raided suspected weapons 
depots in moslem neighborhoods wednesday after six days of violence 
between rival militias killed 40 people and wounded 87 
the syrian command said the searches by 200 helmeted syrian 
troops in trucks and an armored personnel carrier were aimed at 
making west beirut a demilitarized city 
the cleanup operation was launched monday after almost a week of 
clashes between members of the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of 
god and the prosyrian amal arabic for hope in south and west 
beirut 
the battles between the militias may be endangering the lives of 
14 western hostages including nine americans believed held by 
hezbollah in the slums of beirut 
in the past two days syrian troops detained 350 suspected 
militia gunmen in house raids said a police spokesman who demanded 
anonymity he said most of them have been released after being 
interrogated but about a dozen remain in custody 
the syrian command should disarm both amal and hezbollah to 
prevent further clashes said sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin 
lebanons senior shiite cleric in a broadcast on the moslem voice 
of nation radio 
on wednesday syrian troops confiscated two rifles buried in an 
empty lot in the mossaitbeh district witnesses said 
the syrians entered two buildings occupied by shiite squatters in 
the old jewish quarter of wadi abu jamil and a deserted shiite 
mosque in the rawsheh neighborhood but they found no weapons said 
one witness who refused to be identified 
a syrian officer asked several residents in wadi abu jamil 
whether they had weapons all of them said they didnt have weapons 
and the officer seemed to believe them because he did not order the

american personal income posted its largest 
gain in a year in october the government said wednesday in a report 
cited as more evidence of economic strength and inflationary 
pressure 
however a separate report to the federal reserve board found 
evidence of an apparently slower pace of growth financial 
markets rallied interpreting it as a signal that fed members are 
less worried about inflation than previously thought 
the commerce department said personal income rose 18 percent 
the biggest rise since october 1987 to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 418 trillion last month the gain followed modest 
increases of 05 percent in september and 04 percent in august 
the department attributed about half of last months increase to 
farm subsidy payments and bonuses to auto workers however 
excluding those factors income still would have risen a hefty 09 
percent 
this throws cold water on the view the economy slowed down 
much said john hagens an economist with the wefa group a bala 
cynwyd pa forecasting firm it may have taken a bit of a pause 
in august and september but it came roaring back in october 
the concern in financial markets has been that growth is too 
strong high levels of employment will lead to higher wages and 
strong consumer demand will lead to higher prices they fear 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a washington 
consulting firm said retailers likely will be pleased with the 
income gains 
there are more people working and people are earning more 
money she said retailers will be at least reasonably satisfied 
with the christmas season 
however in a review of the economy based on assessments from the 
12 regional federal reserve banks the fed reported an apparently 
slower pace of growth moderate wage increases and slightly eased 
price pressures in several manufacturing industries 
it doesnt sound like the same economy were looking at 
hagens said 
personal consumption spending which includes everything except 
interest payments on debt was up a robust 08 percent to an annual 
rate of 330 trillion following a weak 01 percent rise in 
september 
the biggest spending increase last month was for services up 14 
percent followed by a 06 percent increase for nondurable goods 
spending on durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years fell 06 percent 
with income rising faster than spending americans saved more 
than in any month since october 1987 the personal savings rate 
savings as a percentage of aftertax income was 52 percent up 
from 42 percent in september 
disposable or aftertax income was up 19 percent last month 
also the largest increase in a year after rising 06 percent a 
month earlier 
wages and salaries a key component of personal income were up a 
strong 15 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 251 
trillion bolstered by a 21 percent increase in manufacturing 
salaries the auto bonuses accounted for about 60 percent of the 
manufacturing increase 
farm income rose a huge 762 percent to an annual rate of 467 
billion largely because of government payments for corn harvested 
in 1987

regulars sipped their last fruit juice wednesday at 
the milestone pub but fans of the pioneering bar for nondrinkers 
said its example lives on 
the milestone opened at exeter in the southwestern england in 
1985 as britains first lowalcohol bar serving soft drinks and the 
occasional lowalcohol beer since then 31 similar bars and clubs 
have sprung up around the country most of them for mostly for 
teenagers 
operators of the milestone blamed its closure on lack of public 
funds on which it was run almost exclusively for the first 2 
years officials said it had made a path others are following 
i dont think the closing is a bad sign said juliet 
gosling spokeswoman for the governments alcoholeducation body 
alcohol concern 
i think its very sad but new clubs and bars are opening every 
week theres unprecedented interest in setting up this sort of 
venture she said in a telephone interview adding that other such 
bars have learned from the milestone 
we expressly set out not to make the milestone a club for 
exdrinkers said mike tristram director of the exeter and 
district council on alcohol the charity that ran the milestone 
he said only onethird of the pubs customers were people with 
drinking problems and twothirds were the general public who 
prefer a nonalcoholic environment 
lowalcohol beer carries an alcohol content of 09 percent 
whereas alcohol in regular beer can range up to 10 percent a 
british bitter drawn from the tap typically contains just under 4 
percent alcohol 
low alcohol isnt the only attraction of the new pubs however 
assistant manager graham hampson said a lot of women come in 
because they fear being molested in other places 
the milestone which cost more than 28000 annually to operate 
was heavily supported at its beginning by an annual 22000 grant 
from the national mental health foundation 
but when the foundation grant ran out this year the pub could 
not break even ms gosling said its location in the basement in a 
community services building away from the city center also made 
profits elusive 
the pub will now be made into a club for physically and mentally 
handicapped people 
some nights the place has been packed and weve only taken 20 
pounds or 40 said manager norrie mckechnie a 41yearold 
reformed alcoholic people dont come in and drink five pints of 
orange juice 
tristram said its very unfortunate that an initiative like 
this wouldnt attract more public support for funding 
but he and mckechnie agreed that the milestone had achieved some 
of its objectives 
our closure will make everyone think alcoholfree pubs dont 
work but the failure is only in commercial terms its helped so 
many people mckechnie said 
ms gosling attributed the popularity of such bars to growing 
concern about alcoholrelated problems like drunken driving 
underage drinking and work accidents 
many of the bars were opened with teenagers or families in mind 
she said 
a spokesman for the brewers society which represents most of the 
countrys 117 brewers said sales of lowalcohol products have 
doubled every year since 1985 the society recently launched a 
campaign to get drivers to drink lowalcohol products in regular 
pubs 
of the milestone the spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
i cant quite see the point of it im surprised it lasted that 
long if you want to go to a place without alcohol go to a cafe

an aerial photograph of the b2 stealth bomber 
taken from directly overhead was published in the nov 28 edition 
of aviation week amp space technology magazine 
the official view of the plane was headon from a reviewing 
stand 
william g hartenstein took the picture from a private airplane 
on nov 22 the day the plane was put on display for the first time 
david quast assistant managing editor of the magazine said 
wednesday 
we had a private airplane flown by one of our writers who is 
also a pilot said quast it was not restricted airspace there 
was no restriction and no rule broken there was a possibility 
president reagan was going to be there had he been it would have 
been restricted 
the stealth bomber was put on display nov 11 after more than 10 
years of secrecyshrouded development 
the bomber is a subsonic allaltitude flying wing formed from 
nonmetallic composite materials that are intended to let it absorb 
radar transmissions rather than reflect them its shape and lack of 
sharp angles also help make it nearly invisible to radar 
air force officials say it makes the same impression on a radar 
screen as a bird

the chancellor of the main campus of 
louisiana state university has resigned amid a furor over his 
decision to readmit a graduate student who cheated and is related to 
a powerful legislator 
lsu system president allen copping announced james whartons 
resignation at a news conference wednesday wharton was not present 
and did not come out of his office to talk to reporters 
im very sorry about this but he feels that because certain 
things have happened that certain faculty members have lost 
confidence in him said copping who stressed he did not encourage 
the chancellor to resign 
wharton served seven years ago as chief executive of the 
27000student campus here he has tenure and will return to 
teaching chemistry copping said 
the announcement came shortly before the faculty senate was to 
release a critical report on whartons decision to readmit the 
student 
copping acknowledged that the student whose name has not been 
released by the university is related to sammy nunez president pro 
tem of the louisiana senate pressed by reporters copping said 
wharton told him that nunez had inquired about the students status 
and had talked with the chancellor 
the incident came to light in october when members of the faculty 
questioned wharton about the incident the senate said it appeared 
wharton acted on matters the faculty should control academics and 
admissions 
at the time wharton said he felt the only issue was what rules 
apply in punishing a student the graduate school catalog calls for 
a twoyear suspension for academic misconduct while the code of 
student conduct calls for a onesemester suspension 
wharton said in october he felt the code should apply because the 
twoyear rule was enacted after the student entered lsu 
chancellor wharton and i have talked about this at length and 
he said he felt he followed the proper procedures copping said 
i may or may not have done the same thing 
copping said wharton told him of the decision to resign on 
tuesday night and the lsu board was informed wednesday copping said 
he has not decided on an interim chancellor

the federal reserves district banks in 
november reported apparently slower growth moderate wage 
increases and slightly eased price pressures in several 
manufacturing industries according to a report released wednesday 
the new report based on surveys conducted by the 12 fed district 
banks stirred a rally in financial markets wednesday as investors 
interpreted the findings as a signal that the fed might be williing 
to loosen its credit policy because of signs of a slowing economy 
and easing inflationary pressures 
however some private economists said they believed the fed 
district banks were overstating the economic slowdown and the 
central bank will still be forced to tighten credit conditions in 
coming months 
we think there will be more consumer price inflation said 
john hagens chief economist for the wefa group an economic 
consulting firm we think it is almost inevitable that the fed 
will continue to tighten 
the fed survey was prepared for the dec 1314 meeting of the 
feds policymaking open market committee the panel which sets 
monetary policy for the central bank 
most districts report continued economic growth but at an 
apparently slower pace than in previous months the fed survey 
said only dallas st louis and kansas city report generally 
sluggish business conditions and cite persistent weakness in many 
sectors 
the survey of economic conditions known as the tan book said 
that wage increases continued to be moderate even though labor 
markets around many part of the country are tight 
capacity pressures and consequently price pressures have 
reportedly eased slightly in several industries including paper 
chemical steel and textiles the survey found 
the survey said that while retail sales have been slow there was 
optimism in many cities for a pickup in sales during the holiday 
shopping season

the key witness in a 1977 murder trial whose 
outcome was questioned in the film the thin blue line recanted 
wednesday and testified that randall dale adams is innocent in the 
killing of a police officer 
death row inmate david ray harris called as a witness in adams 
hearing to ask for a new trial said he was alone in a car stopped 
by officer robert wood who was killed in the incident nov 28 
1976 harris acknowledged his finger was on the trigger when wood 
was shot but stopped short of saying he killed the officer 
based on harris testimony state district judge larry baraka 
said he would determine that harris had admitted to the killing 
as far as the court is concerned he is telling me that he 
did baraka said but the judge did not decide immediately on 
adams request 
adams was convicted of killing wood and sentenced to death but 
the sentence later was commuted to life in prison he has maintained 
his innocence and his conviction was questioned in the errol morris 
movie the thin blue line 
harris testified he was biased in favor of the prosecution when 
he first implicated adams harris said prosecutor doug mulder had 
promised to take care of other criminal charges pending against 
him in return for his testimony 
did randall adams kill robert wood attorney randy schaffer 
asked harris who was wearing an orange jail uniform handcuffs and 
shackles 
no he did not harris replied randall adams knew nothing 
about this offense and was not in the car at the time harris had 
initially said he and adams were both in the car when it was stopped 
by wood 
harris said that after he testified at the 1977 trial that he 
crouched in the car as adams shot wood he was not prosecuted in his 
other pending cases and did not have to continue reporting to his 
probation officer 
a recommendation by baraka for a new trial would go to the texas 
court of criminal appeals which may act on it the hearing is 
expected to take several days 
harris is on death row for a 1986 conviction for murdering a 
beaumont man whose home he broke into in 1985

a german prince who killed himself 
after his wife died of a drug overdose was investigated for a 
cocaine deal also involving deceased film director rainer werner 
fassbinder a newspaper said wednesday 
bild a masscirculation hamburg paper also said officials in 
hanover called off another drugrelated investigation of 33yearold 
prince ludwig rudolf of hanover last week for lack of evidence 
ludwig greatgrandson of germanys last emperor kaiser wilhelm 
ii was found dead sunday in austria with his hunting rifle at his 
side 
austrian police said he killed himself after finding his wife 
princess isabelle 26 dead of a cocaine overdose earlier in the day 
in their bedroom at the luxurious koeniginvilla at gmunden 90 
miles northeast of salzburg 
bild said the couple appear to have had a long drug career 
behind them 
the daily said hanover officials last week called off for lack of 
evidence an investigation that the jetset prince had purchased 
drugs 
it said munich officials also investigated the prince in 1981 for 
a cocaine deal said to have involved fassbinder the west german 
movie director who died in munich in 1982 of a cocaine and sleeping 
pill overdose at age of 36 
he prince ludwig was suspected of buying 33 grams slightly 
more than one ounce of coke for 6725 marks just under 
3900 said the newspaper 
it said authorities suspected fassbinder of buying cocaine in the 
same deal but the investigation was dropped because of insufficient 
evidence 
heinz stocker head of the munich prosecutors office and 
officials at the hanover prosecutors office could not be reached 
for comment on the bild report a woman at stockers office who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said he was not in town 
bild quoted johann haberl the austrian doctor who performed 
autopsies on the prince and princess as saying there were about 
a dozen puncture marks in the princess arm and they had not healed 
some of them are probably no more than a week old 
prosecutors in austria said investigators found punctures on the 
arms of the prince as well 
austrian police say the case is under court investigation but 
refused to give details 
bild said ludwig and some musician friends tried to revive his 
wife for about an hour through mouthtomouth resuscitation and 
heart massage to no avail ludwig then went to a wooded area and 
shot himself it reported 
ludwig and his wife moved in the world of rock music and fashion 
and both lived for years in england 
the prince was a distant relative of queen elizabeth ii of 
britain and bild said elizabeth plans to send a representative to 
the couples funeral on friday near gmunden

the kremlin has shut down thousands of 
broadcast jamming devices allowing radio liberty and radio free 
europe to be heard loud and clear across the soviet union and 
most of eastern europe for the first time in 38 years government 
officials said wednesday 
the soviet action came so quickly that radio engineers were only 
becoming aware of it as secretary of state george shultz said in a 
broadcast to europe wednesday morning that radio jamming was one 
area where progress was still needed with the soviets 
soviet jamming of germanys deutsche wella and kol israel also 
stopped tuesday officials said 
its another marker in the soviet march toward trying to be an 
acceptable citizen of the world community as against the pariah that 
they have been said charles z wick us information agency 
director 
wick said he and other us officials have raised the issue of 
jamming which is illegal under international agreements several 
times with the soviets most recently in a september visit by us 
broadcasting officials to moscow 
he said the move was likely was timed to coincide with the 
meeting of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev with president reagan and 
presidentelect george bush next week in new york 
the jamming shutoff means that millions of eastern european and 
soviet citizens will hear american and other western news and 
analysis in their own languages of events in the soviet bloc voice 
of america which has not been jammed anywhere except in afghanistan 
since may 1987 focuses more broadly on us and world affairs voa 
operates independently of radio liberty and radio free europe 
the cessation of jamming represents a significant step on the 
part of the soviet government toward the free flow of information 
said gene pell president of radio liberty which is a 
congressionally funded operation based in munich west germany pell 
said that it was a strong signal in support of gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness 
pell said however jamming was still continuing against radio 
free europe broadcasts to czechoslovakia and bulgaria voa 
broadcasts in the dari and pashto languages into afghanistan also 
were still jammed but the broadcasts of radio afghanistan 
affiliated with radio free europe into the wartorn country were 
clear he said 
some officials suggested the limited jamming might be the result 
of a mixup between the soviets and allies who operate separate 
jamming gear 
reports from the soviet union and the baltic republics confirm 
that radio liberty and radio free europe broadcasts are being heard 
loud and clear said pell 
he cautioned however that there was no indication whether the 
lifting was a permanent decision or whether it will be expanded to 
include an absolute and irrevocable end to all jamming 
malcolm s forbes jr chairman of the board for international 
broadcasting which oversees the radio operations said the soviets 
had been giving signals that the jamming might be stopped but the 
action tuesday came as a surprise 
forbes said the action could bring significant savings to the 
soviets who officials estimate have been spending up to 125 
billion a year on jamming 
forbes said any savings for the 200 million us broadcasting 
operations would probably be erased by the need for increased 
programming to replace broadcasts that will no longer have to be 
repeated several times to get through the jamming 
the soviets have jammed voa broadcasts off and on through the 
years prior to 1987 but government engineers say jamming efforts 
against radio liberty and radio free europe have been constant since 
they were set up at the start of the 1950s radio liberty broadcasts 
by shortwave into the soviet union and radio free europe into other 
soviet bloc countries including poland czechoslovakia hungary 
romania and bulgaria in their own languages 
beth knisley voa spokeswoman said one radio liberty listener 
who talked to a voa researcher said tuesday he had picked up a 
broadcast for the first time since the 1950s she said she did not 
know where the listener lived 
stanley leinwoll engineering director for radio liberty in new 
york city said the service has managed to overcome much of the 
jamming by using higher frequencies and highpowered antennas and 
other equipment 
we have voluminous evidence that weve been heard but the fact 
is our effectiveness because of the jamming has been way down 
leinwoll said in a telephone interview 
you cant not be excited about something like this said 
leinwoll 
between 2000 and 2500 jamming devices are scattered across the 
vast soviet union with many more in eastern europe leinwoll said 
for them all to be turned off at once could not be an accident or 
technical problem he said 
leinwoll called the shutdown a momentous event but cautioned 
that they never do dismantle their devices i certainly wouldnt 
take any precipitous actions in terms of taking our antijamming 
transmitters off the air

the president of estonia the republic whose 
declaration of sovereignty was quashed told the soviet parliament 
wednesday no political system suits all parts of this vast nation 
so we have developed our own 
arnold ruutel also complained about the official media which 
criticized estonias actions without publishing details about them 
we deplore the lack of objective information in the mass media 
which can only make the situation more tense he declared 
after two days of debate a new experience for its members the 
supreme soviet sent a plan for restructuring the government back to 
the kremlin leadership for decisions on dozens of suggested 
amendments 
until recently the national legislature merely approved actions 
already taken by the leadership without debate or dissent this 
time the supreme soviet heard 37 of its members criticize and 
propose changes in the plan submitted by mikhail s gorbachev the 
president and communist party chief 
on wednesday the 1500member chamber asked the presidium and 
two committees to decide which suggestions to include in a final 
version to be submitted for a vote thursday the presidium of the 
supreme soviet is the nations highest executive body and gorbachev 
is its chairman 
tass the official news agency said the two parliamentary 
committees met wednesday night but it did not report details 
in wednesdays debate deputies said the reform plan raises trhe 
possibility that a representative could be elected to more than one 
seat in the new national congress 
gorbachev says his comprehensive reform of the political and 
electoral system which includes more than 100 pieces of 
legislation will help make the soviet union a society ruled by law 
rather than central dictation 
estonia came under repeated attack by delegates for the 
declaration by its legislature two weeks ago that the tiny baltic 
republic is sovereign in all but defense and foreign affairs and 
has the right to veto soviet laws 
the presidium responded by nullifying the declaration last 
saturday 
deputies leaned forward in their seats when ruutel took the 
podium wednesday but he neither apologized nor fought back he did 
not mention that several esetonian leaders have indicated they would 
ignore the presidium order 
he said his republic prefers its own political structure to one 
devised in moscow and told the delegates it is impossible to 
find an optimum system for all regions of the country so we have 
developed our own 
a deputy identified only as popinikov from the city of vladimir 
complained later in the day ruutel did not even give us his 
assessment of the presidium action he described estonias actions 
as antisocial and said they undermine the unity and 
principles of our multinational state 
ruutel said he appreciated some of the 88 changes in the reform 
plan announced tuesday after five weeks of discussion and expressed 
gratitude for plans to widen and defend the sovereign rights of 
republics in the next stage he also indicated however that 
estonia still is not satisfied 
estonia would prefer to retain its current legislature rather 
than exchanging it for a contemplated congress of peoples deputies 
ruutel said the new national congress and similar bodies in each 
of the 15 republics would in turn elect smaller and more active 
supreme soviets 
the new legislative framework is a central element of gorbachevs 
package but the deputies found fault with two elements of it 
indirect election of the supreme soviets and the proposal that 
onethird of the congress members be choosen by social and political 
organizations such as the communist prty and trade unions 
critics said voters should elect their supreme soviet directly 
they said the second provision creates the possibilities of the same 
person voting for both a deputy to be elected on a geographical 
basis and one from his party or union organization and of a person 
holding more than one seat in the congress 
ruutel said we should also allow each republic to decide how to 
elect its deputies but did not suggest the congress be eliminated 
on the national level

thirtyfive senators on wednesday urged george 
bush to stop the social security administration from restricting the 
rights of the elderly and disabled to appeal decisions denying them 
benefits 
in a letter to the presidentelect 34 democrats and republican 
dave durenberger of minnesota urged bush to make it clear that 
such a policy will have no place in your administration the 
letter was initiated by sen howard metzenbaum of ohio 
last year the agency received 55 million claims for social 
security medicare and welfare benefits and more than 300000 
appeals from its nobenefit rulings the government lost more than 
half of the cases that were appealed according to a draft of the 
proposal to change the rules on appeals hearings 
agency spokesman philip gambino has described the proposal as an 
attempt to improve efficiency 
but the senators letter said the astonishingly high number 
of cases won by people who were denied benefits suggests to us 
that the social security administration consistently makes 
systemwide errors in determining eligibility 
but instead of correcting its mistakes the social security 
administration is trying to make it harder for claimants to appeal 
those mistakes said the letter

the six firefighters who died in three 
blasts that rocked a highway construction site had been warned there 
could be explosives at the scene transcripts of conversations with 
dispatchers show 
but fire officials said there were no signs at the site 
indicating that the ammonium nitrate explosives were contained in 
the construction trailers that blew up tuesday 
two pumper crews were sent to the site in south kansas city after 
dispatchers were told that a pickup truck was on fire and that 
explosives might also be burning 
the call came at 340 am from someone who said the truck was 
burning harold knabe the kansas city fire department spokesman 
said wednesday that officials do not know who made that call but 
that they assume it came from two security guards at the site 
the guards told investigators they had seen prowlers in the area 
before finding the pickup burning police homicide and arson 
detectives are investigating 
as the dispatcher asked questions about the location of the fire 
another voice is heard in the background on the tape provided by the 
fire department saying oh the explosives are on fire 
when the dispatcher asked what was burning the first voice said 
theres some explosives up on a hill that i also see now is 
burning 
the dispatcher sent a pumper from fire station 41 to the scene 
with a word of warning of explosives 
capt james kilventon jr 54 headed the threeman crew that 
reached the scene at 347 am and immediately asked for another 
pumper and then for police because of suspected arson 
ten minutes later his pumper told the dispatcher to alert the 
pumper crew from fire station 30 that theres the trailer on fire 
up there stay away from it the crew also asked for a battalion 
chief and said theres supposed to be explosives involved in 
that 
at 408 am battalion chief marion germann told the dispatcher 
explosion just as we pulled up in here get us a all kinds of 
ambulances in here get us ambulances and uh at least a couple 
three more companies 
just before the blast germann said he noticed what he described 
as a glow coming from the trailer and decided to pull the crews 
back he was reaching for his radio to give the order when the 
explosion hit forcing his car back about 50 feet and breaking the 
windshield 
officials said the first explosion was in a construction trailer 
containing 30000 pounds of ammonium nitrate used most commonly as 
a fertilizer but also used in blasting after being mixed with fuel 
oil a second trailer containing about 15000 pounds of the chemical 
exploded about half an hour later and fire officials said there was 
also another much smaller explosion 
the blasts left two craters 30 to 40 feet wide and 6 to 7 feet 
deep along with a smaller one and broke windows in scores of homes 
and businesses 
fire officials reviewing the response of the two crews found no 
immediate reason to question it 
everybody is kind of monday morning quarterbacking said 
knabe but the officer in charge has to evaluate and size up the 
situation whatever they were doing apparently there was nothing 
there to indicate to him there was any type of danger 
knabe noted that kilventon and gerald c halloran 59 the other 
captain who died had more than 60 years of experience between them 
they are not going to direct their men into a place they know

the state supreme court on wednesday 
ordered the 122yearold state penitentiary in northern west viginia 
closed in less than four years and warned it may order the release 
of all prisoners there if the state does not comply 
calling conditions at the west virginia penitentiary deplorable 
the court said releasing the prisoners may be the only remaining 
alternative if a new prison is not built by july 1992 
in a unanimous opinion written by justice william brotherton the 
court did not order construction of a new maximumsecurity prison 
but recommended that the state building commission refrain from 
buying or leasing any new buildings so the state can afford to 
construct a replacement by the july 1 1992 shutdown date 
govelect gaston caperton who enters office jan 16 declined 
comment 
william whyte executive assistant to state corrections 
commissioner av dodrill said the decision puts state government 
on notice theyve given us sufficient time to get started on a 
replacement

wheeling have complained of raw sewage rats and unbearable heat and 
cold in their cells on new years day 1986 prisoners rioted and 
took 16 prison employees hostage killing three fellow inmates 
before releasing the hostages two days later 
thencircuit judge arthur recht ruled in 1981 that conditions at 
the aging prison in moundsville just south of wheeling were 
unconstitutional and the state has done little to improve the 
prison despite repeated court orders the high court said wednesday 
if possible the conditions have deteriorated even more 
wednesdays court order said 
the court scheduled a hearing may 2 for state officials to give 
their reasons why the justices should not place the prison in 
receivership give the receiver power to build a new prison and 
order the state building commission to finance the project

the united states would welcome forthcoming 
statements from soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on such issues 
as troop imbalances in europe and the berlin wall at next weeks 
superpower meeting secretary of state george p shultz said 
wednesday 
while gorbachev will hold only one session with president reagan 
and presidentelect george bush and is visiting the city primarily 
to address the united nations there will be a lot of substantive 
discussion shultz said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said meanwhile reagan 
would raise arms control human rights and the situation in 
afghanistan during the luncheon meeting on governors island in new 
york harbor 
but fitzwater said were not going there with proposals 
were not going there to solve specific problems there will be 
general discussion there will be a very limited time frame 
he said the entire process will probably take two three hours 
no longer than that 
with reagan due to leave office in six weeks hes not going to 
have promises to make fitzwater said bush not yet in office is 
unlikely to have commitments to make he said 
at the same time fitzwater said gorbachev wants to assure 
continuity and progress in dealing with this government and this 
administration and certainly that objective will be fulfilled at 
least from our objective 
the us and soviet first ladies will have lunch at a separate 
gathering he said 
meantime a spokesman for the new york stock exchange said 
gorbachev is welcome to visit that citadel of capitalism if the 
communist leaders schedule permits richard torrenzano said soviet 
officials have discussed the possibility of a visit with exchange 
officials 
in a governmentsponsored telecast to western europe shultz 
stressed the preparations were not as thorough as those that 
preceded reagans four other meetings with gorbachev mr 
gorbachev is basically not visiting the united states as much as the 
united nations he said 
however shultz said he hoped gorbachev makes a lot of 
forthcoming statements in the meeting as examples he said the 
soviet president could propose reducing the numerical edge warsaw 
pact troops have over north atlantic treaty organization forces in 
europe or make a gesture such as saying he would tear down the 
berlin wall 
anything like that would be very welcome shultz said 
immediately after the meeting shultz will fly to brussels to 
brief the nato foreign ministers while reagan will return to 
washington and make a speech that evening to the american enterprise 
institute a conservativeoriented think tank 
the meeting will be held after gorbachev addresses the un

the soviet leaders visit and is expected to range over several 
subjects including the suspended soviet troop withdrawal from 
afghanistan the us side is seeking reassurances the soviets will 
complete the pullout by feb 15 as they have promised 
fitzwater described the agenda as very flexible 
he said marcella perez de cuellar wife of united nations general 
secretary javier perez de cuellar would hold a luncheon in new york 
on wednesday for first lady nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev wife 
of the soviet leader in connection with the meeting of their

nasas tools and equipment may be the 
most sophisticated money can buy but some of the problems on 
atlantis were strictly mundane a leaky tire and broken bolts 
one of the shuttles 2794 landing gear tires started leaking 
while on the launch pad and on wednesday technicans found two 
broken bolts on a critical panel cover 
officials decided they could ignore the tire problem but decided 
to fix the faulty bolts with every craftsmans best friend epoxy 
glue 
launch pad technicians found the broken bolts when they attempted 
to replace a cover protecting an access panel on the nose of 
atlantis the access panel contains the connections used to fill 
fuel tanks in the shuttles forward steering rockets 
the panel cover fits on ten bolts that are anchored in the hull 
of the spacecraft nuts are then tighted on the bolts to hold the 
cover tightly in place 
but when the technicians attempted to install two of the nuts 
they found that the bolts were loose and the nuts would not tighten 
the experts immediately reached for the glue said dave 
winterhalter a nasa engineer 
an attempt to glue the faulty bolts in place failed but the 
technicans hoped a generous application of epoxy bonding on the 
cover itself would hold it in place if the glue did not work 
engineers said it might force the space agency to delay the launch 
by one or two days while new bolts were installed 
henry pohl a nasa engineering official said it was no surprise 
that there was a leak in one of the six tires used in the shuttle 
landing system 
all tires leak said pohl it just that this one leaks more 
than the others in the past 
the tire on the right main landing gear was losing pressure at 
the rate of 17 pounds per square inch daily it normally holds 330 
pounds of pressure but can be used if the pressure drops to as low 
as 275 pounds he said 
if atlantis is launched within two weeks said pohl the leaky 
tire would not create a problem 
should the leak continue for longer nasas equivalent of a trip 
to the corner service station could cost millions of dollars in lost 
time and effort 
pohl said that to repressurize the shuttle tire technicians 
would have to remove atlantis from the launch pad and then unload 
its solid rockets and external fuel tank a project that could take 
weeks 
a set of tires on the shuttle costs 16764 and are the best 
that the tire industry can build said pohl but the tires take 
such a beating when the shuttle lands from orbit that they are used 
only once

confessed twa hijacker mohammed 
ali hamadi said wednesday that his accomplice shot and killed a us 
navy diver aboard the plane because he was afraid the jetliner was 
going to be attacked 
hamadi was commenting on testimony by copilot philip g maresca 
who earlier told the court hamadi came into the cockpit carrying a 
gun seconds after 23yearold sailor robert stethem was killed 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is being tried on murder and 
air piracy charges in the june 1985 hijacking during which 39 
americans were held hostage for 17 days 
he has admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied killing 
stethem 
the defendant disputed most of marescas testimony and again 
blamed his accomplice hassan ezzeddine for killing stethem 
ezzeddine is a fugitive 
hamadi said armed men surrounded the plane in beirut he said 
ezzeddine fired two warning shots from the cockpit window as they 
tried to approach 
he said ezzeddine earlier had told the tower he wanted to speak 
to a certain person and became very agitated when that 
individual did not show up 
he came back and took stethem i spoke with him about it but 
he was determined that one of the military people had to be shot he 
was afraid of an attack on the plane hamadi said 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger asked who was it that ezzeddine 
wanted to speak to and hamadi replied he was the one responsible 
for the hijacking and he was from amal the shiites main military 
arm in lebanon 
the judge asked if he was willing to identify the person and 
hamadi replied no not at this moment 
hamadi denied going into the cockpit after stethem was shot 
maresca told the court i stand by my testimony 
the judge then adjourned the trial until monday 
maresca testified regarding the circumstances of stethems 
shooting 
i was able to peek out of the corner of my eye and i thought i 
was able to determine that a passenger was being dragged to the 
front of the plane 
then i heard a gunshot about 10 to 15 seconds later 
hamadi came into the cockpit with a gun in his hand 
then uli derickson the flight purser came in very distressed 
and said one of the passengers had been killed 
he fought back tears as he described the scene 
the divers parents richard and patricia stethem listened 
quietly during the testimony they have attended the trial regularly 
since it began on july 5 
maresca 46 said he did not see the shooting because hamadi 
ordered the crew to look forward and not behind and not to pay 
attention to any noise 
the copilot said the hijackers beat the crew every time they 
tried to establish radio contact with other aircraft or with 
airports 
maresca said he felt from hamedis actions that hamadi was the 
leader of the two hijackers 
he was more volatile very excitable the other hijacker tried 
to restrain hamadi when he was extremely abusive hamadi had the gun 
most of the time and he made most of the demands on us maresca 
said 
the judge granted a defense motion for a psychiatric examination 
the defense says hamadi was mentally disturbed at the time of the 
hijacking 
hamadi was arrested jan 13 1987 at frankfurt airport after 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage

the drug enforcement administration said 
wednesday it plans no change in procedures under which it sometimes 
arranges for local police officers to claim public credit for busts 
of drug shipments that are brought into the united states by dea 
undercover operatives 
the practice has raised objections from some news media 
executives who say it is misleading for state and local police to 
generate news stories on seizures of imported drugs that already are 
under dea control 
the controversy stems from an article sunday in the houston 
chronicle which said the dea had arranged drug seizures to generate 
false news reports that undercover agents could use in deceiving 
druglords 
it is reasonable for state and local police involved in such 
cases to turn aside inquiries from the news media about the precise 
details of how the busts came about said william alden chief of 
congressional and public affairs for the dea 
alden said details come out in subsequent court proceedings and 
that the news media and the public are not misled 
what weve done we feel comfortable with said alden 
the dea defended its actions in a meeting wednesday with 
associate attorney general francis keating who then issued a 
statement supportive of the dea 
i have been assured that it is not the policy of dea to lie or 
mislead the media nor is it dea policy to misrepresent information 
to the media or the public in any fashion said keating i am 
satisfied that this is a wise policy which continues to be carefully 
followed 
when dea undercover operatives are acting as middlemen for south 
american traffickers the dea on occasion arranges for local law 
enforcement authorities to seize incoming drug shipments in an 
attempt to protect the operatives from disclosure agency sources 
acknowledged speaking on condition of anonymity the practice is 
designed to keep the drugs from reaching local dealers while 
allowing the dea to continue criminal investigations targeting 
toplevel drug figures they said

the environmental protection agency on 
wednesday unveiled draft regulations aimed at bringing stormwater 
runoff under control something that will require thousands of 
industrial plants and scores of cities to apply for permits to 
operate storm sewer systems 
the regulations will not apply to the combined sanitarystorm 
sewers commonly found in older eastern cities nor to plants whose 
storm sewers discharge into a municipally owned system 
the draft would exempt systems run by counties or other 
nonmunicipal bodies the exemption was called illegal by the 
natural resources defense council 
stormwater runoff can be a major source of stream pollution in 
urban areas picking up oil from service station pavements dirt 
from construction sites pesticides and fertilizers from lawns and 
gardens contamination leaking out of landfills and other forms of 
pollution twentyone states have reported construction site runoff 
as a major source of pollution 
epas draft regulations ordered by 1987 legislation and 
published for 90 days of public comment require the nations 170 
cities of more than 100000 people to get permits for their storm 
sewer outflows officials said they did not know how many might not 
qualify because the storm and sanitary sewers are combined 
in addition some 25000 industrial facilities might have to 
apply for permits said james elder director of epas office of 
water enforcement and permits he said 75000 to 100000 probably 
are connected to municipal systems and these though not needing 
permits will be required to inform the municipalities how they are 
handling storm runoff 
cities below 100000 population will not be brought under 
regulation until after 1992 elder said cities larger than 250000 
will have two years after publication of final regulations to 
complete their permit applications cities between 100000 and 
250000 will have until february 1992 
final regulations might not be published until next february 
which would be a year after the congressional deadline elder said 
smaller cities as in suburbs with storm sewer systems that 
connect with those of larger cities may be required to get permits 
at the discretion of the regional epa director or state authorities 
in the 38 states with authority to run their own water pollution 
control programs 
the agency intends to avoid numerical concentration standards 
relying on requirements for good management of runoff 
municipalities are being asked to almost write their own permits in 
their applications elder said 
the agency will require discovery and elimination of illicit 
connections where sanitary sewers have been connected to storm 
sewers 
plants required to get permits are those with not necessarily a 
complete storm sewer system but just any point source used for 
collecting and conveying runoff 
the agency will encourage general permits for construction 
companies that would not be tied to specific sites and will try to 
grant group permits to plants that can show they are similar he 
said 
the agency asked for specific comment on its plans to ignore 
countyrun systems for the moment an exemption that bruce bowen an 
aide to epa administrator lee m thomas said was made in the 
interests of administrative feasibility we want to make sure we 
dont bite off more than we can chew 
bob adler a lawyer for the natural resources defense council 
said 410 counties were large enough to be covered by the rule and 
their inclusion would mean storm sewers serving 66 percent of the 
population would be covered instead of just 25 percent 
adler said the omission of counties was deliberately flouting 
congress instructions and the omission of specific control or 
treatment requirements meant an institutionalization of the 
foxinthehenhouse approach to pollution control 
but he said the plan was not all bad and applauded epas 
emphasis on the elimination of illicit connections

a financial officer for political 
extremist lyndon h larouche jr testified wednesday he wrote 
larouche in 1984 that he suspected that former secretary of state 
henry kissinger was responsible for some of the movements money 
problems 
richard welsh told larouches conspiracy trial that he suspected 
kissingers involvement after obtaining a copy of a letter kissinger 
wrote to the fbi soliciting advice about his own security from the 
larouche organization 
larouche and six codefendants contend that government harassment 
impeded their fundraising capabilities and is at the root of a 
failure to pay back the bulk of more than 30 million in loans to 
larouche organizations 
larouche and the six associates are charged with conspiring to 
defraud those who lent the movement money by devising a scheme to 
avoid repayment 
the kissinger letter to the fbi was obtained by the larouche 
movement under the freedom of information act and admitted into 
evidence at the us district court trial dated aug 19 1982 and 
addressed to former fbi director william webster kissinger wrote 
i appreciated your letter forwarding the flier which has been 
circulated by lyndon h larouche jr 
because these people have been getting increasingly obnoxious 
i have taken the liberty of asking my lawyer bill rogers to get in 
touch with you to ask your advice especially with respect to 
security 
welsh testified that he sent a memo to larouche in october 1984 
in the midst of larouches second of three presidential campaigns 
you stated in the memo that kissinger was behind the actions 
to hurt the larouche organization financially asked assistant us 
attorney kent robinson 
it was the primary but not the only suggestion i made welsh 
testified 
welsh however did not specify how he thought that kissinger 
long a target of verbal assaults by larouche could have created 
financial problems for the movement by privately expressing concern 
for his security 
welsh also testified that a tax lawyer advised him and other 
larouche staffers to file federal tax returns even though it was not 
clear that the law required larouche to do so 
welsh said he met with the tax lawyer to see whether larouche was 
obligated to file returns even if he had no income and all his 
expenses were paid for by organizations that were part of his 
political movement 
welsh told the jury he was told that the assistance to larouche 
should be treated as ordinary business expenses by the companies 
and not as larouches personal income 
larouche alone is charged in the case with conspiring to defraud 
the internal revenue service by not declaring the personal and 
household expenses he received as income and by not filing federal 
income tax returns since 1979 
welsh said the tax lawyer recommended that a tax return be 
filed not because it was required but because larouche was a 
controversial public figure 
in an effort to convince the jury that money spent for larouches 
security was actually used for his personal expenses the 
prosecution called to the stand kathy magraw a larouche financial 
staffer who testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution 
she acknowledged under prosecution questioning that the security 
account paid for a 7000 piano cufflinks for larouche shoes for 
his wife helga clothing luggage a 10 haircut for larouche and 
reimbursement for a purchase of wine 
ms magraw said the account also paid expenses for guests who 
stayed at larouches leesburg va estate 
seeking to rebut the argument that the money was used improperly 
larouche attorney william moffitt attempted to question ms magraw 
about security expenses for two latin american members of larouches 
organization whose lives had been threatened by drug dealers 
however us district judge albert v bryan jr refused to allow 
the defense to delve into the latin american figures backgrounds 
thus scuttling efforts to show there were legitimate expenses in the 
security account that were not for larouches personal benefit 
larouche was indicted in october on 13 counts of mail fraud 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the irs 
the mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of 
credit sent through the mails by the larouche organization 
conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years 
in prison and fines of 325 million for larouche 
the six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail 
fraud and conspiracy charges which cover the years 1983 to 1987 
in the tax conspiracy count the federal grand jury charged that 
larouche failed to declare as income the personal and household 
services provided by his organizations 
on trial with larouche are his chief fundraiser william wertz 
his legal adviser edward spannaus and four fundraisers michael 
billington dennis small paul greenberg and joyce rubinstein

the government presented a bill wednesday to ease 
britains secrecy laws but critics from the opposition media and 
activist groups said it would leave the nation still the most 
secretive of western democracies 
the bill if made law would decriminalize minor leaks and make 
some prosecutions more difficult 
critics have said a major flaw in the bill is that it does not 
allow officials who leak information about questionable government 
conduct commonly known as whistleblowers to argue as a defense 
that they acted in the public interest or that the information has 
already been published elsewhere 
the bill also provides no automatic right of access to official 
information mrs thatcher has ruled out a freedom of information 
act like that of the united states 
to claim this as a major advance toward ending secrecy in 
government is nonsense maurice frankel director of the campaign 
for freedom of information said in an interview 
britain will remain extremely secretive and much worse off than 
the major englishspeaking countries with which we compare 
ourselves the united states canada australia and new zealand 
the opposition labor party maintained wednesday that the proposed 
measure will give the conservative government of prime minister 
margaret thatcher increased powers to withhold and conceal 
information it might find politically embarrassing 
the bill based on muchcriticized proposals published last june 
confines secrecy mainly to defense security and foreign affairs 
in a change from the june proposals only leaking or publishing 
information about bugging telephone tapping and mail interception 
by the secret security services would be an automatic offense in 
cases of other unauthorized disclosures by journalists or civil 
servants prosecutors would have to prove these harmed the national 
interest 
but a lifetime gag remains on members of the mi5 
counterintelligence agency and mi6 intelligence agency and their 
unauthorized memoirs 
in the most notable recent case the government lost a threeyear 
battle this year to ban publication of spycatcher the memoirs 
of exmi5 agent peter wright who lives in australia 
the bill likely to become law by next summer will amend a 
section of the official secrets act making it a criminal offense to 
reveal any official information however trivial without 
authorization 
the act passed hastily in 1911 during a german spy scare has 
bolstered britains reputation for secrecy particularly since mrs 
thatcher won power in 1979 
the bill is a notable essay in openness secretary douglas 
hurd said in a statement as the measure was proposed wednesday in 
the house of commons we want to narrow drastically the scope of 
official information covered by the law 
the draft measure stipulates penalties of up to two years in jail 
for people convicted of unauthorized disclosures 
however the national council of civil liberties said the lack of 
a defense arguing that information was released in the public 
interest means journalists could be jailed for disclosing 
information in order to expose fraud negligence or unlawful 
activities 
in 1985 a jury acquitted civil servant clive ponting on grounds 
that his exposure of a government coverup surrounding the sinking 
of an argentine cruiser in the 1982 falkland islands war was in the 
public interest critics say ponting would likely be convicted under 
the new bill 
michael corner spokesman for the guild of british newspaper 
editors said the bill was seriously flawed as far as freeing 
information is concerned and as far as the press is concerned in 
carrying out its proper function

a man who sued the heavymetal rock group judas 
priest contending its music drove him to a 1985 suicide attempt 
has died after lapsing into an unexplained coma 
the judas priest lawsuit is going forward we are not daunted 
one bit as a matter of fact its more important than ever 
attorney timothy post said wednesday 
james vance 23 was pronounced dead at 1048 pm tuesday at 
washoe medical center where he had been in a coma since 
thanksgiving day said spokesman david stipech 
vance had been on a life support system since he lapsed into a 
coma he was disconnected from the respirator after he was declared 
brain dead 
vance and his parents sued judas priest and cbs records alleging 
that subliminal messages in the british groups music caused vance 
and raymond belknap 19 to make a suicide pact after listening to 
the stained class album for six hours while smoking marijuana 
and drinking beer 
the two took a shotgun to a church playground in nearby sparks 
two days before christmas 1985 and shot themselves in the head 
belknap died instantly and vance was disfigured after shooting away 
part of his face 
the lawsuit which was filed by both families is pending in 
washoe district court 
judge jerry whitehead has ordered cbs to produce the 24track 
master tape of the stained class album but so far the 
defendants have found the master for every track but a song called 
better by you better than me 
prosecution attorneys contend that song contains the hidden 
message do it do it and claim those words along with other 
references to death and suicide pushed the young men into their pact 
without evidence of subliminal messages whitehead said the case 
would not go to trial since music and lyrics are protected by the 
first amendment 
if subliminal messages do exist within the stained class 
album whitehead said the trial would concentrate on whether such 
hidden communication deserves the same first amendment protection 
vance was admitted to the hospitals psychiatric ward nov 15 for 
treatment of depression and was scheduled to be released last 
thursday the day he went into a coma 
an autopsy was pending

by a member of the soviet delegation during an altercation earlier

a transit authority bus driver who was denied 
restricted duty during her pregnancy and later miscarried has been 
awarded 450000 for mental anguish the state division of human 
rights announced wednesday 
human rights commissioner douglas white called the case the 
most shocking instance of abuse of an employee by an employer in 
recent memory accordingly he said the award was a record high for 
mental anguish 
the authoritys disability policy violated state law by treating 
pregnant women differently than people with other temporarily 
disabling conditions the state found 
authority spokesman bob slovak said the pregnancy policy in 
question was rescinded years ago the authority has filed an appeal 
in state supreme court claiming insufficient evidence of 
discrimination and that the award was excessive 
bus driver adrienne nash of staten island learned that she was 
pregnant in june 1981 and her doctor advised her not to continue 
driving a bus because of her previous history of miscarriage 
nash was placed on light duty after an examination by an 
authority doctor but after a week the same doctor reversed himself 
and ordered nash back to full duty status she was returned to her 
regular bus route without explanation or another examination 
nash felt she could not be without a paycheck for seven months 
and she acceded to the transit authoritys cruel choice white 
said 
nash drove a bus for nine days before she suffered a miscarriage 
on july 16 1981 she then went on sick leave with pay for one week 
and was placed on leave without pay for about two months 
white said authority regulations in effect at the time required 
that all pregnant employees take a leave of absence without pay for 
a minimum of one year while disabled men were routinely place on 
reduced duty with pay 
by its unlawfully discriminatory acts respondent the 
authority created a situation leading complainant nash to have to 
live with the thought that her fetus was destroyed because she was a 
pregnant worker for an employer who would not deign to grant what 
the human rights law provided and required administrative law 
judge matthew foner said in his opinion which was adopted by the 
division of human rights 
nashs decision to continue working most likely will continue 
to cause her feelings of guilt feelings of resentment and other 
mental anguish about her lost child to the end of her days the 
judge wrote 
upon her return to work after her miscarriage the authority 
found her psychologically unfit to drive a bus a status that 
prevailed for about nine days the judge found that this action was 
taken by the authority in retaliation for nashs filing of a 
complaint with the division of human rights according to her 
attorney kenneth gordon 
nash subsequently learned she was pregnant again in december 1981 
and again asked for restricted duty and was again denied on the 
recommendation of the authority doctor she was forced to take an 
unpaid leave of absence until after her due date she gave birth to 
a daughter on aug 21 1982 
the award includes back pay with interest for her unpaid leave 
during her fullterm pregnancy but not for the two months she was 
out after her miscarriage

state supreme court on wednesday turned down the congressmans 
request to void a countys votes 
we are delighted we had a victory for the people of the 4th 
district james said adding he had 11 lawyers research state law 
for the court challenge to attempt to disenfranchise the voters 
of the 4th district is tantamount to being unamerican 
the states election canvassing commission consisting of gov 
bob martinez secretary of state jim smith both republicans and 
commissioner of agriculture doyle connor a democrat certified the 
results last week

the labor partys ruling body defied its 
two principal leaders wednesday in a narrow decision against 
negotiating with the rival conservative likud bloc on a possible 
coalition government 
the 6157 vote in a closed meeting of labors executive bureau 
went against the wishes of foreign minister shimon peres and defense 
minister yitzhak rabin a former prime minister party spokesmen 
said one member abstained 
israel radio reported late wednesday that likud and the 
rightwing shas party a small orthodox group had signed a 
coalition agreement giving shas two cabinet posts 
likud won 40 of the 120 parliament seats in the nov 1 election 
and labor got 39 orthodox religious parties have 18 including six 
held by shas and prime minister yitzhak shamir the likud leader 
has been holding coalition talks with them 
in his proposal to labor shamir had offered two of the four most 
powerful cabinet jobs defense and either foreign or finance 
shamir said in a statement im sorry that we have lost an 
opportunity to form a broad government as was the wish of the 
majority of the people within the next few days i will present to 
the knesset parliament a government that will serve well the 
people and the country 
labor and likud have been equal partners in a national unity 
coalition since the inconclusive election of july 1984 peres was 
prime minister and shamir foreign minister during the first two 
years then they switched jobs 
the labor decision leaves shamir the task of making coalition 
deals with farright and ultraorthodox parties 
his offer to labor of a junior coalition partnership came after 
talks with fundamentalist parties bogged down over their demands for 
cabinet posts and a who is a jew law under which only 
conversions to judaism by orthdox rabbis would be accepted 
american jews more often affiliated with the conservative or 
reform movements oppose such a law 
at the labor meeting rabin said it is a serious mistake not to 
enter negotiations party spokeswoman michal cohen said 
many in the party contended however that labor would have to 
give up its principles to join a likud government 
the current coalition was paralyzed on an approach to peace with 
the arabs because of conflicts between the hardline likud and 
labor which took a more dovish approach 
peres and rabin left immediately after the vote but other 
laborites received the results with loud applause kissing and 
hugging each other and shouting we did it we did it israel 
radio said 
the radio described the vote as a revolutionary situation of 
a younger opposition voting against the old party leadership of 
peres and rabin who got their faces slapped

a boeing aerodynamics expert testified 
wednesday that delta flight 1141 which crashed aug 31 after 
takeoff had reached sufficient speed to fly even without its wing 
flaps in the proper position 
ronald j halvarson a supervisor in aerodynamics technology 
told a national transportation safety board public hearing that 
boeing recently ran tests that showed the plane could easily have 
become airborne even with a flap configuration that a pilots union 
contends may have caused the crash 
even in the flaps up position the airplane could have been 
flyable in my opinion halvarson said 
paul mccarthy a lawyer heading the air line pilots association 
delegation criticized halvarsons test criteria as insufficient and 
said before you hang these pilots give us a chance to review 
this data 
the plane crashed aug 31 at dallasfort worth international 
airport killing 14 of the 108 people on board survivors included 
the threeman crew 
the position of flight 1141s wing flaps has become a central 
issue in the ntsb inquiry which will seek information but draw no 
conclusions for at least half a year 
the flaps located on the trailing edge of the wings to provide 
extra lift during the slow speeds of takeoff or landing were found 
in a retracted position after the broken plane slid to a stop about 
3000 feet past the end of the runway 
the position of the handle that sets the flaps was at odds with 
the position in which the flaps were found pilots union officials 
have suggested the crew properly set the flap handle but that the 
plane crashed just as the flaps were beginning to move into position 
during halvarsons appearance before the board a delta attorney 
interjected that some of the planes takeoff data was estimated but 
halvarson said i believe theyre close to being correct 
attorney mccarthy said he had not been informed that boeing had 
compiled results of flap configurations from wind tunnel tests to 
see if flight would be possible under conditions similar to those 
affecting flight 1141 
halvarson said results indicate at least two of the planes three 
engines were flying 
mccarthy said halvarsons tests had considered the planes 
thrust weight and lift but had ignored a fourth flight variable 
drag 
the first officer on the flight carey w kirkland told the 
panel tuesday that it was his responsibility to put the flaps into a 
proper angle for takeoff and that everything had progressed normally 
im convinced i did lower the flaps that day said kirkland 
who explained he was allowed to choose when they would be lowered as 
soon as the plane had started two engines and pushed away from the 
gate 
but kirkland also said i dont remember much about takeoff and 
the subsequent crash

the trial of the socalled night stalker 
defendant officially began four months ago but not a single juror 
has been seated as the notorious case stretches into its fourth year 
attorneys in the richard ramirez case finished asking questions 
wednesday in the second of three phases of jury selection an 
intensive inquiry into the views of prospective jurors about the 
death penalty 
i believe that does it said superior court judge michael 
tynan as he concluded an interview of the last prospective juror to 
be quizzed 
during wednesdays session one woman was excused after she said 
the case was giving her nightmares and threatening her health 
another woman was allowed to remain although she said she had 
consulted with her minister on the troubling question of whether she 
could vote for the death penalty if necessary she said she decided 
she could 
the judge recessed the trial until dec 12 when the third phase 
of jury questioning begins 
testimony about the killings that spread fear throughout los 
angeles in the summer of 1985 is still months away 
in los angeles and across the country witnesses wait for a call 
from deputy district attorney p philip halpin telling them it is 
time to recount their ghastly tales of horror 
many of their accounts were first told two years ago at a 
preliminary hearing for ramirez 28 who is from el paso texas a 
judge who heard that testimony about rape murder and in one case 
the gouging out of a victims eyes ordered ramirez to stand trial 
ramirez who is said to have dabbled in satanism and once 
shouted hail satan in court faces 13 counts of murder in the 
string of nighttime attacks he also is charged with 30 other 
felonies including rape robbery and attempted murder 
the shaggyhaired drifter linked to the crimes through items 
stolen from victims homes was captured and beaten by angry 
residents of an east los angeles neighborhood as he tried to steal a 
car on aug 31 1985 
if jurors convict him of even one murder and special circumstance 
allegation they must then decide whether to impose the death 
penalty or sentence him to life in prison without parole 
in spite of the painstaking jury selection ramirez lawyer 
daniel hernandez insists publicity has made it impossible for his 
client to receive a fair trial 
weve seen some very fine people come through here hernandez 
said these jurors have made a commitment to be as fair and 
impartial as they can be but its an impossible position to put 
them in 
he said many prospective jurors lived in fear when the night 
stalker crimes were going on 
because of the publicity saturation and the fear and terror 
they would be unable to be fair he said 
halpin disagrees 
we have been in a process of jury selection since july 21 
1988 and that process has validated our belief that los angeles 
with its large and diverse population does afford the defendant a 
forum in which he can get a fair trial said halpin 
so far more than 1500 people have been summoned to the 
courtroom of superior court judge michael tynan hundreds were 
excused because they could not afford to spend an estimated two 
years in court more were dismissed because they believed ramirez 
was guilty of the night stalker slayings 
in the latest phase about 150 prospects were turned away because 
of unalterable views for or against the death penalty 
on dec 12 some 145 jury finalists will return for further 
questioning on more general subjects from that pool 12 jurors and 
12 alternates will be chosen tynan hopes to seat a jury by 
midjanuary

a scientist who lived for 111 days in an underground 
cave emerged from her neartotal isolation tuesday and said she had 
become attached to her damp surroundings and even had talked to the 
stalactites 
at last smells vegetation and brouhaha veronique le guen 
32 said excitedly when she walked from a cave in laven du 
valatnegre in the aveyron region of southern france to end the 
experiment into how isolation affects the body 
photographers television crews and relatives were on hand to 
greet mrs le guen who had been cut off from the outside world 
since aug 10 in her campsite 275 feet underground where the eerie 
silence was broken only by the sounds of dripping water and the 
beating of her heart 
pale and wearing special sunglasses she had to be helped to a 
waiting car that took her to a hospital for medical tests 
before surfacing i talked to the cave i listened for the last 
time to the sounds of the water dripping off the stalactites she 
said mixed with the joy of being reunited with my family was a 
poignant sadness at leaving this cave which id become attached to 
after all 
the purpose of the experiment was to see how the human body 
responds when it is deprived of light and cut off from the natural 
cycles of day and night 
mrs le guen was wired with electrodes that sent signals to 
scientists above ground indicating her sleep cycles and following 
the temperature curve of each breast the data will help medical 
researchers in strasbourg studying tumor detection based on changing 
breast temperatures 
she also collected urine and saliva samples that charted her 
bodys chemical reactions to caffeine 
mrs le guens only contact with the outside world was through 
telephone calls from project head michel siffre but she said they 
hurt more than they helped 
the calls put into my ears the sounds of people living without 
me in the free air i missed that and felt bad about it she said 
mrs le guen lived in a large tent equipped with electricity 
three freezers and a stove on which she cooked all her meals her 
diet was normal only chocolate and alchohol were forbidden because 
they interfered with her metabolization of caffeine 
the tent was at the back of a long passage way leading to the 
caves entrance giving her about 100 yards in which she could 
exercise 
although she had neither watch nor clock she said she had the 
feeling that time was passing quickly she thought she had been in 
the cave for only 42 days and nights not 111 
christian vasseur a computer scientist analyzing data from the 
project said mrs le guen had days that lasted 40 hours 
followed by 38 hours of uninterrupted sleep 
in the beginning i thought i would spend most of my time 
thinking about metaphysical questions mrs le guen said but 
when youre alone down there you only think about taking care of 
yourself i cooked i washed dishes i read and i wrote a lot 
her fondest memory she said was reading gabriel garcia 
marquezs one hundred years of solitude while the hardest part 
of her daily routine was tending to scientific matters 
at the end i couldnt stand it not to be able to urinate in 
peace to have to prick my fingers to take blood samples to spit 
and collect my saliva to hook up the electrodes before sleeping 
and ill skip the details much worse she said 
president francois mitterrand sent a telegram congratulating mrs 
le guen for completing a great scientific adventure and for her 
remarkable personal commitment

the justice department announced wednesday it 
plans to return five mariel cuban detainees to their island homeland 
on thursday resuming a repatriation program that began in 1984 
the five being held at the federal correctional institution in 
talladega ala were among the 125000 cubans who came to the 
united states in the 1980 mariel boatlift 
lawyers for three of the five on wednesday night were seeking a 
stay from the supreme court to block their return to cuba one of 
their attorneys gary leshaw of atlanta said in an interview 
leshaw said he anticipated a decision by the court on thursday 
morning on whether to issue an emergency stay involving the three 
the five were to be sent by bus thursday from talladega to 
birmingham ala where they were to be flown to an airport near 
havana cuba at midafternoon thursday said deborah burstionwade 
a justice department spokeswoman 
some 50 people were to be aboard the plane a us marshals 
service aircraft departing from the alabama air national guard area 
of the airport at birmingham she said the party was to include 
deputy us marshals immigration and bureau of prisons officials 
cuba had suspended the repatriation program in 1985 after taking 
back 201 people 
cuba had agreed to accept a total of 2746 mariel cubans 
the five were to be flown to cuba after a threemember panel of 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals denied their request for an 
emergency stay of a us district court opinion permitting their 
return 
the five had gone to the federal courts after justice department 
review panels said they should be repatriated 
the panels were established in the aftermath of riots by cuban 
detainees in atlanta and oakdale la a year ago which were 
triggered by plans to resume deportation of the prisoners to cuba 
so far the panels have decided that 15 detainees should be 
repatriated to cuba and the five to be returned thursday are among 
those 15 
the three who are seeking a supreme court stay are 
miguel beitiasocarraz 28 who pleaded guilty to a charge of 
seconddegree burglary for robbing a commercial establishment one 
prison evaluation stated he was very prisonhardened and streetwise 
onel calzadogarlobo 43 convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual 
assault charges involving a 13yearold girl 
rene maurinoliva 25 who pleaded guilty to theft and battery 
and whose mental health evaluations suggest he suffers from 
borderline personality disorders 
on tuesday us district judge uw clemon in birmingham ala 
rejected appeals from beitiasocarraz calzadogarlobo and maurin 
oliva clemon turned aside arguments that the three had been denied 
hearings on their claims to political asylum in the united states 
leshaw is seeking an emergency stay in a separate case in which 
he argues that the cuban detainees have a right to appeal to federal 
court the justice department review panels decisions on 
repatriation that right says leshaw comes under the 
administrative procedure act 
the other two facing repatriation thursday about whom no details 
were immediately available are hector hernandezquesada and angel

two harvard university computer experts 
appeared wednesday before a federal grand jury that is investigating 
the origin of a computer virus that jammed a nationwide network of 
computers 
the investigation is focused on cornell university graduate 
student robert morris jr 23 of washington dc who authorities 
believe created the virus 
the virus program transmitted copies of itself from computer to 
computer cramming an estimated 6000 computers nationwide it 
caused at least 97 million in damage because of interrupted work 
on computers that had to be shut down and in the work needed to 
resuscitate the computers according to the computer virus industry 
association 
fbi agents in massachusetts last week subpoenaed three people at 
harvard where morris was a computer science undergraduate until 
june 
two of them graduate student paul graham and computer programmer 
andrew h suddeth appeared wednesday afternoon before the grand 
jury 
suddeth has said that morris called him in a panic to get help in 
getting out a message to other computer operators after he realized 
what the virus was doing 
suddeth on tuesday said he wanted to stop commenting publicly 
until he had appeared before the grand jury 
the third person subpoenaed mark friedell an associate 
professor of computer science at harvard was excused from 
testifying he said he told prosecutors he knew nothing of morris 
alleged involvement with the virus 
friedell was an adviser to morris when morris researched and 
wrote an undergraduate thesis about computers 
a week ago federal agents seized computer tapes from files 
morris had at harvard the files which are accessible to computers 
located off the harvard campus were created and edited a week 
before the virus clogged the network 
on nov 10 fbi agents in ithaca executed two other search 
warrants at cornell seizing computer tapes and notes that agents 
believe are linked to the creation of the virus 
morris lawyer thomas guidoboni of washington told the 
newspaper that morris has not been subpoenaed to appear before the 
grand jury in syracuse 
guidoboni so far has advised morris not to talk with anyone about 
the virus including fbi agents however the lawyer said an 
agreement may soon be reached in which an interview with agents 
would be arranged 
guidoboni said he was uncertain where morris would be interviewed 
i think the fbi would like to talk with him guidoboni said 
but im not aware specifically what theyd like to talk to him

million that was stolen from a museum was recovered wednesday in new

upset was not regretful enough to turn himself in said suffolk 
county police detective sgt gene gross who took two calls from the

a jet fighters gun fired by mistake 
wednesday setting six planes ablaze on the uss nimitz flight deck 
and killing a sailor but crews averted disaster by dousing the 
flames quickly us officials said 
a second crewman was severely burned in the fire which was 
brought under control in about 20 minutes navy spokesmen reported 
they said a cannon on an a7 corsair was fired accidentally during 
troubleshooting maintenance aboard the carrier in the arabian 
sea 
the 20mm shell exploded against another parked plane starting a 
fire that eventually spread to six aircraft a6 intruders and a7s 
that suffered minor to major damage according to the reports 
one of the damaged aircraft was a ka6 intruder tanker fitted 
for airtoair refueling but the officials said they did not know 
whether it was the one hit by the shell 
a7 fighterbombers are among the navys older combat planes and 
carry two 20mm guns 
navy spokesmen said the accident early wednesday would not affect 
operations of the nuclearpowered carrier which arrived oct 29 
leading an eightship battle group assigned to support us naval 
units in the persian gulf 
the 90944ton nimitz was launched in 1975 as the first in the 
navys newest class of supercarriers it caries about 6000 men 
including pilots and aircraft maintenance personnel and its home 
port is bremerton wash 
wednesdays accident evoked memories of the worst carrier flight 
deck disaster since world war ii a fire on the uss forrestal off 
indochina in 1967 
that fire was started by a missile mistakenly launched by a plane 
preparing for a bombing raid on north vietnam it killed 134 
sailors injured 64 and destroyed dozens of planes in an inferno of 
burning fuel and exploding ammunition 
it was the nimitzs second fatal accident on may 25 1981 a 
marine corps jet crashed on its flight deck during operations off 
florida killing 14 men 
officials said fire control teams may have prevented another 
calamity wednesday by containing the blaze quickly 
many of the carriers more than 80 aircraft were parked on the 
flight deck when the cannon fired at 250 am 750 pm est 
tuesday officials said 
from all indications its clear that the quick action was 
responsible for avoiding a much worse situation even a disaster 
one officer said on condition his name not be used 
there have been some bad fires on carriers and weve all heard 
the old navy saying that working on a carrier flight deck is 
probably the worlds first or second most dangerous occupation 
another officer said also privately when youve got all that 
ammunition fuel and so on it can turn real ugly in no time 
petty officer joe bartlett a spokesman for the navys joint task 
force middle east said an investigation was being conducted 
he said the injured seaman was taken to a us military hospital 
in west germany sources said the sailor had burns on 70 percent of 
his body 
in washington navy officials identified the dead sailor as 
aviation structural mechanic 2nd class douglas scott dimberg 23 of 
redfield sd the injured man was identified as airman apprentice

lech walesa urged the government wednesday 
night in an unprecedented tv debate with the head of polands 
official unions to legalize solidarity the banned labor federation 
he helped found in 1980 
the debate after the evening news represented the first time in 
five years that walesa the 1983 nobel peace laureate had a chance 
to defend solidarity on statecontrolled television and was his most 
extensive tv appearance ever 
the exchange was televised live and uncensored a clock was even 
placed in the background of the set to demonstrate that no deletions 
were made 
jubilant solidarity advisers declared victory afterward hundreds 
of spectators who crowded around television sets at warsaws central 
station also seemed to score it a win for walesa 
we have to agree for poland poland needs agreement walesa 
told alfred miodowicz during the 43minute debate 
referring to miodowiczs membership in the ruling politburo 
walesa said serious talks between the opposition and government 
could begin when officials acknowledge solidaritys right to exist 
soldarity the first free union movement in the soviet bloc was 
founded legally during a turbulent summer of strikes in 1980 but 
was suppressed and outlawed after martial law was declared in 
december 1981 
if you can make a mans decision that there is a place for 
solidarity we will immediately roll up our sleeves and we will 
begin working hard for poland because time is running out walesa 
told miodowicz 
grzegorz streszynski a young man at the railroad station missed 
his train to western poland to watch the contest walesa made 
great remarks i waited seven years to hear them he said 
walesa stepped on him said adam michnik a senior adviser to 
the solidarity founder 
this is a fantastic day beautiful which will be noted in the 
history of our country as a great victory for solidarity said 
film director andrzej wajda a solidarity supporter 
walesa said later his performance suffered because he had a 
severe case of flu 
the official news agency pap was noncommittal in spite of the 
fact that the approaches remained divergent the very fact of the 
meeting is a good prognosis for overcoming barriers in reaching 
dialogue and national agreement 
dressed in a gray suit with a solidarity badge and an image of a 
madonna on his lapel walesa looked relaxed as he and miodowicz sat 
side by side 
miodowicz began the program urging that there be no divisions 
among workers 
please join us in the official trade unions join our 
democratic elections said miodowicz who wore a black shirt and 
no tie with a gray suit 
walesa said you want me to come on my knees to your union i 
dont want to i want to be myself 
as the debate progressed walesa became more animated gesturing 
broadly with his hands miodowiczs opening remarks lasted five 
minutes longer than walesas but the solidarity leader did most of 
the talking afterward 
when miodowicz said authorities were moving step by step to 
improve the political and economic situation in poland walesa 
agreed but said poland was taking small steps while the rest of the 
world rushed toward progress 
the debate was proposed by miodowicz on nov 14 and accepted 
swiftly by walesa a television official had predicted that all of

france detonated one of its 
biggest nuclear explosions in the south pacific on thursday and new 
zealand quickly condemned the test as dangerous 
government scientists in new zealand estimated the blast had a 
yield of 100 kilotons frances biggest recorded test measured 140 
kilotons 
the scientists said the test appeared to be the biggest since a 
120kiloton explosion in 1979 at mururoa an atoll in french 
polynesia 
one kiloton is equivalent to the explosion of 1000 tons of tnt 
foreign minister russell marshall of new zealand said the latest 
test the eighth this year renewed questions about the safety of 
the test site government officials said the explosion was for the 
first time at faungataufa atoll not the usual mururoa site 
the fact that the french test their nuclear weapons so far from 
their own country suggests an uncertainty about the risks of their 
nuclear testing and moving this nuclear test back to faungataufa 
merely raises more questions said marshall in a statement 
marshall said france probably was developing warheads for a new 
mobile landbased ballistic missile or a new submarinelaunched 
ballistic missile 
nuclear testing merely fuels the arms race he added we 
will continue to deplore it wherever and whenever it occurs further 
development of more and more nuclear weapons does not guarantee 
anybodys security 
france maintains a policy of not confirming reports of nuclear 
testing it began underground testing at mururoa in 1975 after 
abandoning atmospheric tests

in a tiny midwestern hamlet called eldritch 
population 70 the people can be friendly caring and closeknit 
they also can be gossipy insular unforgiving and downright 
murderous 
lanford wilson examines a dozen or so of the towns residents in 
the rimers of eldritch which was revived wednesday by 
offbroadways second stage the play still tantalizes but this 
production doesnt its a fluid but emotionally barren revival that 
doesnt capture the power of wilsons dark story or his poetic 
almost lyrical sense of everyday language 
the rimers of eldritch is early wilson a large messy play 
that was first performed offoffbroadway at lamama in 1966 the 
evening is an unsentimental mosaic of rural life but nothing is 
straightforward scenes bleed into each other conversations overlap 
and sometimes are repeated action occurs in a time frame that skips 
from spring to summer to fall and back again 
ultimately pieces of the story fit together building toward a 
climax that has been hinted at from the beginning of the play until 
then the audience has to absorb a remarkable number of characters 
and incidents 
the opening sequence is promising two old biddies played with 
hilarious righteousness by georgia creighton and mary jay cackle 
about the goingson between the owner of the town cafe and her 
amorous hired hand 
gradually the rest of the large cast is introduced 
theres patsy johnson described by the playwright as the 
prettiest girl at centerville high patsy longs to move to 
centerville some 20 miles away but shes trapped in eldritch and 
can only leave on a school bus 
her speeches of longing particularly when recited by an actress 
as sympathetic as jennie moreau are among the productions few 
affecting moments 
theres also a parade of eccentric characters who seem in this 
revival at least to reside in dogpatch rather than eldritch they 
include skelly the town hermit the emotionally unstable nelly 
windrod and her senile mother mary the ultrareligious evelyn 
jackson and her crippled daughter eva and a strange young man named 
robert conklin who is amorously pursued by eva 
the plot involves a murder and a subsequent trial neither is 
presented chronologically and information about both is revealed 
between slices of midwest life often performed at much too high a 
pitch 
director mark brokaw hasnt gotten much out of his actors besides 
an ability to scamper up and down designer santo loquastos mountain 
of roughhewn boards in addition to miss moreau only adam storke 
as the troubled robert evokes much sympathy or interest even 
jennifer tiptons lighting seems unrealized more murky than 
revealing 
as an examination of smalltime people in a smalltown 
oppressive atmosphere the rimers of eldritch remains 
intriguing its just hard to see what makes them tick in this 
leaden production

marcia gray a comatose woman kept 
alive near three years by a feeding tube while her family 
successfully fought to stop feeding her died wednesday after 
surviving two weeks without nourishment 
mrs gray 49 died at 818 pm at south county hospital in 
south kingstown said philip tracy the hospitals senior vice 
president 
death was attributed to kidney failure and respiratory 
arrest he said most of the family were with her including 
her husband h glenn gray who fought for his wifes right to die 
her family was all with her and glenn was able to hold her it 
was a very quiet peaceful passage said the familys attorney 
linda macdonald 
hes taking it pretty hard he said its an easy passage for 
her but its not for us hes not going to be talking to anybody 
for a while probably for at least a week ms macdonald said 
along with gray 47 were mrs grays 23yearold son 
21yearold daughter and about eight other relatives and inlaws 
ms macdonald said 
her death was the final chapter in her familys controversial 
appeal to a federal judge and a roman catholic theologian that mrs 
gray did not want her life prolonged artificially 
mrs gray suffered a burst blood vessel in her brain on jan 4 
1986 she has been in what doctors called a persistent vegetative 
state since then confined mostly at the state general hospital 
gray and other family members contended throughout the 
controversy that mrs gray told them before she was stricken that 
she did not want to be kept alive by artificial means 
state officials refused to remove her feeding tube arguing it 
was morally wrong that she endure a cruel and painful death by 
starvation 
the gray family then sued the state in an attempt to force 
officials to let mrs gray die us district judge francis j boyle 
on oct 17 sided with the family and ordered the state to remove the 
feeding tube or find another hospital that would by nov 16 
bishop louis e gelineau of the providence roman catholic 
diocese drew national attention last year when he approved a 
theologians opinion that it was morally permissible to withhold 
nutrition from mrs gray 
after the federal decision thomas romeo state director of the 
department of mental health retardation and hospitals still 
expressed reluctance in removing mrs grays nutrition he wrote to 
more than 270 hospitals in rhode island massachusetts and 
connecticut asking them to accept mrs gray 
she was transfered to south county hospital on nov 16 dr 
robert conrad who has worked at south county for 23 years removed 
the tube he said at the time that he was concerned mrs gray was 
being kept alive against her wishes 
tracy said mrs grays death was expected 
right from day one shes been deteriorating but the past few 
days more so he said theres not much more you can say its 
done and other with 
he said there were no attempts to resuscitate mrs gray on 
conrads orders 
the family began a bedside vigil monday after several instances 
when mrs grays blood pressure dropped sharply and her heart began 
beating irregularly ms macdonald said 
she kept rallying this morning they thought she was going and 
she held on for another 12 hours the lawyer said every one of 
her organs was beginning to shut down from what the doctors said 
ms macdonald said that although it has been painful for the 
family gray is proud of the fact that his wife did not die in 
vain that marcias death as unprivate as it was opened the path 
for other families not to go through the same thing 
at one point in the states attempts to find a health care 
facility tht would take mrs gray romeo sought the advice of us 
surgeon general c everett koop 
koop who had said that although he didnt endorse the removal of 
patients feeding tubes in general the gray familys request was 
acceptable because mrs gray had previously asked to be allowed to 
die

carlos salinas de gortari a mexican 
nationalist with us academic training becomes mexicos president 
thursday and begins a race against time to restructure his country 
economically politically and psychologically 
six years of economic crisis and austerity have fed discontent 
and political opposition salinas himself has said that the future 
of the system a system that has served mexico for almost 60 
years is at stake 
with cabinet appointments announced wednesday however salinas 
served notice that he intends to extend freemarket policies 
several young appointees worked with salinas under outgoing 
president miguel de la madrid and like salinas hold degrees in 
economics from topranked us schools 
when he takes the oath in the legislative palace for his sixyear 
term salinas will look out at an example of how times have changed 
out of 500 congressmen 263 belong to his institutional 
revolutionary party and an unprecedented 237 to the opposition 
salinas victory july 6 with just over 50 percent of the vote was 
marred by accusations of fraud and the result still is being 
protested over the weekend members of the national democratic front 
occupied city halls in michoacan state 
only last week democratic front presidential candidate cuauhtemoc 
cardenas labeled salinas an illegitimate president and said 
foreign heads of state such as cubas fidel castro should not be 
attending the inauguration 
salinas needs a quick success to demonstrate his command of the 
job but he is taking over a country with a foreign debt of 102 
billion an economy that has not grown in six years and an annual 
inflation rate of 40 percent 
to help him move forward salinas selected a cabinet to include 
pedro aspe a 38yearold with a phd from mit as treasury 
secretary and chief of debt negotiations jaime serra puche a 
37yearold who worked for salinas in the budget office as minister 
of commerce and industry and close associate fernando solana 57 
as foreign minister 
other appointments included ernesto zedillo ponce de leon 36 
who has been aspes assistant secretary and who holds a yale 
doctorate as budget secretary fernando gutierrez barrios 61 
governor of veracruz state and former assistant interior secretary 
as interior secretary gen antonio riviello bazan 62 a career 
officer as defense secretary and economist andres caso lombardo 
64 as communications and transportation secretary 
salinas named his closest collaborator 42yearold manuel 
camacho solis as mayor of sprawling mexico city and its population 
of 18 million which the pri lost badly in the july elections 
despite all his difficulties there are signs that salinas may 
have an easier time than de la madrid whose biggest accomplishment 
was to stop an economic downslide and prevent social unrest 
de la madrid with salinas as budget director reduced the 
governments control of the economy sold off stateowned companies 
and pushed efforts to free mexico of its dependence on oil revenue 
by making its industry more competitive on world markets 
the difference between now and six years ago is that today 
people are confident we can pull out of the crisis said ramon 
alatorre an official with howard johnson of mexico a restaurant 
and motel franchiser 
salinas has said his biggest concern is to get mexico to grow 
again and to do that he said the country needs both new 
investment and the use of resources that now go abroad as payments 
on the foreign debt 
he expects a sympathetic ear from presidentelect george bush 
whom he met last week in houston mexico will pay 9 billion in 
interest on the debt this year and salinas says creditors must be 
more understanding 
the new mexican president called bush a man with a positive 
attitude mexican sources at the meeting said the mexican leader 
a harvard graduate with a doctorate in economics and bush a yale 
alumnus seemed to hit it off they also discussed other 
irritants to usmexico relations drug trafficking migration and 
free trade 
salinas is expected to continue austerity measures recommended by 
international financial institutions to pull mexico out of its 
crisis and keep trying to make the economy more efficient 
in a show of confidence the united states offered a 35 billion 
credit mexico has not yet needed to draw on the money but the 
psychological effect was positive 
present at the inauguration will be eight latin american chiefs 
of state the attendance of castro and nicaraguas daniel ortega is 
particularly annoying to leftists who question salinas mandate 
the us delegation will include secretary of state george p 
shultz and bushs son john who will come with his mexicanamerican 
wife columba 
others attending will be presidents virgilio barco of colombia 
raul alfonsin of argentina jose napoleon duarte of el salvador 
jose azcona hoyo of honduras vinicio cerezo arevalo of guatemala 
and prime minister manuel esquivel of belize

leaky seals and gaskets caused a series of 
plutonium leaks at the governments savannah river plant in aiken 
county sc and more leaks could occur before the problem is 
fixed scientists said wednesday 
three separate unplanned releases of plutonium have occurred at 
the nuclear weapons material production plant in the past six weeks 
the most recent on nov 22 fifteen workers have picked up minute 
quantities of the radioactive material on the soles of their shoes 
as a result of the leaks 
john porter a technical superintendent at the plant near 
augusta ga told the atlanta constitution wednesday the source of 
the releases appears to be a contaminated filter room at a 
laboratory near srps plutonium refining facility 
over a period of years plutonium had built up in the room as 
filters designed to trap radioactivity were replaced some of the 
accumulated plutonium then was sucked accidentally out of the labs 
exhaust air stack without passing through filters 
the accidental releases occurred because several seals and 
gaskets that should have been airtight were not porter said 
since the first leak was discovered in late october after six 
workers had gone home with plutonium on their shoes air flow 
through the laboratory has been restricted and gaskets in the filter 
room have been replaced 
as a result porter said the chances of more releases occurring 
have been reduced but not eliminated its unlikely that more will 
be released but its not impossible porter said 
one microcurie of plutonium has been found outside of a plutonium 
refining facility according to srp officials if all of that had 
been swallowed by a single person that person would receive only 
about onethird of the radiation dose permitted by federal 
regulations 
however bill reinig srp health physics superintendent 
acknowledged that some plutonium could have escaped from the plant 
without being measured 
none of the three reactors at srp are operating they have been 
shut down because of safety and other concerns

the du pont co hopes to get federal approval 
next week to market a solution which in clinical trials increased 
the time that livers pancreases and kidneys can be preserved before 
transplanting a scientist said wednesday 
dr james h southard of the university of wisconsin who helped 
develop uw solution said during a telephone interview from madison 
wis that the solution will mean more livers preserved for shipment 
to transplant centers 
it means the surgery can be scheduled and done during the 
normal hours of the operating room it means a wellrested staff a 
more expeditious operation and a safer operation southard said 
organ transplants are generally done on an emergency basis 
shortly after organs become available which is often unpredictable 
and inconvenient 
with the solution organs begin to function immediately after a 
transplant eliminating the need for dialysis for kidney patients or 
insulin for those with tranplanted pancreases southard said 
survival rates for those with transplanted livers would increase 
because the livers would work immediately he said 
prior to the development of the solution livers and pancreases 
could be preserved from six to 10 hours while kidneys could be 
preserved for about 30 hours 
a lot of organs were wasted because we couldnt transport them 
fast enough southard said the new solution preserves kidneys and 
pancreases for three days and livers for two days he said 
at the university of pittsburgh hospital where the solution has 
been used for about a year more than 450 liver transplants have 
been done and livers have been preserved for more than 30 hours 
southard said 
in 1987 there were 8967 kidney tranplants 1199 liver 
transplants and 142 pancreas tranplants according to the 
notforprofit united network for organ sharing in richmond va 
although it is believed the number of transplants will probably 
increase as a result of the solution unos spokeswoman kelle m 
straw said only 15 to 20 percent of the potential pool of donors is 
being used 
i think the solution will help in the area of allowing more 
time for tissue typing and coordinating flights and getting an organ 
to its destination she said 
unos a national clearinghouse for organ donors and recipients 
has been tracking the clinical trials of the new solution tests are 
under way to determine if the solution would also work on hearts 
southard an associate professor in the department of surgery at 
the university of wisconsin developed the solution with dr folkert 
o belzer chairman of the department 
the solution uses chemicals invented by du pont which is 
headquartered in wilmington the solution has been used in clinical 
trials in the united states europe and canada since january du 
pont spokesman roger morris said 
if the us food and drug administration does not object or 
request further information about the product on monday du pont 
plans to begin commercially marketing the solution to hospitals and 
transplant centers in february morris said

a campaign to secure irans full 
cooperation with the un human rights investigator collapsed 
wednesday when a committee adopted a resolution harshly critical of 
the tehran governments practices 
irans un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati said last 
friday his country was ready to allow un special representative 
reynaldo galindo pohl to tour iran in december if a mild consensus 
resolution were adopted 
iran has never allowed galindo into the country and he has had 
to compile his reports from iranian news reports and the testimony 
of exiles 
when the resolution criticizing iran passed mahallati seemed to 
withdraw the offer saying iran would continue to extend the same 
degree of cooperation as in the past 
the resolution mahallati sought contained no reference to past 
iranian practices that concerned western nations such as a reported 
wave of executions of political prisoners and repression of the 
bahai religion 
the netherlands portugal and belgium were unable to accept such 
a resolution said mahallati

today on the reforms the president proposed the constitutional 
changes last month and the supreme soviet the nations parliament 
is to vote on them thursday 
it is obvious that some of the provisions of the bills were not

the supreme soviet is considering during its threeday session a 
package of almost 120 articles of legislation that gorbachev says 
are the first major step toward a political system based on law not

concern about the reliability of the safety 
alarms on commercial jetliners is responsible for the governments 
suggestion for a new device in 3700 aircraft an alarm to warn 
pilots their alarm isnt working 
the federal aviation administration announced tuesday that it 
plans to require airlines early next year to install a warning light 
in all of their jetliners to tell pilots if their takeoff alarm 
system is out of commission 
the takeoff alarms variations of which are found in all 
commercial jetliners are supposed to guard against a plane taking 
off without being properly prepared such as having its wing flaps 
in the wrong position 
the alarm which in some planes sounds a loud horn and in others 
a computerized voice often is the last defense against a pilots

government and private analysts said today the 
outlook for world wheat markets looks strong next year and offers 
us producers a good opportunity to make gains 
more land worldwide is expected to be devoted to wheat production 
in 1989 because of strong crop prices and government incentives 
including easing of landidling restrictions for farmers in the 
united states said bruce r weber an economist with the 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
in prepared remarks for delivery at todays session of the usda 
agricultural outlook conference weber forecast that total harvested 
areas for wheat could rise 5 percent to 6 percent above 1988 levels 
to 230 million to 232 million hectares worldwide a hectare is a 
metric measure equalling nearly 2 acres 
if the recent upward trend in yields continue the world should 
easily harvest a 1989 wheat crop in excess of 500 million metric 
tons said weber how favorable the growing season is will 
dictate how close the crop comes to the record 530 million harvest 
of 1986

david allen lindsey sr had a talent 
for building objects and images 
as a carpenter he built furniture and made free repairs around a 
miami orphanage for years as a rare single man allowed to adopt 
children he put together a family of 11 boys as an apparently 
devoted father he developed the trust of childwelfare officials 
and of journalists who hailed him as a man breaking stereotypes 
now the same boys who filled his threebedroom boynton beach 
home could tear down whats left of the world lindsey built 
two of his adoptive sons have agreed to testify in the sexual 
abuse trial of the man they once called dad the two are 
lindseys 19yearold namesake david jr who is learning to live 
on his own now and a 9yearold adjusting to a new foster family 
lindsey free on bond and living with his wife of eight months in 
the northern florida city of ocala faces nine counts of sexual 
assault against the two and an unidentified neighborhood boy 
conviction could bring life imprisonment 
five other adopted sons recanted statements they made against 
lindsey last year to boynton beach police 
lindseys trial is to begin soon in circuit court in west palm 
beach though no date has been set meanwhile the two adoptive 
brothers have filed civil suits against the 42yearold man and 
agencies involved in the adoptions seeking unspecified monetary 
awards 
he is an animal said sgt david nissensohn of the boynton 
beach police department which led the initial probe of lindsey last 
year he has destroyed the lives of many boys and belongs behind 
bars 
hes ugly said the thirdgrader who agreed last month to 
testify if i go to court i wont look at him ill just turn my 
head and tell them what happened 
not long ago people spoke quite differently about lindsey 
calling him a selfsacrificing savior who opened his home to the 
most troubled needy boys many of them youths who had gone from one 
foster home to another after neglect or abuse by their parents 
a sign in his home read its better to build children than to 
repair men 
the boys lindsey adopted were all under 14 years old most 
between 7 and 12 when adopted all are now either on their own or 
placed with foster families 
in 1969 lindseys request to adopt a son was met with 
astonishment singleparent homes were less common then and an 
unmarried man seeking to adopt was a particular curiosity 
lindsey however was relentless he argued that a single man 
could be a fine parent and provide a loving home after two years of 
volunteering time at the statefunded childrens home society 
orphanage in miami he was given his first son ray 
by 1981 lindseys family had grown to five boys the fifth being 
david jr 
on fathers day they were a staple for the local and national 
news media and the stories were always upbeat lindsey seemed to 
have tireless energy and commitment i get more out of the boys 
than out of freedom he said in a 1981 article 
the boys never had a complaint for outsiders 
looking back now its hard to see how someone didnt question 
the arrangement said becky walker supervisor of childrens 
services for the florida department of health and rehabilitative 
services referring to lindseys request only for white 
preadolescent boys to adopt i cant say what they were thinking 
then 
evelyn cassidy the counselor who arranged most of lindseys 
adoptions at the childrens home has temporarily been assigned to a 
new job at the agency until the trial is completed she declined to 
comment on lindsey or the charges 
the storm of allegations against lindsey began to brew during a 
series of quarrels with david jr in early 1987 the boy eventually 
left the house and after two days away was about to call lindsey 
for forgiveness 
instead he telephoned the rev neil hickem and his wife at the 
first baptist church in delray beach where lindsey used to take his 
sons nearly every sunday 
on a night in may 1987 david jr told the couple his adoptive 
father masturbated and performed oral sex on the boys whom he 
claimed often slept with lindsey the abuse usually ended when the 
boys reached late puberty he said 
i dont think i know how to love david jr has told the 
miami herald 
sometimes i wonder what my life would be like if this had never 
happened if i had been adopted by a different family he said 
i wonder if i would have gone to college i wonder if i would have 
gotten married and had children its hard for me to imagine now 
what will happen 
the day after he talked with the hickems david jr again told 
his story to boynton beach detectives and the tale was corroborated 
by five other adoptive brothers police said but eventually all but 
david jr would recant their taperecorded stories 
three months before a boy from nearby lake worth had identified 
lindsey as the man who had offered him money for sex said police 
the boy however did not wish to press charges 
police later found a neighborhood boy who claimed lindsey had 
twice assaulted him and gave him a motorcycle to remain silent 
lindsey was arrested on june 3 1987 last march circuit judge 
thomas sholts rejected a plea agreement that would have given 
lindsey psychiatric counseling but no jail time in exchange for 
a confession 
lindseys attorney richard lubin said at the time his client 
wanted to spare the boys the trauma of testifying 
prosecutors now have an extensive witness list that includes 
former neighbors and associates of lindsey said mary greene a 
spokeswoman for the crimes against children division of the state 
attorney generals office 
we do not expect a plea she said we intend to prosecute

when beth howland and jennifer warren heard 
about jason gaes book telling of his battle against cancer they 
knew they had found the subject for their first coproduction 
howland an actress bestknown for her role as vera on the tv 
series alice saw jason and his mother on a publicaccess 
television show talking about his upcoming book my book for kids 
with cansur 
i was so taken with him said howland he was so 
articulate he was a regular kid but wise beyond his years without 
being precocious 
jason was 8 when he was stricken with burkitts lymphoma a form 
of viral cancer the producers said jason now 10 is considered 
cured 
their story of jason and the fight he and his family waged 
against cancer is told in you dont have to die a halfhour 
documentary that will have its premiere monday on home box office 
the show combines documentary footage with animation of the 
books illustrations drawn by jasons twin brother tim and an 
older brother adam 
the documentary was secondary with us said howland what 
we really wanted to do was animate the book the drawings in the 
book are very primitive like little stick drawings 
warren added the animation was done by john canemaker and it 
weaves in and out of the documentary the animation deals with his 
treatment and things that would be hard to take in real life the 
animation is informative but not frightening it includes some 
fantasies too because jason talks a lot about death 
the reason jason wrote the book and the reason it appealed to 
howland and warren was that it was about survival and hope 
there are so many books and pictures about people who die 
said howland jason wanted a book about hope the survival rate 
for childrens cancer is now very good 
my book for kids with cansur began as an invitation to a 
getwell party for jason who lives in worthington minn the 
american cancer society in minnesota saw it and printed it as a 
pamphlet 
we first saw it as a pamphlet said warren the book has 
more drawings and is in color it has a real charm to it 
it has very little text said howland thats why we did 
the documentary there wasnt enough material for a half hour of 
animation it was a good thing because once we got into it we found 
out how expensive animation is 
the show was filmed at jasons home and at the mayo clinic in 
rochester minn where jason was treated 
its about this family and how they went through this 
experience and what happened to each of them said howland the 
family stuck together which we learned isnt usually the case when 
a child has a catastrophic illness 
the documentary is the first for their tiger rose productions 
which they named for their dogs warren and howland first met as 
acting students in new york 
warren has starred in a number of motion pictures including 
night moves and slap shot and the tv series paper dolls 
they are developing other projects including dramas that they 
would star in 
howland is currently in rehearsal for alan ayckbourns a chorus 
of disapproval at the arena theater in washington dc 
warren will direct the beans of egypt maine for pbs 
american playhouse and for later release as a feature film its 
adapted from carolyn chutes novel about a rowdy rural family 
i have no interest in directing said howland i produce 
because there arent enough acting jobs you have to create them

one of the prime products of banking 
deregulation the money market deposit account observes its sixth 
anniversary this month 
but many savers and investors might feel they have less reason to 
cheer the occasion than the banks and savings institutions that take 
these deposits 
as shortterm interest rates have climbed steadily this year 
yields on most types of money market investments have moved up on a 
parallel course 
in contrast returns on the typical money market deposit account 
or mmda simply havent kept pace 
as of late november the average rate on mmdas at 100 large banks 
and thrift institutions stood at 593 percent according to bank 
rate monitor 
compare that to a 10 percent to 105 percent prime lending rate 
the basic rate used by the institutions to calculate the interest 
they charge on many adjustablerate loans to both businesses and 
consumers 
or even more pertinent contrast it to the average yield on 
money market mutual funds of just under 8 percent as reported by 
donoghues money fund report of holliston mass that translates 
into 4 in interest for every 3 paid to mmda depositors 
mmdas were created in december 1982 as a way of allowing banks 
and savings institutions to compete with the money funds which had 
been enjoying explosive growth 
and compete they did for most of the next four years mmdas 
offered returns close to even occasionally exceeding what you 
could get in a money fund 
whats more mmdas offered the advantage of federal deposit 
insurance money funds no matter how safe they may be deemed have 
no such direct backing from the federal government cash poured into 
mmdas 
since early 1987 another key difference between the two vehicles 
has begun to manifest itself 
money funds are required to pay out to their shareholders 
whatever they can earn from moneymarket securities such as treasury 
bills and commercial paper issued by corporations minus their 
expenses and management fees 
bank and thrift institutions on the other hand are free to pay 
whatever rate on mmdas they think the market will bear 
since interest rates began moving higher in the spring of last 
year money fund yields have responded automatically with increases 
of their own mmda yields barely budged 
the disparity in available returns has not gone unnoticed assets 
in money funds have lately climbed to new highs surpassing 280 
billion 
that total still pales however in comparison to the 500 
billionplus that reposes in mmdas 
this indicates that banks and thrifts have found a level of 
interest rates satisfactory to most depositors that is significantly 
below the rates prevailing in the open market said norman fosback 
in the advisory letter income amp safety 
by permitting their yields to lag far behind money funds banks 
and thrifts have lowered their interest costs and boosted their 
earnings by approximately 75 billion a year 
that same 75 billion represents earnings lost by savers that 
have chosen to ignore the growing superiority of money funds over 
deposit accounts 
of course all insured money market accounts are not equal 
fosback added in spots across the country some institutions are 
offering mmdas with rates in the neighborhood of 8 percent 
nevertheless fosback concluded the average money fund 
holder is doing much better today than the average money market 
account depositor at a bank or thrift

in socialist and capitalist societies alike the 
motive is the same to increase economic values by a greater 
reliance on private initiative it is a worldwide trend 
their economies bogged down by bureaucratic obstacle courses 
socialist nations are allowing and relying on a much greater 
degree of private sector initiative in the form of profitseeking 
businesses 
and for reasons roughly similar countries more inclined toward 
capitalism than socialism are seeking ways to privatize or turn 
over to the private sector a variety of governmental activities 
in each instance the goal is to stimulate economies raise 
revenues and clear away bottlenecks through reliance on individual 
initiative in the belief that society is best served when goals are 
clear and achievement is rewarded 
though action is stalled for the time being the privatization 
effort in the united states is building support because of one of 
the countrys most persistent failures the inability to live within 
the constraints of budgets 
government is seen as wasteful cumbersome and unable to 
extricate itself from its problems especially debt wouldnt it be 
better say the advocates of privatization to let the private 
sector handle some of the problems 
it is hardly an american phenomenon since britain france 
japan new zealand and other nations have done more since 1979 for 
example the british government has sold more than 36 billion in 
public assets 
not only did the british treasury boast a 17 billion surplus for 
1987 but some of the once subsidized stateowned enterprises are 
now profitable taxpaying private enterprises 
the national freight corp for example has expanded its 
operations once subsidized by government and created new jobs in 
addition employees who bought shares in the company have seen the 
value of the shares skyrocket 
often ridiculed just a couple of decades ago us privatization 
advocates now can be found in government academe industry 
notforprofit institutions and even to some extent in the labor 
movement 
while movement has been slow the agenda is packed consider some 
of the items selling government loans federal lands surplus 
military bases the us postal service the airwaves and even the 
nations highways and bridges 
the air traffic control system is a candidate for privatization 
education too so is the tennessee valley authority prisons also 
even social security 
some privatizing already has occurred in the united states but 
only on a relatively modest scale conrail the rail freight 
operation went for 17 billion more than 5 billion in federal 
loans were sold during the reagan administration some lowincome 
housing was privatized and contracting out of government services 
and production has occurred on a small scale 
of greater future consequence however is the research that has 
been stimulated at the heritage foundation the reason foundation 
the political economy research center the pacific research 
institute and elsewhere 
the reason foundation headed by robert w poole jr often 
credited with coining privatization in his 1980 book cutting 
back city hall has just published federal privatization with 
emphasis on the federal deficit 
among other things the foundations book lists assets that could 
be sold for about 310 billion plus huge savings in the annual 
operation of these assets 
included are obsolete military bases tva 370 million acres of 
land a multibilliondollar loan portfolio dulles and national 
airports serving washington dc amtrak the postal service and 
naval petroleum reserves 
could the nations airwaves be sold to private enterprises why 
not says the report and highways and bridges again why not 
remember the report advises the sale of assets doesnt mean a loss 
of control over them 
contributors to the book many of whom assisted the presidents 
commission on privatization when it held hearings have now 
presented their views to the national economic commission which is 
deliberating on budget matters 
the commission is well aware that it has two alternatives 
spending cuts and tax increases 
the reason foundations authors want the commission to know it 
has a third way out of the dilemma of a government living beyond its 
means try going private they say you may like it

the hyundai excel is a car of contrasts its base price of 5499 
attracts budgetminded consumers yet sales figures show the average 
buyer winds up with an excel model averaging at least 8300 
auto critics have panned the little south koreanbuilt excel 
since its debut in february 1986 yet americans flocked to the 
showrooms and made hyundai the fourthbiggest importer in its first 
year 
despite the lower profit margins offered to car dealers from 
hyundai compared with other automakers the company reports about 
one out of every three us dealers have applied for a hyundai 
dealership 
thats not bad for a car whose name many folks cant pronounce 
it rhymes with sunday and means modern in korean 
hyundai officials say they merely found a market niche the low 
end of the small car market that had been nearly abandoned by the 
domestics even the japanese have departed the niche over the last 
few years as carmakers moved upscale 
buyers get more bang for the buck with our car more value a 
hyundai spokeswoman said when asked what sets hyundai apart from 
other subcompacts 
she said sales rose from 168882 in the introductory year of 1986 
to 263610 in 1987 sales in the first 10 months of this year 
totaled 225198 vs 226191 in the same period in 1987 the 
spokeswoman attributed the slight decline to a strike earlier this 
year in south korea that curtailed production she said the company 
has not projected 1989 sales 
the average excel buyer is between 25 and 35 with average income 
from 25000 to 35000 a year hyundai said fiftytwo percent are 
females and 32 percent are college graduates a majority have some 
college education 
the test car was a frontdrive gls sedan with a base price of 
7749 plus 1300 for options way above the base excel at 5499 
the excel gls had a good set of standard features such as 
tachometer full cloth seats and a driver seat with height and 
lumbar adjustment these items are not part of the base excel 
package however 
the gls also had a spongy suspension and substantial road noise 
unfortunately they are part of the base excel and both models have 
the underpowered 15liter fourcylinder carbureted engine that 
has been criticized by auto test drivers 
i had to agree with them i found that passing other vehicles 
even on the highway took some doing because the excels 
powerplant capable of 68 horsepower at 5500 rpm just labored i 
put the accelerator to the floor and got no immediate response 
the engine was teamed with a fivespeed manual overdrive 
transmission a drive in a threespeed automatic excel proved no 
better performancewise i also dropped the left two wheels off the 
highway onto the paved shoulder and had a time getting the excel 
back onto the road 
handling is imprecise still in the city i appreciated the excel 
in difficult parking maneuvers it was a breeze to squeeze into 
small spaces the excels fit and finish was superb inside and out 
the interior was well done though the rear seat would be a 
nearly impossible fit for three decentsized adults legroom was ok 
in back if the front seats were moved all the way up but there 
wasnt be much legroom in back if the front seats were pushed back 
all the way 
the trunk had a nice flat floor but the carpet wasnt fastened 
down in the middle and tended to bunch up under luggage 
consumer reports said the excel reports of trouble from owners in 
its first year here 1986 were average 
overall the excel seemed to have the tradeoffs expected of a 
small car priced as low as 5499 
but with the test gls priced at more than 9000 i had to wonder 
whether this is really a lowpriced car for a special market niche 
at 9000 a buyer could widen his or her scope to the honda civic 
dx hatchback at around 8450 or a ford escort which starts around 
7000 then the niche is gone and perhaps thats the biggest 
contrast of all

as the morning mist lifts groups of 
mostly older men and women faces shielded from the sun by 
coneshaped straw hats make their way to a large lowlying field 
to cultivate garden plots 
its a ritual startlingly reminiscent of scenes shown on 
television during the vietnam war but this is the mississippi 
delta not the mekong 
i have seen this same thing in vietnam many times said tu 
pineda an interpreter for associated catholic charities of new 
orleans she pointed to an elderly man harvesting small white 
eggplants grinned and said papasan 
the man moi nguyen 71 spoke to her in vietnamese he says he 
and his wife sold fish sauce and anchovy paste in their village back 
in south vietnam pineda said he says they emigrated there 
from north vietnam in 1954 after the french were defeated and 
then came here in 1975 
she slowly surveyed the other gardens many bordered by banana 
plants and added this is very very much like southeast asia 
the similarity to southeast asia of this village 12 miles east of 
new orleans is no accident more than 2800 of its 4000 residents 
70 percent are refugees from south vietnam they are part of the 
larger vietnamese community more than 12000 strong that has 
settled in greater new orleans since 1975 
there are larger populations of vietnamese in this country in 
california new york and texas for example said monsignor 
dominic luong but new orleans certainly has the most unique 
refugee group in the country 
what makes it so unique is versailles the nations most 
intensely vietnamese community a place where cone hats are common 
and for sale signs are as likely to be in vietnamese as in 
english 
in other areas of the country the vietnamese refugees are 
scattered throughout their communities luong said here they 
basically live in two places in eastern new orleans and along the 
west bank of the mississippi river south and west of the city 
but versailles is even more special because most of the people 
living here came from three small fishing villages near vung tau 
about 50 miles southeast of saigon in a sense they have recreated 
their villages also many of them fled north vietnam earlier so 
coming here was their second major migration in two decades 
he gestured toward the villages commercial section where more 
than two dozen shops and businesses emblazoned with vietnamese 
signs or bearing english names such as saigon plaza were doing 
a brisk trade 
luong who has been in this country 20 years said see all 
those stores those groceries those medical clinics laundries and 
restaurants and so forth those were all built since the vietnamese 
arrived here in 1975 
before that he said a note of pride in his voice there 
was nothing there except weeds 
he stepped into a vietnamese grocery that offered a variety of 
oriental vegetables as well as canned abalone dried squid pickled 
ducks feet and a whole roasted pig the young vietnamese clerk 
said few americans ever came into the store 
later driving down a street in a 400unit rental complex 
comprising half of the village proper luong pointed to a parking 
lot where youths were passing a football thats where i held 
outdoor services for the first 18 months after i came out here in 
1978 
jane foley director of resettlement and immigration services for 
associated catholic charities also remembers those days in 1975 
the archdiocese sponsored 1000 refugees that first summer right 
after saigon fell we found apartments for a lot of them out at 
versailles because it was a big subdivision that was failing and 
plenty of housing was available 
by 1978 more than 5000 refugees had poured into the new orleans 
area many sponsored by the archdiocese hundreds more arrived over 
the next five years as thousands of boat people fled vietnam 
tu pineda who fled with her son a niece and two nephews was among 
them 
other refugees like minh nguyen a former helicopter pilot who 
runs an auto repair shop in jefferson parish came to new orleans 
from elsewhere in the country i was living in kentucky and we had 
a big big snow that first winter as soon as spring arrived i came 
to new orleans it is more like vietnam here he said 
most of the refugees who came to new orleans owned nothing but 
their clothes when they arrived only 5 percent spoke english 
but they worked hard often holding two or three jobs and 
everybody helped each other luong said now 40 percent of 
versailles vietnamese residents own their own homes and were not 
talking about professionals here most of the vietnamese 
professionals live in the washington dc area not in new 
orleans 
it hasnt been easy in the early years no public transportation 
ran between new orleans and versailles and language and cultural 
differences created constant tension with the refugees american 
neighbors 
the simmering cultural problems boiled over in 1978 when the 
area economy was slipping death threats were mailed to several 
vietnamese families amid rumors that missing pets were ending up in 
vietnamese stewpots and angry neighbors complained more than once 
when refugee families hung pungent fish from apartment balconies to 
dry in the sun 
a lot of those things have been smoothed out luong said 
however i do still spend a lot of time handling misunderstandings 
with our black neighbors many of them are jealous of us i think 
because they feel our people are taking their jobs 
the vietnamese initially took the lowestpaying menial jobs jobs 
nobody else wanted they have slowly climbed the economic ladder 
opening small stores and shops and moving into betterpaying service 
jobs in restaurants and tourist attractions like the cafe du monde 
in the french quarter fishing however is the refugees major 
occupation 
nearly half of versailles workers leave home on monday morning 
and stay out on the boats until the following weekend luong said 
a couple of vietnamese refugees even run shrimp processing plants 
now

one such plant operator is nguyen cao ky who was premier of 
south vietnam for three years beginning in 1965 he operates a boat 
dock and processing plant at dulac a small cajun community 70 miles 
southwest of new orleans 
more than 60 percent of the shrimpers from texas to florida now 
are vietnamese fishermen said ky 
ky 59 who first visited southern louisiana two years ago after 
his california liquor store went bankrupt moved to dulac in june 
he said he has been wellreceived despite recurring stories of 
friction between vietnamese fishermen and american shrimpers along 
the gulf coast 
vietnamese fishermen have been here for 13 years now there was 
trouble at first but not so much anymore i think ky said 
sonny parfait dulacs constable said he doesnt hear nearly as 
much grumbling about the vietnamese but noted that tensions have 
risen in some areas because shrimp catches have been below normal 
for two fishing seasons 
then theres the louisiana economy said eleanor will 
director of associated catholic charities office of refugee social 
services the job situation here is so poor there are so few jobs 
that some refugees are being forced to leave for other areas such 
as california which has a looser welfare policy 
will said the most persistent problem for the refugee community 
has been culture shock especially for grandparents and older 
married males 
some married men are very threatened by their wives newfound 
independence she explained and the grandparents tend to be 
depressed because they came from a culture where older people were 
honored and made all the important family decisions here things 
are different 
squatting beside her garden near versailles 62yearold vi 
nguyen who left two daughters in vietnam said the garden helps her 
forget her troubles 
im not so sad anymore said the grayhaired woman whose 
youngest daughter soon will graduate from louisiana state university 
like many of the refugee gardeners she sells her vegetables 
including yellow ginger lemon grass and ginseng to the local 
vietnamese markets 
they use the money to help their children with school 
expenses said luong about half of our high school graduates 
those who dont have to help their families on the shrimp boats go 
on to college 
but this sort of success points out another cultural problem he 
said the children are forgetting how to speak vietnamese their 
parents are so upset that we have begun language classes at the 
church and you know some of the children say they think the 
vietnamese language sounds funny and foreign

when nguyen cao ky moved to this remote cajun 
fishing village it caused hardly a ripple among folks along bayou 
caillou 
in fact many of the 3500 residents didnt realize the newcomer 
was a former general and onetime ruler of south vietnam 
we have a lot of vietnamese in this area and we saw this fellow 
as just another vietnamese fisherman said volunteer fireman sonny 
parfait tell you the truth i myself didnt know who he was 
until you say so 
parfait who is also dulacs constable said ky south vietnams 
premier from 1965 to 1968 can be seen around town almost any day 
as he goes about the business of running the shrimp processing plant 
he leased in may 
everybody seems to like him all right parfait said at 
least i havent heard any complaints and his plant is providing 
jobs for local people 
one of those people jean fairchild of nearby houma acknowledged 
she had some reservations about staying on as a secretary when ky 
took over the thenfailing processing plant 
i decided to give him a chance i had no idea what to expect 
working for a vietnamese but it has turned out very well hes a 
good boss and im not just saying that either 
next door in his paneled office the slender darkhaired 
president of southern gulf seafood processors inc quietly 
acknowledged that he has worked hard to fit in here dulac is 
located 70 miles southwest of new orleans deep in the heart of 
cajun country where alligators prowl dark bayou waters and strangers 
are often regarded with suspicion by the locals who speak a 
distinctive cajun patois 
ky doesnt dwell on the days when he says he had absolute 
power as premier i was a soldier and a politician now i am a 
businessman and a fisherman when im with vietnamese fishermen now 
i think they see me now as a fisherman instead of as a fighter 
pilot who used to be their premier 
ky who looks much younger than his 59 years usually wears 
jeans sneakers and a sports shirt and limits his socializing 
outside the vietnamese community to an occasional game of tennis 
more importantly he hires local workers 
seven of our eight fulltime employees are local americans and 
our parttime packing crew is largely made up of local residents 
he said 
its only fair employment opportunities are very scarce in 
this area and it wouldnt have been right not to have given the 
local people the first chance at these jobs 
ky buys most of his shrimp from the vietnamese fishermen who ply 
the gulf of mexico from florida to texas it was they who brought ky 
to louisiana two years ago after his southern california liquor 
store went bankrupt 
i was traveling around the country visiting vietnamese 
refugees he said i came down here and got interested in the 
fishing industry i found i liked it and decided maybe i could make 
a living and also help my people 
ky said he thinks the vietnamese now thought to comprise more 
than 60 percent of the shrimpers in the gulf should form a coop 
with the other fishermen a coop he said would market their 
catches and help with their business affairs 
things are getting more and more complicated for the vietnamese 
fishermen said ky at first when they just had small boats 
they could keep everything they made from their catch now however 
many of them own large boats costing several hundreds of thousands 
of dollars 
theyre getting more and more like americans he added 
smiling theyve got to make 4000amonth loan payments to the 
bank theyve got insurance premiums to pay

at 85 lord home of the hirsel is a 
powerful reminder of how the british conservative party has changed 
from the party of aristocratic bluebloods to the virtual fiefdom of 
margaret thatcher the grocers daughter 
its a transformation he appears not to regret at all 
indeed it was he as prime minister sir alec douglashome who 
revamped the partys structure and opened the doors of power to the 
middle classes first to edward heath the son of a carpenter who 
built a small construction business and then mrs thatcher 
lord homes career on the world stage goes back to 1938 when he 
was prime minister neville chamberlains private secretary at the 
munich pact talks with adolf hitler 
home was prime minister for only a year beginning in october 
1963 and is better known internationally through a total of 13 
years as foreign secretary or commonwealth secretary shepherding 
many of britains colonies to independence 
he is not among those highborn tory grandees who accuse mrs 
thatcher of making the governing party rougher tougher and 
uncompromisingly rightwing sacrificing compassion to freemarket 
economics 
on the contrary i think shes a very kindhearted person he 
said in an interview but you have to be decisive these days and 
there are two things which she realized and put into practice 
first that inflation is the real public enemy and second that 
productivity is the answer 
home divides his time between two vast family estates in 
scotland which he shares with elizabeth his wife of 52 years and 
london where he keeps politically active through regular attendance 
at the house of lords the unelected upper chamber of parliament 
to become prime minister he had to sit in the house of commons 
and thus renounce a string of hereditary titles including baron of 
dunglass which dates to the 14th century and earl of home a title 
granted to a feudal chieftain ancestor by king james i in 1603 
i didnt seem to matter much what i was called he says but 
he adds that he gave up the titles only after ensuring that his only

gaunt thinlipped face twinkle with humor 
when the conservatives chose the 14th earl of home as party 
leader and thus prime minister it meant home was the first peer 
picked to head any government this century 
an elegant anachronism stormed harold wilson then leader of 
the opposition socialist labor party after half a century of 
democratic advance of social revolution the whole process has 
ground to a halt with a 14th earl 
retorted home i suppose mr wilson when you come to think of 
it is the fourteenth mr wilson 
he was a compromise choice for the premiership replacing harold 
macmillan who had retired and home was the last conservative 
candidate to be picked through a timehonored process of secretive 
consultation among the party elders 
home changed the system to a ballot among conservative lawmakers 
opening the way to successors who had scrambled up the ladder from 
lowermiddle class backgrounds heath and then in 1975 mrs 
thatcher 
after the traditional upperclass education at eton and oxford 
home was elected to parliament in 1931 representing the scottish 
district of larnark 
apart from a fiveyear absence after a 1945 election defeat he 
remained in the commons until he inherited his fathers title and 
went to the lords in 1951 
to get him back into the commons as prime minister the tory 
candidate in the safe conservative scottish district of kinross and 
west perthshire stood aside and home won handily on nov 7 1963 
home lost a general election in 1964 to wilson but again held 
high office in 197074 as foreign secretary when the tories regained

he mucked it up home mused recently of heath you must not 
allow yourself to have a vendetta particularly with a woman 
home retains an air of being above it all detached from the 
mudslinging and jockeying for power his aloof patrician view of 
life comes of belonging to a family secure in its ancient

in the 1945 election 
hes lost my lord said the butler 
whos lost what replied homes father 
one of homes regrets is that chamberlain was so wrong in 
thinking britain could avoid war with nazi germany although he 
stresses the positive aspect that the compromises made by 
chamberlain bought britain time to arm 
his only other regret home says is that he neglected to develop 
a media image

a unit of itt corp has sued campeau corp for 
damages to its bondholdings stemming from campeaus takeover 
activity the second time this month itt has taken such action 
the unit hartford fire insurance co filed suit tuesday in us 
district court in manhattan against campeau and federated department 
stores which campeau acquired for 66 billion in april 
the suit accuses federated of securities fraud involving a 200 
million bond issue in october 1987 federated officials knew their 
company was a possible takeover target and failed to disclose that 
they could approve transactions such as a buyout that would reduce 
the credit rating and thus the market value of those bonds the 
suit alleged 
campeau borrowed heavily to acquire federated causing 
bondrating agencies to downgrade the bonds issued earlier by 
federated 
hartford fire sold federated bonds after the downgrading 
suffering a 43 million loss the suit stated the company is 
seeking compensatory damages plus interest 
in takeovers financed mainly with debt transactions known as 
leveraged buyouts the target company is left with a huge debt load 
that is repaid with its cash flow or with money raised by the sale 
of its assets 
because the huge new debt payments increase the risk that the 
company will not be able to meet all its previous obligations such 
buyouts generally reduce the credit rating for the targets bonds 
a campeau spokeswoman told the new york times in todays editions 
that the torontobased company had no comment because it had not 
seen the suit 
itts insurance subsidiaries on nov 14 sued rjr nabisco corp in 
federal court alleging fraud because nabisco management did not 
disclose the possibility of undertaking a leveraged buyout when it 
sold them bonds earlier this year 
the suit contends that possibility should have been stated in the 
bond prospectus because it was likely to depress rjr nabiscos 
corporate debt rating and therefore decrease the price of the bonds 
rjr nabisco management last month kicked off a 
multibilliondollar bidding war for the company by making a 
leveraged buyout proposal rjrs bonds have dropped sharply in value 
since the bidding began 
metropolitan life insurance co also has sued rjr nabisco 
claiming the value of its rjr bonds had dropped by nearly 40 
million

the oil futures market is showing increased 
skepticism to opecs new production accord 
on the new york mercantile exchange the january contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude settled down 11 
cents to 1492 a barrel tuesday after trading as high as 1525 
other contract months mostly were lower 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange tuesday 
the december contract for wholesale home heating oil lost 086 cent 
to settle at 4779 cents a gallon the december contract for 
unleaded gasoline settled at 4687 cents a gallon up 050 cent from 
monday 
analysts said the market was directionless following mondays 
agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting countries to 
limit crude production to 185 million barrels a day well under the 
estimated 225 million it now is pumping 
i think confusion is the watchword said peter beutel an 
energy analyst for elders futures inc i dont think opec answered 
a lot of questions the market has 
beutel said many traders are wondering what the cartel members 
would do before the accord takes effect jan 1 whether some would 
flood the market with oil before the date or start cutting 
production early he said traders also are wondering whether all 
members would adhere to the voluntary cuts once the agreement is in 
place 
just after the pact was announced monday the united arab 
emirates said the output level set in the opec agreement was not his 
official ceiling although the nations oil minister later promised 
to abide by the quota 
runaway oil production has been responsible for worsening a 
worldwide surplus that has sharply reduced oil prices

motorists could be paying 10 cents a gallon more 
at the gasoline pump by mid1989 if opec achieves its goal of 
reducing production and raising oil prices by about 4 a barrel 
analysts say 
but experts also say that because gasoline prices have not fallen 
in step with crude prices in recent months theyre unlikely to rise 
proportionately in the future 
increasing gasoline inventories the onset of winter and the 
current surplus of cheap crude oil are some of the factors 
offsetting any crude price hike sparked by the opec agreement 
analysts said tuesday 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries signed an 
agreement this week to limit the amount of crude oil it produces to 
185 million barrels a day starting in 1989 compared with its 
estimated current level of some 225 million barrels 
since april crude prices have fallen by more than 20 percent as 
the 13nation cartels production worsened a world oil glut 
assuming the new accord holds up opec hopes to boost prices to 
18 a barrel or higher the current price of around 14 to 15 in 
the first half of the year 
every 1 change in crude prices amounts to a change of 2 cents to 
3 cents in a gallon of gasoline if opec achieves its 18abarrel 
target then gasoline prices could jump 8 cents to 10 cents a gallon 
but gasoline prices have not declined along with crude prices 
other factors such as inventory levels demand imports and the 
amount of crude oil going into refineries have offset the drop in 
crude prices and may water down any future rise in oil prices 
product prices have been decoupled from crude theres not a 
one on one relationship says cyrus h tahmassebi chief economist 
for ashland oil inc 
if crude prices firm 2 to 3 then we will see gasoline 
prices go up about a nickel but if its just a slight temporary 
increase its not going to make much difference to the consumer 
tight gasoline supplies stemming mainly from refinery problems 
coupled with high demand helped keep retail prices firm at the gas 
pump at that same time that crude prices were going down 
michael canes an economist for the american petroleum institute 
estimates gasoline demand in 1988 has risen 25 percent over last 
year and was unusually strong late in the summer and this fall 
gasoline demand increased so we were using all our american 
refinery capacity and importing large amounts canes said we 
were having to go to highcost sources that we dont normally tap 
the high costs of imports in turn were passed along to consumers 
so while crude prices began falling steeply in april gasoline 
prices began to climb 
in april the average price of regular unleaded gasoline was 933 
cents a gallon according to the bureau of labor statistics by 
june it had risen to 955 cents and in august reached 987 cents a 
gallon 
a buildup in inventories due to increased refinery capacity 
helped lower prices to 974 cents in september and to 956 cents 
last month 
analysts say tight gasoline supplies are unlikely to occur again 
in 1989 even though gasoline demand is projected to grow at 
approximately 120000 barrels per day annually over the next several 
years 
with the onset of winter demand for gasoline is expected to 
decrease because people drive less during cold weather 
even if crude prices do rise substantially the full increase 
will not be passed along to the consumer at least until spring 
usually there is some lag said canes first the crude 
price is passed on in wholesale gasoline and then that gets passed 
on at the retail level it would be six to eight weeks before we 
would see a full passthrough

just a week after the nations major airlines 
raised most of their discount air fares four big carriers announced 
reductions in some of their fares 
eastern airlines and continental airlines both subsidiaries of 
texas air corp said tuesday they are cutting their fares to 
florida for travel from jan 5 through feb 15 delta air lines a 
close competitor of eastern in the market linking the northeast and 
florida said it will match the fare reductions 
northwest airlines the nations fourthlargest carrier 
announced in st paul minn that it is taking 10 percent off its 
domestic fares for passengers 62 or older a companion accompanying 
a senior citizen also is entitled to the reduction regardless of 
the companions age northwest said 
the limited fare cuts follow a move last week by the nations big 
airlines to boost most of their lowest discount fares and eliminate 
the cheap fares that can be booked a few days before a flight 
the changes which were initiated by continental and took effect 
last tuesday revamped the popular advancepurchase maxsaver 
fares used by most vacation travelers about twothirds of the 
maxsaver fares were increased while the rest were reduced 
the airlines also dropped the socalled junk fares available 
four to seven days before a flight and used mainly by business 
travelers 
in making the changes last week miamibased eastern said it 
planned to keep its fares intact in the highly competitive 
northeastflorida market its competitor delta also put off revising 
fares in the florida market 
eastern the biggest airline in the florida market with about a 
third of the passenger traffic announced tuesday it is cutting its 
maxsaver fares from the northeast to 11 florida cities by around 40 
on a roundtrip ticket the new oneway fares range from 79 to 
119 down from the current 109 to 149 
delta is matching easterns fare cuts to florida delta

be purchased within 24 hours of making a reservation 
eastern also said it is offering a 50 discount on its winter 
vacation packages to florida for travel through feb 15 
ten years of airline deregulation has taught us that price 
discounting really does work we know that discounts can 
stimulate business george brennan easterns vice president of 
marketing told a news conference in new york 
with the cheaper fares eastern is aiming to attract more 
passengers to florida in january which is not as heavily booked as 
february and march brennan said 
houstonbased continental announced similar reductions for travel 
from 17 cities in the northeast and midwest to nine florida 
destinations tickets must be bought from nov 30 through dec 16

demand in japan for americanmade hondas 
has been so strong that the company says it has increased production 
to satisfy orders for the autos which it began exporting to its 
home country earlier this year 
honda the fourthlargest automaker in the united states will 
ship 6000 twodoor accord coupes to japan by the end of this year 
up from its original estimate of 4000 according to roger lambert 
a spokesman for honda of america mfg inc 
lambert said tuesday that the first shipment which arrived in 
tokyo last spring aroused curiosity among japanese dealers and 
customers there were orders for 2000 accord coupes when the 
initial load of 540 cars was shipped 
they asked will these cars be as good as the cars that come 
out of japan he said when the first cars arrived they were 
put under the microscopeand they were very wellreceived 
reports continued to come back that orders were pouring in and 
that any increase in production would be welcome he said 
few honda dealerships in japan have the accord coupe on display 
primarily because they lack showroom space and because of the 
onemonth delivery time for the car said toshiaki mishiba a honda 
dealer in tokyo of the six dealerships in tokyo that belong to 
honda daiichi sales mishibas is the only one displaying the car 
in japan the coupe sells for 26 million yen about 21300 at 
current exchange rates a comparable car sells for from 11650 to 
15300 in the united states depending on equipment 
mishiba who has sold about 30 of the coupes since april said 
japanese buyers are attracted to the leftside steering wheel in the 
usmade honda japanese cars have the steering wheel on the right 
side 
it gives japanese an american feeling combined with confidence 
in hondas quality mishiba said with its leather seats 
aluminum wheels and americanmade bose stereo system its 
relatively cheap about 300000 yen 2500 less than a comparable 
car sold in japan 
maryann keller an analyst with furman selz mager dietz amp birney 
of new york city said that although the usmade hondas were 
selling well in japan the auto must prove it is a wellmade car 
that retains its value if the company is to reach its export growth 
goals 
the japanese customer may very well be buying this car this 
year because its new its different it has its badge of 
distinction ms keller said 
honda will export a total of 12000 cars this year including 
4500 accord fourdoor sedans to canada and 1500 of the same car to 
taiwan lambert said the company hopes to export 70000 usmade 
cars by 1991 including 50000 to japan he said 
in comparison general motors corp plans to export 80000 
vehicles worldwide by the end of the year ford motor co 42000 and 
chrysler corp 55000 
lambert said honda plans to export about the same number of 
accord coupes in 1989 as it exports this year the car is produced 
only at the marysville plant about 35 miles northwest of columbus 
in central ohio 
honda began manufacturing in the united states in september 1979 
with a motorcycle plant in marysville the auto plant at marysville 
began production of the accord fourdoor sedan in november 1982 and 
an engine plant at anna in western ohio started production in july 
1985 
the first usmade accords shipped to japan arrived there april 
8 the same day honda of americas one millionth car rolled off the 
marysville assembly line 
honda which holds 35 percent of the world auto market expects 
to produce 360000 cars at its marysville plant this year 
the civic fourdoor sedan was added to production at marysville 
in july 1986 and production of civic engines began at anna two 
months later 
near the marysville operation honda is building a new assembly 
plant that is scheduled to begin production of civic fourdoor 
sedans in fall 1989

prime computer inc has rejected a 970 million 
buyout offer mai basic four inc and said it had received an 
unsolicited overture from a third party 
prime on tuesday called the 20ashare offer from a subsidiary 
of mai which is controlled by investor bennett s 
lebowinadequate and said in a statement that primes recent 
acquisitions and consolidation measures would soon boost the 
companys performance 
we believe the unsolicited 20 offer by choice fails to 
recognize either the intrinsic value of the company today or the 
longterm values achievable by the company for all its 
stockholders said david dunn prime computers chairman 
in trading tuesday primes stock closed up 87 cents a share at 
1650 in new york stock exchange composite trading 
also tuesday prime said in a securities and exchange commission 
filing that it had received an unsolicited preliminary inquiry 
from a third party with respect to a possible negotiated business 
combination 
prime spokesman joseph gavaghan said the companys board did not 
want to disclose the source of the inquiry because it might disrupt 
potential negotiations no discussions have yet begun he said 
in a prepared statement lebow responded it is quite 
surprising that the prime board chaired by mr david j dunn a 
selfavowed advocate of shareholders rights and opponent of 
management entrenchment devices such as poison pills and golden 
parachutes would choose to stonewall the mbf offer with such 
devices 
we are opposed to their actions and will continue to pursue 
vigorously our acquisition of prime lebow said 
john adams an analyst for adams harkness amp hill in boston said 
the announcement of the thirdparty inquiry did not necessarily 
herald the arrival of a white knight bidder to thwart an mai 
takeover 
mai basic based in tustin calif owns 41 percent of primes 
485 million shares outstanding 
in its filing with the sec prime said it was not actively 
engaged in any substantive discussions or negotiations that could 
lead to a transaction such as a merger sale or purchase of assets 
or a change in primes current capitalization and dividend policy 
but might do so 
the thirdparty inquiry was made sometime between nov 15 when 
mai basic made its tender offer and nov 22 when the prime board 
voted to keep the source of the inquiry secret 
the boards unanimous decision to reject the mai bid was made in 
a meeting on monday and was announced tuesday in addition to 
rejecting the mai bid prime retained a poison pill shareholder 
rights plan designed to make unwelcome takeovers prohibitively 
expensive 
last week prime sued mai basic saying its offer was illegal and 
flawed 
some analysts have speculated that lebow has attempted the 
takeover to induce prime to buy his company 
dunn said the prime board considered several factors including 
primes business and financial condition its prospects 
recommendations from the companys financial advisers and the recent 
value of its stock before rejecting the offer 
the prime directors felt the current market price of prime common 
stock reflects the negative effects of the costs and expenses 
associated with the acquisition of computervision acquired in 
february for 435 million 
the company expects belttightening measures in certain areas to 
improve nearterm and longterm operating results of the company and 
increase values for stockholders 
prime is second to international business machines corp in the 
field of computeraided design and manufacturing systems it also 
makes sophisticated computer work stations for engineers and 
database management systems

carlos salinas de gortari who takes office as 
president on thursday will be walking a delicate line between 
inflation and deep recession between debt and investment and 
between his peoples hopes and their fears 
the staggering 102 billion foreign debt is the bestknown of 
mexicos economic problems but it is far from the only one 
mexico has gone into recession this fall partly as a result of a 
government deficit and partly as a result of efforts to control 
inflation which was over 140 per cent in 1987 
the recession is a further blow to a people who lost about half 
their buying power during six years of austerity under president 
miguel de la madrid an austerity salinas presided over as budget 
director 
the economy also has bright spots such as tremendous growth in 
nonpetroleum exports and businessmen are facing the future with 
more confidence than they did in 1982 
back then everybody was trembling afraid of what was going to 
happen next said ramon e alatorre an assistant to the president 
for howard johnson of mexico a restaurant and motel franchiser 
among other things petroleum prices had plunged mexico had run 
out of money to pay its foreign obligations and president jose lopez 
portillo had just nationalized the banks 
it was salinas who led the effort to modernize mexicos economy 
selling stateowned companies reducing subsidies and increasing 
competition all policies salinas intends to continue 
the dark side was squeezed pocketbooks and political unrest a 
boon to the opposition in the july 6 presidential elections 
salinas won but barely and says the opposition unfairly he 
is now under pressure to resume growth relieve unemployment and 
restore the damaged standard of living 
a study by a private enterprise group estimated mexicos economy 
created only 350000 jobs last year 650000 fewer than it needs to 
to keep up with the number of young people entering the job market 
every year 
the official unemployment figure is 8 percent but a study by 
salinas own institutional revolutionary party estimated the real 
rate at 14 percent other economists put it as high as 20 percent 
the latest example of the human strain came this week in the 
state of michoacan where disgruntled political opponents occupied 
city halls in 30 towns and cities and said they wanted salinas out 
we have to provide housing education sanitation and other 
basic services salinas said in a recent televised interview 
there is a growing consensus that mexico will get international 
help it will pay 14 billion in interest and principle on its 
foreign debt this year money that could have been used for 
investment in development and growth 
mexicos debt obligations should be designed subject to its 
capacity to pay under conditions of growth said a study released 
this month by the bilateral commission on the future of united 
statesmexican relations 
although salinas is aiming for a growth rate of 5 percent and 
hopes to gain 5 to 6 billion a year in fresh credits and debt 
relief he has already said he expects little growth in 1989 
a social compact between government labor and business has 
helped control prices and wages and salinas trickiest immediate 
assignment may be ending the pact without reigniting inflation 
recently close to zero 
mexico also has had capital outflow since the end of april when 
mexico boasted 162 billion in hardearned foreign exchange 
that figure was below 10 billion by october according to 
jonathan heath director of the economic forecasting firm macro 
asesoria as mexico began showing a trade deficit and spent money 
supporting the peso 
heath and other economists said many feel the financial community 
owes mexico which has done everything it was asked to do in 
revamping its economy and imposing austerity 
one sign of us confidence and support was a recent 35 billion 
loan offer to give salinas some breathing room 
oil which used to account for 90 percent of mexicos income now 
accounts for about a third a diversification in products and 
customers that has made it less vulnerable to oil price swings and 
the strength of the us economy 
mexico should be helped by higher oil prices if a recent 
agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
stands up 
alatorre the hopeful businessman says the progress made should 
not be forgotten 
they wouldnt have been able to sell aeromexico if things had 
stayed the way they were said alatorre referring to last weeks 
sale of a governmentowned airline for 345 million nobody would 
even have bought a ticket

general electric co which pleaded guilty to 
a defense department fraud charge three years ago plans to fight 
new government accusations that it intentionally shortchanged the 
army 10 million 
in a federal indictment released tuesday the government charged 
the nations thirdlargest defense contractor and two employees with 
hiding savings negotiated with subcontractors in a 270 million 
contract to make a battlefield computer system 
ge which according to the government faces a maximum penalty of 
719 million plus restitution called the charges 
sensationalized 
ge has up to now found the government to be fair as ge has 
implemented this selfpolicing program and cooperated with 
governmental authorities the company said in a statement but 
in this case where the governments indictment is both unfair 
and unfounded ge intends to defend itself at trial 
the company also said that an internal investigation into the 
same matter showed pricing discrepancies totaling 369 million 
which the company already has refunded 
thomas h lee ii first assistant us attorney responded we 
look forward to the opportunity to have a jury judge the merits of 
the case 
in washington the defense department said no decisions have been 
made as yet on whether to suspend ge from bidding on defense 
contracts worth 58 billion to the contractor last year 
the allegations will now have to be reviewed by the army 
said william caldwell a pentagon spokesman 
ge was awarded a 250 million contract in june 1983 to make the 
decentralized automated service support system called the 
das3 for the army 
the 321count indictment charges that ge through its 
whollyowned subsidiary management and technical services co 
matsco in suburban king of prussia negotiated subcontracting 
costs that were lower than it anticipated and hid them from the army 
the army would have been defrauded of 22 million if the scheme 
had not been uncovered the pentagon said 
in may 1985 ge pleaded guilty to contractfraud charges paying 
a 104 million fine and rembursing the government 800000 
according to the present indictment the company and the two 
employees james badolato of springfield and gerald a leo of king 
of prussia lied to the defense department about the prices the 
company was paying for parts and raw materials and doublebilled for 
some materials 
the government charges badolato 41 formerly the subsidiarys 
subcontracts manager with trying to cover up the scheme by altering 
dates of purchase orders and withholding information from government 
auditors leo 51 formerly the materials manager for matsco was 
also charged with lying to a federal auditor 
leo faces a maximum of 55 years in jail and 13 million in fines 
if he is convicted on one count of racketeering five counts of mail 
fraud and two counts of making false statements and concealing 
material facts from a federal agency 
badolato faces the same penalties plus 5000 more in fines if 
convicted of one count of racketeering five counts of mail fraud 
one count of obstructing agency proceedings and one count of making 
false statements and concealing material facts from a federal agency 
ge is charged with five counts of mail fraud and 312 counts of 
presenting false claims to the government 
in its statement ge said the employees maintained their 
innocence leo and badolato who have since been transferred to 
other parts of ge referred reporters to the company attorneys

george mitchell showed the style he brings to 
the post of senate majority leader when he was asked recently how 
the democratic congress would respond to george bushs call for a 
cut in the capital gains tax 
i doubt it would be enacted he quickly replied adding that 
to begin the struggle to reduce the deficit by making a proposal 
that would increase the deficit seems to me to be the wrong way to 
begin 
that said he lost no time offering the republican 
presidentelect an easy way to avoid an early confrontation 
it seems to me he could logically say to those who favor that 
position first weve got to get our fiscal house in order said 
the maine senator 
the message was clear but it was delivered without rancor it 
was partisan but not excessively so 
how much that style contributed to mitchells surprisingly easy 
victory tuesday in the contest for majority leader was unclear 
senators jealously guard their motives in such internal matters 
but when the secret ballot was tallied mitchell had 27 votes 
compared with 14 each for sens j bennett johnston of louisiana and 
daniel inouye of hawaii 
one of the things senators do best is to count votes and assess 
their meaning and as soon as the first ballot total was known 
johnston and inouye moved to declare mitchells election unanimous 
the maine senator succeeds robert c byrd of west virginia a man 
of far different temperament and style out of place in an age of 
television byrd often came across as a throwback to a time when the 
senate was a club ruled by elders who used their seniority and their 
power to dispense or withhold favors as a way of maintaining party 
discipline 
during the past two decades the senate changed markedly most 
obviously the average age plummeted it now is somewhere just below 
50 gone are the aged southern monuments to the past many senators 
are in their thirties and have young children 
they also grew up with television and recognized its power and 
ronald reagans mastery of the medium two years ago after a decade 
of resistance television entered the senate chamber and the 
democrats became more acutely aware of the need for a leader who 
would project well to americans now able to watch debates from their 
living rooms 
clearly television worked in mitchells favor as he sought 
support from his colleagues 
one of the highlights of the televised irancontra hearings was 
mitchells confrontation with marine lt col oliver north the 
former white house aide who was a central figure in the sale of arms 
to iran and the diversion of funds to the nicaraguan contras 
please remember that it is possible for an american to 
disagree with you on aid to the contras and still love god and 
still love this country just as much as you do said mitchell 
but his ability to come across well on television was not 
mitchells only asset 
the maine senator also displayed a talent for putting his finger 
on the right balance of politics and substance 
when you begin to permit political calculations to dominate the 
decisionmaking process more often than not you end up wrong 
substantively and wrong politically mitchell said during a recent 
interview in his office in the capitol 
at the same time hes aware of the political implications of this 
transition period and he sent a clear message to bush the moment he 
emerged from the democratic caucus 
the democrats await with interest and enthusiasm the proposals 
of the next administration mitchell said 
the new administration and congress are faced with record budget 
and trade deficits the republican presidentelect campaigned on a 
no new taxes pledge but most democrats and many republicans as 
well believe new revenues will be required to attain significant 
reduction in the deficit 
still no one wants to get out front advocating a tax increase 
and let the new president replay his read my lips line from the 
gop convention 
so mitchell took over his new job and nodded to the 
presidentelect and said in effect after you george

cities of more than 100000 population will be 
required to obtain federal pollution discharge permits for storm 
sewers from the environmental protection agency epa said today 
the same requirements will fall on certain large industrial 
plants with their own storm sewers but generally not plants that 
discharge into a municipal storm sewer system 
the requirements come in draft regulations required by 1987 
legislation to bring storm sewers under the agencys permit system 
several studies have shown that storm runoff and melting snow can 
pick up pesticides and fertilizers from lawns oil from garages and 
service stations and other contaminants from construction sites 
landfills junkyards construction sites and even dry cleaners 
twentyone states have listed constructionsite runoff as a major 
source of harm to stream water quality 
a major feature of the regulations will ban crossconnections 
between storm sewer systems and sanitary sewage lines these 
connections called illicit connections because they are frequently 
just that can result in the discharge of industrial process waste 
or household sewage to rivers and streams without proper treatment 
removal of these illicit connections often presents 
opportunities for dramatic improvements in the quality of 
stormsewer discharges epa said 
cities with combined sanitary and storm sewers generally older 
cities in the east are covered by a separate set of regulations 
cities will be allowed to propose their own permit conditions 
epa said that for the initial fiveyear permit terms cities would 
have to start identifying pollution sources conduct an initial 
analysis of illicit connections and describe their storm sewer 
management plans and priorities 
the plans will place heavy emphasis on optimum management 
practices including appropriate local ordinances instead of 
requiring new treatment facilities epa said 
the agency said it would hold several hearings around to country 
through february seeking comments on the draft regulations

strict economic discipline is the only way to 
overcome the mounting public debt facing some latin american 
countries said president joaquin balaguer of the dominican republic 
the problem of the public debt in latin america is the product 
of a lack of forethought balaguer said tuesday night in the first 
address at the 12th annual miami conference on the caribbean 
those governments in power happily contracted those loans and 
then without thought failed to manage funds responsibly he said 
the debt can be surmounted only through strict economic 
discipline and adjustments not through gifts or donations from 
the united states or the international monetary fund 
debt in latin america and underdeveloped countries worldwide is 
not just an economic or political problem but a human one balaguer 
said 
the greatest challenge isnt payment of the debt but sustained 
economic growth and increased per capita income said balaguer 
speaking in spanish the first challenge is to live the second 
is to pay 
we have to seek the causes of underdevelopment of the third 
world especially the latin underdevelopment he said something 
must exist that would allow some nations to advance while others 
in many cases exceptionally endowed by nature havent been able to 
reach the level that corresponds to them 
about 2000 delegates including latin and caribbean officials 
and investors from outside the region were expected to participate 
in the fourday conference on trade investment and development 
preceeding balaguer with welcoming remarks were miami mayor 
xavier suarez prime minister maria liberia peters of the 
netherlands antilles and french minister of state for foriegn 
affairs ewige avice 
we have big expectations towards the bush administration and 
the newly elected congress said ms peters adding that the 
smaller countries of the caribbean should find a way to join the 
united states and canada in their free trade agreement 
in addition to balaguer the guatemalan president vinicio cerezo 
and the prime ministers of barbados belize dominica jamaica the 
netherlands antilles st lucia and st vincent and the grenadines 
were to attend

a fund for up to 200000 victims of 
asbestosrelated disease is beginning to settle claims that are 
expected to reach 3 billion against manville corp once the 
nations largest producer of asbestos 
the company which emerged from bankruptcy protection monday is 
setting aside 80 percent of its new stock to help pay the huge 
liability bill 
the company is the former johns manville co which sought 
bankruptcy protection in 1982 with about 17000 pending 
asbestosrelated lawsuits dating to the 1960s 
as part of a courtapproved reorganization the company helped 
establish the manville personal injury settlement trust the 
bankruptcy court approved the reorganization in december 1986 
appeals by various parties delayed the effective date of the 
reorganization until this week 
the company already has settled an estimated 10000 lawsuits for 
about 500 million the trust fund is working to clean up the 
remaining 7000 that were outstanding at the time of the bankruptcy 
filing it will then take on thousands of claims filed since then 
a second trust called the property damage settlement trust 
would settle asbestosrelated property claims manville paid 100 
million cash into it and the companys insurance carriers also will 
contribute millions of dollars 
asbestos once regarded as a miracle fiber was used in scores of 
products because of its fire retardant qualities before scientists 
discovered it caused such diseases as asbestosis lung cancer and 
mesothelioma 
manville was the biggest producer but other asbestos makers and 
distributors also have been sued and many of those firms also 
sought bankruptcy protection of their assets 
the manville trust for personal injury claims is designed to last 
for 27 years 
we are in business to compensate all manville asbestos health 
claimants including current known and future victims said 
marianna smith executive director of the trust 
asbestosinduced diseases may take up to 30 years to manifest 
symptoms resulting in serious and sometimes fatal results she 
said although the exact number of claims the trust may receive is 
unknown estimates range as high as 200000 
most of the personal injury claimants have been workers in the 
asbestos industry and in industries such as shipbuilding where the 
substance was widely used 
about 3000 victims live in the philadelphia area ms smith 
said which has been a center of asbestos litigation because of the 
concentration of shipbuilding and petrochemical industries 
other regions with the same types of businesses are san 
francisco los angeles and parts of texas and mississippi 
gene locks an attorney who represents more than 5000 claimants 
said most settlements will average around 35000 some payouts 
could be more than 100000 ms smith said the payouts should 
start in december probably first to victims in the new orleans area 
where manville had a plant 
locks said he believes in excess of 3 billion will be 
available to pay victims during the next two to three decades 
the trust is the result of four years of negotiation by lawyers 
for claimants manville and the federal bankruptcy court in the 
southern district of new york which permitted manville to emerge 
from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection

in another attempt to stave off a 
transatlantic trade war us and eec officials plan to meet in 
montreal to discuss an eec plan to ban imports of us meat treated 
with growthboosting hormones 
eec external trade commissioner willy de clercq said wednesday he 
and eec agriculture commissioner frans andriessen will discuss the 
ban with us trade representative clayton yeutter and us 
agriculture secretary richard lyng on friday 
we should try everything possible and decent to avoid the 
clash de clercq told reporters 
fridays encounter will precede next weeks meeting in montreal 
to review progress in the uruguay round of global trade 
liberalization talks within the 96nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
the 12nation european economic community has complained to gatt 
about the growth hormones which it considers a health hazard and 
about us threats of retaliation 
the meat import ban is scheduled to take effect on jan 1 the 
ban would affect about 145 million annually in exports of us meat 
to the eec 
the united states argues that hormonetreated meat poses no 
health hazard as the eec contends and considers the ban a 
protectionist measure 
the united states has threatened to retaliate against imports 
from the eec which in turn has threatened a counterretaliation 
the hormone debate has been around for two years without the eec 
and the united states being able to resolve the dispute 
de clercq andriessen lyng and yeutter last discussed the issue 
at a meeting on nov 18 
de clercq denied press reports that since then the two sides have 
come nearer a compromise and gave no indication the eec was ready to 
drop the ban 
the eec has offered to exempt meat for pet food from its ban and 
raise imports of topquality us beef if it is free of hormones 
the united states has accepted the pet food proposal but has said 
the highgrade beef proposal did not remove americas fundamental 
objections to the eec ban

the eec commission seeking to cut noise 
levels near airports wednesday proposed european economic community 
airlines be banned from adding five plane models to their fleets as 
of nov 1 1990 
the proposal if adopted by the 12 eec states will prevent eec 
airlines from adding some versions of these models the dc9 boeing 
727 737 and 747 and the bac 111 
the airlines were certified before 1977 and are too noisy to 
remain in service after nov 1 1990 the commission said 
models that came into service after 1977 including the boeing 
757 and 765 and the airbus 320 meet a stricter set of internally 
accepted noise standards the commission added 
it did not propose banning all pre1977 aircraft models such as 
the airbus300 the tristar the dc 980 and the boeing 737300 
which can be reengined or fitted with hush kits to reduce their 
noise 
for the time being the commission said older aircraft that do 
not meet the strictest noise standards can still be used and sold 
in the community and outside but cannot be imported into eec 
member states from third countries 
the commission said its proposal would lead to a substantial 
cut in noise levels at eec airports 
it is the short and mediumhaul flights which tend to be 
noisiest since longhaul planes generally meet noise standards 
laid down in the convention on international civil aviation 
the commission asked the 12 eec governments for a quick decision 
the united states and the nordic countries are already working 
on new legislation for aircraft noiseif the community is to have 
an influence over the development of these plans it must take quick 
decisions on an agreed community position the commission said

the eec commission asked the european 
economic community states wednesday to recognize each others 
drivers licences establish uniform speed limits for trucks and 
buses and adopt a common maximum allowable level of alcohol in a 
drivers blood 
the proposals are part of a road safety package designed to 
reduce traffic accidets in the 12 eec nations that annually kill 
50000 people and injure 16 million others 
every year the number of people killed on our roads is 
equivalent to the population of a small town stanley clinton 
davis the eec transport commissioner said in a statement 
he proposed a drivers license issued in one eec state be valid 
in another state if its holder lives there eec nationals must now 
exchange their licences within one year after moving to another eec 
state 
clinton davis proposed these maximum speed limits throughout the 
eec 
100 kilometers per hour 621 mph for buses on express highways 
and 80 kph 497 mph on other roadways outside cities 
80 kph 497 mph for trucks on express highways and 70 kph 
434 mph on other roadways 
no uniform speed limit was given for automobiles a commission 
source said that issue was considered to be politically too 
sensitive 
up to half of all fatal road accidents involve adults who have 
been drinking and the commission proposed the eec states fix a 
maximum allowable level of alcohol in a drivers blood of 05

house speaker jim wright today called on 
presidentelect george bush to reject the suggestions of some of his 
own advisers and instead move quickly to submit his own budget plan 
to congress as a way of calming jittery financial markets 
in making the suggestion wright joined a chorus of democrats who 
in recent days have been turning up the pressure on bush to spell 
out his own ideas for cutting the federal deficit by an estimated 
35 billion in the next fiscal year 
bush has been silent on the question of whether he will submit 
his own spending plan or simply go directly into negotiations with 
congress over the 1990 budget 
under law president reagan must submit a budget for 1990 by jan 
9 while bush would have the option of submitting his own budget 
plan to congress once he takes office jan 20 as reagan did in 
1981 some of bushs advisers have been urging the presidentelect 
to skip this step 
wright and other democrats want to force bush to be specific on 
how he would cut the deficit without raising taxes and still keep 
his other campaign promises to boost spending in such areas as 
education day care and environmental cleanup 
at the beginning of a new presidential term we want very much 
to give the new president ample opportunity to address these 
problems in his own budget recommendations wright said we 
trust that he will submit those recommendations no later than the 
middle of february so that our budget committees can consider them 
carefully weigh them against the nations needs and make such 
modifications as the legislative branch is required to make in time 
for the passage of the budget resolution 
wrights comments came in remarks to the national economic 
commission a highlevel advisory group created by congress to draft 
a deficitreduction plan 
another speaker before the commission today former federal 
reserve board chairman paul volcker echoed warnings made two weeks 
ago by his successor alan greenspan that there was a growing 
urgency for the government to reduce the deficit 
volcker said the risk of doing nothing would ultimately raise the 
danger of a severe recession spreading abroad and characterized 
by strong doubt about american leadership 
the effort now must be to get the deficit down volcker said 
it is essential to support what can and should be a strong economy 
competitive in world markets and capable of many more years of 
sustained growth 
most of the witnesses before the commission warn of the economic 
dangers awaiting the country if the bush administration does not 
deal quickly with the deficit 
behind the scenes commission members are anxiously awaiting word 
from the bush camp on what role the new administration sees for the 
commission 
the first sign will be bushs choice for the final two people to 
complete the 14member advisory group supporters of the commission 
are hoping that bush will name pragmatists along the lines of bushs 
choice as budget director richard darman 
they believe that would be the best sign that bush wants to use 
the panel which was created by congress as a vehicle for crafting 
a compromise with congress to end the sevenyear stalemate over the 
budget deficit 
in an effort to reassure the markets bush has said that he sees 
attacking the deficit as his top priority but he has not provided 
any specifics on what he plans to do about it he says he will name 
his administrations negotiators with congress on his first day in 
office 
various groups have weighed in with opinions on how bush should 
attack the budget deficit which last year climbed to 1551 billion 
and is projected by many economists to hit 165 billion this year 
the council on competitiveness composed of 157 chief executives 
from business organized labor and higher education was presenting 
the deficit commission today with a list of proposals showing that 
the deficit could be trimmed by 120 billion by 1993 with a 
combination of 48 billion in spending reductions 48 billion in 
new taxes and 24 billion in savings on interest payments on the 
national debt 
john d ong chairman of bf goodrich amp co and the project 
leader for the councils report said the executives were unable to 
come up with any credible deficit reduction plan that avoided 
increasing taxes something bush has pledged not to do 
we determined that reducing the deficit on the spending side of 
the ledger alone could undermine national security and erode 
benefits for some of the nations neediest citizens ong told 
reporters at a briefing tuesday 
among the higher taxes the council suggested were a boost in 
excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol which would raise 8 billion 
annually a 20centpergallon increase in the gasoline tax which 
would raise 20 billion annually and higher income tax rates for 
families earning more than 220350 a year which could bring in 7 
billion in additional revenues the council said 
meanwhile the reagan administration is rushing to complete its 
final spending plan which must be submitted to congress on jan 9 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said tuesday that 
reagan will use his final budget to make one last effort to overhaul 
the way the government goes abou spending money including a 
recommendation to switch from oneyear to twoyear spending plans 
other longtime reagan proposals that will reappear include 
presidential authority to veto individual items in appropriations 
bills and a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget 
while reagan will leave office without getting any of his pet 
changes adopted advisers to bush have given indications the new 
administration will take up the fight for some of them in 
particular the switch to twoyear budgets

and soybeans were mostly higher in early trading today on the 
chicago board of trade but the price changes were slight due to a 
lack of significant news

a large increase in farm subsidy payments and 
bonuses to auto workers pushed americans personal income up 18 
percent in october the steepest rise in a year the government said 
today 
the commerce department said income rose 721 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 418 trillion last mont 
following modest increases of 05 percent in september and 04 
percent in august 
it was the largest increase since october 1987 when income shot 
up 20 percent also on the strength of farm subsidies 
its continuing good news said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater the economy is proceeding on an even keel 
the department attributed about half of last months increase to 
farm and auto payments excluding those factors income would have 
risen a still hefty 09 percent 
todays report is the latest in a series of indicators showing 
the economy boomed in october the unemployment rate was at a 
14year low of 53 percent factories were operating at the highest 
rate in 8 years and retailers enjoyed the strongest sales gain in 
seven months 
personal consumption spending which includes everything except 
interest payments on debt was up a robust 08 percent to an annual 
rate of 330 trillion following a weak 01 percent rise in 
september 
the biggest spending increase last month was for services up 14 
percent followed by a 06 percent increase for nondurable goods 
spending on durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years fell 06 percent 
with income rising faster than spending americans saved more 
than in any month since october 1987 the personal savings rate 
savings as a percentage of aftertax income was 52 percent up 
from 42 percent in september 
disposable or aftertax income was up 19 percent last month 
also the largest increase in a year after rising 06 percent a 
month earlier

strong 15 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 251 
trillion bolstered by a 21 percent increase in manufacturing 
salaries the auto bonuses accounted for about 60 percent of the 
manufacturing increase 
farm income rose a huge 762 percent to an annual rate of 467 
billion largely because of government payments for corn harvested 
in 1987

the chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp called today for spending 30 billion next year to shut down 
the worst losers in the savings and loan industry 
we need to close the worst first fdic chairman l william 
seidman said in a luncheon speech to the national press club 
these institutions are losing over a billion dollars per month 
seidmans agency insures deposits in commercial banks not thrift 
institutions but his agency is offering recommendations for solving 
the crisis in the savings and loan industry 
some analysts recommend tapping seidmans fund a move he 
opposes and estimate that the sampl cleanup will eventually cost 50 
billion to 100 billion 
the federal savings amp loan insurance corporation which insuring 
deposits in thrift institutions is technically insolvent 
regulators have been spending as little cash as possible putting 
together rescue packages with promissory notes and guarantees 
committing revenue they expect to receive for the next 30 years from 
an assessment on healthy sampls 
few analysts believe the industry can bear such a burden for that 
long 
seidman did not call directly for a taxpayer bailout saying 
only its up to the treasury department and congress to determine 
which alternative makes the most sense 
he said that the sampl industry certainly can contribute its 
part but added that beyond that contribution the government 
must find the resources to meet this problem 
seidmans recommendation to quickly close about 90 seriously 
insolvent sampls differs sharply from the views of the federal home 
loan bank board responsible for regulating the nations 3028 
federally insured sampls 
the bank boards approach has been to rescue most failed sampls and 
keep them open fearing that massive closings would leave some 
regions without service and devastate local economies by flooding 
the market with foreclosed real estate 
others including former presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter 
and congress general accounting office say it will be cheaper in 
the long run to spend heavily now to close failed sampls as soon as 
possible 
on tuesday bank board chairman m danny wall said sampl losses 
shrank dramatically last quarter as the federal government 
transferred the red ink onto its own books through rescues and 
closings 
sampls lost 152 billion in the julyseptember quarter down 60 
percent from losses of 382 billion in the second quarter and 393 
billion in the first he said 
wall also hinted at the recommendation his agency plans to offer 
next month for financing the sampl rescue effort 
he told reporters that the plan resembles this years rescue of 
the farm credit system which featured borrowing backed by the 
treasury and a special board including the treasury secretary to 
oversee bailout spending 
what we have on the agenda isnt far from that wall said he 
declined to elaborate 
the 927 billion in sampl losses through sept 30 already have 
topped last years postdepression record of 78 billion 
wall attributed the partial stemming of the red ink last quarter 
to the more than 140 closings and forced mergers of failed sampls so 
far this year he said the bank board hopes to have handled 200 by 
the end of the year 
some analysts and members of congress have criticized the deals 
because the bank board lacking cash to spend immediately agrees to 
absorb much of the rescued institutions future losses they say 
losses will continue to mount showing up later as obligations of 
the governments sampl deposit insurance fund rather than on the 
industrys books 
wall argues however that the rescues reduce losses by achieving 
efficiency through mergers and by eliminating insolvent 
institutions need to run up the eventual costs to the government by 
offering high interest rates to attract deposits

the eec repeated its criticism of us 
agricultural policy wednesday saying it was endangering the uruguay 
round of world trade talks within the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade 
eec external trade commissioner willy de clercq speaking of next 
weeks midterm review of the gatt talks in montreal reiterated the 
eecs longstanding objection to us insistence that all farm 
subsidies be eliminated 
the european economic community favors reducing not abolishing 
such subsidies 
i think our american friends are aware that they are calling 
into question the entire negotiation de clercq told reporters 
he said the united states which until recently insisted that 
subsidies be eliminated by the year 2000 has adjusted its target 
date 
but that has not fundamentally changed the us position he 
added 
de clercq also criticized the united states for its stand in gatt 
on tropical products a sector of prime importance to negotiators in 
the uruguay round of trade liberalization talks that began in 1986 
he said the eec had set an example for others by proposing to 
reduce barriers to imports of tropical products 
but he cautioned the eec will not cut such barriers on its own 
without parallel action by other industrialized countries such as 
the united states 
we regret that the united states has made no offer at all de 
clercq said 
he said the reagan administration continued to tie this area to 
progress in the agricultural sector terming that a dangerous 
attitude 
de clercq said he expected the montreal negotiations to be 
difficult adding the uruguay round is more of an obstacle 
course than a sprint

negotiators for the chicago suntimes and its 
newsroom employees today scheduled another round of contract 
negotiations after a clause on pensionfund contributions 
jeopardized their tentative labor pact 
a bargaining session was set for thursday morning officials said 
its progress said newspaper spokesman michael soll it 
means sitting down and reasoning again 
we hope it can be resolved said linda lenz a union 
spokeswoman and an education writer for the suntimes things will 
not drag on we are determined not to let them drag on 
the dispute revived the chance of a strike at the citys 
secondlargest newspaper 
when informed of the lastminute snag members of newspaper guild 
local 71 postponed a vote on the tentative contract late tuesday and 
told union bargainers to seek new talks 
we are disappointed that the guild did not unanimously 
recommend approval of the companys offer as it had agreed to do 
soll said today 
the companys offer included two separate pension alternatives 
with the guild having the option to select one or the other 
apparently the guild selected an alternative which it did not fully 
understand he said reading a company statement 
ratification by the locals 250 members seemed little more than a 
formality until union leaders studied specific language on pensions 
in an outline provided earlier tuesday by suntimes management 
the suntimes said the new pension formula which has increased 
contributions from the company takes effect jan 1 union 
bargainers though said they believed it would be retroactive to an 
earlier date 
neither i nor the unit chairman tom gibbons recall any 
indication made by the company about that since you dont take notes 
on things that arent said guild official gerry minkkinen 
said 
soll said management has full notes describing the agreement 
and the federal mediator agrees with the management 
but ms lenz said the federal mediators notes were silent on 
the issue similarly our guild notes do not reflect what the 
company claims they said 
a strike was planned for nov 21 but was postponed as bargainers 
tried to get a contract 
the next day bargainers reached agreement on a threeyear pact 
that offered a 500 payment in the first year followed by 3 percent 
wage increases in each of the remaining two years 
the proposed contract also included improvements in sick leave 
hospitalization maternity leave indemnification from libel 
lawsuits and minority hiring and training programs 
as a result of the new development guild spokesman daniel 
lehmann the newspapers religion reporter said another strike date 
could be set 
after tuesday nights meeting many newsroom employees were angry 
we have to have an acceptable contract said shane gericke a 
member of the negotiating committee who described the guild 
bargainers as being on a very short leash 
lehmann called the pension language one of the major elements 
of the new contract 
newsroom employees have been working without a contract since 
june 1 
the suntimes has an estimated circulation of 605000 daily and 
614000 on sundays the chicago tribunes circulation is estimated 
at 765000 daily and 111 million on sundays

opecs new oil accord alone will not be 
sufficient to raise petroleum prices to the cartels 18 per barrel 
benchmark venezuelas oil minister said wednesday 
energy minister julio cesar gil said that nonopec oil exporters 
also must reduce their output to help push prices up by roughly 6 
from current crude levels 
we cannot arrive at 18 only with the accord it is essential 
to count on the nonopec countries gil said 
gil said venezuela one of the founding members of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries will begin contacting 
nine independent nations which have indicated a willingness to work 
with opec to reduce the glut of world oil that has kept prices weak 
the nations include mexico colombia malaysia oman egypt 
china norway angola and the soviet union he said 
opec concluded its thorny winter session on sunday by agreeing to 
reduce oil production from an estimated 22 million barrels a day to 
185 million barrels the cartel hopes the new agreement will lift 
prices to the 18 level in the first half of 1989 
gil said he spoke with mexican oil minister fernando yriart 
valderrama monday and that contacts would be renewed following that 
countrys change of government on thursday 
the minister said his country also was satisfied with the 
definition of condensates adopted at the conference which includes 
an american petroleum institute weight as one of five defining 
elements 
condensates are petroleum gases which condense into liquids at 
normal atmospheric pressure venezuela produces about 180000 
barrels a day of condensates which are not included in opec oil 
output quotas 
he said the conference approved a scientific technical 
definition which is in agreement with the elements proposed by our 
experts the new definition prevents the reclassification of 
crudes as condensates he said 
but he said an api grade ranging between 45 and 50 degrees is one 
of five factors opec experts will take into account when defining a 
condensate earlier venezuela had insisted on a definition that did 
not include an api grade 
he said the definition also allowed for an intermediate 
product which would be a temporary crude or a temporary 
condensate other elements include gasliquid ratios and octane 
ratings he said 
gil praised opecs new 185 million barrel production agreement 
as giving opec again the credibility that it is capable of 
organizing the world oil market 
he said the conference decided that oil loans between opec 
members would be credited to the quota of the receiving nation 
gil said venezuela hoped to increase its oil export revenue next 
year by between 15 and 2 billion as a result of higher oil prices 
and its new 164 million barreladay quota 
the new quota represents a 65000 barrel increase over the old 
one but a reduction in venezuelas share of total opec production to 
88 percent from 95 percent 
venezuelas income from oil petrochemicals and coal this year is 
expected to be around 71 billion assuming an average price of 
about 1350 per barrel which does not include tuesdays price hike 
of one dollar per barrel for some of venezuelas exports he said

wall street leaders are increasingly 
concluding and admitting that they arent going to win their 
decadelong battle to keep banks out of the stocks and bonds 
business 
the latest sign of their retreat from the lobbying effort came 
here wednesday when the head of the streets main trade group said 
the organization no longer opposes repeal of the glasssteagall act 
of 1933 
the measure one of many financial reforms instituted in the 
depression set sharp boundaries between the financial services that 
banks and brokers could offer 
but in more recent times institutions of both types have been 
making intense assaults on each others turf 
the securities industry association would like to see 
glasssteagall resolved said its chairman john bachmann who is 
also managing principal of the brokerage firm edward d jones amp co 
in st louis 
wed like to get that behind us he said 
the sias current position now closely matches that of many 
regulators who argue that glasssteagall restrictions have outlived 
their usefulness and are unnecessarily restrictive 
addressing the groups annual convention wednesday chairman alan 
greenspan of the federal reserve board repeated his belief that it 
is in the public interest that banks no longer be so circumscribed 
in their securities activities 
the brokerage group qualifies its apparent acquiescence to this 
form of deregulation for example the brokers argue that firms of 
any type that take bank deposits and also sell securities like 
stocks do so through separate subsidiaries kept apart by firm 
protective barriers the brokers say bankers should not be able to 
use federal deposit insurance for instance to gain a competitive 
advantage in marketing relatively risky investments like stocks 
the sia also urges that financial firms of all varieties be 
subject to regulation by business 
in other words bank activities involving stocks and bonds would 
be overseen by the securities and exchange commission which now 
regulates traditional brokerage activities 
edward obrien the sias president said any move to dismantle 
glasssteagall should proceed at a careful pace in the context of 
other financial problems in particular he said regulators probably 
ought to deal first with the issue of numerous troubled savings and 
loan institutions

honda plans to increase its exports of 
americanmade cars from 12000 this year to 70000 in 1991 a move 
that some analysts see as an effort to enter the european market 
honda of america mfg inc expects to export 50000 cars to japan 
that year and 20000 to other countries not yet specified company 
spokesman roger lambert said honda earlier this year began 
exporting usbuilt twodoor accord coupes to its home country 
the accord coupe is produced only at the marysville plant about 
35 miles northwest of columbus in central ohio 
europe would be a likely market for honda of america to

philadelphia said wednesday american companies stand to benefit 
from lowered economic trade barriers that would result from the 
merger of europe into a single market by 1992 
where else would you go with them franck said there are 
no barriers for american exports in europe in 1992 that i know of 
under the current system american companies are faced with 
differing regulations in each of the 12 countries in the european 
community 
franck said the export of hondas serves the companys auto supply 
needs in japan but also is an attempt to diffuse the idea of 
shipping to europe they have been evasive in that area 
lambert said honda of america does not yet know which countries 
to target for its 1991 exports 
maryann keller an analyst with furman selz mager dietz amp birney 
of new york city also said honda would be interested in the 
european market 
the specter of americanmade japanese cars is something that 
the europeans would find to be very paranoid about she said 
who wants to have more competition 
honda of america has been exporting motorcycles to world markets 
including europe since 1980 it also exports fourdoor accord 
sedans to taiwan and canada the company plans to ship 4500 cars to 
canada and 1500 to taiwan this year 
honda the fourthlargest automaker in the united states expects 
to ship 6000 accord coupes to japan by the end of this year up 
from its original estimate of 4000 
lambert said there has been strong demand for the car with 
orders for 2000 accord coupes when the initial load of 540 cars 
arrived last april he said the cars aroused curosity in dealers and 
customers 
they asked will these cars be as good as the cars that come 
out of japan he said when the first cars arrived they were 
put under the microscope and they were very wellreceived 
in japan the coupe sells for 26 million yen about 21300 at 
current exchange rates a comparable car sells for 11650 to 
15300 in the united states depending on equipment 
toshiaki mishiba a honda dealer in tokyo who has sold about 30 
of the coupes since april said japanese are attracted to the 
leftside steering wheel in the usmade honda japanese cars have 
the steering wheel on the right side 
it gives japanese an american feeling combined with confidence 
in hondas quality mishiba said with its leather seats 
aluminum wheels and americanmade bose stereo system its 
relatively cheap about 300000 yen 2500 less than a comparable 
car sold in japan 
ms keller said the accord coupe a new model this year must 
prove it is a wellmade car that retains its value if the company is 
to reach its export growth goals 
the japanese customer may very well be buying this car this 
year because its new its different it has its badge of 
distinction ms keller said 
honda began manufacturing in the united states in september 1979 
with a motorcycle plant at marysville the auto plant at marysville 
began production of the accord fourdoor sedan in november 1982 and 
an engine plant at anna in western ohio started production in july 
1985 
the civic fourdoor sedan was added to production at marysville 
in july 1986 and production of civic engines began at anna two 
months later 
near the marysville operation honda is building a new assembly 
plant that is scheduled to begin production of civic fourdoor 
sedans in the fall of 1989

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade with substantial 
gains in soybean and nearmonth corn futures partially linked to 
firstnotice day for the december contracts 
wednesday was the first day on which traders could formally 
announce their intention to deliver wheat corn oats soybean oil 
and soybean meal against the contracts for delivery in december 
firstnotice days frequently are characterized by sharp price 
movements because most traders play the market with no intention of 
making or taking physical delivery of commodities analysts said 
there is no contract for december delivery of soybeans but the 
rally in the soybean meal and oil pits helped boost soybean futures 
said cathy leow an assistant vice president of research with 
thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
dry weather in the south american soybean belt also contributed 
to the rise in soybean futures prices she said 
at the close of trading wheat was cent lower to 1 cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 424 a bushel corn 
was 1 cents to 4 cents higher with december at 261 a bushel

dow jones amp co inc said wednesday it has agreed 
to sell its 17 percent interest in continental cablevision inc to 
the privatelyheld cable television operators chairman for 2998 
million 
continental cablevision is based in boston and is the nations 
thirdlargest cable operator with about 23 million subscribers in 
15 states 
dow jones said it had agreed to sell its stake in the company for 
270 a share to chairman amos hostetter who is also chief executive 
it said under terms of the 1981 agreement in which it bought the 
stake dow jones must offer the company the right to repurchase its 
shares on the same terms as agreed upon with hostetter robert 
sachs senior vice president for continental cablevision said its 
board has not yet considered the matter 
dow jones which publishes the wall street journal barrons 
magazine and provides electronic business information services said 
it had purchased a 245 percent stake in continental cablevision in 
1981 for 25 a share 
it subsequently sold part of that interest to the company in 1986 
for 100 million according to dow jones spokesman james ambrosio 
dow jones said its decision to sell the rest of its interest 
reflected the attractive gain in price of its stake compared 
with what it paid in 1981 
the company said it expects the deal to be closed in january 
1989 and said it plans to use the anticipated 193 million in 
aftertax proceeds to reduce its debt and for other unspecified 
corporate purposes 
according to paul kagan associates inc a media research company 
based in carmel calif continental cablevision ranked third among 
the nations multiplesystem cable operators with nearly 23 million 
subscribers at the end of august 
the two largest operators are telecommunications inc based in 
denver with 43 million subscribers and american television and 
communications corp controlled by new yorkbased time inc with 
39 million subscribers according to the kagan ranking 
sachs said continental cablevision founded in 1963 has cable 
systems in 450 communities across the country including sizeable 
operations in new england ohio california florida and michigan

centel corp put its cable television unit on the 
auction block wednesday two months after buying out a group of 
dissident shareholders for 925 million and seven months after 
declaring it was not selling any of its businesses 
chairman john p frazee jr said divestment of the centel cable 
television co would allow centel to concentrate on its telephone 
operations which include local exchange service in nine states and 
a fastgrowing mobile cellular communications business that operates 
in 13 states 
analysts estimated the value of centel cable at 14 billion 
centel said in a statement that proceeds from the sale would be used 
to repurchase shares and reduce indebtedness 
but frazee denied any connection between the decision to sell 
centel cable and the more than 850 million that centel paid out in 
the past year to extend the reach of its cellular division and fight 
a takeover battle 
we cant be all things we cant be as large in each one of 
these three businesses as we would like to be frazee said in a 
telephone interview from his chicago office 
we believe this decision will allow our shareholders to receive 
full value from our cable television investment frazee said 
more importantly it will enable us to refocus our attention on 
those businesses that have tremendous potential for enhancing 
sharehoulder value 
frazee would not speculate on the potential sale price of centel 
cable which serves more than 550000 subscribers in florida 
illinois indiana kentucky michigan and ohio 
centel cable ranks 22nd among the top 50 us cable operators and 
should fetch about 25 per subscriber or about 14 billion said 
paula greer an industry analyst with paul kagan associates inc of 
carmel calif 
ms greer said in an interview from her office in mount clemens 
mich that federal regulations prohibit companies from owning both 
cable and telephone services in the same market so it does make 
sense that they would sell off the cable and concentrate on their 
core business which is telephone operations 
centel cable accounted for 130 million of centels 148 
billion in revenues last year and has been an industry leader in 
deploying new technologies such as payperview and fiber optics 
centel said 
local telephone service provides the bulk of centels revenues 
accounting for nearly 825 million in sales last year 
last spring centel purchased united telespectrum inc the 
cellular subsidiary of kansas city mobased united 
telecommunications for 763 million plus 95 million in united 
telespectrum debt 
centel spent much of this year waging a proxy battle against its 
largest shareholders new yorkbased investors asher b edelman and 
george lindemann who sought to break up the company and sell the 
pieces frazee had said in april that none of centels businesses 
were for sale 
shareholders rejected the dissidents takeover bid and in 
september edelman and lindemann sold their 55 percent stake back 
to centel 
centel still is seeking a buyer for its business telephone 
systems business which has been on the block since late may

sentiment pulled it down from gains posted earlier in trading in 
europe gold prices rose 
it was a war between the bulls and the bears said zlatko 
glamuzina chief currency dealer of banco di sicilia in new york

that the federal reserve would push up us interest rates to 
control inflation but a report to the federal reserve on wednesday 
said there was no indication that inflation was getting out of hand 
glamuzina said 
in addition to the report to the fed the dollar was hurt by a 
big sell order and by action by the bank of england whose attempts 
to keep the british pound from rising against the west german mark 
had the effect of pressuring the dollar glamuzina said 
foreignexchange dealers said trading was light and traders were

hesitant 
the volume is better but not at levels where one would think 
theres a lot of confidence or aggressive buying said robert 
colby a market analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
many traders were keeping a low profile in advance of fridays

the fed will raise the discount rate if the jobless figure remains 
low in october the unemployment rate was 53 percent 
despite traders hestitancy analysts said they detected a better 
tone in the market over the past few days 
colby noting that stocks managed a small gain on monday after 
major banks raised their prime lending rates said the market 
acted well in the face of bad news

wednesday amid encouraging signs about the latest opec agreement 
on the new york mercantile exchange the january contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil settled 40 
cents higher at 1532 a barrel near its high for the day of

prices 
nonopec oilproducing countries are showing signs of wanting to 
cooperate with opec countries to help reduce the glut of oil on 
world markets said bob baker an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc 
thats very important psychologically baker said its not 
that nonopec countries are going to cut back much but it could 
show some positive response 
in addition the oil minister from the united arab emirates 
continued to make efforts to soften remarks he made on monday that 
his country did not consider its new opec production quota the 
official quota 
on monday the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
signed a new agreement to limit the cartels production to 185 
million barrels a day from the present level of around 225 million 
the cartel also maintained its benchmark price of 18 a barrel 
which it hopes to achieve in the first half of 1989 
analysts said wednesdays oil futures prices also were helped by 
bullish weekly statistics on us inventories from the american 
petroleum institute and the expiration of the december contracts on 
the mercantile exchange

gasoline inventories gasoline stocks dropped 25 million barrels 
last week and crude stocks fell 26 million

buying interest accelerated as the price approached 600 analysts 
said

where the market had been having trouble said craig sloane

that you were in a different ball game 
strong psychological resistance was cracked at the 600 mark

mercantile exchange on mostly technical buying inspired by the 
february contracts rise above 4350 cents a pound last weeks high 
that brought in a tremendous amount of buying and it just 
perpetuated itself said paul hare a livestock market analyst 
with linnco futures inc in chicago 
hog futures rallied in sympathy with the pork bellies while 
cattle futures retreated also on technically inspired selling he 
said 
live cattle settled unchanged to 78 cent lower with december at 
7232 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 28 cent lower 
with january at 8242 cents a pound hogs were 25 cent to 37 cent 
higher with december at 3982 cents a pound frozen pork bellies

days of higher prices on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
sugar settled 19 cent to 28 cent lower with march at 1107 
cents a pound

chicago board of trade with substantial gains in soybean and 
nearmonth corn futures partially linked to the peculiarities of

opecs agreement to limit production and 
boost prices is good news to independent oil patch producers but 
most call the pact more of a lifesupport system than a cure for the 
ailing domestic industry 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
agreed monday to limit productin to 185 million barrels a day and 
bring prices back up near 18 a barrel beginning in january 
analysts estimate that the cartel currently pumps about 225 million 
barrels a day 
opec president rilwanu lukmans assertion that crude oil prices 
could reach 18 by june comes as good news to texas oil producers 
who have seen prices gyrate in 1988 west texas intermediate the 
us benchmark crude fell to 1375 a barrel in october from a high 
of 1792 in april 
it looks very encouraging said bill kleine president of 
permian corp a producer based in midland texas 
but because opec members agreed on the production ceiling only 
for six months the pact isnt expected to improve the longterm 
environment for domestic producers oil leaders say 
while the prospect of 18abarrel oil will benefit small 
independent producers in the short term those producers will 
continue to struggle in an uncertain environment said mickey 
thompson the oklahoma independent petroleum associations vice 
president for governmental affairs 
even at 18 a barrel were not looking at a major resurgence 
as far as exploration or drilling he said 
but were not about to look a gift horse in the mouth either 
it may at least keep us alive for another six months 
immediately following the announcement several large purchasers 
of crude raised their posted prices some by as much as 2 a barrel 
phillips petroleum co increased the price it will pay producers 
in the texas and oklahoma panhandles to 1425 a barrel from 1225 
while marathon oil hiked its posted prices by 2 to 1475 
thats an extremely hopeful sign that prices will one 
stabilize somewhat and two increase thompson said we need a 
shot in the arm 
but unless prices rise above 20 domestic drilling activity 
wont show much of an increase with or without the opec agreement 
said don l evans president of tmbrsharp drilling co in midland 
its a hopeful sign but as far as translating into a dramatic 
increase in the rig count it doesnt equal that he said i 
dont see that changing budgets dramatically for 1989 
major producers such as phillips and conoco inc also take a 
cautious view toward the pact 
we dont make our plans on the assumption that opec is going to 
do one thing or another said al hegburg phillips director for 
international affairs and government relations we dont adjust 
our strategy according to what opec does we just watch with 
interest 
but texas railroad commissioner kent hance who attended part of 
the opec meetings in vienna austria is more optimistic about the 
agreement saying it should boost drilling activity stabilize oil 
prices at between 16 and 18 a barrel within two months and help 
state revenues 
this is not going to be a boon for the energy industry in 
texas said the member of the body that regulates the states oil 
and gas industry but its certainly not going to be a bust

farm workers who are in the country illegally faced a midnight 
wednesday deadline to apply for residency and immigration officials 
said many have provided false documentation in a desperate attempt 
to avoid deportation 
were concerned that there are high levels of fraud in the 
program said duke austin a spokesman for the immigration and 
naturalization service in washington 
the ins had estimated that 600000 farm workers would apply under 
the program part of the 1986 immigration act but the figure topped 
1 million by the first week of november and up to 200000 more were 
expected before the deadline the ins said 
lines formed at many offices wednesday and officials said they 
were prepared for a lastminute flood of applicants ins offices 
nationwide would stay open until midnight austin said 
under the initial phase of the immigrant legalization program 
that ended may 4 temporary residency was granted to more than 17 
million illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the united 
states since jan 1 1982 
under the farm laborer phase foreign farmhands must prove they 
harvested perishable crops in the united states for a total of at 
least 90 days from may 1 1985 to may 1 1986 those accepted will 
receive temporary residency status and eventually will be able to 
apply for permanent status 
but many of those unable to prove they worked on farms have 
resorted to fraud leading to a market in forged documents 
officials said 
we actually have developed a complete file system with about 50 
people or organizations who are indicated as vendors of fraudulent 
documents said francis siciliano acting chief legalization 
officer of the phoenix ins office where over 52000 applications 
were expected 
theyre going for 100 200 300 ive even heard of 2500 
for a packet of documents he said 
austin said one source of these illegal documents are farm labor 
contractors who hire illegal immigrants 
in liberal kan five people were arrested late tuesday and 
early wednesday for selling fraudulent employment letters to illegal 
aliens said ron sanders district ins director in kansas city 
about 60 percent of the applications filed in arizona are being 
recommended for denial officials said but that doesnt mean that 
that many will ultimately be rejected siciliano said a 
recommendation for denial simply means the application needs further 
checking 
in the northeast more than 40 percent of the almost 20000 
applications were recommended for denial said amy otten an ins 
spokeswoman in burlington vt 
louis d crocetti director of the baltimore ins office said 
many whose applications were rejected there had tried to pass as 
farm workers after missing the may 4 cutoff for nonfarm workers 
weve had people who said they picked baked beans or used 
ladders to pick cucumbers he said they dont even rehearse 
what theyre going to say 
more than half the applications under the program or about 
500000 have come from california followed by florida with about 
10 percent and texas with about 8 percent officials said 
significant numbers have also been filed in the northwest arizona 
and new york 
in new orleans applicants were waiting at the door of the ins 
office wednesday morning 
i dont know why people have waited until the last day said 
charles v williams the offices chief legalization officer 
at the fresno calif ins office two illegal aliens explained 
their procrastination 
francisco ruiz 29 said he had great difficulty obtaining his 
birth certificate from mexico he said he sent for the document in 
may but it arrived just two weeks ago 
pedro enriquez said he delayed applying because he didnt have 
the money until wednesday for the 185 application fee 
the houston ins office opened at midnight tuesday to handle the 
expected crowds after lines earlier that day stretched around the 
block 
weve taken in over 900 people so far richard rios the 
office director said wednesday morning by midnight we expect to 
have had about 1500 people in a 24hour period 
the deadline comes without the fanfare of the one in may during 
the last month of that yearlong application period the ins as well 
as private groups put out the word on radio television 
billboards newspapers and pamphlets 
antonio bustomonte a legal aid attorney in phoenix who works 
with farm workers said that for every person who applies there 
is at least one more who didnt 
the ins made no effort to reach farm workers had no game 
plan he said 
dick perry deputy director of the ins phoenix district disputed 
bustomontes claim and said the agency had done a good job at 
spreading the word 
one illegal alien applying wednesday for resident status in lima 
pa said receiving the permit was a matter of life and death for 
his wife and four children in mexico 
if i dont theyll die of hunger said jose villagomez 36 
a mushroom worker in kennett square pa who sends money to his

rjr nabisco incs management threw the 
highstakes takeover auction for the company into total confusion 
wednesday by boosting its offer to more than 243 billion in a 
stunning postdeadline drive to nose out rival bids for the 
foodandtobacco giant 
the fatter offer from the group led by chief executive f ross 
johnson topped its 227 billion proposal submitted at 5 pm 
tuesday which was the deadline the company had established for 
final bids 
the move sent rjrs stock roaring higher partly in anticipation 
that the unprecedented auction might be prolonged yet again 
rjr outside directors conducting the auction said earlier in the 
day that they were evaluating all bids and an announcement would 
come later but johnsons surprise delayed the directors 
deliberations and their intentions were unclear by late wednesday 
there also was no word from johnsons main competitors in the 
historic takeover fight buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co and the investment firm first boston corp 
but sources familiar with the bidding said they understood 
kohlberg also may have raised its offer after the deadline in a 
frantic effort to stay in the race those sources said johnsons 
group may have raised its offer even higher to as much as 2475 
billion neither report could be confirmed 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified also 
said first boston was still in the auction contrary to some reports 
that said it had withdrawn 
the sources said first bostons bid was valued at between 103 
and 115 a share or 2317 billion and 2587 billion but was 
considered more tentative than the others and given practically no 
chance of success 
they said that before johnsons lastminute offer kohlberg 
appeared to be the winner with its own sweetened bid of more than 
231 billion kohlberg was so confident it had triumphed that the 
firms senior officers were said to be standing by to arrange press 
interviews 
the events led many speculators and securities analysts watching 
the biggest takeover fight in history to conclude that it wasnt 
over 
weve got an auction going said john maxwell a strategist 
at wheat first securities in richmond va if you were an rjr 
director would you say everything is closed goodbye i dont see 
how they can really close it down for a while they dont have to 
decide right away theres no rule 
although johnsons move came as a surprise it wasnt 
inconsistent with the unpredictable takeover brawl that already has 
smashed all records and raised major concerns about the frenzied 
level of dealmaking on wall street 
the management group said in a brief statement that it was 
prepared to offer 108 a share for the company vs the 101 a share 
offer submitted tuesday 100 a share offer of nov 18 84 a share 
offer of nov 4 and 75ashare opening salvo oct 20 that 
precipitated the takeover struggle 
the group said the latest offer included 84 a share in cash 
preferred stock it valued at 20 and additional preferred stock it 
valued at 4 convertible into 15 percent of the common stock in the 
acquired company 
johnsons group also promised unspecified protection to rjrs 
employees and said they were prepared to further negotiate all 
aspects of their proposal including price 
sources familiar with the kohlberg bid said it was worth 103 a 
share vs its earlier 94ashare offer the cash component of the 
latest bid was said to be about 95 
a crucial element of each proposal is the portion of cash each 
bidder intends to pay because the value of the securities segment 
is difficult to determine these securities often are worth less 
than their face amount 
rjr stock surged in frantic new york stock exchange trading and 
the big board briefly halted it when buy orders overwhelmed sell 
orders the stock resumed trading by midafternoon and closed up 
225 to 93 on volume exceeding 67 million shares 
rjr stock was trading at less than 56 a share when the battle 
began in late october 
johnsons group incited the battle in october when he proposed to 
take the nations 19thlargest industrial company private by 
borrowing massive amounts of money to acquire all rjr shares a 
transaction known as a leveraged buyout 
rjrs board of directors then put the company up for sale to 
attract rival bids and conducted the first round of an auction nov 
1820 they decided to prolong it because the offers received were 
too vague and inadequate 
based in atlanta rjr is one of the largest consumer products 
companies with more than 120000 employees it makes wellknown 
brands that range from camel cigarettes to shredded wheat cereal to 
life savers mints

the federal trade commission ended its 
antitrust probe of the proposed 126 billion merger of philip 
morris cos inc and kraft inc on wednesday after news reports 
that it was still investigating the deal generated widespread 
investor concern 
the commission formally ended its probe a day after the mandatory 
waiting period for the takeover ended 
normally closing an antitrust investigation is a routine matter 
attracting little public attention the two companies had issued a 
statement tuesday that the legal waiting period had ended without 
the government challenging their merger plans 
but at a routine press briefing on wednesday ftc chairman 
daniel oliver and agency officials declined to discuss details of 
the case stating that they could not comment because the matter 
remained open 
that sparked speculation that the agency might be preparing to 
take action against the planned takeover and prompted officials to 
call news media to clarify their position and the full commission 
met by the end of the day and voted to close the matter 
its fairly routine to keep investigations open beyond 
thewaiting period ending the waiting period doesnt mean the 
investigation is auotmatically closed said patrick m sheller an 
aide to oliver 
but sheller and ftc spokeswoman anna davis stressed that keeping 
the investigation open did not indicate any action was pending 
when large companies plan to merge they must inform the 
commission and justice department and then wait 30 days before 
completing the action to give the government time to act if it deems 
the marger anticompetitive 
but even after a merger is completed the commission still can 
take legal action to undo the combination 
sheller said the normal procedure is for the staff to come to the 
fivemember commission at some point with a recommendation on 
whether to approve the merger then the commission itself votes on 
that recommendation and either commences lagal action or sends the 
companies a formal notice closing the investigation

tyson foods inc on wednesday sweetened 
its buyout offer for holly farms corp but made completion of the 
deal contingent on the elimination of key terms of holly farms 
merger with conagra inc 
the nations biggest poultry processor boosted its cash tender 
offer to 54 a share or about 11 billion for holly farms 204 
million outstanding common shares and equivalents from 52 a share 
or about 106 billion 
tyson stated in a letter to the board of memphis tennbased 
holly farms that the offer was subject to termination or 
invalidation of holly farms agreement to sell conagra some of its 
prize assets if acquired by a third company such as tyson and to 
pay conagra a bustup fee if their deal fell through 
tyson also offered to pay cash and stock it valued at 57 a share 
for control of holly farms under a twostep buyout if the company 
terminated its merger with conagra and negotiated a new agreement 
with tyson 
the company said it remained willing to revise its new proposals 
and threatened to put the latest offers directly before shareholders 
if holly farms continued its refusal to negotiate 
a holly farms spokesman at the companys headquarters was said to 
be unavailable for comment conagra spokesman walt casey said the 
latest tyson offer doesnt change our expectations of being able 
to acquire holly farms conagra has valued its proposal for holly 
farms at about 1 billion 
holly farms has rejected tysons previous takeover offers and on 
nov 16 agreed to a stock swap merger with omaha nebbased conagra 
that the holly farms board valued at 5925 a share that merger 
with holly farms the nations secondlargest poultry processor 
would make conagra the nations biggest poultry concern 
in agreeing to the merger holly farms granted conagra a 
socalled lockup option to buy key holly farms assets in the 
event a third company acquires holly farms it also agreed to pay 
conagra a 15 million bustup fee if their merger falls through 
tyson is challenging those provision in delaware chancery court 
and in wednesdays letter again attacked them as reflecting a 
bidding process that was a sham calculated to deliver holly farms 
at any price to the bidder favored by management 
we ask that you consider our increased tender offer price and 
our merger proposalin light of certain undeniable facts namely 
that the lockup option and the termination fee provisions resulted 
from a process which was neither fair nor an auction and clearly was 
not intended to maximize value for holly farms stockholders 
chairman don tyson said in the letter 
holly farms stock closed at 5350 a share up 1 in new york 
stock exchange trading tyson dipped 50 cents a share to 1550 in 
national overthecounter trading 
under the twostep transaction tyson proposed it would pay 53 
cash and onequarter share of tyson stock worth about 387 at 
wednesdays price for 93 percent of holly farms outstanding 
shares or about 1898 million shares the remaining shares would be 
converted into 356 shares of tyson stock worth 5518 based on 
wednesdays price in a subsequent merger 
if its amended tender offer is accepted tyson said it could be 
in position to close the deal as early as dec 16 when the offer is 
scheduled to expire the second step could be completed early next 
year tyson said 
tyson also demanded that it be furnished all written information 
furnished to conagra

texaco inc agreed wednesday to plead guilty 
to federal felony charges stemming from failure to test safety 
equipment on an offshore oil rig and pay a 750000 fine 
the companys texaco usa subsidiary was charged along with a 
former oil rig supervisor and a drilling contractor with delaying 
for two days a required weekly test of a device that prevents deadly 
blowouts of pressurized natural gas during drilling 
this certainly signals our commitment to see that offshore 
drilling operations are conducted safely and legally said 
assistant us attorney janet goldstein a member of the justice 
departments environmental crime section who is prosecuting the case 
it is the first criminal prosecution under provisions of the 
offshore drilling act that took effect in 1978 she said 
no accident or other damage took place because of the testing 
delays at the companys platform harvest off the california coast in 
december 1986 texaco said the company blamed the violations on the 
supervisor who was fired 
a criminal complaint filed in us district court charges texaco 
with two counts of violating the outer continental shelf lands act 
one count for each day the test was delayed 
robert r brogdin 48 of bakersfield a former supervisor on the 
platform 11 miles off point conception also was charged with two 
counts of violating the act 
texaco which could be fined up to 1 million agreed to pay 
750000 in a plea bargain filed simultaneously with the charges 
brogdin who could be imprisoned for 20 years and fined 500000 
also pleaded guilty but prosecutors didnt make a sentencing 
recommendation 
in a separate indictment returned wednesday by a federal grand 
jury the contractor helmerich amp payne international drilling co 
of tulsa okla was charged with six counts of violating the act 
said ms goldstein two counts concern the delayed test and four 
other counts stem from alleged falsification of documents on earlier 
tests of the blowout preventer 
the company which also has a ventura office declined to 
negotiate a plea she said 
calls to helmerich amp paynes california office wednesday evening 
rang unanswered and an employee who answered the phone in tulsa 
refused to call a spokesman at home brogdin isnt listed in the 
bakersfield directory 
blowouts occur during drilling when equipment cannot contain 
pressurized natural gas that is found along with oil deposits under 
the seabed a blowout would imperil the oil rig crew and could cause 
an environmentally disastrous spill ms goldstein said 
according to texaco brogdin allowed helmerich amp payne to delay 
tests of the blowout preventer dec 29 and 30 1986 because of an 
equipment problem tests are required every seven days under the 
drilling act which is administered by the interior departments 
minerals management service 
higher texaco officials learned of the violations jan 6 1987 
and fired brogdin 10 days later said robert hammond a spokesman in 
the companys universal city office 
investigations by the minerals management service and the justice 
department support texacos contention that it didnt condone such 
behavior hammond said 
the platform is off point conception 125 miles north of los 
angeles

westinghouse electric corp bracing for an 
expected lawsuit by the philippines said wednesday the dispute 
stems from politically motivated opposition to the nuclear power 
plant it built under former president ferdinand marcos 
the government of president corazon aquino has said it plans to 
sue westinghouse for damages and breach of contract regarding the 
23 billion plant which never went into operation because of 
alleged safety defects 
a formal announcement of the suit was scheduled in manila for 
230 pm local time 130 am est at the presidential palace 
the government says the plant 60 miles northwest of manila in 
bataan province is unsafe partly because of its design and its 
location on an earthquake fault and near a volcano 
the reactors opponents also allege that bribes were paid over 
the awarding of the prime contract for the plant 
what were finding here are the results of a political policy 
that came to life when they were running for office said 
nathaniel d woodson general manager of the westinghouse nuclear 
fuels unit they now feel they have a political albatross around 
their neck and theyre trying to blame us 
president aquinos legal adviser adolfo azcuna said in late 
october that the suit was ready and likely would be filed within a 
month in the united states 
in addition a standstill agreement barring either the government 
or the company from taking legal action was to expire thursday 
woodson and deputy general counsel louis j briskman said 
philippines officials have acknowledged during private talks that no 
matter how safe the plant is they dont intend to allow nuclear 
power production in the country 
with all but 20 million to 30 million still due from manila for 
the power plant westinghouse could walk away from the 10yearold 
controversy said woodson the bigger risk could be damage to the 
companys international standing as a designer and builder of 
nuclear power plants 
all over the world we have built plants and we havent had 
this problem if they dont want to operate this plant thats their 
decision but dont make westinghouse a scapegoat he said 
westinghouse will not be a scapegoat 
the company cites investigations by the us justice department 
and the securities and exchange commission which produced no 
evidence to warrant charges 
a safety study commissioned by the aquino government a draft of 
which was published by a trade journal concluded that the plant is 
safe westinghouse said but the government says the final report 
concludes otherwise although officials have refused to release the 
document 
the 620megawatt plant powered by a westinghouse pressurized 
water reactor was completed three years ago 
the project early on was shaken by allegations of kickbacks to 
officials of the marcos regime and by safety concerns 
communist rebels have bombed the transmission towers leading from 
the plant and people have cut and sold the copper lines as scrap 
the plants corps of operators has largely disbanded and 
westinghouse has only a handful of employees still in the 
philippines woodson said 
furthermore the cost of the plant continues rising westinghouse 
said interest on the loans the philippines government took to build 
the plant cost an estimated 300000 per day

pillsbury co said wednesday it has sent a 
letter to grand metropolitan plc chairman allen sheppard saying that 
a 60ashare takeover offer is inadequate and a meeting between 
officials of the two companies would therefore serve no 
purpose 
following many hours of study with the advice and assistance 
of four respected financial advisers the board has unanimously 
determined that your 60pershare offer is financially inadequate 
and not in the best interests of pillsbury and its shareholders 
philip l smith pillsburys chairman and chief executive officer 
said in the letter 
this conclusion is confirmed not only by pillsburys own 
internal analysis and the advice of its financial advisors but also 
by the advice of your advisers who have put values in the high 60s 
to low 70s on pillsbury in documents that were disclosed publicly 
in open court by your counsel smith wrote 
sheppard responded in a letter wednesday to smith by 
reiterating his desire for a meeting and contending that pillsburys 
characterization of grand mets offer as inadequate was flawed 
sheppard called the offer at the high end of the range of fair 
values for pillsbury based on analysis by grand mets investment 
advisers and noted that pillsburys advisers variously have valued 
the company in the 50 a share range 
grand met a british liquor gambling and speciality products 
conglomerate launched its 523 billion hostile takeover bid oct 
4 pillsburys board of directors has rejected it as inadequate and 
has refused to meet with sheppard 
in a nov 22 letter to smith sheppard said grand met would like 
a full and frank discussion with pillsbury executives of grand 
mets allcash offer 
sheppard told smith that although he has no reason to believe 
that our 60pershare offer is not fair and fully priced i remain 
prepared to negotiate all aspects of the proposal including price 
in his response smith told sheppard your reluctance to 
provide a higher offer cannot be excused by saying you wont bid 
against yourself the pillsbury board will only endorse an offer for 
pillsbury which reflects the values inherent in the company your 
current offer does not 
on monday hennepin county district judge thomas carey took under 
advisement renewed arguments from a pillsbury shareholders group on 
its request to have pillsburys poison pill defense invalidated 
force pillsbury to negotiate with grand met and block the 
minneapolisbased food and restaurant companys planned spinoff of 
its burger king fastfood subsidiary 
in his letter smith said our boards review of pillsburys 
and burger kings potential has confirmed that now is not an 
appropriate time to sell pillsbury and that if the company were to 
be sold in the future as two separate companies substantially 
greater values could be realized 
smith concluded the pillsbury board remains committed to 
value simply put your 60pershare offer does not represent the 
values which the pillsbury shareholders deserve as long as the 
framework for a meeting between ourselves is an inadequate offer 
which you persist in claiming is fair and fully priced a meeting 
would serve no purpose 
grand met has said a separate burger king would create a huge tax 
liability for grand met if the takeover is successful in addition 
burger king franchisees have announced opposition to the plan 
saying it would add too much debt to the already troubled fastfood 
chain 
grand met on monday extended its offer for a fifth time the 
tender offer now will expire at midnight est friday unless extended 
again by last saturday 853 percent of pillsburys outstanding 
shares had been tendered and not withdrawn grand met said
