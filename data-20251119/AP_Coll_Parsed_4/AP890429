the producerdirector of the miniseries war 
and remembrance has denied an entertainment tonight report 
that an orphan was mistreated during filming in yugoslavia of the 
abc television movie 
its an insane allegation dan curtis said in a telephone 
interview friday we spent five years telling the story of the 
holocaust and they are trivializing it 
entertainment tonight reported thursday that a 3yearold 
hired from an orphanage in zagreb yugoslavia was mistreated by 
repeatedly being held upside down 
an unidentified technician with a crew that was filming a 
documentary at the same time said the impression we had was that 
they didnt want us to shoot the scene because they were possibly 
abusing the child it would be viewed by some as abusing the 
child 
abc is investigating the allegations said jim brochu manager 
of business information for abc 
the final five parts of the 30hour miniseries will be telecast 
beginning sunday may 7 
the technician said the child screamed during the filming he 
said the crew was asked to leave so that they could not see what 
was happening 
but curtis said they were asked to leave because the room was 
small and the second camera was confusing the child 
the scene called for jane seymour as natalie jastrow henry to 
be brought to the basement of the ss headquarters with her son 
louis the ss officers order her to stop her agitation against the 
nazis and hold her son upside down and threaten to rip him apart 
curtis acknowledged that the child had screamed but said he 
began screaming long before the filming began 
when he was held upsidedown he was quiet because stuntmen had 
worked with him for a week to make it a game curtis said he said 
the child was held upsidedown twice for several seconds each time 
and not repeatedly as the entertainment program alleged 
he said it quickly became apparent that the child could not take 
direction curtis replaced him and reshot the scene with an 
american child actor hunter schlesinger 
entertainment tonight said it had also obtained a memo to 
curtis signed by 70 members of the crew on feb 14 1986 accusing 
curtis of exercising power that does not differ greatly from the 
method depicted in our film 
curtis said he was unable to read most of the signatures on the 
memo 
i went to those whose names i could read he said no one 
could answer me why they did it and why they didnt say anything at 
the time on the set i was very angry its not true 
the director said he told entertainment tonight friday that 
he had made a mistake in trying to use an untrained child as an 
actor but again denied any mistreatment of the child 
i refused to go on entertainment tonight and defend this 
insane allegation curtis said why wasnt it brought up at the 
time it happened why did it suddenly surface a week before we go 
on the air

magellan americas first 
interplanetary probe in 11 years is named for a portuguese 
explorer who 467 years ago led the expedition that was the first to 
sail around the world 
after it is deployed in orbit by the space shuttle the magellan 
probe will travel to venus in 15 months the 800millionmile 
voyage will last less than half as long as it took a 16thcentury 
expedition led by ferdinand magellan to sail around the world 
magellan who chose to sail under the spanish flag was 
commander of a fiveship flotilla that left seville spain on sept 
20 1519 to search for a route to the socalled spice islands in 
the south pacific 
the fleet reached south america in december and then sailed 
around the southern tip of that continent through what came to be 
called the straits of magellan 
after following the west coast of south america magellan 
directed his fleet across the pacific ocean the ships made 
landfall at guam on march 6 1521 and then went on to what became 
the philippine islands 
the spanish sailors got into a fight with natives on mactan 
island on april 27 1521 and magellan was killed the anniversary 
of his death fell on thursday 
magellans fleet continued its voyage with juan sebastian 
elcano in command but one ship after another was lost until only 
the victoria was left the vessel returned to spain on sept 8 
1522 only 17 men of an original crew of 270 survived the 
threeyear voyage 
though magellan died before the trip ended he is generally 
credited with the first circumnavigation of the earth 
stargazing sailors on the voyage are credited with discovery of 
two star galaxies called the magellanic clouds which are visible 
only from the southern hemisphere

two weeks ago zarina khatoon sold 
her aluminum cooking pot to buy food for her four hungry children 
the cooking pot was the last asset i could sell my children 
were going without food for two days they had nothing but water 
zarina said wearing a ragged sari and sitting on the ground in 
front of her mudandstraw house 
her plight is common among the families of 65 million landless 
day laborers in this povertystricken nation of 110 million people 
when there are no fields to tend there is no money to earn 
two months of drought have aggravated the situation the rain 
that brought a measure of relief on wednesday may not be enough to 
save the crops in the ground 
in yet another of the deadly caprices nature so often unleashes 
on bangladesh the rains were accompanied by tornadoes that killed 
at least 600 people it was the latest in a series of natural 
calamities that have struck the nation 
floods last summer killed more than 1400 people submerged 
fourfifths of the country and left 25 million people homeless 
barely two months after the water receded cyclones struck in late 
november claiming another 1100 lives 
the jamalpur district 90 miles north of dhaka was ravaged by 
last summers monsoonspawned floods now it suffers from drought 
but so far the main problem is not availability of food relief 
workers say its the shortage of work 
the sowing season is over for landless day laborers there will 
be no more work until the rice crop now in the ground is harvested 
in early june if the paddies survive the drought 
zarina khatoons husband mokbul ahmad left home two weeks ago 
to look for work he has not yet returned to palashtala 12 miles 
south of jamalpur 
shortly after he left zarina sold her cooking pot for 15 takas 
about 46 cents she promptly spent 31 cents on 22 pounds of flour 
which saw her family through two meals 
the 25yearold woman said her situation had improved slightly 
since she found work digging a pond for 15 takas a day 
still i cannot buy rice for my family she said rice is 
out of my reach 
two weeks ago lowquality rice the staple of the bangladeshi 
diet sold for 28 cents a pound the government pumped some reserve 
stocks into the area and the price fell a little to 25 cents a 
pound 
its not the question of availability of rice the problem is 
the poor people have no money to buy food they have no jobs 
said fakhrul ahsan a local worker for the privately run bangladesh 
rural development committee 
he said the committee is working with 56000 people living in 47 
villages in the jamalpur region doing postflood rehabilitation 
work and trying to provide jobs such as building roads and making 
handicrafts 
almost 30 percent of the people we cover are living in extreme 
conditions ahsan said they take flour and boil it with water 
they cant make bread from wheat as that fails to feed all the 
members of the family 
this is a lean period for agriculture workers there is no 
work in the fields until the next harvest comes the poor landless 
people eat on days they can work on workless days they go without 
food he added 
we have no report of anyone dying for lack of food but the 
situation is pretty bad said debabrata das another worker from 
the bangladesh rural development committee 
abdul hamid who lives in narayanpur near palashtala said he 
earned 15 takas a day working for wealthy farmers 
the money i earn cannot buy rice for me and my family the 
35yearold father of three said rice has become a luxury item 
for us 
bangladesh where the per capita annual income is 160 needs 
185 million tons of rice and wheat a year to feed its people in 
good years it produces 17 million tons it tries to import an 
additional 2 million tons to cover the shortfall and provide an 
emergency reserve 
last year the floods wiped out 25 million tons that were in 
the fields and paddies when the deluge struck 
the spring rice crop now in the ground was expected to produce 
about 56 million tons but agriculture officials in dhaka fear at 
least half will be lost to the drought

in his fight for political change in china 
student leader wuer kaixi has lost his voice and 10 pounds but 
the 21yearold from remote xinjiang province shows no sign of 
giving up 
the freshman has been at the forefront of demonstrations for 
democracy and a free press since april 20 when he singlehandedly 
organized a sitin near the gates of the communist party 
headquarters 
with no microphone wuer shouted down about 1000 unruly 
students making them sit quietly for several hours in protest 
hundreds of security forces then massed and charged the protesters 
beating some and sending others fleeing 
theres nothing i can do about it ive always wanted to do 
what other people were afraid of said the cocky young man from 
beijing normal university cracking a dimpled smile 
last week after he appointed himself president of beijing 
normals student association the students approved his decision in 
one of the first student elections in a country that has always 
appointed its student representatives 
he also is a member of the independent allcity student 
association which has organized the protests the communist 
government has called the organizations illegal wuer said they 
represent the will of the students 
ive been leading students since i started school he said 
in a recent interview in a cramped student dormitory room at his 
school in high school i didnt think twice about standing up on 
the table and shouting if we needed more light bulbs or an official 
hit a student 
but now instead of light bulbs wuer is calling for democracy 
people are beginning to discover that im a dangerous man 
he said with obvious relish that is a good thing 
early in the protest his school recognized that fact and had 
his father sent thousands of miles from xinjiang to beijing to urge 
him to stop his work 
putting pressure on my father was sick and disgusting he 
said it wont work 
the demonstrations have taken their toll on his health 
i havent been eating much when we spent the night at 
tiananmen square on friday i didnt eat at all my throat hurts 
from screaming but my spirit is good 
wuer hails from chinas remote northwest both his parents are 
of turkish escent belonging to the uigur people who dominated 
central asia between the 8th and the 12th centuries 
i look at my status as a minority in this country of han 
people as a bonus he said we have an expression in chinese 
the onlooker sees the game best i think i see the problems of 
the han better because my blood is different 
wuer said he is little impressed with political thinkers from 
the west or china 
ive always thought i had to go my own way he said some 
of my classmates worship americas system but i think its like the 
story about the king who asked his subjects to blow on their gold 
horns if they supported democracy none of them had gold horns 
however his personality he said resembles that of an american 
im not conservative and im ready to say whats on my mind 
he said the rest of my countrymen trouble me so many wont dare 
to raise their heads 
this tendency he said has hurt china 
wuer said his country is like an ancient boat a junk with 
holes in its sails and maybe a leak or two 
the boat might founder it might even sink but the student 
movement were just like the guys with the straps on their 
shoulders pulling the boat up the river weve used a lot of 
strength a lot of sweat even blood but the boat hasnt moved 
much but weve got to pull anyway 
wuer said he doesnt expect the movement to win concrete 
results 
but were part of a process in china the weight of 11 
billion people is a heavy one and you cant budge it in a day 
on thursday wuer led his university as it marched 20 miles 
through the streets of beijing with 150000 students and other 
supporters in the biggest march in commuunist chinas history 
finally we are victorious he said as he trudged home from 
a long day of standoffs with police finally 
he admits to being afraid for the future 
maybe this idea is a little strange but if they arrest me i 
dont want to be sent to jail for a traffic violation during a 
protest if im going to jail i want to be a political prisoner

second nuclear power plant because of the doubts and fears 
expressed by society state radio said 
according to the report industry minister mieczyslaw wilczek 
met with provincial governors from western poland whose provinces 
are near the klempicz plant and told them he favored a 
comprehensive review of the development program of the nuclear 
power industry in poland 
wilczek told the governors of the pila poznan and gorzow 
wielkopolska provinces that decisions about the fate of the 
project will be made on the basis of a comprehensive and thorough 
analysis of the fuelenergy situation up to the year 2000 the 
report said 
the state news agency pap early today said it had no word about 
such a decision 
the plans to construct the nuclear plant in the pila province 
town of klempicz has aroused protests in western poland the plant 
to be finished by the year 2000 would be about 30 miles north of 
poznan a city of 585000 people 110 miles from the east german 
border 
marches protesting the plant have become frequent events since 
the plans to build were announced in 1987 kemplicz would be the 
second polish nuclear plant after one in zarnowiec on the baltic 
coast where construction has begun that plant is scheduled to 
begin producing power in 1991 
the plants are based on soviet designs concerns about possible 
nuclear accidents have become much more acute among poles since the 
1986 accident at chernobyl in the soviet ukraine which borders 
poland

community isnt going to the prom the juniors pay for it its 
their night

it isnt playing well with city leaders but 
a student who can smell a winner has come up with a scent that 
could have all america turning its nose up at peoria 
essence of peoria is being promoted as the midwests 
finest industrial fragrance a potion that reeks of the ethanol 
plants that permeate this city 
its the smell of very old beer kind of an egg sulfur smell 
when the wind is just right its the smell you get all over 
peoria said david cook the bradley university student who 
developed the formula with the help of chemists 
cook packaged 1000 bottles of his fragrance and got several 
area hotels and novelty stores to sell it as a gag but the 
response has been far from comical 
its a gag thats going crazy cook said ive already 
sold out half my stock about 300 bottles in just one week on the 
market i broke even on my investment three days ago ill 
definitely be producing more 
i dont know if people in peoria will buy it because all they 
have to do is open their windows but its going to do real well 
with visitors said dj shadid owner of gift shops in three 
hotels 
but city officials who hired a public relations firm in 1987 to 
polish the citys image would like to get rid of the stink over 
essence 
i admit its a clever idea but it disappoints me because i 
dont want to see someone making fun of our city mayor jim 
maloof said weve tried so hard the last few years to change our 
image hopefully this product and the smell will fade away

the decision by energy secretary james d 
watkins to wait until 1990 to resume production of a gas needed for 
nuclear warheads shows clearly that supplies of the gas are not as 
tight as the government once claimed critics say 
the pentagon asserted last fall that unless production resumed 
by this summer the nuclear weapons factories would face a shortage 
of tritium a scarce highly radioactive gas used to boost the 
explosive power of nuclear warheads 
but critics have said they believe the earlier warnings about a 
tritium crisis were aimed at galvanizing congressional support for 
the energy departments proposal to spend 68 billion to build two 
new tritiumproducing reactors 
that whole scenario was orchestrated for political purposes by 
certain people in the pentagon chris paine an aide to sen 
edward kennedy on nuclear defense issues said in an interview 
friday its not as serious as they suggested 
watkins told congress and the pentagon this week that he had 
decided the departments tritiumproducing reactors in south 
carolina would not be restarted until early next year at the 
earliest 
watkins said he wanted more time to assess safety conditions at 
the savannah river site where the three reactors have been sitting 
idle since last spring they were shut down for mechanical repairs 
and to address safety problems 
the reactors are the nations only source of tritium which 
decays relatively quickly so replacement supplies are needed to 
maintain the nuclear arsenal one hundred grams of tritium becomes 
50 grams after 12 years a far faster rate of decay than 
plutonium another vital material used to make nuclear weapons 
the tritium hiatus has had no immediate affect on weapons 
production since the arms factories can dip into a tritium 
reserve the size of that reserve is classified and the government 
has not said exactly how long the surplus will last 
several times earlier this year the energy departments chief 
of defense programs troy wade testified at congressional hearings 
that the problem had become critical 
if a reactor is not restarted this year then the supply of 
tritium could be reduced to such an extent that the nuclear 
stockpile may be affected wade told a senate armed services 
subcommittee in early february 
private analysts who monitor the governments weapons program 
have been saying for months that the energy department and the 
pentagon have overstated the supply problem 
dan reicher an attorney for natural resources defense council 
an environmental group that has sued the energy department to block 
restart of the savannah river reactors said friday that watkins 
decision undercuts the idea of a looming crisis 
the longer we go without production the more we see there is 
no tritium crisis he said in an interview again the pentagon 
and doe have cried wolf 
last week 11 prominent us scientists issued a joint statement 
urging the energy department to hold off on restart of the savannah 
river reactors until the soviet union has been sounded about 
possible negotiated cuts in nuclear materials 
it is our considered view that there is no critical shortage 
of tritium today and that claims of an imminent crisis distort 
the true situation the scientists said 
they said enough tritium exists today to sustain a fully 
adequate weapons stockpile for at least five years without new 
production if better management techniques were used among these 
would be the use of tritium from weapons scheduled for retirement 
or held in storage 
watkins said in a letter to congressional committees last week 
that he had ordered changes in the departments management of 
tritium inventories but he gave no details

farmers are getting more for their grain 
livestock and other commodities than they did last year but their 
net income is expected to drop from last years record according 
to the agricuture department 
prices measured by a usda index dropped 2 percent from march to 
april but were still 12 percent higher than a year ago the 
departments agricultural statistics board said friday in its 
preliminary report 
lower prices for cattle eggs hogs soybeans and lettuce were 
mostly responsible for the decrease from the march average while 
higher prices for tomatoes oranges and potatoes offset part of the 
decline for the other commodities 
new quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet 
expenses were up 11 percent from january and averaged 54 percent 
more than in april 1988 
higher prices for fuels fertilizers seeds autos and trucks 
tractors and other machinery contibuted most to the increase in the 
index since january the report said lower prices for feed 
and feeder cattle and calves were partially offsetting 
and department economists say net cash income of farmers is 
expected to fall 12 percent to 16 percent this year to a range of 
48 billion to 52 billion from the record 1988 level of 58 
billion 
net cash income is the amount farmers have at their disposal 
during the year and represents the difference between gross cash 
income and cash expenses cash income rose last year despite the 
drought partly because of higher market prices and crops farmers 
had stored from previous harvests 
the decline this year is expected to stem from farmers larger 
cash expenses as they boost plantings and also because of lower 
federal subsidies 
consumer food prices are still forecast by usda to rise an 
average of 3 percent to 5 percent this year following a 41 
percent increase in 1988 however department economists say it is 
likely that the 1989 forecast will be revised upward depending on 
how current conditions shape up 
in another report the department said the soviet union has 
bought an additional 105 million metric tons of us corn for 
delivery this year under a longterm supply agreement 
officials said the latest corn sales by unidentified private 
exporters pushed the total grain bought by the soviets this year to 
almost 183 million tons close to the record 186 million tons 
moscow purchased from the united states in 198485 corn makes up 
about 143 million tons and wheat 4 million 
the corn is scheduled for delivery by sept 30 the end of the 
sixth year of a longterm grain supply agreement between the soviet 
union and the united states 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 105 million tons 
of corn would be about 41 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 253 per bushel at the 
farm level according to the latest usda fiveday average meaning 
that the latest sale could have a farm value of more than 100 
million

three groups opposed to the governments plan 
to build a new plutoniumproduction factory in idaho are suing to 
block initial work on the 12 billion facility 
a suit filed in us district court in washington said the 
energy department should not be allowed to go ahead with 
preparatory work planned for later this year until a fuller 
assessment is made of the plants environmental impact 
the object of the suit is the special isotope separation plant 
which the energy department plans to build on federal land near 
idaho falls the facility would use a new technique to produce 
weapongrade plutonium for nuclear weapons 
the parties to the suit the natural resources defense council 
the snake river alliance and the palouseclearwater hanford watch 
contend the department also should be required to give further 
study to alternatives to building the plant 
doe simply has not lived up to its obligation to look before 
it leaps into a potentially unnecessary and dangerous plant said 
dan w reicher an attorney for natural resources 
a department spokesman will callicott said there would be no 
official comment on the suit 
the plant to be built at the idaho national engineering 
laboratory by 1995 would use laser technologies to make 
weapongrade plutonium out of reactorgrade plutonium that is 
recovered from commercial nuclear power plants the suit alleges 
the technology is under development at the governments lawrence 
livermore national laboratory in california 
some private analysts of the governments nuclear weapons 
program contend there is no demonstrated need for the idaho 
facility because there already is more than enough plutonium to 
last for the foreseeable future the size of the nations plutonium 
inventories is classified 
in light of the plutonium surplus sis appears to be a 3 
billion porkbarrel project paul leventhal president of the 
nuclear control institute said in a letter to congressional 
leaders last month he was referring to the estimated 12 billion 
construction cost and 19 billion operating cost 
the energy department in a report earlier this year on plans 
for modernizing its nuclear weapons complex labeled the idaho 
project timecritical and essential and ranked it among its top 
defense program priorities 
energy secretary james d watkins who is reassessing the reagan 
administrations longrange plans for the weapons program has told 
congress he strongly supports building the idaho plant 
the special isotope separation facility in idaho should be 
constructed to provide flexibility and technological diversity to a 
production complex burdened by reactor operating constraints he 
told a house panel earlier this month

the bush administration has decided to 
retaliate against japan on grounds it has violated an agreement to 
allow usmade cellular phones and mobile radios to compete in its 
telecommunications market it was reported today 
the washington post and the new york times reported the decision 
was made friday by president bushs economic policy council the 
decision could result in imposing penalty tariffs on similar 
japanese products under the new trade law passed by congress last 
year the papers said 
the decision came as us trade representative carla hills 
charged that 34 countries are erecting unfair barriers to us 
products in a move that could eventually lead to 100 percent 
tariffs against some imports 
the trade representative offices general counsel joshua 
bolten and spokeswoman claire buchan could not be reached at 
home friday night to confirm the reports on sanctions against 
japan such sanctions would be the first ordered since 1987 when 
the reagan administration accused japan of failing to keep an 
agreement to buy more us semiconductors 
the times quoted hills as saying that public hearings will be 
held sometime in may to determine what japanese products and 
services might be subject to retaliation 
hills report on the trade barriers took 18 pages to list the 
complaints against japan the most for any country the 12nation 
european community and south korea were next each with nine pages 
of complaints 
the accusations of trade barriers covered a wide range of 
products from shipments of autos to argentina to the sales of 
american cigarettes in yugoslavia 
in addition to the 34 nations two trading organizations are 
named those are the ec and the gulf cooperation council which 
includes saudi arabia 
the report is the first step in drawing up a hit list of 
priority countries the administration will target for intensive 
negotiations aimed at getting the trade barriers eliminated that 
priority list drawn from the countries mentioned friday is due on 
may 30 
the united states must initiate negotiations with the countries 
on the priority list with a deadline of achieving results within 18 
months the countries then would have three years to live up to the 
agreements and remove the trade barriers america finds offensive 
should the negotiations prove unfruitful or a country fail to 
implement the agreement the trade law gives the administration the 
power to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on selected imports 
the procedure set up by the omnibus trade act was the most 
controversial section of the 1988 law which congress passed in an 
effort to force the executive branch to take a tougher stance to 
whittle down the countrys huge trade deficits 
many economists said at the time the legislation was debated 
that the effort could backfire and set off a global trade war in 
which us attempts to punish unfair trade practices are met by 
counterretaliation against american goods 
foreign governments concerned by the tight deadlines for 
negotiations to be completed have already begun intensive lobbying 
efforts to keep from being placed on the priority list 
while the law provides various loopholes a president could use 
to avoid imposing retaliatory tariffs a failure to act would have 
to be explained to congress 
american companies have filed petitions with hills office 
recommending that close to 50 countries be placed on the priority 
negotiating list south korea has the most complaints filed against 
it by us businesses followed by japan india taiwan brazil and 
the european community 
officials from those nations have mounted their own 
counterattack dispatching their top trade officials to washington 
for meetings with top administration officials to press their case 
that their countries should not be singled out 
the debate has been particularly intense with regard to japan 
some in the administration have expressed concerns about applying 
further trade pressure on japan at a time the country is facing 
internal turmoil with the announced resignation of japanese prime 
minister noboru takeshita 
but sen max baucus dmont chairman of the trade subcommittee 
of the senate finance committee said last week the administration 
would be cutting the heart out of the new trade law if it 
didnt target japan 
in fridays report the countries named were argentina 
australia brazil canada chile china colombia egypt west 
germany finland france greece india indonesia italy japan 
south korea malaysia mexico new zealand nigeria norway 
pakistan philippines portugal spain sweden switzerland

west german officials say nato nations 
are starting to line up against the us and british views in a 
major disarmament dispute within the western alliance 
chancellor helmut kohls call for superpower negotiations on 
shortrange nuclear weapons has placed him in a battle of wills 
against both president bush and british prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
mrs thatcher and kohl are scheduled to meet sunday in west 
germany to discuss the issue 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher spent part of friday 
talking about the dispute one of the most divisive in recent years 
in the north atlantic treaty organization with us ambassador 
vernon a walters 
a foreign ministry statement said both sides expressed their 
belief that the alliance will jointly resolve the stillopen 
question of a formulation of a comprehensive disarmament 
concept 
but there were no indications that would happen soon 
genschers spokesman said seven of the 16 nato members 
including west germany support kohl 
west germany wants the united states to agree to talks with the 
soviet union on the shortrange weapons and notes that nato decided 
in favor of such negotiations in 1987 
most of natos shortrange nuclear weapons are based in west 
germany and would be used exclusively on german soil in the event 
of war 
washington rejects the west german insistence on negotiations 
saying talks on tactical nuclear arsenals should not begin as long 
as the warsaw pact alliance has a superiority in conventional 
forces 
west german polls show that the electorate favors such talks 
the military reductions announced by mikhail s gorbachev has made 
the soviet leader a popular figure in western europe 
the dispute has led to lobbying efforts by both sides among the 
nato members 
genscher told parliament on friday we can see that we are 
finding more and more understanding for this position for 
negotiations within the whole alliance 
juergen chrobog genschers chief spokesman told reporters six 
other nato countries are backing west germany 
denmark belgium norway and italy have announced their support 
of kohl and chrobog said greece and spain also back him 
france has not given a clear signal where it stands but french 
president francois mitterrand said last week nothing should be 
done that will compromise the movement toward disarmament 
the netherlands has offered to mediate between the feuding nato 
members and dutch premier ruud lubbers plans to travel to bonn on 
wednesday 
kohl is slated to travel to rome on tuesday for discussions with 
italys leaders on the dispute and genscher will have talks in 
paris the same day with french foreign minister roland dumas 
one west german official speaking with the condition he not be 
identified said the government would stand firm 
in past years the german point of view wasnt always put that 
strongly in alliance matters but right now german interests are at 
stake he said 
with a growing mood for increased demilitarization nato is 
hoping to present a showing of solidarity at its brussels summit on 
may 2930 
west germanys pressure for negotiations on shortrange nuclear 
weapons comes as kohl tries to improve his image there have been 
predictions he could lose next years elections to the leftleaning 
social democrats

former presidents jimmy carter and gerald r 
ford have been invited by authorities in panama to monitor upcoming 
national elections in that country a panamanian official said 
panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter said at a news 
conference friday evening that he informed a carter emissary on 
wednesday the two former presidents would be welcome for the may 7 
balloting 
ritter said carter is held in high esteem by panamanians because 
of his role in negotiating the canal treaties that will revert the 
waterway to panamanian control at the end of the century 
we are prepared to give him the warmest welcome ritter said 
spokesmen for carter and ford were unavailable for comment 
friday night 
ritter said panamanian authorities are not eager to have foreign 
observers in overwhelming numbers he said the reason is that 
the country lacks facilities to accommodate them and their presence 
could impair the electoral process 
the bush administration has said that the panamanian government 
led by the defense forces commander manuel antonio noriega is 
preparing fraud on a massive scale to ensure victory in the 
elections 
the principal contest in the balloting matches the official 
candidate carlos duque against guillermo david endara who is 
running on an antigoverment coalition ticket 
the election controversy was taken up friday morning at a un 
security council session called at panamas request 
ritter told the session the united states has supplied millions 
of dollars to opposition candidates and has sent commandos special 
weapons and helicopters to panama as well 
he accused the united states of trying to subvert democratic 
elections set up a puppet prowashington government and undermine 
the canal treaties 
us plans of interfering in the panamanian electoral process 
have entered a phase of direct participation ritter told the 
15member council 
the objective is undermining public order causing chaos 
promoting widespread destabilization in the country around election 
time and creating a pretext for military intervention in panama 
in reply us ambassador thomas pickering accused panamas 
government of blatantly interfering in the election process 
manipulating voters lists muzzling the opposition press and tv 
and restricting access by impartial foreign monitors and 
journalists 
the moral bankruptcy of the regime of gen manuel noriega for 
which mr ritter speaks is well known pickering said 
the united states does not recognize the noriegaled government 
insisting that former president eric arturo delvalle was ousted 
illegally in february 1988 and continues to be the countrys 
legitimate authority

president bush says he wants to go ahead with 
a controversial deal with japan for joint development and 
production of the new fsx jetfighter despite congressional concern 
over loss of american jobs and technology 
bush announcing on friday the agreement to make an advanced 
version of the us f16 for deployment by japan in the late 1990s 
declared that the deal was in the strategic and commercial 
interests of the united states 
and we weighed this matter from the standpoint of trade of 
our industrial growth and technology transfer as well as strategic 
and foreign policy considerations the president said 
the announcement was made the same day the office of trade 
representative released a report listing japan as one of the worst 
users of trade barriers and according to published reports 
recommended sanctions for refusing to open its markets to usmade 
cellular phones and mobile radios 
congressional critics were quick to respond to bushs 
announcement 
president bush claims that this giveaway will not cost the 
american people a cent said rep richard a gephardt dmo 
chairman of the fsx task force and a house leader on trade issues 
whats he going to tell the thousands of aerospace workers who 
will lose their jobs as a result of this deal 
gephardts st louis district is the home of general dynamics 
the american partner with japans mitsubishi heavy industries in 
developing the aircraft 
bush told reporters at the white house the united states will 
have a 40 percent work share in the initial development stage of 
this aircraft and we will have a similar share when the aircraft 
goes into production 
development of the fsx is expected to cost about 12 billion 
while the production run is estimated to cost about 5 billion for 
130 planes 
there will be no cost to the american taxpayer and at the same 
time the japanese will improve their ability to carry their share 
of the defense burden bush said 
addressing concerns over us technology bush said sensitive 
source codes for the aircrafts computer will be strictly 
controlled access will be granted to only those codes that are 
essential to complete the project 
three administration officials who briefed reporters said that 
for instance the codes for the new f16 digital flight control 
computer which just came out last year will not be released to 
the japanese 
any new technology developed by the japanese during the fsx 
program will be available to us firms but japan will be banned 
from transferring to third countries or firms any technology 
derived from the usbuilt f16 plane the officials said 
congress has 30 days to review the agreement signed friday by 
secretary of state james a baker iii and japans ambassador nobuo 
matsunaga 
the house and senate can reject it by a joint resolution of 
disapproval but if such a resolution is passed a twothirds 
majority of both houses would be required to override a likely bush 
veto 
initial capitol hill reaction to the announcement was dominated 
by critics of the fsx 
rep mel levine dcalif said he will mount a campaign to 
scrap the plan because japan could best help reduce the trade 
deficit with the united states by purchasing usbuilt f16s off 
the shelf 
also speaking out against the decision was rep james j florio 
dnj who said that we are giving our strongest competitor in 
the world marketplace the expertise it lacks to directly challenge 
americas leadership in international civil and military aircraft 
sales 
sen richard g lugar rind a senior member of the senate 
foreign relations committee said he favors going ahead with the 
deal 
im encouraged by the agreement between the united states and 
the japanese particularly on the work share the computer source 
codes and technology flowback he said and i hope that this 
will ease congressional concerns about the fsx

sources close to jesse jackson say he is 
strongly considering foregoing a third race for the presidency 
in 1992 to run for mayor of the district of columbia 
a source speaking on condition of anonymity said friday that 
jackson would consider the 1990 mayoral bid if embattled mayor 
marion s barry jr decides against seeking a fourth term 
jackson denied friday night that he is seeking to replace barry 
a longtime ally although he said in interviews published in two 
newspapers today that has not ruled out running for the office if 
barry steps aside 
i have not yet made a determination to run here jackson 
told the washington post 
asked by a reporter at a hotel banquet here friday night if he 
was considering a race for mayor jackson said no he also said 
he has not talked to barry about whether the mayor who has been 
dogged by reports about the citys skyrocketing murder rate and 
friendship with a former city official convicted of cocaine 
trafficking will run 
ive always supported the mayor said jackson who last year 
lost the democratic presidential nomination to massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis 
the two men however have talked about jackson running for the 
job if barry does not seek a fourth fouryear term the source 
close to jackson who spoke only on condition of anonymity told 
the associated press 
the new york times reported in todays editions that jackson 
said he would never run against marion barry 
but jackson said if he were not running thats a different 
story 
jackson lives in chicago but the washington post report said is 
speeding up plans to remodel a house he owns in washington and 
could move in by november my family has not made that decision 
but we cant move before the house is finished jackson told the 
post 
jackson has repeatedly said that under no condition would he 
run against barry the two men have been close friends and 
political allies since their civil rights activities together in 
the early 1960s 
barry who has not said whether he will seek reelection could 
not be reached friday night the mayors spokesman also was 
unreachable 
an effort to organize a mayoral campaign on behalf of jackson 
was launched two months ago by a member of the city school board 
and a leader of the districts statehood party 
ann lewis a democratic political strategist and an adviser to 
jackson in his presidential campaign said friday that comments 
jackson has made to political confidants indicate he does not 
immediately reject running for mayor 
i know hes been under a lot of pressure about this ms 
lewis said its clear that they have reached him she said 
referring to the draftjackson effort organized by school board 
member r calvin lockridge and statehood party leader tom chorlton 
the two men had hoped to gather signatures from 100000 of the 
citys 300000 registered voters on a petition supporting jackson 
for mayor but chorlton said the effort has been slowed by a lack 
of volunteers 
jackson who has never held elective office could qualify for 
the 1990 mayors race by switching his voter registration from 
chicago to the district by november of this year

a suspect in a related attack 
a grand jury meanwhile indicted a sixth teenager in the 
joggers attack and city officials announced a beefing up of 
security in the area near the attack 
this crime was an outrage which shocked every new yorker

conference 
the new protection plan will include mounted police patrols 
increased police car surveillance and the use of police decoys

and terrible that it brings about a tremendous counterattack 
said stern i think thats what happened here 
on friday afternoon a grand jury indicted 14yearold kevin 
richardson the only suspect who admitted raping the woman in his 
statement to police six teenagers are now charged as members of

hearing 
while stern detailed the security changes a confrontation 
erupted at state supreme court between spectators and court 
officers friday morning when acting justice carol berkman ordered 
defense attorney alton h maddox jr removed from court 
maddox had repeatedly refused to follow the judges instructions 
to sit down and remain silent during the hearing 
as spectators stood and screamed at the officers to leave maddox 
alone berkman left the bench and court officers entered the 
courtroom with billy clubs and riot helmets when the judge 
returned five minutes later maddox and cocounsel joseph mack 
turned and walked out

defendants kharey wise 16 antron mccray 15 and steve lopez 
15 and told their attorneys to submit their bail applications in 
writing

bail called the april 19 assault on the wall street investment 
banker the most vicious and brutal crime in new york to date

unconscious in metropolitan hospital said lederer she was

miami vice the fashionconscious cop show that 
once dominated televisions top 10 filmed its last episode this 
week and city leaders were unsure whether vice has been a virtue 
most city officials would agree that the program brought a new 
sense of excitement to miamis tattered image but some fear the 
programs obsession with drug smugglers and violent crime may have 
scared off tourists and outsiders 
the final scenes were shot thursday night at a luxurious house 
in miami beach and some of the cast and production crew held a 
farewell party friday night 
the program is widely recognized for its influence on mens 
fashion televisionfilming techniques and rockmusic scores for 
television 
as its popularity grew life imitated art and both miami and 
miami beach saw a boom in bright pastels and a glorification of art 
deco 
the producers of miami vice decided this season would be the 
last season saying the fiveyear show had run its course once one 
of tvs most watched shows ac nielsen cos endoftheyear 
ratings recently ranked the nbc show in 65th place 
television writer anthony yerkovich said in an interview that 
his idea for the show came out of visits in the early 1980s when 
the area faced race riots drug shootouts and waves of new 
immigrants 
it seemed to be a real border town an american casablanca 
with all the hopes and dreams that implies yerkovich said the 
city inspired the show in the sense that we had a vision of miami 
that wasnt connected to the reality of the town 
sidney levin a founding member of the beacon council which 
promotes the citys business climate said friday that the 
television show gave miami the feeling of a new city a city that 
a lot of tourists had never seen 
it made a fashion trend a miami style there hadnt been a 
miami style since the 1940s and 50s levin said 
some civic leaders said they winced when they heard the shows 
title 
here came a show to be called miami vice a shootemup 
levin said i think if you could have taken a vote that day they 
would have voted the show out of town 
he said many people who promote the city will be relieved to see 
the show go because of its emphasis on violence and drugs 
we were trying to combat an image problem said former dade 
county manager merrett stierheim we were always a target for 
various publications that take a delight in beating on miami 
i want to say kind things he said but the jury is out as 
to the total impact on greater miami 
the plot of the last show is strikingly similar to the first 
one aired sept 16 1984 the main characters sonny crockett 
played by don johnson and rico tubbs played by philip michael 
thomas are sent to the fictional south american country of costa 
morado to bring back a corrupt dictator to testify against 
international drug traffickers the ending is secret 
the final show is scheduled to be shown may 21 
johnson and thomas say theyll keep their ties to the community 
johnson said he may open a restaurant and race powerboats while 
thomas plans to open a theater for young actors 
im not leaving miami thomas said this is home for me

countries had reached a better understanding of each other through 
their talks on the fsx craft which is a new more sophisticated 
version of the american f16 jet 
president bush announced in washington friday that the united 
states will produce the fsx or fighter support experimental 
with japan despite congressional concern over loss of us jobs and 
technology 
the joint development of the aircraft will be extremely 
important for defense cooperation between the united states and 
japan tazawa said in the statement 
the defense agency late friday decided to give the united states 
a 40 percent share of the development and production of the jet 
it also agreed to allow the united states to protect the 
computer codes used to help fly and control the plane which will 
be a joint project of general dynamics and mitsubishi heavy 
industries 
mitsubishi told kyodo news service it expects the project to 
begin at the end of june to cost about 72 billion 
an unidentified japanese diplomat said japan expects the 
agreement to become a model of technology sharing between tokyo 
and washington 
bush told reporters friday that he had agreed to go ahead with 
the project because he was convinced that codevelopment of this 
aircraft is in the strategic and commercial interests of the united 
states

gov buddy roemers tax revision plan 
heralded by proponents as a break with louisianas past and 
condemned by opponents as a windfall for big business fell into 
the hands of the voters today 
the controversial plan would overturn decades of populist 
tradition by raising taxes and cutting the load on businesses 
roemer has pushed for a radical restructuring of the tax system 
saying it is vital in order to create jobs in the state with the 
nations highest unemployment rate which is higher than 11 percent 
jobs now the governor said of his plan 
but opponents led by rep david duke the former ku klux klan 
leader who won a special election in february criticized the plan 
as harmful to individual taxpayers 
the referendum is on a proposed constitutional amendment 
authorizing the legislature to make basic changes in the tax system 
a new tax code approved by legislators during a special session 
in late february and early march would take effect if the amendment 
passes among other things the new code would increase individual 
income taxes and give businesses incentives to move into the state 
and expand 
the package also would raise the gasoline tax by 4 cents a 
gallon to fund a 14 billion in improvements on highways airports 
and shipping ports 
if the referendum is defeated the legislature would have to cut 
more than 600 million from an already tight budget which roemer 
has said is impossible 
oil companies have footed much of the states bills for decades 
but the recession in the industry has cut tax revenues drastically 
in recent years and cast the state into a series of budget crises 
through a blitz of radio and television spots financed by more 
than 12 million from backers roemer has touted the plan as a way 
of creating jobs and ending louisianas dependence on the petroleum 
industry 
but opponents say most of the tax breaks will be enjoyed by the 
states 1000 largest corporations many of which are not 
laborintensive and that new jobs will not be created 
its bad for business its bad for the consumer said duke 
you dont raise taxes in a recession 
secretary of state fox mckeithen said he expected more than 40 
percent of the states 2 million registered voters to cast ballots 
the plan would cost an extra 126 million over the current tax 
load but opponents point out that as of july 1 the tax load 
increase would be 526 million 
last summer the legislature approved a oneyear sales tax 
increase of 500 million to keep the government solvent that 
increase was scheduled to expire on july 1 but roemers package 
would make about 400 million of that tax permanent

the chairman of exxon and alaskas 
governor stepped up their feud over the cleanup of oil from the 
exxon valdez and a mountain climber scaled the companys anchorage 
office to protest the spill 
meanwhile high seas and stiff winds sidelined thousands of 
cleanup workers tackling the nations largest spill on friday but 
officials said nature was helping the effort some by washing oil 
off beaches and back into prince william sound 
gov steve cowper accused exxon chairman lawrence rawl of 
misleading the public and shirking the blame for responding slowly 
to the march 24 spill which poured more than 10 million gallons of 
alaskan crude into the sound 
rawl has blamed the state and the coast guard for delaying the 
use of dispersants to control the oil slick 
if an untrue statement continues to be repeated time after 
time after time after time and you dont make an effort to refute 
that statement then people will believe it like it was gospel 
cowper said in a letter to rawl on friday 
rawl shot back with his own letter which was shared with the 
associated press accusing cowper of spreading a fantasy 
unfortunately for all concerned your letter of april 28 does 
not set the record straight rawl wrote in fact it 
perpetuates a good many wrong assertions 
cowper said the coast guard approved tests of dispersants to 
control the spill the day it occurred the state asked for 
restrictions only after exxon sprayed the dispersant carelessly 
hitting coast guard and oil company workers he said 
rawl said that barring state restrictions there was enough 
dispersant on hand and en route to the scene control the entire 
spill he said the chemical was safe for the environment and marine 
wildlife 
because of the slow start quick sea currents carried the oil 
down alaskas southern coast where it has claimed the lives of 
thousands of sea birds and hundreds of otters 
on friday thousands of workers were sidelined in the sound and 
the gulf of alaska for a third straight day 
the weather was too rough to get people onto the beaches 
said coast guard spokeswoman kathleen donohoe 
low clouds over the gulf kept sheenspotting planes and the oil 
skimmers they serve at bay donohoe said the vaidogubsky a giant 
soviet skimmer counted on for big help turned toward the port of 
homer for fuel and supplies 
nevertheless one official said choppy seas had washed some oil 
off the beaches and back into the sound and oil concentrations in 
the sound are much lighter than they were two weeks ago said jerry 
galt of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
were seeing sheens that are almost solely associated with 
rewashing galt said compared to what we were seeing two weeks 
ago three weeks ago its quite light 
in anchorage michael a tumey climbed out onto the roof of 
exxons office and rapelled halfway down the eightstory building 
before attaching a sign that read oil spilled exxon kills 
remember the sound 
the environment comes first if you cant make a dollar and 
spare the environment then get out of the business said tumey

he got to the ground

villages of saturia and hargoz found 40 more bodies overnight 
about 12000 people were injured when the tornado struck central 
bangladesh on wednesday and severely damaged more than 20 small 
villages 
the death toll was expected to rise further because about 400 
people listed as missing are now believed dead the officials said 
and bodies still were being recovered from the rubble of destroyed 
homes 
the daily bangladesh observer said at least 5000 people were 
missing and 20000 others injured many of them in critical 
condition in hospitals in dhaka and neighboring districts leveled

blood 
about 400 of the injured were at the hospital said one doctor 
the government appealed to people to give blood 
the storm ravaged about 45 square miles of the manikganj 
district 25 miles northwest of dhaka 
the tornado was accompanied by hail and showers and came hours 
after president hussain muhammad ershad led nationwide prayers for 
rains to ease a twomonth drought in dhaka alone more than 75000 
people joined ershad in a service 
the drought has threatened to destroy half of the nations 
spring rice crop most of bangladeshs 110 million people rely on 
agriculture for their livelihoods 
the daily sangbad reported today that 100000 people in the 
manikganj district faced starvation because of the tornado

since wednesday mohammed rashid a red crescent official in 
saturia told the associated press it is our estimate that more 
than 30000 houses have been demolished by the tornado 
red crescent officials said delays in the delivery of government 
relief supplies had caused resentment among tornado victims 
relief ministry officials said they had rushed 90 tons of 
supplies to ravaged areas and planned to send more including 
medicine clothing and rice and biscuits

yale university and brookhaven national 
laboratory scientists say three weeks of tests failed to produce 
roomtemperature fusion and that they are skeptical of findings 
announced by utah researchers 
no emissions of neutrons or gamma rays which would be evidence 
of atomic fusion were detected in excess of normal background 
radiation according to preliminary results from the yale 
experiments 
yale physics professor moshe gai said friday the tests conducted 
at the arthur w wright nuclear structure laboratory failed to 
confirm the findings of scientists from the university of utah and 
brigham young university 
but gai also emphasized that he and his collaborators cannot say 
they have disproved the fusion findings at the university of utah 
physicists said they were hampered by a lack of details about the 
utah experiments 
he also said scientists did not try to test all claims 
but he said the data from the yale tests are extremely clean and 
from what i see i have good reason to be skeptical 
the utah researchers shocked physicists last month by claiming 
to have produced cold fusion using simple lab equipment a process 
that could provide a source of abundant clean energy 
the two groups said they obtained fusion by dunking palladium or 
platinum electrodes in solutions of heavy water and passing 
electricity through them heavy water contains deuterium a form of 
hydrogen with one extra neutron 
until last month scientists assumed that the fusion of hydrogen 
atoms which power the sun stars and hydrogen bombs occurs only 
at extremely high temperatures and pressures 
the scientists at both utah and brigham young reported their 
tests produced emission of neutrons evidence of fusion 
yale and brookhaven scientists will present their findings at an 
american physical society meeting in baltimore on monday 
gai said the team tried to reproduce as many of the previously 
done experiments as possible 
princeton and the massachusetts institute of technology also 
have failed to reproduce the utah experiments and are working on 
new theories to explain the puzzling utah results 
georgia tech and texas aampm announced they had reproduced parts 
of the experiments but then withdrew their claims after realizing 
their measuring equipment might be flawed

pope john paul ii donated 50000 
today to a local archdiocese to show the roman catholic churchs 
desire to help the poor on this impoverished island 
i would like in particular to express my affection for 
those of you are suffering those who are bearing the weight of 
loneliness and poverty the pontiff said during an open air mass 
near the airport of this northern port 
he spoke of the role of missionaries who meet the poor as well 
as the rich the powerful and the humble the sick as well as the 
healthy they have given much energy and love to health care and 
education 
upon his arrival friday night for the start of his fifth african 
tour the pope promised the church would do all it could to help 
the poor 
the pontiff also said he was willing to meet with soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev but that obstacles prevent him from making a 
papal tour of the soviet union 
gorbachev is to travel to italy in november and a visit to the 
vatican would be the first ever between a pope and a soviet 
communist chief 
the pope said he would meet gorbachev with great respect as 
the head of state the head of a system 
but the pontiff added he would be unable to visit the soviet 
union because of continuing problems between the roman catholic 
church and state that dates from the repression of ukrainian 
catholics in 1946 by the late dictator josep stalin 
today ukrainian catholics form the largest underground church 
in the soviet union 
this is really a very difficult problem the pope said the 
vatican and soviet orthodox church leaders are discussing the issue 
but no early breakthrough is expected 
madagascar is the popes first stop on a nineday tour that also 
includes visits to the french island of reunion in the indian ocean 
and the african nations of zambia and malawi 
malagasy as citizens of madagascar are known gathered at the 
airport and waved flags and banners when the pope arrived 
the pope kissed the ground upon arrival and said the catholic 
church would do all it could to help the impoverished nation the 
bishops of this country have called on all their brothers to work 
with determination to rehabilitate the economy he added 
like many african countries the government has abandoned 
socialist policies to gain needed western aid and improve a 
moribund economy 
president didier ratsiraka used the occasion to criticize 
opposition parties which blame his government for the nations 
protracted economic problems and accuse him of rigging last months 
presidential elections 
the opposition declared a papal truce and halted six days of 
antigovernment riots that claimed six lives 
roman catholic clergymen also have been highly critical of 
ratsirakas government and a committee of catholic and protestant 
clergymen who observed the march 12 presidential election said 
there were widespread irregularities 
ratsiraka won by 63 percent of the vote western diplomats say 
any irregularities likely did not significantly affect the outcome 
a vatican official said the pope was expected to address the 
issue of political ethics during his visit 
later today the pope was to meet with youths in a soccer 
stadium in antananarivo the capital and in the evening meet with 
catholic and protestant clergymen 
about 40 percent of the population of the former french colony 
is christian and the rest animist half the christians are roman 
catholic

three young chinese women lured to san 
francisco with a promise of dance lessons were kept in an apartment 
and forced to perform domestic labor authorities said

residence they could come and go but it was a very structured 
type of come and go district attorney chief investigator john 
majka said friday one day after authorities freed the women 
the women ages 14 19 and 20 had no money and no place to 
go they were placed in protective custody pending the outcome of 
an the investigation majka said 
one of the women had lived in the apartment for nearly a year 
police seized a large number of documents and other records at 
the apartment and workplace of the homeowner who police identified 
only as a chinese man the documents were written in various 
chinese dialects and may take some time to evaluate majka said 
no charges have been filed yet 
the women were apparently lured from china with a promise of 
studying dance at a fictitious school called the san francisco 
college of music and theater arts 
all of the girls appeared to be in generally good physical 
condition they were very happy and they thanked the investigators 
for taking them out majka said we believe they may have been 
held against their will there 
immigration and naturalization service officials said they were 
unsure of the womens immigration status and were investigating it

senior government officials met today with 
student activists seeking democratic reforms but failed to resolve 
issues that have caused almost two weeks of largescale protests 
against chinas political system 
state council spokesman yuan mu and state education minister he 
dongchang met for 3 hours with both student activists and 
representatives of officially sanctioned student unions 
it was the first government contact with the student activists 
the government has declared their organizations illegal 
the appearance of yuan believed to be part of the inner circle 
of the nations top decisionmakers was an indication of how 
serious the government regards the recent student unrest 
the chinese government criticized a us statement on the recent 
demonstrations calling it inappropriate because the demonstrations 
are purely chinas internal affair in washington the state 
department had said that all peoples should have the right of 
peaceful assembly including peaceful protest and freedom of 
expression 
the meeting took place in offices of the allchina youth 
federation a government body encompassing various youth groups 
wuer kaixi the president of the united association of beijing 
universities a group newly formed by student activists was 
invited to the meeting but not allowed to attend after he refused 
to give up a plan to openly denounce the governments position that 
the association is illegal 
zhou yongjun another representative of the independent student 
group who attended the meeting said it was a failure because the 
government side refused to recognize the legitimacy of the 
association 
he said state education minister repeated the government 
argument that the association was illegal but he couldnt say 
which law weve broken that to me was a victory 
after the protests began students at 41 beijing colleges ousted 
their schoolappointed student federations and set up their own 
student committees each of the committees in turn chose 
representatives to the united association of beijing universities 
zhou said the weeklong class boycott in force in most beijing 
universities would continue the students are demanding freedoms of 
press and speech and an end to official corruption 
zhou said the student side raised questions of bureaucracy and 
corruption in the meeting he said yuan sought to placate the 
students by saying that a shrill editorial in the communist party 
mouthpiece peoples daily last week was directed at only a minority 
of the students 
the editorial accused the students of being unpatriotic and said 
they were involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the communist party 
and the government 
students reacted to the editorial by staging a 15hour march 
through the streets of beijing on thursday up to 150000 marchers 
were cheered on by tens of thousands of citizens along the way in 
one of the boldest challenges ever to the communist party 
leadership 
zhou complained that the government side did not treat the 
student leaders as equals he said there were no plans for further 
meetings with the government 
of the 40 students at the meeting about half were from the 
newly formed studentchosen activist groups and the other half from 
the official student unions which the activists have rejected 
one activist leader said many from the official student unions 
supported their cause 
the campuses were quiet today with classrooms empty and many 
students outside enjoying the spring weather 
at beijing normal university scattered groups of students said 
in one classroom building quietly studying but no classes were in 
session 
student leaders have said the strike will go on until thursday 
the 70th anniversary of chinas first student demonstrations for 
democracy

an indian supertanker that ran aground in 
the red sea was refloated today after it spilled nearly 1 million 
gallons of oil sources said an expert warned the oil could harm 
fragile coral reefs and turtle breeding areas 
oil industry sources in riyadh the saudi capital said leakage 
from the tanker kanchenjunga apparently was less than had been 
previously reported a 50mile long oil slick was breaking up the 
british broadcasting corp said 
the saudibased sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said an estimated 949000 gallons of oil flowed from ruptured tanks 
of the kanchenjunga after it struck a reef near the port of jiddah 
on wednesday 
that spill was about 2 percent of the oil aboard the 276744ton 
tanker and about 8 percent of the 10 million gallons lost in the 
exxon valdez accident in alaska last month earlier lloyds 
shipping intelligence unit in london reported that 15 million 
gallons had spilled in the red sea incident 
while fears of a major pollution threat to the red sea eased 
one environmental expert warned that even a limited spillage could 
be dangerous to the waterways environment 
the red sea is especially vulnerable because it has many 
beautiful coral reefs and there are some turtle breeding islands 
in the area said walter vreeland an american advisor to the 
bahrain government on environmental problems vreeland also said 
light crude oil such as that carried by the kanchenjunga is more 
toxic to marine life than heavier grades 
salvage industry sources said the stateowned kanchenjunga 
believed to be indias biggest tanker was refloated after some 
cargo was pumped into another vessel and later was taken to a 
port the cargo was to be reloaded later 
the ship loaded about 1 million barrels of iraqi basra light 
crude at saudi arabias yanbu terminal and was bound for bombay 
when it hit the reef six miles off jiddah there were no injuries 
reported among the crew of about 70 
jiddah port officials saudi aramco the national oil company 
and the meterorological and environmental protection authority a 
government agency were jointly handling the case 
in new delhi officials at the shipping corporation of india 
which owns the tanker could not be reached for comment today was 
a government holiday 
lloyds which monitors shipping activities around the world 
reported on friday that three of the ships tanks containing 
nearly 200000 barrels of oil had been damaged 
the kanchenjunga has previously encountered trouble in the 
middle east as one of the first ships attacked in the persian 
gulfs tanker war between iraq and iran the bridge was wrecked 
and two crew members were wounded in an attack by iranian warplanes 
in the persian gulf on christmas day 1984

moslem gunners today lobbed shells into 
lebanons christian enclave in violation of a ceasefire called by 
the arab league 
six howitzer shells slammed into the christiancontrolled 
coastal strip north of beirut over five hours a police spokesman 
said there was no response from army commander gen michel aouns 
christian gunners he said 
police said no casualties were reported from the sporadic 
shelling 
at least 273 people have died and 993 have been wounded in six 
weeks of fierce fighting the latest outbreak of lebanons 14year 
civil war 
the spokesman who requested anonymity said the intermittent 
shelling underscored differences over terms of the ceasefire 
which took effect friday 
he predicted the syrians and their druse allies would continue 
fighting until aoun lifts a blockade of ports they have been 
operating illegally 
if the shelling continues the spokesman said it could lead 
to an exchange of fire and consequently it would shatter the 
truce 
after aoun imposed the blockades the syrians and their allies 
laid siege to the 310square mile enclave where 1 million 
christians live 
although he agreed to the ceasefire aoun disagrees with a 
provision of the ceasefire that calls for lifting the blockades 
imposed on all sea air and land facilities aoun who also heads 
the christian cabinet in lebanons dual government interpreted the 
clause to mean that a moslem blockade of two ports in the christian 
enclave should be raised 
arab league secretary general chedli klibi in cables sent late 
friday to aoun and his sunni moslem rival clarified that the 
accord covered all sea ports irrespective of their status 
but the christian leader cabled back that his blockade of the 
militiarun ports was enforced in implementation of lebanese 
laws 
the halfdozen illegal ports along lebanons mediterranean 
coastline were stripping the state treasury of 100 million a year 
in uncollected taxes

us flags flew at half staff and 14 
american war veterans bowed their heads in memory of 749 comrades 
killed by german torpedo boats as they trained for the dday 
invasion 
the service which took place next to a sherman tank salvaged 
from the shallows off slapton sands in devon ended a day of 
tribute friday to the american servicemen who died on april 28 
1944 
the soldiers had been preparing amphibious landings as training 
for the june 6 dday invasion of normandy that summer 
however the training exercise turned into real battle when nine 
enemy vessels chanced upon the 30000 american troops in the 
english channel and torpedoed three of their landing craft 
earlier friday the 14 us veterans boarded the british 
destroyer hms bristol to lay a wreath on the sea off the southwest 
coast of england many wept hugging their wives as they paid 
their respects 
the massacre was hushed up at the time to preserve morale in the 
tense weeks before dday after the war it remained secret until 
ken small a local innkeeper began investigating why so many 
american servicemens possessions kept washing up on the beach 
small recovered the sherman tank in 1984 and persuaded local 
authorities to turn it into a permanent memorial his efforts led 
to the dead americans finally being officially honored at a 
ceremony in 1987 
as the wreath was thrown to the waves a guard of honor stood to 
attention on the destroyers deck and two buglers of the royal 
marines played taps 
john doyle 72 of missoula mont who was captain of landing 
ship tank515 which picked up many of the survivors said he was 
touched by the ceremony 
we picked up about 100 survivors in the morning and of course 
there was a lot of confusion but this ceremony means a lot to all 
of us 45 years on i feel the people who died can now properly be 
laid to rest he said 
his thoughts were echoed by other veterans who survived the 
disaster 
john fedyszyn 62 of dunkirk ny was on lst507 when a huge 
explosion rocked the ship 
i was in these waters for six hours until we were spotted and 
picked up and i was only 17 at the time he said it is great 
to be back but its very emotional and i am a little tearful its 
something i will never forget 
for 64yearold kenneth bloch of hicksville ny the day 
marked the end of a long quest 
when i was rescued from the sea the first thing i noticed was 
seeing my shipmates lying on the deck dead for me this is my way 
of paying my tribute to all my friends he said

nearly 20 years after man landed on the 
moon the us space program lacks clear longrange goals and 
public commitment former astronauts and nasa officials said 
we need a consistent government policy former space agency 
administrator james m beggs said friday 
andrew j stofan a vice president of martin mariettas 
astronautics group and former nasa official said the agency should 
have a strategic plan to colonize the planet mars over the next 100 
years a manned space station would be a first step toward that 
end he said 
beggs and stofan were among a panel of experts who discussed the 
space program at an annual news conference of the aviationspace 
writers association 
also at the meeting the head of a national project to build a 
spacecraft that can take off and land like an airplane said the 
plan was making great progress but proposed cuts in defense 
spending were endangering it 
we look at it as the opening of a new era the era of 
hypersonics said robert barthelemy head of the national 
aerospace plane project 
the craft would be capable of horizontal takeoff and landing 
from earth to orbit traveling at speeds of up to 17000 miles per 
hour 
japan west germany france the soviet union and great britain 
all are working on their own hypersonic programs barthelemy said 
maybe you need a world consortium to do this he added 
beggs said those countries also are looking at a manned space 
station and eventually exploring mars 
but our leadership is no longer guaranteed we must earn it 
he said 
former astronaut charles pete conrad jr said the 
administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration 
should have cabinetlevel status as a secretary of space 
stofan said a lack of direction longrange vision and firm 
budgets have led the space agency to waste billions of dollars on 
projects planned then cut back then planned again with nothing 
accomplished 
another former astronaut joseph allen said several space 
accomplishments were imminent he noted the launch of the magellan 
space probe to the planet venus from the shuttle atlantis which 
was delayed friday at least until next week and the planned launch 
of a mars probe from the shuttle late this year 
but he said it is increasingly apparent that many projects and 
particularly a manned space station have proceeded too slowly 
because of a lack of focused leadership 
in many ways were not being honest to the generations to come 
because of this lack of commitment and lack of a strategic plan 
said allen 
conrad said that the apollo applications group recommended more 
than 20 years ago that a manned space station be built and followed 
by a mission to mars but successive presidents shot the 
recommendations down 
they were among a set of recommendations made again last year by 
the national commission on space 
its now 1989 and the space station is about seven years 
away said allen

outside namibia until midmay when they are to return as unarmed 
refugees to participate in november elections provided for by the

this week to allow another two weeks to verify whether the 
guerrillas had left namibia he said if the south africanled 
forces verify the guerrillas departure by may 13 the peace plan 
would resume 
the three nations were the main parties in the un accord that 
also calls for the withdrawal of cuban troops aiding the marxist 
government in angola against south african and usbacked rebels

labor unrest are disrupting the economy and fomenting political 
unrest senior officials said saturday the government was studying 
tough new measures to end the strikes but the official refused to

long workweeks a growing number are demanding wage increases 
better working conditions and a share in south koreas growing 
economic prosperity

billion in lost production this year it is concerned about efforts 
by radical students and dissidents to build a political alliance 
with striking workers to challenge the roh government 
roh has introduced broad reforms since he took office in 
february 1988 but dissidents associate him with the authoritarian 
regime of his predecessor chun doohwan 
in addition to rohs ouster radicals are demanding the 
withdrawal of 43000 us troops stationed in south korea under a 
mutual defense pact they say the troops prevent reunification with 
communist north korea

in the mexican countryside where land means 
everything there is constant tension over land rights and land 
reform disputes and seizures frequently end in violence as this 
one did 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to peasants living in the folds of 
mexicos southern mountains sebastian perez nunez was a hero the 
leader of their struggle for a piece of land 
to roberto zenteno rojas who wanted to build a ranching empire 
perez was a bandit 
as the sun dropped low on the thursday after last christmas 
their confict came to a violent end 
zenteno saw perez in an old maroon pickup on the other side of 
the pump at the only gas station in town got out of his white 
pickupcamper and fired at least 13 bullets into his enemy 
authorities say 
investigators said someone in the pickup fired back but missed 
perez died zenteno went into hiding 
the struggle that flooded from one and the sick rage of the 
other are accumulated expressions of the failure to find a solution 
to the problems said gov patrocinio gonzalez garrido of chiapas 
state who knew both men 
in remote southern mexico problems are rooted in land reform 
and justice which have routes as circuitous as the curling 
mountain roads 
zenteno 49 and perez 38 were born on farms in bochil county 
zenteno on land his grandfather owned and perez on the big llano 
grande ranch where his father worked 
perez grew up speaking tzotzil an indian language after 
finishing sixth grade in bochil town a twohour walk from home he 
became a bilingual teacher 
he looked for ways to help his fellow peasants and the 
foundation of his struggle became the land reform acts that emerged 
from mexicos revolution in 19101920 
those acts outlaw such large holdings as llano grande and 
peasants can petition the government to give the land to them 
if the petition is granted a peasant receives a grant called an 
ejido the land it covers can be used and passed on to children 
but not sold or rented out 
entangled as it is in bureaucracy the process takes years even 
lifetimes 
investigations of old deeds challenges by owners and 
conflicting previous decisions conspire with inefficiency to create 
a legal labyrinth in the agrarian reform system the cases are not 
handled by courts 
he started to see all the applications for ejidos that were 
20 30 40 years old said perezs wife manuela 34 who lived 
with him since she was 14 the ones who first made the 
application had already died 
he began to see that the government said there was no more 
land because land doesnt stretch but he saw there was still 
land in the hands of caciques they passed themselves off as small 
property owners but they had a great deal of land 
the peasants saw zenteno as a cacique or rural boss a man 
with land wealth and clout 
zenteno had run the family ranch since he dropped out of school 
in the sixth grade when his father fell ill he raised cattle and 
sold smaller tracts of land to buy bigger better ones like the 
santo domingo ranch putting some in the names of his children 
he had houses on santo domingo in bochil where he served a 
term as mayor and in tuxtla gutierrez the state capital 
perez started working for the peasants in 1980 about 35 tracts 
of 250750 acres were turned into ejidos through his efforts 
posters from his unsuccessful campaign for a federal senate seat 
on the socialist party ticket last summer show him with a droopy 
mustache and beard he had just finished a term in the state 
legislature 
perez spent his last year on an ejido called las granjas with 
manuela and their three daughters they lived in a rundown 
twostory main house whose columned porch nowdry swimming pool 
and palmlined drive recall more opulent days 
zenteno and perez came to grips in 1986 when peasants petitioned 
for santo domingo the zenteno familys prize holding and two 
other tracts totaling about 1000 acres 
gonzalez the governor says the holdings were within legal 
limits which vary depending on land use availability of water and 
other factors 
the peasants disagreed and conducted a recovery putting up 
shacks and planting crops while they awaited a decision zenteno 
and other ranchers called it an invasion 
they looted they stole what they found and left said the 
eldest of zentenos five children roberto we had to be ready 
for this every week or two 
another son eduardo was wounded two years ago in an ambush the 
family blames on perez 
at the time of his death perez was named in 27 warrants on 
robbery and other charges stemming from takeovers gov gonzalez 
said landowners often fabricate charges against peasant leaders 
on dec 11 the younger roberto zenteno said peasants took 
corn some fighting cocks and sheep four bulls disappeared and 
squatters invaded the main house 
we exhausted all the resources said his brother marco 
antonio a lawyer we knocked door to door on the government 
offices we felt impotent 
authorities ran campesinos off the ranch twice and the zentenos 
sometimes did it themselves 
manuela perez remembers sadness at christmas an anonymous 
letter had wished her husband and other peasant leaders a bitter 
christmas and sad new year 
on thursday dec 29 station attendants told authorities 
zenteno was getting gas when perez arrived in the pickup with his 
wife and two other people an attendant began filling the maroon 
truck they said and zenteno started shooting 
an autopsy revealed 13 bullets in her husbands body fired from 
close range 
investigators said three shots came from the pickup paraffin 
tests indicated perez had fired a weapon but none was found 
a small gray wooden cross marks the grave the name lettered in 
black by hand 
zenteno is wanted for homicide maybe he thought he could get 
away with it 
tradition in chiapas has been that a crime is committed and in 
six months is forgotten or you have the guarantee justice isnt 
going to function gonzalez observed in an interview he said he 
is changing that

as the soviet union and china prepare for their 
first summit in 30 years mikhail gorbachev and deng xiaoping could 
look to their border for lessons in getting along a frontier 
region that once bristled with soldiers now bustles with trade 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it began with 200 tons of 
watermelons the chinese feared would rot they ran a white flag up 
a watchtower and invited soviet soldiers on the other bank of the 
bluegray amur river to a meeting 
the kgb border guards went then reported back to officials in 
this siberian city 3500 miles east of moscow that the chinese 
wanted to deal 
after some discussion blagoveshchensk authorities dispatched a 
barge to pick up the melons giving the chinese a load of 
fertilizer in exchange 
that modest barter arrangement in 1987 began trade between the 
soviet unions amur region and the neighboring chinese province of 
heilongjiang that grew to the equivalent of 81 million last year 
russians in blagoveshchensk a boom town of the 19th century 
gold rush once worried about the chinese coming now they want 
them to 
in the 1960s when ideological and border disputes poisoned 
sovietchinese relations huge portraits of mao tsetung sprouted 
on the shore in heihe the city half a mile away across the amur 
chinese tanks and military vehicles maneuvered on the icebound 
river and maos frontier troops even bared their buttocks to mock 
soviet soldiers recalled capt alexander m kirushin commander of 
the 50 border guards in blagoveshchensk 
we were frightened and ready to evacuate said irina 
alexandreyeva 62 then a nurse in this city of 210000 we were 
prepared for anything the chinese could have crossed 
now government and business leaders in blagoveshchensk court 
workers investors and potential trading partners on the other side 
of the amur in an effort to end chronic shortages of goods and spur 
the local economy 
vladimir vechinkin said in our region theres no way to 
avoid external economic relations we border on our great neighbor 
the peoples republic of china 
he is first deputy chairman of government in the amur region an 
area the size of montana where slightly more than 1 million people 
live 
as the may 15 summit approaches soviet officials describe 
blagoveshchensk as a showcase for the advantages of better 
relations 
it is an atypical example 
border trade totaled 146 million last year according to the 
soviet foreign trade ministry that means trade in this area 
accounted for more than half the commerce along the 5000mile 
frontier 
changes wrought by it are graphic in blagoveshchensk where the 
chinese have arrived and more are on the way 
on the fifth floor of what someday will be the tourist hotel 
chinese workers slather mortar onto tiles its part of a 12 
million contract for painting tiling and performing other work on 
three building sites awarded last year to a heihe construction firm 
when the tourist hotel opens blagoveshchensk will have its 
first chinese restaurant 
we need to increase construction threefold by the year 2000 
and build 64 new enterprises but we have a shortage of building 
trade specialists said anatoly s lagutin chief of the regional 
construction organization amurstroi the chinese have the 
specialists and a talent for manual work 
they also come cheap each of the 100 chinese working in 
blagoveshchensk earns the equivalent of 450 a day about 
onefourth the average soviet industrial wage they also get free 
housing in an amurstroi dormitory and are fed by a chinese chef at 
soviet expense 
classrooms at middle school no 14 are filled with the voices of 
russian children singing songs or reciting verse in mandarin 
it is a modest demonstration of interest in chinese culture when 
compared with instruction in other foreign languages english is 
taught in hundreds of blagoveshchensk schools but principal 
albina n dimnich expects to hire two more chinese teachers this 
year 
all parents of my pupils tell their kids study hard and 
maybe in the future youll become a specialist in chinese and help 
develop relations between our countries said alexander trukhin 
a language teacher at school no 14 
the school also provides a lesson in how difficult 
sovietchinese relations have been a hallway poster exhorts soviet 
youngsters to vigilance proclaiming remember the border is 
next door 
for consumers in blagoveshchensk better relations have meant 
the availability of cigarette lighters video and audio cassettes 
umbrellas thermos bottles and other chinesemade goods supplies 
are erratic however and prices can be high 
trukhin 22 paid 250 nearly a months salary to buy a denim 
jacket from a chinese construction worker 
generally the feeling is optimistic 
were at the very beginning in developing our trade with 
china said vechinkin the government official he expects the 
summit to improve sovietchinese relations and the climate for 
trade 
the soviets have offered to sell 100 million kilowatt hours of 
electricity to the chinese starting next year and officials from 
both countries have agreed to build a hydroelectric station on the 
amur 
in may a 30channel radiotelephone will go into service 
enabling people in blagoveshchensk and heihe to talk to each other 
its very difficult to have commercial ties if you cant talk 
to your partners vechinkin said

vice president dan quayle marked 
his first 100 days in office saturday in australia clearly 
enjoying his role as roving ambassador for the bush administration 
us ambassador bill lane said the vice president has a lot in 
common with the australian people hes likeable and hes outgoing 
and hes crazy about sports particularly golf quayle squeezed 
in a lastminute round at this lush resort in the countrys 
northeast quarter saturday 
whether sipping beer at a pub in sydney batting balls at the 
australian national tennis center in melbourne or climbing up to a 
giant nasa satellite dish near canberra quayle clearly was 
enjoying himself down under 
what he admired about the australians quayle said was their 
directness their candor and the fact they called him 
dan 
after 100 days in office the vice president says one of the 
best things about his new job is the foreign travel 
but he might have to scale back on overseas trips this summer 
he said because of pressing business in congress 
i do enjoy the foreign travel and i do enjoy carrying 
messages for the president gaining information from the people and 
the countries that ill be visiting because it will be very 
valuable information as we contemplate the policies that will be 
enacted during the bush administration quayle told an audience 
of mainly australian reporters at a press conference in canberra 
for quayle and his staff the real test here was whether he 
could negotiate his second foreign trip without committing blunders 
that might recall the uncertainties about his qualifications that 
were raised by opponents in last falls presidential campaign 
quayle who has taken to making selfdeprecating jokes about 
himself to defuse criticism in a way that ronald reagan used to 
make fun of his age realized the challenge even on this 
relatively riskfree diplomatic mission 
i appreciate the introduction and also the lunch particularly 
the quail eggs he said at his first press conference 
you have your story already written the press had quayle for 
lunch he joked 
with the exception of a couple of gaffes he once referred to 
pago pago the capital of american samoa where he stopped over 
briefly as pogo pogo and a diplomatic spat over grain exports 
quayles trip is going according to the script 
asked saturday by one australian reporter about what he had 
accomplished on his trip quayle said he had some tough candid 
talks with australian leaders 
more importantly he said he learned about the issues facing 
australia and established a rapport with many of the countrys 
younger politicians 
officially quayle was president bushs representative at the 
australianamerican friendship week which commemorates the allied 
cooperation in world war ii and the battle of coral sea 
while bush was a decorated fighter pilot shot down in the 
pacific theater quayle wasnt even born until two years after the 
war ended a fact he addressed several times 
but the 42yearold quayle said i believe that this 
generation my generation is very dedicated and understands the 
importance of maintaining freedom and maintaining a posture of 
peace 
from the australians point of view the big news was quayles 
insistence that us subsidies on wheat exports are not detrimental 
to australian wheat exports abroad 
rick farley executive director of the national farmers 
federation called that view an insult to his countrymen 
australians claim their share of the overseas markets have been 
hurt by price supports 
quayle said he was ready for the australians reaction but a 
top aide speaking on condition he not be identified said the vice 
president and his aides were surprised by the sharpness of the 
attacks 
but those attacks may have been good preparation for quayle who 
has said there are some thorny diplomatic issues hell confront 
when he visits indonesia singapore and thailand on the next leg of 
his 12day journey

soviet citizens are increasingly fleeing the farms 
for a better life in the already strapped cities a troublesome 
trend that threatens to worsen the countrys economic problems 
officials said saturday 
the soviet population climbed 93 percent during the past decade 
and now stands at 2867 million with the largest increases in the 
central asian regions according to census figures published 
saturday 
a top soviet statistician expressed concern the population had 
not increased faster which he said was necessary to ensure 
greater economic development and that growth rates were low in 
european regions 
pravda the communist party daily devoted an entire page to 
preliminary results of the nationwide census conducted in january 
the countrys first since 1979 
the demographic center of the soviet union is gradually shifting 
from the european slavic heartland the russian federation the 
ukraine and byelorussia to central asia according to data from 
the state committee on statistics 
those numbers represent troublesome trends for the soviet 
leadership which has been trying to keep the countrys peasantry 
on the farm and has acknowledged it cannot create jobs fast enough 
in central asia to keep pace with population growth 
the total number of soviets grew by 243 million in the past 10 
years and stood at 2867 million jan 12 that represents a growth 
of 93 percent since 1979 
four traditionally moslem republics in soviet central asia 
registered the greatest population increases a 34 percent rise in 
tadzhikistan 29 percent in uzbekistan 28 percent in turkmenia and 
22 percent in kirghizia 
azerbaijan the only predominantly moslem republic in the soviet 
caucasus had a 17 percent increase in population and in the fifth 
central asian republic kazakhstan the number of people rose 13 
percent 
population growth in the rest of the country did not exceed 10 
percent 
the scope of the development of the soviet economy and the 
need for additional manpower resources to develop economically 
promising areas call for greater population growth nikolai 
belov state statistics committee deputy chairman told the 
official tass news agency this especially concerns some regions 
above all in the european part of the country and in the far east 
the russian federation the largest of the 15 constituent soviet 
republics remains the most populated with 1474 million 
inhabitants but its population grew by only 7 percent 
the ukraine remains second with 517 million people but the 
increase only was 4 percent in byelorussia the population rose 7 
percent 
in the past decade the soviet rural population dropped 38 
percent to 34 percent of the total 
however tass said high population growth rates were registered 
in central asias rural regions as a result of which there 
emerged the problem of the ablebodied populations employment in 
the countryside 
a total of 106 million soviets migrated from villages to 
cities and the countrys urban population grew by 252 million or 
15 percent tass said in a dispatch summarizing census results 
that would aggravate an already serious housing problem one of 
every five urban residents in the soviet union lives in dormitories 
or in communal apartments with common kitchens bathrooms and other 
facilities 
as a result of the flight from the countryside to the cities 
there are now far more men aged 1829 than women living in the 
rural regions of most soviet republics tass said given such a 
ratio not all men can marry it said

nearly a year ago house speaker jim wright 
confidently asked the ethics committee to quickly dispose of a list 
of charges hurled by a pesky conservative rep newt gingrich 
the process has been anything but quick wrights fortunes have 
fallen as gingrichs have risen and the speakers supporters now 
find themselves attacking the same investigators they once 
encouraged 
since filing the ethics charges gingrich has been elevated to 
minority whip the no 2 gop leadership post in the house 
soon probably within the month wright the nations highest 
elected democrat is likely to go on trial before the ethics 
committee there wright will have his first chance to publicly lay 
out his defense against charges that he violated house rules 69 
times over the past decade 
a tough chicago lawyer richard phelan will act as the 
prosecutor it was phelan who led the ethics committees long 15 
million investigation that turned over virtually every stone in 
wrights 40year political career 
wrights defense will rely on a team of lawyers likely to be 
announced this week who will seek to pick apart the legal ground 
on which phelan has built his case and cut down witnesses called to 
testify against wright 
in addition to wrights current lawyer william oldaker the 
team may include such symbols of respect as democratic patriarch 
clark clifford and perhaps a hardnosed trial lawyer like richard 
benveniste who was an assistant prosecutor in the watergate case 
but in another sense the defense already has begun wrights 
supporters chiefly members of the texas congressional delegation 
have surrounded the speaker and are playing hardball politics with 
anyone seen as an enemy 
asked what he would advise two ethics committee democrats chet 
atkins of massachusetts and bernard dwyer of new jersey who voted 
against wright on a key issue in committee rep jack brooks 
dtexas replied pray 
they are rumps in and horns out said rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo alluding to what she termed a different sort of 
behavioral standard shared by texans being from texas means 
never having to say youre sorry 
while it will give him an opportunity to mount a pointbypoint 
defense the trial also is likely to be politically painful to the 
speaker ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said the 
proceeding probably would be open to the public and the major 
television networks are pressing for a waiver of committee rules to 
open the event to cameras something wrights supporters fear 
we think its in the public interest said barbara cohen 
chief of the cbs news washington bureau and head of a network 
pool that handles matters of mutual concern to the 
broadcasters we certainly would be doing stories on the nightly 
news and would like to use the speakers own words 
wrights strategy with his colleagues is to align himself with 
them and the institution admitting personal flaws but appealing to 
the pressures all lawmakers feel conflicts between friendships and 
public responsibilities financial constraints loyalty to the 
house 
at the same time wright and his lieutenants have sought to 
paint phelan as an overzealous outsider who is trying to 
singlehandedly rewrite the institutions own rules and who has 
somehow conned the ethics committee into agreeing with him brooks 
referred to phelan in a television interview as an assassin 
but some members in both parties view the effort to isolate 
phelan as risky and with the potential to backfire one midwestern 
democrat notes that wright himself publicly welcomed the 
appointment of phelan an active democrat last july 
others both democrats and republicans say the ethics committee 
enjoys a high level of credibility in the house and that lawmakers 
will probably accept whatever verdict the committee returns 
the defense the speaker has put together is absolutely 
reprehensible says rep vin weber rminn a close ally of 
gingrich and a leading gop spokesman on the wright case 
it will not serve them well and it doesnt reflect well on the 
people around him their strategy is basically to commit democratic 
members to his exoneration before they have seen the evidence and 
to attempt to discredit and intimidate the ethics committee 
noting comments like brooks advice to the ethics committee 
democrats who voted against wright weber added these are not 
random offthecuff remarks these are toplevel powerful 
democrats who are close to the speaker these are threats from the 
speaker of the house 
between now and wrights trial there also is the likelihood of 
continued revelations about his business dealings the ethics 
committee is scheduled to interview a group of texas businessmen on 
wednesday and thursday who were participants in a gas well venture 
that yielded huge profits for wrights blind trust last year 
and last week it was revealed that wright failed for four years 
to pay 8000 owed for a corporate jet he and others used in 1985 
for political fundraising the bill was paid tuesday only after 
the planes owner got wind that a reporter for the wall street 
journal had found out about the incident which would have amounted 
to an illegal and unreported campaign contribution

nasa said today it will not try to 
launch space shuttle atlantis and the robot probe targeted for 
venus until a fuel pump problem and leaking fuel line are corrected 
on the space shuttle and we dont know when we can go 
sources close to the program reported earlier that the 
postponement could be at least 10 days but later said that was 
based on a preliminary assessment they said the delay will be 
several days and possibly could stretch to a week or more if 
technicians have to replace both the pump and the fuel line 
nasa spokesperson lisa malone said nasa officials are evaluating 
the problems today and have assigned committees to study each 
element she reports from those committees will be made on sunday 
we dont know when we can go said malone it depends on 
where the troubleshooting takes us 
a launch countdown was stopped friday with just 31 seconds left 
after controllers detected an electrical power surge in a main 
engine fuel pump later engineers found leak in a hydrogen fuel 
line 
atlantis is to carry into space a robot probe called magellan 
which is to fly to the planet venus in a resumption of americas 
exploration of the solar system after an 11year gap 
earlier robert sieck the kennedy space center launch director 
said technicians would remove panels of the engine compartment to 
get at the pump 
the leaky hydrogen line which spewed a cloud of vapor toward 
the end of the countdown also must be repaired sieck said 
engineers believe the vapor escaped through a pinhole in a fitting 
the technicians worked through the night to drain a half million 
gallons of oxygen and hydrogen rocket fuel from atlantis they then 
planned to install scaffolding at the base of the spacecraft and 
remove panels covering the engine compartment 
nasa spokesman george diller said engineers should be able to 
examine the faulty pump by tonight only then can it be determined 
how the problem will be corrected the experts looked at the leaky 
hydrogen line this morning but were still undecided on what 
repairs were needed for that problem he said 
if either the pump or the hydrogen line have to be replaced the 
launch could be postponed until well into next week sieck said 
atlantis couldnt be launched before monday at the earliest 
because of the two problems he said 
both of them would have to fall into a quick fix and it would 
be optimistic to expect that sieck said 
among tens of thousands who had gathered for the planned rare 
afternoon liftoff were prominent planetary scientists who have been 
waiting to resume solar system exploration since 1978 when 
pioneervenus was launched on the last us planetary expedition 
we have waited a number of years for this flight and a few 
extra days wont matter said lennard fisk nasas chief 
scientist the window is a month long having the shuttle ready 
on the first day is ample time to solve the problem and get us on 
our way to venus 
thats just the way it is said james head a geologist from 
brown university 
the space agency must send the magellan probe on its way by may 
28 to take advantage of the proper alignment between earth and 
venus if nasa cant meet that deadline officials would have to 
wait two years before the two planets again are in the desired 
position 
after the scrub was announced the astronauts climbed out of the 
spaceship in their bright orange launch suits and were taken back 
to the crew quarters for a late lunch 
the crew includes commander david walker along with pilot 
ronald j grabe mary l cleave norman e thagard and mark c lee 
sieck said the preparations seemed picture perfect until 20 
minutes before launch 
a computer malfunction was quickly fixed and the count resumed 
after a sixminute delay then with fewer than 50 seconds left on 
the clock an engineer in the launch control room told sieck 
possible problem with an engine 1 recirculation pump 
recommend hold at tminus 31 
the countdown was stopped 
it just wasnt our day sieck said he fretted out loud that 
the weather perfect on friday would likely be less ideal next 
week 
after it is released from atlantis cargo bay magellan will 
rocket itself onto a 15month 806 millionmile path toward venus 
the earths nearest planetary neighbor 
the explorer craft will spend eight months orbiting venus and 
mapping about 90 percent of the planet surface using a 
sophisticated radar system 
venus is a cloudshrouded world that has always intrigued 
scientists because it is about the size of earth but lacks any of 
the conditions that make life on this planet possible

attendance has soared at this citys 
roman catholic cathedral as unease and superstition haunt the 
border valley where authorities say 15 people were ritually 
murdered by a drug smuggling cult 
parents here and across the rio grande in brownsville texas 
keep closer watch on their children an ecumenical prayer service 
scheduled for sunday in brownsville is billed in fliers as intended 
to heal our land 
and police in a puzzling action most witnesses refused to 
discuss burned down the bloodsplattered shack at a ranch where 
four suspects say the gang practiced human sacrifice in hopes of 
protecting their drug trafficking 
now people are saying yes evil exists said the rev 
ruperto ayala espinoza a priest at our lady of refuge the 
catholic cathedral that towers over matamoros main plaza 
the priest said there has been a marked increase in attendance 
at services communion and confession since the first 12 bodies 
were exhumed at santa elena ranch april 11 
people who may have been indifferent toward the church have 
moved closer to the church he said 
he said many parents no longer leave their children unattended 
or let them walk to and from school out of fear of the 
narcosatanicos a term coined by mexican newspapers to 
describe the cult members 
investigators believe that only a few of the victims were 
sacrifices and that the others were killed in retaliation for 
soured drug deals 
the prevalence of traditional mexican mystic healers and herb 
shops selling magic paraphernalia moved the population to take 
seriously the threat of occult sacrifices said the priest 
here theres a lot of belief in witchcraft spells 
superstition said ayala whose church denounces such practices 
at texas southmost college in brownsville last week three days 
of seminars on the occult and satanism scheduled before the 15 
bodies were discovered had to be moved to larger rooms because of 
overflow attendance 
investigators say the ranch sacrifice did not involve satanism 
but a deviant form of the afrocuban religion palo mayombe known 
for using human body parts in its rituals 
nelda san roman 27 of brownsville who attended one of the 
seminars said it does not matter what name the evil practices go 
by 
they all add up to the same thing she said the devil is 
behind it no matter what you call it 
at the santa elena ranch last sunday mexican and us police 
watched the incineration of the wooden shack where the cult held 
bloody rituals 
nearly two weeks after the first bodies were exhumed in a field 
next to the shack police had photographed the area but left in 
place evidence including cauldrons of human brains blood sticks 
goats heads and a mutilated rooster 
police would not discuss reasons for the shack burning the only 
us journalist present was frank ordonez a brownsville herald 
photographer upon arriving he said he saw a man circling the 
shack he said sheriffs lt george gavito of brownsville told him 
the man was performing an exorcism 
the man went inside the shack and made some hand gestures before 
his face then the sign of the cross before torching the building 
ordonez said 
while it was burning he threw bags of white powder on the 
fire he said 
gavito said wednesday there was no purification exercise he 
said a man threw something but i dont know what it was it 
might have been something for the smell 
one witness who would not be identified said the powder was 
salt in white magic salt often is used to drive out evil 
ayala espinoza said 
tony zavaleta an anthropologist at the college who specializes 
in mexican folk beliefs videotaped the burning but refused to 
discuss what took place 
when i stepped on that ranch last week for the first time 
to me in my mind there was a feeling of evil zavaleta said i 
could just feel it after it was burned i felt better about it 
zavaleta who also is a brownsville city commissioner said two 
of the suspects had taken his classes 
i asked myself if there are any other massmurderers in my 
classes he said im a little bit paranoid whether i should 
speak frankly about these things with the students or worry about 
finding someone waiting for me out in the parking lot

lawmakers on this popular resort island 
have decided to keep the death penalty for now but residents 
eventually may have the final say 
the house of assenbly voted 1919 to retain capital punishment 
for premeditated murder with the speaker of the house casting the 
deciding vote in favor 
despite the vote the governing united bermuda party of premier 
john swan is still considering whether to put the matter to a 
national referendum britain of which bermuda is a colony 
abolished the death penalty in 1965 
we will now discuss the matter in the party caucus swan 
said after fridays vote we feel the public should have a say 
before any moves for abolition 
swan raised the possibility of a referendum on march 31 10 days 
after bermudas governor sir desmond langley stayed the hanging 
of troy dean shorter 
shorter was convicted of firstdegree murder in the slaying of 
shopkeeper roger redman he had exhausted all appeals when langley 
exercised his right to commute death sentences to terms of life 
imprisonment 
the stay of execution was strongly protested 
the legislative debate over capital punishment also has delayed 
the opening of another murder trial that of 29yearold 
businessman leroy alvin dunlop dunlop is accused of the july 10 
slayings of his girlfriend and her two daughters 
bermuda uses hanging to execute murderers the last time the 
gallows were used was dec 2 1977 when murderers larry tacklyn 
and buck burrows were hanged 
the double hanging led to widespread civil unrest and the 
arrival of british troops to quell riots

remember may fourth has become the rallying 
cry of beijing students who have swept past police barricades to 
march for democracy and clean government the past two weeks 
the date is as emotionally stirring to intellectual chinese as 
1776 is to americans or bastille day to the french 
it is the day in 1919 that beijing university students launched 
a campaign for science and democracy showing intellectuals for the 
first time their power to lead the masses and affect policy 
even before the april 15 death of a reformist official triggered 
the new protests students were counting the days to celebrate the 
70th anniversary of the may fourth movement 
now after having marched repeatedly on central beijings 
tiananmen square and staged the largest protests in 40 years of 
communist rule many students are studying the history of the 
movement to learn from its strategy 
it was chinas enlightenment said one student marcher 
referring to the 18th century science and democracy movement in the 
west that gave rise to the american and french revolutions 
may fourth divided chinese history into two parts what came 
before and everything afterward the student said what we are 
doing now is a continuation of may fourth 
the may fourth movement began with student anger over the 
versailles treaty that ended world war i chinas warlord 
government agreed to treaty clauses that endorsed japans seizure 
of parts of china during the war 
more than 3000 students from 13 beijing schools led by chinas 
most prestigious school beijing university gathered may 4 1919 
at the tiananmen gate to the former imperial palace 
they signed a manifesto denouncing the treaty burned the house 
of a government official and beat another as a traitor 
protests spread to other cities and were supported by 
newspapers worker strikes and boycotts of japanesemade goods the 
government quickly backed down and rejected the versailles treaty 
but the protests did not stop 
galvanized by their new sense of power the students then 
demanded sweeping democratic reforms and adoption of western 
scientific thinking chinas traditional culture made it weak and 
ripe for foreign invasion the students argued 
the movement trained a generation of intellectuals in political 
activism many went on to support the communists in the civil war 
that ended in 1949 with communist victory 
but for the may fourth movement there would have been no 
chinese revolution he xin a scholar said at one of a series of 
symposiums being held in china to commemorate the anniversary 
the official symposiums have been careful to stress that 
protests may have been appropriate then but not now 
however student protesters and older intellectuals say they are 
angry that so little progress toward establishing a democratic 
scientific system has been made 
seventy years lamented one banner carried in thursdays 
march by 150000 students and supporters on tiananmen the symbolic 
seat of power in china and rallying place for protesters 
we havent yet achieved the society we hoped for said 
88yearold bing xin one of modern chinas leading writers and a 
participant in the original may fourth movement 
we can speak out but our words have little effect we are not 
yet satisfied she said in a rare interview the rule of man is 
still more important than rule of law 
bing xin said the 1919 movement won widespread support because 
it had a popular goal opposing japanese imperialism as well as 
the vaguer slogans of science and democracy those were new words 
in china and many people didnt know what they meant she said 
in a country where onequarter of the population is illiterate 
many people today still dont understand the student calls for 
science and democracy 
but they understand the students protests of official 
privilege nepotism and profiteering thousands of workers joined 
thursdays march and many cited corruption as the reason 
officials turn public funds into their own private wealth 
fumed one taxi driver of course i support the students 
outofuniform soldiers and police also have expressed sympathy 
and some have sent letters of support to beijing university 
students 
however todays students are finding it harder than in 1919 to 
turn this silent support into action in part because of government 
control over jobs housing and other necessities 
i cant just find another job and i depend on my work unit 
for housing and my childs education said one worker 
older intellectuals also are fearful of showing support many 
have been jailed criticized or sent to the countryside during past 
leftist campaigns 
but perhaps the strongest factor discouraging protests from 
spreading to all sectors of society as in 1919 is a deep yearning 
among most chinese for peace 
memories are vivid of the 196676 far leftist cultural 
revolution mao tsetungs final effort to perpetuate class 
struggle thousands of people were killed and tens of thousands 
suffered 
one university teacher who applauded the students said it is 
this memory that keeps him from marching in my heart i dont 
want another cultural revolution

the black chemical workers 
union has filed suit to stop the sale of mobil corp assets in 
south africa until it negotiates a disinvestment procedure the 
union said saturday 
the suit was filed friday but a hearing was postponed until may 
9 said taffy adler a spokesman for the chemical workers 
industrial union which represents 1200 of mobils 1500 south 
african black workers 
mobil corp which has done business in south africa for 90 
years announced friday it was leaving the raciallydivided nation 
the oil giant said it was selling operations once valued at more 
than 400 million to general mining union corp ltd for more than 
155 million in cash and 10 million that was expected to be the 
operations 1989 profit 
far from being moral or politically progressive mobil has 
seriously disadvantaged its work force by selling to one of the 
most notoriously antiunion south african corporations the union 
communique said 
the union said company officials earlier told them they had no 
intention of selling south african operations and promised to 
discuss withdrawal procedures with the union if it becomes an 
issue 
the most recent refusal by mobil to negotiate because 
disinvestment is not an issue is in a letter dated feb 13 
1989 the union said it is inconceivable that mobil had not 
begun the process which would lead to disinvestment from south 
africa 
recently the union approached foreign companies including 
mobil with demands in the event of a sellout 
among the requests were a 12month advance notice and guarantees 
of job security in the mobil case the union has also said it 
wants details of the sale agreement and has insisted future profits 
from licensing and franchising the company name in south africa go 
into a union trust adler said 
the chief executive of mobils south africa operation robert 
angel said friday there would be no immediate change in employment 
policies or benefits when the company is turned over to the general 
mining union corp a south african conglomerate 
he and general mining officials have said all existing 
agreements with the union would be honored and mobil would 
continue until at least 1994 to fund a foundation that supports 
community development programs in south africa

one man wanted to sprinkle powdered 
cheese on the nations worst oil spill in hopes it would make the 
oil congeal and easier to pick up 
another would have dropped feathers on the slick either making 
the sludge easier to pick up or tarring and feathering alaskas 
coast 
ideas on how to clean up the 101 million gallons of oil spilled 
in prince william sound began pouring in before the exxon valdez 
tanker wreck was 24 hours old 
a japanese company sent a box of equipment the problem was the 
directions also were in japanese 
it is a big challenge figuring out who is trying to unload a 
warehouse of some product and who has an answer to alaskas 
problems said jeff mach coordinator for the alaska department of 
environmental conservation 
weve gotten hundreds of offers mach said some of them 
come across as a little bit of salesman and a little bit of a 
dogooder 
exxon too has been deluged with inventions 
they range from the sublime to the ridiculous said exxon 
spokesman dennis stanczuk the one thing about all of them 
though is its people trying to help 
tens of thousands of towels have been sent to valdez to help 
with the mopup 
one of the most successful strategies has been to do what nature 
does to cleanse itself shower the rocky beaches with water 
this highvolume flushing of the beach its natures 
way said erich gundlach a specialist in oil contamination of 
beaches and a consulting geologist for the state 
theyre speeding up the natural processes gundlach said 
adding that too many people expect a toothbrush out there 
most of the ideas being used are established practices taken 
from past oilspill fights 
alaska fishermen gave a twist to a triedandtrue method by 
sewing absorbent pads into the nets they normally use to catch 
herring salmon and other fish in alaskas rich waters 
most products presented to state biologists and 
environmentalists are turned over to the coast guard which sends 
them to the services research center in connecticut 
its easy to test your product in a bathtub said the decs 
mach they want to test it in a real field situation 
art cecala of costa mesa calif brought a drum of sanifoam a 
product made in florence sc under the auspices of 3m cecalas 
problem was getting anyone to stop long enough to arrange a test of 
his product 
its a real catch22 cecala said if you go to one agency 
theyll say youve got to have the others approval first 
everybody uses everybody else as a scapegoat for not using the 
product 
cecala described his foam as 96 percent air 3 percent water and 
1 percent urea formaldehyde and said it has a bacterial reaction 
as opposed to a chemical reaction making it safe for the 
environment 
you can just spray it on and over an extended period of time 
the oil will be eaten away it takes a while a couple three 
years he said 
spotting oil sheens has been a problem cecala noted once 
they threw this on it it wouldnt be a problem he said it 
would look like giant popcorn 
some oil spill solutions are too secret even to discuss as mach 
found out when a group from hawaii called offering a product but 
refused to say what was in it 
cleanup officials dare not reject out of hand the wellmeaning 
suggestions lest they overlook a possible solution 
the state was similarly besieged with ideas from around the 
country in october when three calfornia gray whales were trapped in 
ice near barrow 
two minnesotans who were given a polite brushoff when they 
offered their services refused to take no for an answer rick 
skluzacek and greg ferrian loaded their equipment on an airliner 
and flew to barrow at their own expense 
their device known as a bubbler proved invaluable in 
keeping the whales breathing holes icefree and freeing the 
animals

washington president bushs decision to go ahead with the 7 
billion fsx fighter deal sets the stage for a heated congressional 
debate over usjapanese defense ties trade friction and 
americas hightechnology future 
in announcing the agreement for joint development and production 
of an advanced version of the f16 fighter bush sought to allay 
concerns voiced on capitol hill as well as within his own 
administration over the economic and technological impact of the 
deal 
bush told reporters friday that the united states will have a 40 
percent share in the development work and a similar share of 
the production run for the 130 planes which japan wants to deploy 
in the late 1990s 
addressing technology issues the president said that 
sensitive source codes for the aircrafts computer will be 
strictly controlled access will be granted to only those codes 
that are essential to complete the project 
bush said he was convinced that the agreement is in the 
strategic and commercial interests of the united states 
however several members of congress said they were still 
dissatisfied with the terms of the deal and would strive to block 
it when the agreement is sent up to capitol hill for a 30day 
review period 
congress could try to halt the deal by passing a joint 
resolution of disapproval but a twothirds majority of both houses 
would be required to override a likely bush veto of such a 
resolution 
rep richard a gephardt dmo chairman of the house fsx task 
force declared that i will lead an effort to ensure that this 
giveaway of american technology never sees the light of day 
once again the administration has allowed political and 
foreign policy factors to dominate a decision having a fundamental 
impact on our economic future said gephardt who last year ran 
for president on a trade protectionism platform 
gephardts st louis district is the home of general dynamics 
which is slated to work with japans mitsubishi heavy industries in 
codeveloping and coproducing the fsx 
the missouri democrat and other critics of the deal contend that 
japan instead should buy americanmade f16s off the shelf to 
help ease this countrys 55 billion trade deficit with japan 
the fsx announcement came the same day as the office of the 
trade representative released a study listing japan as one of the 
worst users of trade barriers according to published reports the 
agency recommended sanctions for refusing to open its markets to 
usmade cellular phones and mobiles radios 
proponents of the fsx have argued that the deal will give us 
industry access to valuable technology particularly in the areas 
of composite wing construction and advanced radar systems 
developed by the japanese 
however a congressional source said a classified report sent to 
capitol hill friday by the general accounting office an 
investigative arm of congress indicates that the united states 
actually may gain little or nothing from such japanese technology 
we dont know as to what advanced technologies they the 
japanese might have so its pure guesswork from what theyve 
been able to estimate from opensource stuff the us is far 
advanced in wing composites and is even further advanced in the 
radar technology said the source who spoke on condition he not 
be identified 
the source said gao officials also were expected to testify at 
hearings on the fsx that when the deal was initially negotiated 
during the reagan administration us officials did not consider 
any commercial or economic implications they did not bring in any 
agencies that do that they did it solely for security reasons 
and security was narrowly defined 
after the bush administration took office concern over the 
deals broader economic implication was voiced at white house 
meetings by commerce secretary robert mosbacher and us trade 
representative carla hills this prompted bush to send the draft 
agreement back to tokyo for clarifications 
another point that is expected to be raised by fsx critics on 
capitol hill is use of socalled side letters to handle provisions 
on the us production work share and protection of computer source 
codes rather than stipulating these provisions in the 
usjapanese memorandum of understanding that is the heart of 
the deal 
this goes to the issue of trust in japanese willingness to fully 
live up such agreements in the past tokyo has been accused of 
failing to adhere strictly to provisions of other sideletter 
agreements including in the area of semiconductors 
sen alphonse damato rny commented about the japanese i 
dont trust them i think theyll promise you anything and then do 
what they want 
damato said he likely will join in a resolution of disapproval 
on the fsx even though he doubts the move will be successful in 
blocking the deal 
congressional critics also are expected to argue in coming weeks 
that the fsx deal will provide technology that may help propel 
japans aircraft industry into headtohead competition with the 
united states 
we are giving our strongest competitor in the world 
marketplace the expertise it lacks to directly challenge americas 
leadership in international civil and military aircraft sales

moslem forces fired howitzer shells into 
the christian heartland on saturday violating the latest truce 
called by the arab league 
police said syrian and allied druse gunners fired a half dozen 
shells into the coastal strip of the 310squaremile enclave north 
of beirut no casualties were reported 
a police spokesman said the forces of gen michel aoun 
commander of the christian army brigades did not retaliate 
the sporadic shelling came during growing differences betweeen 
aoun and the arab league over the interpretation of a key provision 
in the truce accord that went into effect at noon friday 
the truce is the fourth effort by the arab league in less than a 
month to contain six weeks of hostilities that have killed 273 
people and wounded nearly 1000 
a provision in the agreement calls for lifting the blockades 
imposed on all sea land and air facilities 
aoun who also heads the christian cabinet in lebanons dual 
government insists that the clause covers only the ports of beirut 
and jounieh in the christian enclave they are besieged by the 
syrians and allied forces 
arab league secretarygeneral chedli klibi sent cables to aoun 
and his sunni moslem rival salim hoss saying the provision in 
question covered all sea ports 
aoun responded to klibi in a cable saying his blockade of 
militiarun ports was in implementation of lebanese laws and 
therefore are not to be described as blockades 
lebanon has sought the support of the arab league to help it 
implement its laws and extend its authority on all its territory 
and not to give a legitimate status with an arab cover to 
illegitimate situations ports that violate local and 
international laws aouns cable added 
the syrians and their allies besieged the christian enclave in 
retaliation for a blockade by aouns forces of militiarun ports 
aoun on march 6 ordered the blockade to stop the illegal ports 
from collecting customs fees that instead would go to the state 
treasury 
aoun has charged that three ports run by syrianbacked militias 
along the mediterranean coast south of beirut were used to 
smuggle drugs and terrorism to the world 
hoss sent a cable to klibi declaring support for his 
interpretation of the controversial provision and saying the 
majority of the lebanese people did not regard aoun as their 
legitimate prime minister 
an aide to hoss who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
dispute might block implementation of the truce which was 
announced late thursday after an emergency meeting of the arab 
foreign ministers in tunisia 
aoun had welcomed the arab leagues decision to send arab 
military observers to oversee implementation of the truce calling 
it a shy step in the right direction of lifting the syrian 
hegemony off lebanon 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of failing 
to achieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league by 
siding with the moslems against the christians in the civil strife 
aoun has declared a war of liberation to drive syrias 
40000 troops from eastern and northern lebanon as well as from 
west and south beirut

a supertanker that ran aground in the red 
sea was refloated saturday but sources said it leaked nearly 1 
million gallons of oil that could damage coral reefs and turtle 
breeding grounds 
salvage crews were breaking up a 50mile oil slick the indian 
tanker left after it ran aground off saudi arabia on wednesday the 
accident ruptured three of the ships tanks and sent about 2 
percent of its cargo into the water according to the company that 
owns the vessel shipping corp of india 
the tanker was taken saturday to the saudi port of jiddah after 
part of its cargo was pumped into another vessel so the tanker 
could be refloated 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit in london reported earlier 
that 15 million gallons had leaked but saudibased sources who 
requested anonymity said saturday that about 924000 gallons 
spilled 
the exxon valdez spilled about 10 million gallons of oil into 
the water off alaska last month 
s k sood joint managing director of the shipping corp of 
india said the 276744ton kanchenjunga supertanker had 71 people 
on board when the accident occurred six miles off jiddah there 
were no reports of injuries 
his statement issued by the governmentrun company in bombay 
india did not give the cause of the accident which occurred 
after the tanker picked up a load of light crude and headed back 
toward bombay 
although earlier fears of a major pollution threat to the red 
sea eased saturday one environmental expert warned that even a 
relatively small spill could endanger the waterways environment 
the red sea is especially vulnerable because it has many 
beautiful coral reefs and there are some turtle breeding islands 
in the area said walter vreeland an american advisor to bahrain 
on environmental problems vreeland also said light crude oil is 
more toxic to marine life than heavier grades 
the kanchenjunga was one of the first ships attacked in the 
persian gulf during the tanker war that once raged between iraq

the jury in the oliver north trial ended 
deliberations for the weekend shortly after noon today after 
considering the case for about three hours 
earlier in the morning the trial judge had cut off contact with 
the press corps because 10 news organizations have gone to court to 
seek public disclosure of a piece of evidence in the case 
us district judge gerhard a gesell has been keeping in touch 
with the news media through a press corps emissary 
hereafter no information will emanate from my chambers 
gesell said in a letter to carl stern of nbc news the news media 
liaison with the judge please advise the press to call a court 
telephone number which is updated periodically to keep up to date 
with court proceedings 
stern said the judge was taking the step because the press is 
now an adversary in a court proceeding before gesell the 
associated press and nine other news organizations want public 
disclosure of a stipulation summarizing intelligence intercepts of 
a ciaassisted november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
more than 20 news organizations that were not parties to the 
proceeding wrote a letter to gesell saying that each of us 
requests permission to maintain contact with the court or its 
chambers regarding developments in the north matter 
norths lawyers referred in closing arguments to the 
stipulation but the court refused to release the document publicly 
it shows that top us officials knew at the time of the 
november 1985 shipment that hawk missiles were aboard the craft 
north is charged with creating a false chronology that says no 
one knew until january 1986 that hawks were aboard part of his 
defense is to show that cia director william casey and national 
security adviser john poindexter knew from the intercepts what was 
aboard yet agreed to the story that no one knew 
on april 22 gesell rejected the disclosure motion by the news 
organizations to release the stipulation saying it is a 
classified document 
the news organizations appealed and the appeals court friday 
sent the matter back to gesell calling for a hearing on national 
security issues involved saying it cannot make a decision without 
having such a record 
today the judge set a conference for monday when a schedule can 
be set for compiling a record on the national security issues 
north is accused of lying to congress to cover up his role in 
secretly assisting the contras and lying to the attorney general 
about aspects of the diversion of funds to the contras from the 
iran arms sales he also faces charges that he accepted a 13800 
home security system and converted 4300 in travelers checks from 
a contra leader to his own use

submitted a record number of invitations for their relatives to 
come from the soviet union israel radio reported saturday 
it said that about 79000 invitations were submitted to soviet 
authorities last year the highest annual figure since the 
beginning of the mass soviet jewish emigration in the late 1960s

for a person wishing to emigrate from the soviet union 
uri gordon head of the jewish agencys immigration department 
was quoted by the radio as estimating that soviet jewish emigration 
would reach 50000 this year 
but the radio quoted gordon as saying that 90 percent of the 
emigrants are likely to choose the united states and other western 
countries instead of israel 
last year the soviets allowed about 20000 jews to emigrate 
only about 2200 chose to settle in the jewish state 
in the first three months of 1989 9461 jews were permitted to 
leave according to the washingtonbased national conference for

nationwide the amnesty program had a 94 percent approval 
rate rios said 
those approved for temporary residency begin the process of 
applying for permanent residency already 12300 aliens have been 
granted permanent residency in houston rios said the national 
figure was not immediately available 
it will take an additional five years before the new permanent 
residents can become american citizens during that time most 
amnesty applicants must pass an englishlanguage civics test

70 and those who have attended a year of high school college or

residents of a border town said south 
african soldiers helped guerrillas in a vicious rampage that killed 
seven people the national news agency reported saturday south 
africa denied the report 
in a dispatch from the town of ressano garcia reporter cassimo 
ginabay of the aim news agency said townspeople unanimously 
agree that there was south african involvement in the attack 
the rampage which included looting burning of cars and killing 
of livestock began at 1030 pm thursday and ended nearly five 
hours later aim said 
the town is across the border from komatipoort south africa 
where mozambique and south africa signed a pact in 1984 agreeing 
not to support guerrillas operating in each others territory 
both sides have claimed violations but relations between the 
two countries have improved over the past few months south africa 
has even given aid to help the mozambican army protect the 
countrys power pylons from attack by the rebel mozambican national 
resistance 
the resistance has been fighting since 1977 to topple the 
marxistoriented government it denies reports that it attacks 
mozambican civilians 
south african government officials say no official support now 
goes to the guerrillas but aim continues to carry reports that 
south african military equipment and soldiers are used to supply 
the guerrillas or to aid them in operations 
aim quoted lucas chirute owner of a local disco as saying that 
the attackers were unloaded from a south african army vehicle i 
saw at least 15 bandits get out of the vehicle he said 
the aim report quoted another witness who was not identified 
as saying that during the attack south african soldiers shone huge 
searchlights on a supermarket being looted 
they lit up the area around the foreign exchange store from 
which the bandits stole most of the food the person was quoted 
as saying aim said the same source reported that south african 
soldiers shot at people who were running toward the south african 
side of the border it said at least 200 residents fled into south 
africa 
a spokesman for south africas military said 147 refugees fled 
into mozambique late thurdsay and early friday after heavy gunfire 
was heard coming from the direction of mozambique 
these facts obviously make nonsense of aims claims that 
south african forces participated in the attack the spokesman said 
aim quoted local administrator domingos durbeque as saying 250 
guerrillas divided into three groups attacked the town mainly 
targeting the military headquarters the border guard post and the 
foreign exchange store 
aim said six miners returning to visit their families after 
working in south africa were killed as well as a woman 
aim said the guerrillas stole or burned the belongings of more 
than 20 miners waiting to catch a train dynamited and set fire to 
four locomotives valued at 6 million burned seven vehicles 
destroyed the towns immigration post shot cattle in a corral and 
kidnapped an unknown number of people who were forced to carry away 
the looted food and clothing

weapons bringing to 3000 the number of rebels it claims have

have increased since feb 15 when the soviet union withdrew its 
remaining troops from afghanistan 
we are expecting more in the future maybe a major one very 
soon amani said he did not say when the 422 guerrillas 
surrendered or what happened to them 
the usbacked rebels have been fighting since april 1978 to 
overthrow the marxist government of president najib there are no 
reliable estimates on how many total guerrillas there are

number of village leaders along the salang highway the key supply 
route between the capital and the soviet border to the north 
the agreements offered each village muchneeded food and fuel 
provided that government vehicles were allowed to travel unmolested 
on the highway rebels have consistently attacked government 
vehicles on the road

national press was accepted by nearly every village only the 
village of mirbackhat was singled out for refusing

a united mine workers strike against the 
pittston coal group has led to more than 1180 criminal charges 
mostly resulting from civil disobedience tactics reminiscent of the 
60s civil rights movement 
the 3weekold umw strike against pittston operations in 
virginia and west virginia grew increasingly bitter last week as a 
daylong rally shut down this mountain town where coal trucks 
regularly rumble down the main street 
miners families joined in getting arrested and more than 200 
high school students walked out to support the union 
were not wanting to violate the law said umw strike 
coordinator marty hudson we just want people to know what 
pittston coal has done 
union officials say pittston the nations 15th largest coal 
company and second largest coal exporter has violated labor laws 
and refused to bargain in good faith 
pittston dropped out of the industrys main bargaining group 
the bituminous coal operators association before talks started on 
a new contract last year opting to work out its own agreement with 
the umw 
the rest of the major coal producers have reached agreements 
with the union but 15 months of negotiations have resulted in no 
contract for pittston 
the company canceled health insurance for 1500 umw retirees 
when the old contract expired jan 31 1988 one strike deadline 
passed earlier this year when the union agreed to a 60day cooling 
off period requested by the governors of virginia west virginia 
and kentucky 
both sides agreed that wages are not a major issue in the 
contract dispute the sticking points are job security employee 
responsibility for paying for health insurance and sunday work 
days 
the umw finally called a strike april 5 affecting about 1700 
workers in virginia and west virginia it did not strike pittston 
operations in kentucky citing strategic reasons it will not 
explain 
the uses forms of civil disobedience such as the sitin to draw 
attention to its cause but has updated them with new technology 
union officials carry beepers on the picket lines and some have 
car phones both sides videotape everything sometimes aerially 
for possible use in court at times security guards film pickets 
filming guards 
union members wear camouflage on the picket line presumably to 
make it more difficult to identify individual miners on videotape 
the campaign began april 18 when 37 wives and widows of umw 
members staged a 30hour sitin at pittstons headquarters in 
lebanon in western virginia 
by friday state police reported arrests on 122 felony charges 
mostly throwing rocks at nonunion coal trucks and 1060 
misdemeanors mostly sitting in roads and blocking entrances to 
pittston mines and coal preparation plants 
authorities did not know how many people were arrested because 
some were charged more than once 
arrests monday sparked a rally at the dickenson county 
courthouse in this community just southeast of the kentucky state 
line that was attended by hundreds of signtoting relatives and 
supporters of umw members 
the next day saw a walkout by students at three high schools who 
staged their own rally at the courthouse on thursday 70 student 
walked out at lebanon high school and staged a rally outside 
pittston headquarters 
we have said all along since when they announced they would 
use civil disobedience that it is merely a predetermined excuse to 
break the law said pittston spokeswoman susan copeland 
she said the umw has ignored a dickenson county circuit judges 
order barring mass demonstrations at 17 pittston operations 
theyre just putting themselves above the law she said 
hudson says the civil disobedience by keeping union members 
occupied has prevented violence 
the union also has urged pittston shareholders to ask at the 
companys may 9 annual meeting how long pittston can operate during 
a strike even with replacement workers in some mines 
union officials say their strike fund totals 100 million and 
can be boosted at any time by increasing assessments on dues 
striking miners are paid 200 a week from that fund and the union 
is providing lowcost hospitalization insurance for those left 
without benefits

pope john paul ii on saturday 
urged 20000 youths at a soccer stadium to reject violence and 
embrace forgiveness and reconciliation in this troubled african 
island nation 
on the first full day of his nineday african tour the pope 
made frequent reference to the social and economic problems that 
contributed to recent antigovernment riots in madagascar in which 
six people were killed 
after flying to the port of antsiranana on the northern tip of 
the island for a outdoor mass the pope returned to the capital to 
address youths at the alarobia stadium a soccer ground cut into a 
red hillside 
whoever you are whatever your difficulties you have to be 
intransigent in the defense of rights and justice john paul 
said speaking in french while standing on a raised platform 
reject violence reject contempt reject lies and dishonesty 
take risks if its necessary but know how to forgive and 
reconcile 
in a speech to the countrys 21 bishops later the pope praised 
their recent document proposing natural family planning to control 
the countrys 3 percent annual population growth 
you refuse contraceptive imperialism and even more abortion 
which is against malagasy wisdom and civil law the pope said 
i strongly encourage you to continue to educate consciences on 
this essential point 
only one in 100 married women in madagascar uses contraception 
according to the world watch institute the population of 11 
million is projected to approach 17 million by 2000 
in the meeting with youths the pope cited the concerns of 
students and laborers who cant find jobs or salaries that allow 
them to raise a family he singled out rural workers who often 
are subjected to a climate of insecurity and violent actions an 
apparent reference to the widespread banditry in the countryside 
one student asked the pope if he had any remedies for the 
countrys critical situation of decay 
lets say clearly that it is not my position to analyze all 
the aspects nor to propose solutions first and foremost because 
its you the malagasy people who have to act the pope said 
the roman catholic church in madagascar has often spoken out 
against the policies of president didier ratsiraka saying the 
country has slipped into moral social and economic decay 
ratsiraka who took power in 1975 was reelected last month to 
a third sevenyear term opposition leaders charged the elections 
were rigged 
opposition parties have suspended their protests during the 
popes visit declaring a papal truce two main opposition 
leaders have asked to meet with the pope but vatican officials 
said a meeting was uncertain 
the youths clapped waved banners and swayed to the rhythm of 
polynesianflavored music reflecting the diverse ethnic makeup of 
the country young girls on a platform held up cards forming words 
in malagasy including the slogan everyone must work together to 
improve our country 
the pope urged the youths to reject drugs alcohol and casual 
sex saying casual encounters are but a caricature of love 
in antisaranana the pope celebrated mass for about 20000 
people gathered on a dirt and sand field next to the airport 
the pope leaves monday for the tiny french indian ocean island 
of reunion then travels to zambia and malawi before returning to 
rome on may 6

antiabortion forces since a truce in the first days of the bush 
administration that assured prolifers they would get top agency 
posts they in turn vowed not to oppose sullivans confirmation 
sen gordon humphrey rnh said that while the 
administration has shown compete good faith on the earlier 
appointments the controversy around fulton adds a whole new 
element 
even though fulton would be heading a nonmedical agency he 
would be dealing with family matters humphrey said last week 
sullivan first upset antiabortion activists with a newspaper 
interview indicating he personally opposed abortion but favored 
womens right to choose 
in the fray that followed sullivan assured his critics that he 
shared bushs opposition to abortion except in cases of rape 
incest or danger to the mothers life 
humphrey and other conservatives in congress sought assurances 
from the white house that several top hhs jobs sensitive to 
abortion policy would go to people who actively shared bushs 
antiabortion views 
the positions for which they sought assurances were 
undersecretary assistant secretary for health and assistant 
secretary for public affairs humphrey said and the lawmakers 
suggested names for sullivan to consider 
one of the first people sullivan recommended for an hhs position 
was among those suggested james o mason formerly director of the 
centers for disease control in atlanta has been confirmed by the 
senate as assistant secretary for health a position that will have 
policy dealings on the abortion issue 
two others sullivan recommended early on also were applauded by 
the conservative republican lawmakers constance horner director 
of the office of personnel management whose nomination to be 
undersecretary is awaiting senate confirmation and kay james 
former spokeswoman for the national right to life committee as 
assistant secretary for public affairs 
despite the latest controversy sullivan has persisted in 
support of fulton and oklahoma gov henry bellmon has lobbied on 
fultons behalf at the white house according to sources who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity 
sullivan is to meet with white house officials to discuss his 
recommendation this week said chase untermeyer assistant to the 
president for personnel untermeyer said that while fulton is 
sullivans choice there are also other candidates we are looking 
at 
that would be a very controversial nomination if they went 
forward with it said douglas johnson legislative director of 
the national right to life committee 
in a letter to the white house humphrey said he was concerned 
about allegations in a lawsuit suggesting that from 1977 to 1983 a 
number of babies born with spina bifida a severe spinal defect 
were denied needed surgery in a stateoperated hospital in oklahoma 
fulton who in 1983 became director a state agency with 
authority over the hospital strongly denies any suggestion that he 
condoned such practices he recently was dropped as a defendant in 
the lawsuit 
its certainly not true that we sat around and let the 
challenged practices continue he said in an interview there 
isnt any question we took appropriate action 
the lawsuit was filed in october 1985 after fulton refused to 
sign a consent decree which he said would have been tantamount to 
an admission of guilt on the states part to things he knew not to 
be true 
he said that while he served in the two top state health 
offices only one spina bifida infant died and that child died of 
complications from multiple birth defects 
humphrey said however that he remains concerned about the 
very serious allegations which if true would certainly seem to 
rule him out from a place in health and human services since his 
point of view would be directly in conflict with that of the 
president in the area of right to life 
sen orrin hatch rutah one of the conservative senators who 
initially expressed concern about sullivan said in a recent 
interview that the secretary and president bush have been sensitive 
to abortion opponents concerns 
hatch said he is satisfied with those sullivan has recommended 
to top hhs positions adding but i dont think the abortion 
issue should drive everything i think its also important that you 
get the best people you can get and i think theyre moving in that 
direction

the errant underwater robot jason was raised from 
the deep saturday breathing new life into a 7 million 
international satellite science project whose submersible star had 
unceremoniously sunk 
the crew had prepared an understudy for the project but now 
the show can go on said paul fontaine of bostons museum of 
science jason is back 
the 7footlong remotecontrol robot will be on center stage 
monday as the first of 250000 students in 13 cities across the 
united states and canada hook up via a twoway satellite with 
marine explorers in the mediterranean sea 
about 2000 museum officials teachers and technicians were 
testing the system last week when jason a propellerdriven 
submersible equipped with video camera and maneuverable arms 
disappeared overboard 
dr robert ballards rubberbooted assistants were easing the 
milliondollar robot overboard off the coast of italy when the 
cable snapped and the younger brother of the robot that first nosed 
among the titanics ruins sank 2100 feet to the soft silty ocean 
floor 
everybody felt very badly about it said fontaine one of 
dozens of museums officials nationwide who have worked nearly two 
years to coordinate the project 
jasons as much a member of the crew as anybody he was on the 
frontline though and everyone knows its the frontline person who 
takes the biggest risks fontaine said it was particularly sad 
because he hadnt even had the chance to show off his stuff 
but shelley lauzon a spokeswoman for woods hole oceanographic 
institution on cape cod said it was not immediately clear whether 
jason would be used in this weeks explorations 
but were hopeful she said everything seems to be fine 
but theyll be looking it all over before making a final decision 
fontaine said his colleagues and school teachers nationwide 
would be ecstatic to hear the good news about jason who has 
been the focus of lesson plans in grade school classrooms around 
the country 
lauzon said the support ship star hercules weighed anchor 
saturday and started steaming about 120 northeast to the spot where 
jason and his mobile garage argo were to explore and broadcast 
during the science projects first week

not a day passes now in the mcmartin 
preschool molestation trial without the judge reminding 
participants of its marathon status as one of the longest criminal 
trials in us history 
i dont want to hear the history of bad faith in this case 
superior court judge william pounders chided attorneys who were 
sniping at each other in a recent session that doesnt interest 
me what im interested in is current events weve got to move 
on 
the trial of raymond buckey 30 and his mother peggy mcmartin 
buckey 62 hit the twoyearsandfourdays mark thursday 
surpassing by one day the hillside strangler trial of angelo buono 
but the mcmartin trial is months from conclusion and attorneys say 
it is unlikely to end before 1990 
testimony from 99 witnesses has filled 50000 transcript pages 
and los angeles county says the proceedings have cost about 15 
million 
buckey spent more than four years in jail before he recently was 
able to post bail 
the mother and son accused in 65 combined counts of conspiracy 
and child molestation are the only remaining defendants in a case 
that began five years ago with seven people charged charges 
against the other five were dismissed after the district attorneys 
office concluded there was insufficient evidence 
the case drew national attention when it broke with allegations 
of nursery school children being raped sodomized then terrorized 
into silence by satanic rites and animal mutilations by teachers 
but as the case was pared down doubts were raised about whether 
the children had been coaxed into describing events that hadnt 
happened to please their adult interviewers 
a preliminary hearing took 18 months at trial the prosecution 
spent more than 14 months presenting testimony from 61 witnesses 
including nine children who claimed they were raped sodomized or 
forced to have oral copulation 
the defense is in the sixth month of its presentation which has 
featured testimony from former teachers and students who testified 
they never saw children molested at the school 
the judge whose temper has flared repeatedly in recent weeks 
took drastic action to cut down testimony after jurors began 
dropping out of the case and some appeared to be nodding off during 
testimony 
two weeks ago he slashed eight witnesses from the defense case 
and warned that he would do whatever is necessary to ensure that 
the trial reaches a verdict 
i have an obligation to see that its a fair trial and that it 
gets to a jury thats still there pounders said i am 
desperately concerned that we are not going to have a jury to 
complete this case the most illogical case thats ever gone to a 
jury 
over the years of testimony four of the six alternate jurors 
have been excused two for medical reasons one who was ruled 
inattentive to testimony and one who had career difficulties 
because of the trials duration 
another juror recently reported that the company that has been 
paying his salary may go out of business which would force him to 
leave the jury and look for work pounders was so disturbed at the 
prospect he said he might consider asking the county to pay the 
jurors salary for the rest of the trial 
although the strain of the long proceedings has taken its toll 
on all participants pounders has been the most visibly distraught 
lashing out at attorneys and others at a session last week the 
owner of a service that he accused of delaying delivery of 
transcripts became the brunt of his anger 
pounders frequently blames defense attorney davis for delays to 
which davis recently responded outside court if you get a judge 
who goes bonkers you can lose the case too 
for jurors the highlight of recent weeks was a chance to leave 
the stuffy courthouse and travel 25 miles to the seaside suburb of 
manhattan beach where they visited the little school where 
molestations allegedly occurred 
the jurors strolled through the school grounds paced off 
distances from one room to another and did their own sound tests to 
see if voices could be heard between classrooms 
the next day they came to court with an enormous cake to mark 
the trials twoyear anniversary 
i thank you the judge said for enduring with us

in a major concession to a student movement for 
democracy senior officials met saturday with student leaders to 
discuss their demands protest leaders however denounced the 
meeting as a government plot to destroy their campaign 
they said 41 universities in beijing would continue their 
weekold class boycott until the government accepts their newly 
formed student union as the true representative of students the 
government has declared the group illegal 
despite the complaints the meeting was an unprecedented event 
in a country where the people and their leaders have little contact 
radio and television stations carried a lengthy broadcast of the 
meeting providing some of chinas most eloquent citizens with a 
rare platform to criticize the government 
does premier li peng really fear the people asked one of 
the 45 students present if not why wont he talk with us 
most people i know dont believe the chinese press it should 
be allowed to tell the truth and not used by the party said 
another 
the 3hour meeting with state council spokesman yuan mu state 
education minister he dongchang and highranking officials from the 
beijing city goverment marked the first time government officials 
have met with student activists since protests began two weeks ago 
government officials speaking on behalf of premier li called 
on the students to return to class they made no promises to change 
state policy but acknowledged student complaints and implied that 
further meetings would be possible 
the appearance of yuan believed to be part of the inner circle 
of the nations top decisionmakers was an indication of how 
seriously the government regards the recent unrest 
the meeting was part of a series of concessions and defeats the 
government has suffered since the protests began 
on april 22 for example the government was unable to put into 
effect an order closing tiananmen square because 150000 students 
and their supporters occupied it to commemorate the death of ousted 
communist party leader hu yaobang it was his death april 15 that 
sparked the first demonstrations for political reforms and free 
press 
on thursday tens of thousands of students marched through lines 
of police defying threats of a government crackdown in the 
biggest demonstration in communist chinas 40year history 
both yuan and he cracked jokes and laughed throughout the 
meeting as they sought to adopt a conciliatory attitude toward the 
student movement 
at one point yuan said the government understood the 
patriotic fervor the desire to push democracy and deepen the 
reforms expressed by the students in their marches 
the statement indicated a radical change from the shrill tone of 
an editorial last week in the peoples daily accusing the students 
of plotting to overthrow the socialist system an editorial in the 
saturday editions of the peoples daily also expressed sympathy for 
the students goals 
the government apparently hopes it can split most of beijings 
students from the leaders of the independent student association 
that has organized the protest the government has said the group 
the united association of beijing universities is illegal 
if the government succeeds in its goal it is unclear what 
awaits the associations leaders several fear arrest 
most participants at saturdays meeting came from the officially 
appointed unions only two came from the independent associations 
leadership although other participants said they were sympathetic 
to the associations goals 
wuer kaixi the president of the association was invited to 
the meeting but not allowed to attend after he refused to give up a 
plan to openly denounce the governments position that the 
association was illegal 
we will by no means acknowledge that this meeting was a 
dialogue wuer said at a hastily called news conference this 
is a plot to coopt our movement our minimum condition is that 
they accept us as a legal organization 
at beijing university several hundred students crowded around a 
loudspeaker hooting derisively at the broadcast 
shut up they yelled as yuan explained that the government 
had achieved grand success in fighting corruption 
many students believe that corruption has so infected the 
government that it is beyond saving 
other barnyard noises followed when he claimed that hu had left 
the party of his own accord in 1987 
hu was purged after he was accused of not cracking down hard 
enough on prodemocracy demonstrations in 198687 
students at beijing university published the first edition of a 
studentrun paper the news journal a fourpage mimeographed 
pamphlet with articles supporting the strike and the student 
movement 
the chinese government meanwhile criticized a us statement 
on the recent demonstrations calling it inappropriate because the 
demonstration is purely chinas internal affair 
in washington the state department said that all people should 
have the right of peaceful assembly including peaceful protest 
and freedom of expression 
student leaders have said the class boycott will go on until 
thursday the 70th anniversary of the may fourth movement chinas 
first student demonstrations for democracy

commercial salmon fishing in oiltainted 
prince william sound will begin next month on schedule but 30 
percent of what should have been a record 50 million catch may be 
lost officials said saturday 
fishing boats will be barred from many areas of the sound when 
the season starts may 15 said state biologist james brady 
at one time officials had considered canceling the season 
altogether just as they had canceled the 12 million herring 
fishing season and smaller seasons in the sound for shrimp and 
sablefish after the exxon valdez ran aground and spilled more than 
10 million gallons of oil march 24 
instead fishermen will be crowded into a smaller area in 
efforts to keep their nets clear of oil that would contaminate 
whatever salmon are caught 
i feel confident that we will be able to proceed with our 
salmon fisheries said brady a biologist with the alaska 
department of fish and game but we will have to sacrifice some 
harvest 
state officials will test whatever salmon is brought in by the 
760 fishermen and pledge that no contaminated fish will reach the 
market spotting and smelling fish tainted by crude oil is easy 
biologists say 
also saturday skies cleared and the seas were calm allowing 
the cleanup to resume after several days of waiting out blustery 
weather 
pilots in oilhunting spotter planes and slickergarbed crews 
aboard skimmer boats coordinated their collection efforts as the 
tarlike residue floated just off or coated shorelines on the kenai 
peninsula 
about 300 people using the uss juneau as a floating hotel rode 
landing craft to smith island where crews are trying to hose down 
rocky beaches before pregnant harbor seals haul out to have their 
pups 
teams from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
and from the state department of fish and game toured sugarloaf and 
marmot islands off the kenai peninsula those may be next on the 
list to be cleaned for seals the coast guard said 
the sections of prince william sound most likely to be closed 
for the may salmon season include prime fishing grounds along the 
outer edge where pink salmon arrive still a bright silver after 
months at sea brady said 
the 6 million salmon expected to return to the sawmill bay 
hatchery probably will be offlimits to fishing ships because of 
the oil although hatchery managers may be allowed to take fish 
inside the bay in order to recover expenses 
other closures may include the western and southwest corner of 
the sound where nonhatchery salmon gather before making their runs 
up freshwater streams 
a lot of the bigger slicks have moved out of the sound or are 
hard on the beach brady said but theres still a lot of oil 
on the water 
there is some concern that fishing boats helping in the cleanup 
will be contaminated by the clinging goo we have to make sure we 
dont have oily boats carrying clean fish alaska environmental 
commissioner dennis kelso said 
exxon vice president ulyesse legrange promised the oil company 
would stockpile extra nets in case fishermens nets get 
contaminated but state biologist brady predicted if fishermen 
hit oil we will run out of gear 
fishermen are preparing for an unusual salmon season 
weve heard a lot of politicians and even james brady speak of 
a fishery as normal and that concerns us mike schomer of the 
copper river fishermens cooperative said 
i dont think were ging to have by any means a normal 
fishery

shortly before the jury in the oliver north 
trial wound up its eighth day of deliberation without a verdict 
saturday the judge in the case cut off direct communications with 
reporters covering the case 
hereafter no information will emanate from my chambers 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said in a letter to carl 
stern of nbc news who has been acting as a news media liaison with 
the court since the trial began 
the judge said a lawsuit filed last week by 10 news 
organizations for public release of a document has made the press 
corps a party to the case and therefore put reporters in an 
adversary position 
since the trial began three months ago a copy of most documents 
introduced in court have been made available to the press and news 
organizations banded together to reproduce them 
during the jury deliberations reporters have remained in a 
press room two floors above the court and relied on sterns contact 
with gesell for information about the progress of the 
deliberations including notice when a verdict is reached 
for the first time since the jurors retired to consider the 
case reporters were not allowed to wait on the second floor where 
they spend their day 
gesell refused to release the paper a stipulation summarizing 
intelligence intercepts on grounds that it is a classified 
document the intercepts as described in court were a 
stepbystep tracking of a shipment of hawk missiles sent by israel 
to iran in november 1985 with cia assistance 
the news organizations petitioned the us court of appeals 
after gesells refusal and that court ordered the judge to hold a 
hearing at which a record can be made 
parties to the news media petition were the associated press 
cable news network inc capital citiesabc inc cbs inc dow 
jones amp company inc national broadcasting company inc 
national public radio the new york times company the times mirror 
company and the washington post 
reporters from more than 20 other organizations on saturday 
wrote to gesell asking that they be excluded from his new rule 
the press organizations which have sent reporters to cover the 
north matter are independent of each other and are not a 
monolithic press corps in any sense in which that phrase may be 
understood or interpreted the letter said 
it was signed by representatives of the cleveland plain 
dealernewhouse news service reuters congressional quarterly 
washington times united press international boston globe upi 
radio chicago suntimes united stations radio network new york 
post 
usa todaygannett wusatv washington dc cox newspapers 
conustv knightridder newspapers gillett broadcasting new york 
daily news wjlatv washington dc pacifica radio time 
magazine voice of america and independent news network 
not long after gesell issued his notice a courthouse official 
notified the press room that the jury had wound up its work after 
deliberating three hours and was leaving for another weekend 
sequestered in a downtown hotel that raised total deliberation 
time to 40 hours 
north is accused of lying to congress to cover up his role in 
secretly assisting the contras and lying to the attorney general 
about aspects of the diversion of funds to the contras from the 
iran arms sales he also faces charges that he accepted a 13800 
home security system and converted 4300 in travelers checks from 
a contra leader to his own use

engineers on saturday studied two 
mechanical problems that halted the launch of space shuttle 
atlantis and its robot venus probe and a nasa spokeswoman said 
its anybodys guess when the mission will take place 
the space agency said the flight will not be attempted before 
late this week at the earliest and that it will be at least monday 
before a new launch date will be set 
sources said the delay which began with the lastminute 
cancellation of the flight friday could stretch to a week or more 
if technicians have to replace both a faulty fuel pump and a 
leaking fuel line 
nasa said it will replace the line but would not know about the 
pump until engineers inspect it sunday 
we dont know when we can go it depends on where the 
troubleshooting takes us said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone 
she said nasa and industry officials evaluated the problems 
saturday and assigned committees to study each element she said 
those committees would make preliminary reports sunday 
three of the five astronauts mary cleave mark lee and norman 
thagard returned to their training base in houston saturday an 
indication nasa doesnt expect to launch soon commander david 
walker and pilot ronald grabe planned to leave here sunday after 
flying practice runs in a jet plane equipped to handle like the 
shuttle 
the delay squeezes valuable time out of a 32day launch 
opportunity window for dispatching the magellan spacecraft 
toward venus 
if the shuttle cant get off the ground by may 28 the mission 
will have to be put off for two years at a cost of more than 100 
million until earth and venus are again in proper alignment 
even with this current issue weve run up against im 
convinced were still in a very favorable position to launch 
atlantis during the magellan window shuttle chief richard truly 
said saturday 
the countdown was halted friday with just 31 seconds left after 
controllers noted a power surge in a pump the pump recirculates 
liquid hydrogen through fuel lines serving engine no 1 keeping 
the lines cool and in proper condition for ignition 
after the launch was called off engineers examining tv tapes 
noticed a second problem a vapor cloud spewing from a line that 
carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the shuttle 
launch director bob sieck said the problems posed no danger to 
the five astronauts because there are so many safeguards the 
engines would not have started 
after the scrub the space agency tentatively set monday as a 
new launch target 
the need to drain half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and 
liquid oxygen propellant from atlantis fuel tank delayed access to 
the orbiter until saturday 
nasa said engineers probably would not be able to inspect the 
faulty fuel pump until sunday about the size of a baseball it is 
one of three such pumps in a package each pump serves one of the 
three main engines 
shuttle managers will need additional information about 
whether or not the recirculation pump or pumps need to be replaced 
before making a decision about a next launch attempt a space 
agency statement said 
nasa also said it is highly likely that the line will have to 
be replaced 
the magellan probe is to be released from atlantis cargo bay 
and propelled by a rocket on a 450day journey to venus it will 
orbit the planet and map its cloudveiled surface with 
highresolution radar

danger of soviet aggression than a situation in which disagreements 
within the alliance could eventually lead to a loss of the trust 
that is essential for its existence 
the major beneficiary might be soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev observers say 
mrs thatcher has said kohls call for weapons talks is 
principally an election ploy west german polls show a majority 
support getting rid of shortrange missiles 
kohl has a very difficult political situation and that is 
creating the problem said a thatcher aide who spoke on condition 
of anonymity were not insensitive to this but getting rid of 
shortrange nuclear missiles is exactly what the russians want 
some observers say the confrontation marks the first time west 
germany has asserted its nationhood since the end of world war ii 
the country is the base for 320000 american and 60000 british 
troops 
kohl has publicly asserted that german national interests 
must take precedence over those of the united states and britain 
the respected guardian newspaper said in an editorial 
west european leaders are working to defuse the crisis italian 
and dutch leaders are to meet with west german officials after 
separate talks with mrs thatcher and west german authorities are 
going to france 
west germany claims it has outright support from nearly half the 
north atlantic treaty organization countries denmark belgium 
norway italy greece and spain britains leader has washington 
behind her 
mrs thatcher will have a chance to sway west european opinion 
in a may 2930 nato summit the first gathering of alliance leaders 
attended by president bush the meeting is not however expected 
to generate a unified west european position on the issue and many 
say nato will avoid action until after the 1990 west german 
elections 
its a crisis for nato said mark fielder an analyst at the 
royal united services institute a london research center on 
international relations 
there will probably be a fudged communique fielder said 
that will leave gorbachev to make another arms control initiative 
and nato wont be able to respond 
fielder said arms control initiatives by the soviet president 
have already created the image that gorbachev is the man with 
ideas 
in bonn wolf graf baudissin a west german disarmament expert 
said saturday that the current nato disagreements showed nato was 
not equipped to handle friction over controversial issues 
previously consensus was achieved more easily because of a 
common feeling of the soviet military threat baudissin said 
but now as this threat is perceived to dwindle disagreements 
are erupting as national interests common to the forefront

senegalese ignored a state of emergency 
saturday and pillaged the few mauritanian shops not damaged in 
earlier violence that left at least 20 mauritanians dead 
senegal was expected to begin airlifting about 20000 
mauritanian refugees this weekend to their neighboring homeland 
following the deadly rampage friday 
police used tear gas to disperse crowds after declaring a state 
of emergency friday night and imposing a 10 pm to 6 am curfew 
which brought relative calm to the capital overnight 
but bands of senegalese moved through the center of dakar on 
saturday afternoon looking for mauritanianowned shops that were 
not already damaged 
the state of emergency to be in effect for at least six days 
followed a rampage by senegalese seeking out mauritanians for 
revenge attacks after the reported killing of an estimated 200 
senegalese in neighboring mauritania last week 
press reports saturday said at least 35 mauritanians were killed 
in the violence friday in dakar officials said friday at least 20 
people were killed 
police have been rounding up mauritanians and giving them refuge 
in a fairground outside dakar an estimated 20000 mauritanians had 
been brought there by saturday according to agence francepresse 
the french news agency 
france the former colonial ruler of senegal announced saturday 
in paris that it was furnishing five planes to airlift the 
mauritanians to their home and return to dakar senegalese hiding 
out in the mauritanian capital of nouakchott 
spain on saturday dispatched an air force transport jet loaded 
with medicine blankets and tents to senegal and mauritania 
the violence began in a dispute april 9 between mauritanian 
shepherds and senegalese peasants over grazing land at the border 
of the two countries two senegalese were killed in the incident 
a week of scattered violence in dakar erupted into a killing 
rampage monday and tuesday in nouakchott in which as many as 200 
people were reported killed according to reports most of the 
corpses brought home had been decapitated while some of the 
injured returned to dakar reportedly had their sex organs or limbs 
mutilated 
word of the nature of the injuries and deaths spread through 
dakar enraging the crowds who on friday hunted down mauritanians

president bush this week will name an official 
observer team to monitor panamas elections as he weighs a series 
of pre and postelection actions in case of fraud administration 
officials said saturday 
the team of observers representing the administration will 
consist of congress members administration officials and private 
sector leaders but would be distinct from other privately 
organized efforts to monitor sundays balloting said the sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the membership of the administrations group is not firm yet 
in addition to the team that will represent the administration 
the government is encouraging private observer missions in hopes of 
turning a bright spotlight on what us officials have flatly 
predicted will be an election rigged by panamas ruler gen manuel 
noriega 
recent days have seen a flurry of policy meetings among white 
house state department and military officials to determine what 
actions should be taken before the election and what stance the 
administration should adopt toward panama afterward sources said 
all of the options are ones that involve high costs in the 
sense of political and international impact said one official who 
declined to specify the options 
the deliberations come as officials continue to refuse comment 
on a us news amp world report article last week that said bush 
signed a secret order authorizing the cia to funnel 10 million in 
assistance to noriegas political opposition 
officials said only that preelection actions have been 
discussed 
but with the administration predicting noriega will steal the 
election for his presidential candidate carlos alberto duque the 
focus is increasingly on how bush should react after the balloting 
bush has said he will not accommodate noriega who was indicted 
in february 1988 by a miami grand jury on drug trafficking charges 
the president last week accused noriega of trying to commit 
systemic fraud in the election and said the united states would 
not recognize his fraudulent election results 
un ambassador thomas pickering on friday accused panamas 
government of blatantly manipulating voter lists muzzling the 
opposition press and tv and restricting access by impartial 
foreign monitors and journalists 
panama says the united states is meddling in its elections and 
funnelling millions of dollars to the opposition campaigns 
noriegas staying power raises questions about how the united 
states will act to protect the thousands of military and civilian 
americans who live in the canal zone whether it will step up 
pressure on allies to isolate noriega and how it will move forward 
on the 1977 panama canal treaties 
under the treaties the united states is to turn over the 
americanbuilt canal to panamanian control on dec 31 1999 
a closer issue will be choosing a panamanian director of the 
canal panamas president can make a recommendation but bush and 
congress are charged with actually appointing the individual by 
next january 
for sundays elections the state department is helping organize 
a range of us and foreign observer efforts besides the official 
us government team 
secretary of state james a baker iii himself telephoned former 
presidents carter and ford and urged them to be observers sources 
said 
carter will lead a group organized by the nonprofit national 
democratic institute for international affairs and ford has been 
invited to join them said ken wollack the groups executive vice 
president the team is cosponsored by the national republican 
institute for international affairs and will consist of us and 
foreign leaders wollack said the observer mission received 
100000 in funding from congress 
in addition the washingtonbased center for democracy office 
which monitored the 1986 philippines elections has organizers in 
panama arranging for another observer team of political leaders and 
congress members 
the us government recognizes the exiled eric arturo delvalle 
who had tried to oust noriega as the legitimate president of 
panama 
bush has extended a trade ban the reagan administration imposed 
against panama

began appearing in stores and the darkhumored items have been 
enjoying a modest success ever since 
ann derifield has run a souvenir shop in valdez for 12 years 
when the exxon valdez got stuck on march 24 it was just a matter 
of altering an old design she already sold tshirts with designs 
of every tanker calling on the alaska pipelines marine terminal 
across the harbor from her store 
by march 28 she was selling baseball caps and shirts showing a

a federal requirement that shrimp fishermen 
use devices aimed at helping preserve endangered sea turtles has 
bitterly divided environmentalists and shrimpers who claim it will 
ruin their industry 
if this law isnt changed it will mean that the entire 
shrimping industry is out of business tee john mialjevich 
president of concerned shrimpers said saturday 
its not that we dont want to save turtles its that we want 
to feed our families he said 
concerned shrimpers which mialjevich said represents 2000 
shrimpers from north carolina to texas was formed to fight the 
turtle excluder devices commonly called teds 
us district judge patrick carr held a rare telephone hearing 
friday afternoon after louisiana attorney general william guste 
asked for a temporary restraining order blocking the requirement 
carr said he would rule monday 
already shrimp fishermen have won a 60day reprieve from hefty 
fines that were to go into effect monday for boats that arent 
equipped with the teds to free endangered sea turtles entangled in 
their trawls 
last week under congressional pressure not to strictly enforce 
the special net requirements commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
said he was ordering the coast guard to issue only warnings through 
june 30 instead of fines of up to 10000 to violators along 
the gulf and atlantic coasts 
environmentalists maintain that the teds will help save the 
endangered kemps ridley sea turtle from extinction and 
mosbachers decision drew criticism from a federal biologist 
the shrimpers think that the skys going to open up and god 
will save them again said jack woody national sea turtle 
coordinator for the us fish and wildlife service in this case 
god is the secretary of commerce im totally frustrated at this 
point 
shrimpers disclaim responsibility for most of the 11000 turtle 
deaths estimated by the national oceanographic and atmospheric 
administration each year 
in 21 years of shrimping ive caught six kemps ridley sea 
turtles and they all went right back into the water alive 
mialjevich said 
i dont know of but about a dozen shrimpers that have teds 
ted shepard director of the 400 member louisiana shrimpers 
association said saturday i dont think most of them will tow 
them theyre having a hard enough time making a living now 
teds fit into the mouth of shrimp trawls and have trap doors 
that let turtles escape 
fishermen maintain the devices are dangerous to pull and clog 
easily are expensive and reduce their harvests the contention is 
disputed by researchers who say fishermen who learn to use devices 
correctly show no signs of loss the ones based off louisiana also 
argue that the endangered turtles are not found in the waters where 
they fish 
this is an unbelievable horror story theres just no way this 
should be placed on the gulf fishermen shepard said you dont 
get the kemps turtles in the areas we shrimp in theyre in the 
atlantic and off the coast of florida 
shrimpers have proposed alternatives mialjevich said including 
a 25 fee on shrimping licenses each year dedicated to hatching and 
growing the turtles 
the twomonth delay in enforcement approved by mosbacher comes 
at the beginning of the sea turtle nesting season when thousands of 
the seagoing creatures come ashore to dig their nests on sandy 
beaches across the southeast 
previous studies have shown that more than 11000 sea turtles 
drown in shrimp nets each year in the united states incuding about 
3000 in the gulf of mexico 
we dont need to wait for another study to find out if theyre 
endangered woody said they can call me and ill tell them for 
free ive been putting little turtles in the ocean for 12 years 
and watching them disappear

thousands of dockworkers in seven 
states in brazil went back to work saturday ending a threeday 
strike for higher pay union officials said 
luis carlos silva soares a union official at rios port said 
all workers have returned to their jobs and the port slowly began 
to resume normal operation today as of 7 am 
he said the rio workers received pay increases of 50 percent 
they had been seeking 180 percent increases and a standardized pay 
scale at all of the countrys ports 
the union of sea navigation agencies in santos which 
coordinates and administers work by longshoremen said the average 
salary for a dockworker was about 600 per month 
inflation has been running at more than 1000 percent a year 
the government froze most salaries in january but has allowed some 
price increases 
silva soares said dockworkers in the states of rio grande do 
sul santa catarina parana espiritu santo bahia and pernambuco 
also returned to work saturday morning and were starting to 
unload certain cargo such as wheat shipments 
more than a third of 9000 striking longshoreman in santos near 
the industrial city of sao paulo and brazils busiest port ended 
their strike that began april 10 according to jairo de galvao a 
union leader in santos 
but he said much of the port which normally handles 72000 tons 
of cargo per day and 35 percent of brazils exports remained idle 
about 5500 mechanics unloaders and inspectors are still to 
vote on the offer and probably wont return to work until monday 
he said 
the sao paulo state dock company was reporting losses of 1 
million per day in uncollected loading and unloading fees 
company officials said 39 ships were docked in santos waiting to 
be unloaded and another 42 were anchored outside the port waiting 
to enter 
the strike did not affect oil shipments the state oil monopoly 
petrobras has its own loading terminals and workers whose union did 
not join the strike

the foreign ministry is investigating 
reports that costa ricas ambassador participated in plans to 
discredit the sandinista government the sandinistas newspaper 
reported saturday 
the barricada newspaper quoted deputy foreign minister jose leon 
talavera as saying the ministry is evaluating with extreme 
caution information that costa rican ambassador farid ayales 
engaged in activities outside his diplomatic functions 
the progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario reported friday 
that ayales had met with nicaraguan opposition leaders and a us 
embassy official to prepare a foreign campaign of accusations 
against the leftist government 
el nuevo diario said the campaign would seek to discredit 
electoral law changes approved april 18 by the legislature for the 
general election next february 
the newspaper attributed its information to opposition party 
sources whom it did not name it did not identify the us embassy 
official allegedly involved 
nicaraguas opposition parties have denounced the new electoral 
rules saying they give the sandinista party control over the 
supreme elections council that will supervise the balloting 
talavera told barricada there are no restrictions on foreign 
diplomats meeting with opposition figures but it was intolerable 
under international laws for diplomats to become activists or 
directors of local political organizations 
talaveres also said nicaraguan officials had made some 
observations to ayales several months ago about his conduct in 
nicaragua 
costa rican officials have declined to comment on the el nuevo 
diario report 
also saturday a costa rican newspaper reported that a 
nicaraguan air force flight engineer had defected to costa rica and 
asked authorities for political asylum 
the san jose newspaper la republica identified the flight 
engineer as jesus ferrey alvarado 40 and said he sailed a small 
boat to costa ricas playa rajada and asked for asylum it said 
ferrey alvarado is a specialist in sovietbuilt mi17 troop 
transport helicopters 
costa rican civil guard and immigration authorities could not be 
reached for comment 
on april 21 sandinista air force capt reinaldo aranda guido 
defected to costa rica piloting a small plane owned by a freight 
company from nicaraguas corn island to puerto limon on costa

an iranian newspaper on saturday called 
for the explusion of west german diplomats from tehran calling 
them spies disguised as diplomats and part of an american 
espionage network 
the official islamic republic news agency carried excerpts from 
the editorial in the daily kayhan which said the ouster of german 
diplomats was the best response to the mischief of the bonn 
government 
spokesmen for the west german foreign ministry in bonn were not 
immediately available for comment saturday night 
iranian prime minister hussein musavi claimed tuesday that some 
agents of an alleged us spy network in iran were communicating 
with the americans through west german embassies in europe 
in addition information minister mohammad mohammadirayshahri 
said wednesday the agents all were linked to the cia base at 
weisbaden near frankfurt in west germany 
the widely read kayhan said rayshahris information was based on 
intelligence reports and confessions by those arrested iran did 
not say how many people had been rounded up in connection with the 
affair 
the liberal daily said the news of german involvement was 
sufficient cause to sever relations with west germany said irna 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted kayhan as describing 
the west german capital as being a haven for iranian opposition 
members who use it to launch hostile operations against iranian 
interests 
the newspapers call comes five days after the iranian foreign 
ministry threatened to reduce trade relations with west germany 
accusing it of helping archenemy iraq manufacture missiles and 
internationally banned chemical weapons 
west germany is one of 14 countries that recalled their envoys 
from tehran in february to protest the death threat against british 
novelist salman rushdie by iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini khomeini said rushdie blasphemed islam in his novel 
the satanic verses 
kayhan said west germany always takes similar stands to those 
taken by the united states when it comes to adopting a position 
with respect to iran this year the german government took sides 
with salman rushdie 
kayhan also accused the bonn government of being insincere 
in its friendship despite irans goodwill shown in the release of 
two west german hostages who were held with proiranian shiite 
extemists in lebanon

a huge asteroid skipping off earth at a 
low angle may have kicked thousands of giant boulders into orbit 
creating a shower of meteorites that gradually killed off the 
dinosaurs a scientist says 
brown university geologist peter schultzs research seeks to 
answer a key objection to the theory that dinosaurs and many other 
species 66 million years ago died out because a large object struck 
the planet raising a dust cloud that blocked sunlight and wiped 
out food sources 
fossil experts have pointed out that the dinosaurs died over 
hundreds of thousands of years not all at once 
advocates of the theory responded by suggesting that a series of 
asteroids comets or meteorites hit the planet the new theory by 
schultz and colleague donald gault of the murphys center of 
planetology in murphys calif explains how that might have 
happened 
in experiments using bb pellets and dry ice the pair observed 
that a projectile hitting a surface at an angle breaks into as many 
as a dozen major pieces and thousands of smaller ones which then 
continue along the same trajectory at roughly half the original 
velocity 
schultz suggests an object hit earth then literally skipped 
off the surface and fragmented they would continue to go 
perhaps halfway around the earth causing thousands of other 
devastating impacts he said in an interview last week 
an oblique impact would also kick up a tremendous amount of 
debris we found from doing these experiments that we produced an 
incredible vapor cloud schultz said 
the scientists tested their theory by firing bbs into pits of 
dry ice to test sand trajectory paths and vapor formation 
they concluded that a meteor striking the earth at an angle 
would spew out debris with enough speed to place it in orbit 
allowing it to remain in space long enough to cause largescale 
destruction schultz said 
he said that within 100 years the cloud of debris would collapse 
into a saturnlike ring which would put part of the earth in 
darkness 
the ring would last anywhere from 100000 years to 10 million 
years said schultz 
schultz who presented his theory in march at the annual 
international lunar planetary science conference in houston has 
submitted it for publication he plans to use his research to 
examine the effects of the impact on earths climate 
william clemens a professor of paleontology at the university 
of california at berkeley said he still believes the mass 
extinction was caused by a climatic change rather than a collision 
i would argue against any hypothesis that calls for long 
periods of darkness and great cooling he said some animals 
survived through the period and he said that can be explained only 
by a decrease in temperature of no more than 1 degree or 2 other 
scientists support alternate extinction theories including 
volcanic destruction 
but schultz said his theory is the link to the impact theory 
first proposed by luis and walter alvarez in 1980 
under schultzs theory as the ring decayed debris would again 
pummel the earth every day we have a meteor shower he said 
he said the theory addresses the evidence of an extended 
extinction nonuniform dispersal of meteoritic matter the absence 
of a crater of sufficient size for a single devastating impact and 
evidence of massive intensive fires 
schultz and gault are worldclass experts on impact mechanics 
and anything they come up with will certainly be looked at with 
respect and interest by others involved in the work said walter 
alvarez he declined to comment on the theory in detail 
schultz an associate professor of planetary geology said 
studies of impacts on other planets suggest collisions generally 
occur at angles 
angular collisions leave craters with very distinctive shapes 
we can compare the rate at which oblique impacts occur on the 
moon with what we expect theoretically and it fits he said

saudi arabia said saturday that iran 
must comply with the quota system for sending people to the holy 
cities of mecca and madina during the hajj pilgrimage in july 
at the 1987 hajj thousands of iranians organized political 
demonstrations in mecca and 402 people were killed in clashes with 
saudi police iran boycotted the 1988 hajj because of saudi 
restrictions 
irans shiite moslem leaders have claimed that saudi arabias 
sunni moslem monarchs are unworthy guardians of islams holiest 
shrines 
abdelwahab abdelwasei the saudi minister of religious 
affairs issued a statement saturday stressing that all islamic 
states including iran must abide by the special arrangements for 
organizing and defining the numbers coming to the holy sites to 
perform the hajj rites 
he referred to the decision adopted by the foreign ministers of 
the 46nation organization of islamic conference meeting in jordan 
in march 1988 they approved the saudi proposal to restrict the 
number of pilgrims until the completion of renovations and 
expansion of facilities in the holy cities 
the quota was set at 1000 pilgrims per million of the 
population from each islamic country 
iran had been sending about 150000 people annually to the hajj 
but the quota system reduced that number to 45000 
the saudi minister was responding to iranian complaints that the 
quota blocked thousands of iranians from performing the rites 
the islamic faith requires that all moslems who can afford it 
make the pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime 
saudi arabia severed diplomatic ties with iran in april 1988 
saying iran was trying to destabilize the region the relations 
have not been restored 
hashemi rafsanjani the speaker of irans parliament denounced 
saudi arabia and the quota system earlier this year 
he said the hajj pilgrimage must cease to be a hollow worship 
and should be turned into an active assembly for the islamic 
world to raise its issues and problems

more than 300 chanting students at temple 
university forced a representative of the south african government 
to flee the campus shortly after he was trapped in an elevator 
facing an angry crowd 
as campus and city police led john a davies the south african 
consul in new york off the schools campus friday protesters 
formed a gantlet and yelled dont come back and racist 
students drummed their fists on the city police car that took 
davies away breaking windows on the vehicle but causing no 
injuries detectives said 
davies was on campus to give a speech but the demonstration 
forced him to cancel his appearance 
davies escorted by guards had walked into the elevator before 
the talk but was stalled there with the elevators doors open for 
more than 20 minutes in front of hundreds of angry demonstrators 
security guards and police stood between davies and the protesters 
davies appeared upset by the experience said kostas markou a 
temple senior and native of greece who was also in the elevator 
he was shaking markou said i said to him you must 
know i am greek and the whole world does not like your 
government 
police and school officials said it was not clear whether the 
elevator was not working or whether protesters had sabotaged it 
students said they were pleased that davies talk was canceled 
why should we allow him to speak when our brothers and sisters 
are not allowed to walk into another town in south africa said 
taneshia nash a black protester 
davies said later he had planned to discuss the need for 
stability in south africa so reform efforts could work he said 
blacks would lose their jobs and progress would be slowed if 
economic sanctions were put into effect 
i am frustrated davies said i had been misled into 
thinking there would not be any trouble 
university administrators said they were surprised at the 
protest occurring on the final day of spring semester classes 
h patrick swygert vice president for administration denounced 
the protest of davies talk which was arranged by the chairman of 
the universitys department of political science 
it is the right of the professor to invite anyone who he 
thinks is representative of a point of view swygert said it 
would be a terrible precedent for this or any other university to 
censor that access 
davies was in philadelphia for a meeting of the american academy 
of political and social science he said he had spoken at lehigh 
and princeton universities and that his speeches there were 
delivered without protests although his views were challenged

residents in the soviet republic of georgia have 
beaten family members of army soldiers because they unfairly blame 
the troops for bloody clashes with proindependence demonstrators 
an army general said saturday 
at least 20 people died in the unrest earlier this month in 
tbilisi the georgian capital georgians say the troops attacked a 
peaceful demonstration with shovels clubs and harmful gases 
gen in rodionov commander of the caucasus military district 
said tbilisi residents are blaming red army soldiers for the clash 
and he strongly implied that troops of the interior ministry were 
to blame 
rodionov speaking on the evening news show vremya said wives 
and children of red army soldiers have been beaten and their 
apartments stoned in retaliation for the crackdown he gave no 
other details 
he said interior ministry troops should have handled the 
demonstration without the aid of red army soldiers and suggested 
that ministry troops wear special uniforms so they can be 
distinguished from the red army 
he said the ministry troops also used the harmful gas that 
dissidents claimed was nerve gas 
the georgian health minister said last week that troops used an 
unidentified chemical that caused at least two of the deaths and 
several serious injuries 
rodionov like other soviet officials maintained the substance 
used against demonstrators was tear gas he also said he personally 
opposed the use of troops to crush the demonstrations 
meanwhile in other parts of the caucasus region plans for may 
day celebrations were canceled in soviet armenia for fear they 
could turn into proindependence demonstrations 
the military commander of yerevan the armenian capital issued 
a call for calm saturday asking residents not to allow themselves 
to be incited into a confrontation with authorities said rafael 
popoyan a newsman for the official radio station in yerevan 
yerevan has been under curfew for more than six months to curb 
ethnic conflicts that killed more than 90 people in armenia and 
neighboring azerbaijan in 1988 armenians are seeking to be 
reunited with nagornokarabakh an ethnic armenian region of 
azerbaijan 
leon azruyan of the official radio station in yerevan said 
officials also cited the grim feelings left by the armenian 
earthquake for the cancellation of a may day parade an estimated 
25000 died in the december quake 
in azerbaijan the official news agency azerinform denied rumors 
of new violence in the enclave of nakhichevan which borders 
armenia azerinform said the rumors were spread by people upset 
about a border dispute over an orchard that surveyors determined 
belongs to armenia rather than azerbaijan 
the dispatch indicated that passions rose in the village of 
tsadarak which lost the orchard but there were no deaths or 
injuries

the hot line the link set up 
between washington and moscow more than 25 years ago to reduce the 
risk of an accidental war has fallen into foreign hands 
the hot line was part of a division western union corp sold 
last week to swissowned telecolumbus usa of new york for 56 
million as part of a reorganization western union said 
in a deal approved by the federal communications commission 
telecolumbus acquired the privateline service of itt world 
communications a company acquired 16 months ago by western union 
western union which is based in this northern new jersey city 
kept the divisions telex and international cablegram businesses 
telecolumbus is owned by motorcolumbus ag a 
telecommunications and cable television company based in baden 
switzerland western union spokesman warren bechtel said saturday 
the line which consists of satellite connections and ground 
lines is secure because messages are encoded as they travel 
between the united states and the soviet union navy lt cmdr 
james cudla a navy spokesman was quoted as saying in saturday 
editions of the starledger of newark 
contrary to popular belief the hot line is not a red phone 
sitting on the presidents desk pentagon spokeswoman jan bodanyi 
said saturday 
hotline messages are transmitted from a small room in the 
pentagon housing computer terminals they instantly appear on 
soviet screens and can be printed out at the rate of 1800 words a 
minute five years ago the ability to send facsimiles was added 
voice conversations are considered more likely to be 
misunderstood or mistranslated ms bodanyi said 
itt corp set up the hot line in 1963 after president kennedy 
expressed concern after the cuban missile crisis about the amount 
of time it took to contact soviet leaders 
us and soviet officials send test messages in their own 
languages alternating each hour to make sure the line operates 
the tests are culled from literature and encyclopedias 
the sale drew criticism from rep matthew rinaldo of new jersey 
the ranking republican on the house telecommunications subcommittee 
rinaldo said he was concerned that the link which could make 
the difference between war and peace is controlled by a third 
party he said he would call for a hearing on the issue 
its time we began taking a hard look at how foreign ownership 
of vital services affects our national security rinaldo said

when a family was taken to a hospital for treatment after eating 
hamburgers contaminated with mercury police said 
tesco a supermarket chain with more than 375 stores and boots 
a drugstore chain with more than 1000 stores nationwide said they 
would halt sales of baby food made by hj heinz co and cow and 
gate ltd

interests of consumer safety said john eyre boots director for 
corporate affairs 
the asda food chain also said it was withdrawing all baby food 
from the two companies that was packaged in glass jars 
police said most of the reports of contamination were hoaxes or 
false alarms scotland yard said several arrests have been made 
only two cases apparently were the work of an extortionist who 
demanded up to 17 million from the pittsburghbased hj heinz 
co police said 
the family that ate the tainted hamburgers needed hospital 
treatment but suffered only mild ill effects said a police 
spokesman on condition of anonymity the family is from heswall 
near liverpool 
police said they believed the hamburgers may have been tampered 
with 
local authorities said they were beginning an urgent search to 
find who purchased 11 other packages of the frozen hamburgers from 
the same store in the past two weeks 
reports of taintings with glass shards pieces of razor blades 
and caustic soda began april 7 most reports involved heinz or cow 
and gate baby products but several were in other brands of baby 
food 
in springfield ill three grocery stores operated by 
shopnsave removed heinz baby food products from their shelves 
after a woman reported finding straight pins in jars of the food 
police said saturday it could be a copycat incident of the 
tampering cases in britain 
it could be related said springfield police cmdr kirk 
robinson were not ruling anything out 
there is no reason to think this springfield case is 
anything but an isolated incident said harry carroll a 
spokesman for heinz 
cow and gate owned by nutricia of the netherlands said 
saturday it would follow heinz in introducing new packaging for 
baby food in the coming weeks the two companies share 80 percent 
of britains baby food market 
a 14monthold boy matthew cookson was the latest casualty of 
the potentially deadly contamination he was hospitalized in 
manchester with glass in his stomach after eating a jar of baby 
yogurt that was found to contain glass 
in three earlier cases two mothers cut their fingers on glass 
found in baby food and a 9monthold girl cut her mouth when she 
bit a piece of razor blade in yogurt

two young soviets seeking political 
asylum in the united states say they began scheming two years ago 
to defect and forged documents that enabled them to travel to 
little diomede island in the bering strait last weekend 
it was not possible to make it in a legal way said anatoly 
tkachenko a 24yearold journalist from moscow 
we are very sorry that we kind of marred and soured the 
ceremony at little diomede but there was no other way tkachenko 
added 
tkachenko and alexander genkin also 24 and from moscow 
defected last sunday while they were on little diomede for the 
signing of a protocol designed to ease travel restrictions between 
alaska and siberia 
both men worked for a monthly moscow newspaper that serves the 
governments international affairs ministry and the moscow state 
college for international affairs 
when they learned a soviet delegation would be traveling to 
little diomede for the signing ceremony they forged papers 
authorizing them to cover the event for the newspaper tkachenko 
said at a news conference friday 
the pair typed an application obtained a special stamp to 
verify it had been authorized and took it to the headquarters of 
the bering bridge expedition 
the expedition is a team of soviet and american adventurers 
skiing and dogsledding its way along the siberian and alaskan 
coasts the signing ceremony coincided with their arrival at the 
international dateline in the bering strait between little diomede 
island and the soviet island of big diomede about three miles away 
we were very anxious and apprehensive about our even taking 
part in this delegation because of the forged permission 
tkachenko said if the two had been found out i think we would 
have been in prison for three or four years he said 
both men called in sick to explain their absence while traveling 
to alaska he said 
tkachenko who speaks english fluently did most of the talking 
at the news conference and translated for genkin who speaks very 
little english 
tkachenko said he doubts the defections will affect ussoviet 
relations or hamper efforts to open the alaskasiberia border 
he said neither man told relatives or anyone else about the plan 
to defect and said he didnt think soviet authorities would 
retaliate against their parents 
tkachenko said both men would like to continue working as 
journaists if their requests for asylum are approved 
i am very interested in this field especially in american tv 
journalism tkachenko said it was my idea for a very long time 
to be somehow involved in this field you know maybe i can get a 
job at any company or channel as an expert in soviet affairs 
because i studied international affairs 
he said genkin wants to work in print journalism once he learns 
english 
tkachenko said the absence of censorship in the united states 
was a bigger attraction than money 
there is still a oneparty system of censorhip and an 
unequivocal belief in lenins ideas even with gorbachev he said 
i think if you are a journalist and you wish to work in 
freedom to be creative in your job thats the most important 
thing for you tkachenko said not just the money or the 
possibility to live in a big house its not the main thing for me 
and i think for alexander too 
tkachenko said he ultimately wants to live in new york or 
washington 
gary johnson regional director of the immigration and 
naturalization service said it will be several weeks before a 
decision is made on their requests for asylum

a package of bills aimed at protecting 
alaska from another devastating oil spill like the one that fouled 
prince william sound was passed by the state senate with little 
trouble saturday 
reacting to the largest oil spill in the nations history the 
republicanled senate acted with unusual speed to move the six 
bills through the chamber and to the house 
however it appeared unlikely that the democratcontrolled house 
would approve the entire package before adjournment which is 
scheduled for may 9 
the senate action came five weeks after the tanker exxon valdez 
struck a reef spewing more than 10 million gallons of crude oil 
into the fish and wildliferich sound 
the senate bills would increase civil fines for spill damage 
impose a surcharge on oil producers to boost the states 
spillresponse fund prevent oil companies from deducting spill 
costs from their oilproduction taxes require the state to create 
spill contingency plans establish a spillresponse office and 
cleanup corps and create a commission to investigate the exxon 
valdez spill 
more than a dozen other spillrelated bills are still pending in 
both chambers house speaker sam cotten a democrat said house 
members have been studying the bills and will decide early this 
week which ones will get top priority 
it isnt like weve been waiting around to see what the senate 
did he said 
sen john binkley a republican voted against all the bills 
passed saturday except for the investigation commission measure 
i think that were acting too hastily on these issues he said 
gov steve cowper said friday that he too favors a slower 
approach to oilspill legislation 
i dont think that we need major legislation in this session 
aside from the funding mechanisms and aside from the body that will 
be investigating this incident on the part of the state he said

the wall of 80foot flames was a half mile long and within a 
half mile of state road 2 which is two miles south of the 
floridageorgia border 
firefighters were trying to control the fire by dropping water 
on it from aircraft the strategy wasnt very effective because the 
flames were so high ms summers said

transmisson in a logging vehicle broke down and sent off sparks 
that started the fire in land adjacent to the osceola national

us senators on saturday encouraged 
mexico to continue efforts to combat drug trafficking and modernize 
the economy during bilateral talks on debt drugs and democracy 
sen christopher j dodd dconn praised president carlos 
salinas de gortaris antidrug campaign in return he said the 
united states would support mexicos efforts to cut payments on its 
1074 billion foreign debt 
it is a seamless garment when you start talking about 
confidence in a government dodd said in an interview 
the delegations issued a communique after the twoday meeting of 
us and mexican lawmakers ended saturday night 
they said they were prepared to promote the establishment of a 
mexicous intergovernmental consultive commission for the control 
of narcotic and psychotropic substance abuse 
the sides also urged their respective governments to support 
an international drug summit of the presidents of the western 
hemisphere 
mexicos delegation called for urgent measures to help mexico 
cut its debt payments and the us group suggested mexico broaden 
the alternatives it is presenting to bankers in debt negotiations 
on friday the opening day of the 28th annual meeting dodd read 
a letter to salinas signed by 68 us senators praising the mexican 
president for his commitment to fight drug trafficking 
the us senate votes in may over whether mexico is adequately 
fighting the illicit narcotics trade both dodd and sen phil 
gramm rtexas said they expected a positive vote 
dodd said many us lawmakers were impressed with salinas 
efforts to streamline the mexican economy and liberalize its 
foreign trade 
he is moving at a pace thats impressive there is this very 
strong feeling about his government dodd said 
gramm was more skeptical 
i want to be shown ive heard all the good words before he 
said in an interview 
but gramm added he would give salinas the benefit of the 
doubt 
mexico is negotiating with foreign creditor banks to slice its 
annual debt servicing bill by at least 7 billion the country paid 
9 billion in interest and 5 billion in principal in 1988 and 
servicing will reach an anticipated 16 billion this year 
at this pacific seaside resort the american delegation 
encountered mexican lawmakers representing opposition parties 
which are amply represented in mexicos congress for the first time 
opposition delegates buttonholed their us counterparts to 
lodge complaints that democracy has yet to develop south of the 
border 
we have to start a genuine dialogue among real 
parliamentarians among people speaking for the people said 
porfirio munoz ledo a leftist opposition senator 
salinas the keynote speaker friday took note of the new 
opposition presence in mexican politics nearly a third of mexicos 
36person delegation came from opposition parties 
but teresa otono gurca a federal deputy from the conservative 
national action party or pan said the us delegation was more 
interested in encouraging salinas especially on waging the war 
against drugs than in listening to opposition challenges to the 
legitimacy of salinas election last july 
they think that without the ruling institutional revolutionary 
party there is no stability in mexico otono said of the 
american lawmakers 
delegates from both countries characterized the meeting as open 
and frank

voters on saturday rejected a plan to 
overhaul louisianas tax system that had been heralded by gov 
buddy roemer as a chance to end the states lengthy recession 
we wont quit thats my final message to everybody out there 
tonight its worth fighting for lets keep fighting roemer 
said after the votes were counted 
with 3181 of the states 3285 precincts reporting about 97 
percent the proposed constitutional amendment to authorize the 
legislature to change the tax system was rejected 531392 or 55 
percent to 432483 or 45 percent 
about 45 percent of the states registered voters turned out 
said darrell glasscock a spokesman for the secretary of state 
the plan had been condemned by opponents as a huge tax hike 
under roemers package the tax base would have been shifted by 
putting more of a load on individuals through the income tax 
cutting sales taxes and giving businesses incentive to move to the 
state and expand 
the plan also included a 14 billion program to improve 
highways airports and shipping ports that would be funded by a 
gasoline tax increase of 4 cents a gallon 
defeat of the plan means the legislature will have to cut more 
than 600 million from an already tight budget which roemer has 
said is impossible 
after conceding the plan had lost roemer said he would meet 
with legislative leaders to determine the next step for the budget 
he said earlier that he would meet with louisianas business 
leaders no matter what the outcome 
state rep david duke an outspoken critic of the plan said 
this is going to make a real change in louisiana 
duke a former ku klux klan leader elected to the house in 
february on an antitax plank said the state should reduce waste 
tighten spending and make major changes in its social programs 
instead of revising its tax system 
after fighting tremendous odds after fighting tremendous 
money after fighting tremendous political influence and power 
finally ladies and gentlemen you did it again duke told 
supporters in his metairie district 
jefferson parish assessor lawrence chehardy another opponent 
said voters rejected the package because they did not believe that 
state government has its house in order 
chehardy said the vote had negative political implications for 
the governor i certainly think up to this point it was a 
referendum on buddy roemer the governor made it that way 
chehardy said 
roemer pushed the plan in a blitz of radio and television spots 
financed by more than 12 million from backers the governor 
touted it as a way to create jobs in a state that has the nations 
highest unemployment rate and to end louisianas dependence on the 
oil industry 
backers said the state puts too much of its tax burden on 
business driving away potential new industries and forcing 
cutbacks and shutdowns among existing businesses 
but opponents said most of the tax breaks would be enjoyed by 
the states 1000 largest corporations many of which are not 
laborintensive and contended new jobs would not be created 
the plan would cost an extra 126 million over the current tax 
load but opponents pointed out that as of july 1 the increase in 
the tax load would be 526 million 
the legislature approved a oneyear sales tax increase of 500 
million last summer to avoid government bankruptcy the increase 
which was achieved by canceling longtime exemptions on purchases of 
food and utilities expires july 1 
roemers plan kept about 400 million of that tax on a permanent 
basis

the decision by energy secretary james d 
watkins to wait until 1990 to resume production of a gas needed for 
nuclear warheads shows clearly that supplies of the gas are not as 
tight as the government once claimed critics say 
the pentagon asserted last fall that unless production resumed 
by this summer the nuclear weapons factories would face a shortage 
of tritium a scarce highly radioactive gas used to boost the 
explosive power of nuclear warheads 
but critics have said they believe the earlier warnings about a 
tritium crisis were aimed at galvanizing congressional support for 
the energy departments proposal to spend 68 billion to build two 
new tritiumproducing reactors 
that whole scenario was orchestrated for political purposes by 
certain people in the pentagon chris paine an aide to sen 
edward kennedy on nuclear defense issues said in an interview 
friday its not as serious as they suggested

washington president bushs decision to go ahead with the 7 
billion fsx fighter deal sets the stage for a heated congressional 
debate over usjapanese defense ties trade friction and 
americas hightechnology future 
in announcing the agreement for joint development and production 
of an advanced version of the f16 fighter bush sought to allay 
concerns voiced on capitol hill as well as within his own 
administration over the economic and technological impact of the 
deal 
bush told reporters friday that the united states will have a 40 
percent share in the development work and a similar share of 
the production run for the 130 planes which japan wants to deploy 
in the late 1990s 
addressing technology issues the president said that 
sensitive source codes for the aircrafts computer will be 
strictly controlled access will be granted to only those codes 
that are essential to complete the project 
bush said he was convinced that the agreement is in the 
strategic and commercial interests of the united states 
however several members of congress said they were still 
dissatisfied with the terms of the deal and would strive to block 
it when the agreement is sent up to capitol hill for a 30day 
review period

commercial salmon fishing in oiltainted 
prince william sound will begin next month on schedule but 30 
percent of what should have been a record 50 million catch may be 
lost officials said saturday 
fishing boats will be barred from many areas of the sound when 
the season starts may 15 said state biologist james brady 
at one time officials had considered canceling the season 
altogether just as they had canceled the 12 million herring 
fishing season and smaller seasons in the sound for shrimp and 
sablefish after the exxon valdez ran aground and spilled more than 
10 million gallons of oil march 24 
instead fishermen will be crowded into a smaller area in 
efforts to keep their nets clear of oil that would contaminate 
whatever salmon are caught

he was an ancient egyptian turncoat 
backbone of the pharaohs government one day and strong right arm 
of the conquering persians the next 
most of what the world knows of udjahorresnet comes from 
inscriptions on his statue in the vatican collection which boast 
of his calculated opportunism and the power his treachery won him 
but its a tale without an end the finale missing the last 
lines obscured 
now in the depths of a desert burial maze czechoslavak 
scientists are finding clues to the fate of one of pharaonic 
egypts dastardly personalities 
almost 60 feet down at the foot of a central shaft cut through 
soft petrified clay and filled with sand the team discovered a 
burial chamber 
what a shock to see his name udjahorresnet in such an 
unexpected place away from his home in the nile delta away 
from his persian connections said miroslav verner head of 
egyptology at charles university in prague 
it was thrilling verner said his name is what all 
egyptologists learn first when they study the persian takeover of 
egypt he was a dark personage a man known for his betrayal 
verner has been field director since 1976 of a czechoslavak 
archaeological mission in abusir an ancient burial and religious 
center 18 miles southwest of cairo 
mission scientists discovered a series of rubblefilled shafts 
in 1981 on a site misidentified 150 years earlier as a pyramid 
ruin verners 10man team and colleagues from the egyptian 
antiquities organization began excavating last november 
udjahorresnet took few chances in life and fewer in death the 
maze of shafts he commissioned used a traditional method for 
repelling robbers by filling shafts with sand and was more 
intricate than others found in egypt 
he was a trusted official of the 26thdynasty pharaoh psamtik 
iii then turned up as colonial administrator after cambyses of 
persia conquered egypt in 525 bc 
little is known of udjahorresnets later life 
the last we knew of him he was leading an egyptian army to 
help the persians under darius i cambyses son put down internal 
strife verner said then he disappeared from history the 
final lines on his statue are damaged unreadably and no tomb was 
ever found 
that obscurity may be about to end 
in the limestone chamber at the bottom of the abusir shaft 
excavators found a megalithsized sarcophagus sheltering an inner 
coffin with decorated sides they bore the name udjahorresnet 
the chamber held neither a mummy nor major funerary articles 
but verner said team members found five small statuettes with the 
names of udjahorresnet and his parents and a list of his titles 
since the 1960s the pyramiddomed sands of abusir have yielded 
several major finds to czech archaeologists the oldest papyri 
found in egypt the oldest hall with standing columns and several 
spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty more than 4000 
years ago 
once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor the giza 
plateau abusir became one of egypts most exciting archaeological 
sites 
because of his important titles egypts chief physician and 
overseer of the royal navy and greek mercenaries udjahorresnet 
would have been a man in the know when the persian invasion 
came verner said 
history doesnt record his exact role the archaeologist 
said but the next thing we know after egypts defeat is that 
this man was part of the persian regime close to cambyses his man 
in egypt you might say highly rewarded for his new loyalty 
udjahorresnet even boasts that he put together egyptian 
titles for the new persian ruler he was a 100 percent quisling an 
opportunist 
his statue obtained by the vatican collection 200 years ago is 
thought to have left egypt with the roman emperor hadrian early in 
the second century 
hadrian was a restless traveler and protector of the arts who 
appropriated the beautiful and strange to adorn the imperial villa 
at tivoli near rome 
the architect of udjahorresnets tomb used sand in an 
hourglass effect first to lower the massive sarcophagus and then 
to seal the passages verner said the burial chambers roof 
contained holes with clay pots beneath which the last worker broke 
onebyone as he left through a side shaft so sand would flow in 
from a shaft above the archaeologist said 
at least four graverobbing forays were made into the shaft the 
latest in medieval tims verner said robbers finally tunneled 
through the soft rock and penetrated the basalt coffin by using 
fire and water alternately to weaken it 
during their robberies the thieves lived in the shafts he 
said we know all about them from rubbish they left and the 
soot from their fires

growing up in new jersey and dreaming of playing 
major league baseball bill littlefield hoped willie mays would 
move next door and teach him all he needed to know 
then when he retired id just move in he said 
but mays and the new york giants moved to san francisco and 
littlefield became a college professor and radio commentator 
that didnt end his love of baseball as is clear in his first 
novel prospect which was published by houghton mifflin co on 
april 3 the opening day of the major league baseball season 
not that the book is just about baseball its also about being 
old and caring and sharing 
littlefield didnt know where his writing would lead when he 
began his book i got to several parts where i wanted to know 
what hppened next myself he said in an interview i certainly 
didnt know what was going to happen when i started it 
the story interestingly is told in two firstperson accounts 
one narrator pete estey is a retired baseball scout whose 
playing career never got beyond the minor leagues he lives in a 
flordia nursing home listening to games on a radio and telling 
baseball stories to louise brown the other narrator an avid 
baseball fan from the jackie robinson days she is religious 
strong and determined she takes special care of patients at the 
nursing home to keep them from slipping into the wards of oblivion 
she also has a baseballplaying grandnephew jack and she wants 
to get him a shot at the big leagues 
littlefield didnt know louise was going to be a character when 
he started the book 
i had a wonderful idea to have an old scout tell baseball 
stories he said estey was the sole narrator at first later 
on louise appeared and i found i liked writing her very much 
two old ballplayers signed to their first contracts by estey 
also figure in the book and there is a woman in the nursing home 
whose three dead daughters jackie robinson and babe ruth visit her 
from the clouds by sliding down the flagpole 
the 40yearold littlefield is an associate professor of english 
at curry college in milton mass he also is sports commentator for 
national public radio stations including wbur a baseball throw 
from the boston red sox fenway park 
his commentaries sometimes take an offbeat approach i think 
thats the delight in being in sports you can do a lot of things 
you cant do in other fields he said 
i take baseball very seriously it fills a big aspect of my 
life i try not to be solemn about it i try to recognize it as 
fun 
his baseball career included little league and summer camp teams 
and intramural games at yale university where he also studied 
under robert penn warren now littlefield plays on a fastpitch 
softball team in the cambridge municipal league 
it was through his radio work that he met lennie merullo a 
former player for the chicago cubs who lives in reading and works 
for the major league scouting bureau in new england 
littlefield said he was impressed by merullos enthusiasm and 
turned to him when he was developing the novel to bounce ideas off 
him could this happen would it be possible 
his knowledge insight into the way the elderly think came from 
visiting his two grandmothers in nursing homes in new jersey 
i did have the idea of conveying to peole some of the pathos i 
found in the two places he said as i went along i found i 
remembered far more than i thought 
he began writing prospect in the summer of 1985 and 
continued while on a sabbatical that fall he finished last fall 
he did not work on it when curry college was in session 
what i discovered i think in the end was the discovery 
that pete makes that we are blessed with closeness when we dont 
expect it he said

a decadesold sex caper is making headlines again 
in britain as the movie scandal turns bygone political wounds 
into the stuff of popular cinema 
the film offers that peculiar blend of politics and sex which 
has always caught on in britain where such scandals are regularly 
recycled 
scandal tells of the liaison between former cabinet minister 
john profumo secretary of war with english showgirl christine 
keeler a relationship that exposed a soviet connection and led to 
a sensational trial and the suicide of osteopath stephen ward 
keelers socialclimbing mentor 
the profumo affair as it came to be known forced the war 
minister to resign in 1963 when it was revealed that he was sharing 
keeler with a soviet naval attache the affair helped profumos 
conservative party lose the general election a year later 
john hurt plays ward and joanne whalleykilmer portrays keeler 
ian mckellen who won a 1981 tony for amadeus costars as 
profumo american actress bridget fonda braves a london accent as 
keelers sidekick mandy ricedavies 
critical response in england has ranged from praise for the 
filmmakers daring to disapproval that a seamy story is being 
dredged up again especially after profumos prolonged penance as a 
charity worker in the slums of london 
adam marsjones in the independent called the film a loving 
and highly enjoyable portrait of the early 1960s with a 
firstrate cast 
but peter mckay in the evening standard wrote the whole 
boring morass is a quarter of a century old and it meant nothing at 
the time let alone now 
mckellen retorts the themes brought out were in the end more 
important than the comfort and privacy of one mans life 
the film is controversial in suggesting that ward far from 
being an amoral cad was duped into helping the secret service to 
sexually compromise the soviet attache 
borrowing from new reports scandal suggests that ward was 
abandoned by his spymasters and turned into a scapegoat to protect 
the establishment from humiliation this provoked an angry reply 
from anthony hartley in the conservative sunday telegraph he said 
all the evidence showed that mi5 the domestic secret service 
believed ward was indiscreet unreliable and best avoided 
conspiracy theories are always a misleading approach to 
history wrote hartley and this one is no exception 
but producer stephen woolley says we didnt make this up 
this happened it has the same lack of logic that life has 
scandal has done good box office in britain grossing over 3 
million pounds 51 million since its march 3 release 
in the united states the film generated advance publicity when 
a brief orgy scene earned it an x rating the twominute scene was 
altered and the rating was changed to an r 
coexecutive producer harvey weinstein of miramax pictures in 
new york said scandal was basically a fabulous love story 
for men in my age group christine was like bridget bardot 
except she was involved in an international sex scandal he said 
director michael catonjones said his movie was a call for 
tolerance 
because britain is so classconscious people always take much 
more stock of what politicians say than anyone else he said 
stephen and christine were reprehensible types at the time 
because they were not ministers of state 
catonjones a scot making his first feature movie said 
scandal made no claims towards documentary fact 
there are so many different facets to it that you cant tell 
the true story he said we wanted a focus that would allow us 
to get as much in as possible and it became obvious that the way 
to do that was to concentrate on two characters stephen and 
christine who directly affected it

former dictator hugo banzer has 
demonstrated a lasting broadly based popularity in his campaign to 
win election sunday to the presidency he once took by force 
the 62yearold retired army general is playing to enthusiastic 
audiences from all social levels of this poor largely indian 
nation of 6 million 
his popularity is a curious phenomenon at a time when 
dictatorsip is on the decline in latin america and democracy on the 
rise he explained it this way in a speech the people have an 
instinct that the political hacks have yet to discover the people 
remember the good things as well as the bad 
when banzer was in power from 1971 to 1978 prices for tin oil 
and other exports were high bolivia enjoyed economic growth and 
its people were working after his departure came slumping prices 
rising debt unemployment and rampant inflation 
during a tour of slums at santa cruz a tropical city that is 
bolivias second largest packs of ragged youngsters shouting 
viva banzer chased his open car through the unpaved streets 
he was dressed casually in a sport shirt and waved to cheering 
crowds mothers held up babies to be kissed 
the evening before he attended a crowded fundraising dinner in 
a la paz luxury hotel where an organization of doctors lawyers 
and other professionals gave the former general a gold medal 
designating him leader of bolivian democracy 
nearly every poll shows him leading the field of 10 candidates 
banzer finished first four years ago with 286 percent of the 
vote but lack of a majority left the decision to congress it 
chose victor paz estenssoro who was second with 264 percent 
no candidate is expected to get a majority this time either but 
banzer hopes to build a large enough plurality to make him the only 
possible choice for congress 
a great economic and social development occurred under his 
military government banzer says 
after he was forced out of office by popular pressure for a 
return to democracy an economic crisis descended on latin america 
and the good times ended 
inflation eventually soared to 20000 percent a year paz 
estenssoro had to adopt drastic austerity measures including the 
dismissal of 22000 employees of stateowned tin mines 
authorities say the austerity program is working restoring 
stability and allowing some real economic growth but it also has 
meant painfully hard times for many workingclass bolivians 
nationalist democratic action banzers party promises in its 
slogan a return to order peace and work 
opponents and some human rights groups dwell on the former 
dictators tactics while in power the bolivian permanent assembly 
for human rights says at least 33 people disappeared and hundreds 
were arrested tortured or forced into exile in a crackdown on 
leftists labor and dissident journalists 
banzer kept the people subjected violating the most basic 
human and civil rights rolando villena a roman catholic bishop 
and president of the assemblys executive committee said in an 
interview 
the people are losing their historical memory villena said 
of the public support the banzer slogan he said means order 
imposed from above on those below 
in campaign speeches banzer points out that he did not seize 
power from an elected government 
his coup in 1971 ousted a leftist military government that had 
installed a peoples assembly and planned other communiststyle 
changes many civilians including paz estenssoro supported the 
coup 
villena said banzer relinquished power only when forced to do so 
by popular resistance hunger strikes and labor actions 
democracy isnt a gift of this dictator he said it was 
won by the people against his wishes 
to such arguments banzer responds we arent trying to 
convince our adversaries of today who only want to listen to 
themselves that we are democrats we know that would be like 
plowing the sea 
banzer claims democratic credentials on the basis of peaceful 
participation in the process since forming his party a decade ago 
and his acceptance of the decision by congress to deny him the 
presidency in 1985 
his main opponents this time are gonzalo sanchez de losada of 
the governing revolutionary nationalist movement and jaime paz 
zamora of the movement of the revolutionary left 
he challenged both to pledge their support to the top 
votegetter whoever that is they refused saying congress must 
retain its constitutional authority 
a new congress also is to be elected sunday

it will be a pictureperfect battle of corporate 
tigers polaroid having just fought off a hostile raider is going 
for the jugular of kodak cornered by the japanese and poised to 
fight for its life 
the two photo giants go into court monday to determine how many 
hundreds of millions of dollars eastman kodak co will have to pay 
for violating seven of polaroid corps patents on instant film and 
cameras 
legions of highpriced lawyers are expected to present evidence 
for four to six months before judge a david mazzone reaches a 
decision in us district court here but the stakes are so high 
that neither side is trying to pinch mere millions in legal fees 
whether kodak illegally copied polaroids technology is no 
longer an issue a judge ruled in october 1985 that it had and 
booted kodak out of the instant photography business saddling it 
with 600 million of losses and an estimated 200 million worth of 
useless manufacturing equipment 
the only issue in the trial that starts monday is how much kodak 
must pay its rival 
rochester nybased kodak argues that the most polaroid should 
get is 177 million representing a 5 percent royalty on all the 
instant film and cameras that kodak sold from 1976 to 1986 
but cambridgebased polaroid is asking for 348 billion to 
396 billion for lost profits and missed business opportunities 
plus punitive damages and interest for a total of 1188 billion 
if polaroid gets anything close to that amount it will be the 
largest patent infringement award in history and a devastating blow 
to kodak which had operating profits of 3 billion on sales of 17 
billion last year 
a multibillion dollar verdict could force kodak to make layoffs 
take on huge debt and sell subsidiaries to raise cash it could 
leave the company unable to make the investments it needs to 
compete with japanese film brands like fuji and ilford 
if the award is near the top of the possible range it could 
even force kodak into a chapter 11 bankruptcy just as texaco was 
forced to reorganize when a jury ordered it to pay 103 billion to 
pennzoil four years ago 
but securities analysts say that is unlikely most wall street 
brokerage houses are predicting an award of about 1 billion and 
traders say the stock prices of both companies already reflect that 
expectation 
were not going to see another texaco here said peter 
enderlin an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
polaroid which recently spent 11 billion to buy back stock 
and fend off a hostile takeover by shamrock holdings inc is 
expected to use part of any award to lower its corporate debt 
in addition polaroid made the lawsuit a bargaining chip in the 
takeover fray promising in its march 27 settlement with shamrock 
that stockholders would get part of any award over 750 million 
after taxes 
that payout to be made through dividends or stock repurchases 
would be on a sliding scale at least a quarter of any posttax 
award from 750 million to 12 billion a third of the amount from 
12 billion to 24 billion and half of everything above 24 
billion 
but polaroids stockholders are not the only ones who would gain 
from a big verdict its 11000 employees would too their 
profitsharing plan entitles them to about 10 percent of any award 
for lost profits and their employee stock ownership plan means 
they gain from any rise in share prices 
if the verdict comes in below the expected range however 
polaroids employees and stockholders could get hurt 
alex henderson an analyst with prudential bache securities 
inc said that as a rough rule of thumb polaroids stock 
price probably will rise or fall about 1 for every 100 million of 
the award that is above or below wall streets expectations 
that means a 400 million verdict could knock 5 or 6 off the 
stocks current price of about 38 per share while a 2 billion 
award could add 10 
kodak has had two years to prepare for an adverse judgment and 
already has weathered a lot of the instant photography storm last 
year for example it gave 150 million in cash and merchandise as 
compensation to owners of its instant cameras for which film is no 
longer available 
polaroid meanwhile emerged from its takeover battle in 
fighting trim with 1900 fewer employees lower overhead and 
several new products including conventional film a foray into 
kodaks terrain that seems an appropriate titfortat 
now it remains to be seen who will prevail in court

holly hunter who was nominated for an oscar 
for the film broadcast news doesnt care much for television 
i watch tv and i dont know what im seeing she said im 
bored 
so whys she starring in roe vs wade nbcs dramatization 
of the supreme courts decision to legalize abortion 
it has more to do with an actors convictions than with the 
limits of an entertainment medium 
i was interested in roe vs wade well i wasnt just 
interested in it i was active in it hunter said 
an outspoken prochoice advocate in real life hunter 30 
played the pregnant plaintiff in roe vs wade partly because 
she feels a womans right to a legal abortion is now in jeopardy 
the supreme court is weighing arguments in a missouri case that 
challenges roe vs wade 
i think whats going on says something about how women are 
still riding shotgun hunter said the fact that this case is 
coming up again in the supreme court is kind of indicative of the 
fact that the administration for the past eight years has really 
taken a toll on civil rights in general not excluding womens 
rights 
in roe vs wade hunter is ellen russell a character based 
on the real roe plaintiff norma mccorvey russell is an unmarried 
unemployed texas carnival barker her efforts to obtain an abortion 
in a state where it was then illegal leads her to sarah weddington 
a lawyer eager to challenge the law 
weddington played by amy madigan argues the case all the way 
to the supreme court resulting in the landmark decision legalizing 
abortion in 1973 
although roe vs wade shot under two phony names to avoid 
protests will almost certainly draw complaints from the 
antiabortion lobby hunter believes the movie is fair to both 
sides of the debate indeed nbc insisted on more than 17 scripts 
from roe vs wade screenwriter alison cross to ensure the movie 
didnt play favorites 
i think that the results of jane roes efforts are heroic 
hunter said it was a precedent that needed to be set real 
desperately abortion needed to be made legal but jane roe is 
not a heroine at all shes got glaring weaknesses and shes 
extremely raw and i thought that it was interesting to see 
those two things 
but im really happy jane roe didnt back out of it 
both the prochoice and antiabortion forces in roe vs 
wade hunter said are fully realized characters and it didnt 
have to be that way but that absolutely gives it more credibility 
 
im really glad its not going to be a hammeroverthehead 
movie i dont think theres any sentimentality in it most movies 
even features if theyre talking about issues they make them so 
black and white 
hunter is confident that rather than being seen as a polemic 
roe vs wade will be viewed as educational and 
thoughtprovoking 
i think actually very few people know much of the story of 
this case hunter said including the fact that jane roe was 
unable to have an abortion before the case was decided and she 
gave her baby up for adoption 
the movie made my feeling about adoption more than 
intellectual hunter said before it was certainly something 
that i believed in but now that ive done jane roe it just nailed 
it in a little more securely adoption is just as personal a choice 
as abortion 
the response from so many people is that adoption is the 
answer for any woman who wants to have an abortion but the 
fact is adoption is a haphazardly incompetently handled 
institution 
what if the mother is 23 years old and shes been a hooker 
for the past eight years she has absolutely no money shes got 
six kids already and her husband or one of her tricks left her 
whos going to want that baby whos going to adopt it like 
nobody 
even though roe vs wade clearly represents a personal 
project for hunter it does not mark any profound change in her 
career her role in the upcoming film miss firecracker now 
playing in a few cities is that of a wannabe beauty queen not a 
partisan crusader 
and the character she played so capably in broadcast news 
a professionally gifted but emotionally crippled television news 
producer was not out to change the world 
every movie i do im sure wont have political connotations 
hunter said thats like me saying ill never do a movie just for 
the money are you kiddin man 
yeah i can do roe vs wade which i think is a fine 
socially upstanding statement and then maybe in five years ill 
want to buy 300 acres of property somewhere and say well this 
project looks like itd be fun and theyre offering me just a 
ton of money so i think ill do it hunter said 
where i think the deceit lies is not in doing something for 
money but in doing it for money and not realizing thats why you 
are

the eyes of many investment managers inflation 
worriers and economic forecasters are watching still another 
statistic just as theyve been doing every day for several weeks 
they are scrutinizing digits percentages and even decimal 
points of the latest monthly business activity report from the 
national association of purchasing management seeking in it signs 
about the immediate future 
last week it was the report on consumer spending aftertax 
income and the savings rate later this week the microscope will be 
turned on newhome sales factory inventories nonfarm payrolls 
consumer debt and similar reports 
all this activity creates great excitement ranging from terror 
to elation pontificators orate portfolio managers change 
investments learned academics comment sagely the white house 
often has something to say as well 
but when all is said and done the question remains do the 
statistics of one month or one week mean very much if anything 
probably not and the reasons are obvious and numerous 
to begin with there are seasonal and other aberrations that 
cause shortterm reports to deviate from the longerterm trend as 
more information comes in revisions and adjustments often follow 
and corrections too 
it is not at all uncommon either for one months statistics to 
signify something entirely different from the month before or the 
one that follows moreover opinions of the same statistics vary 
from month to month 
it is for reasons such as these that wise users of statistics 
wait for confirmation which doesnt occur until statistics for a 
couple of months at least show the same configuration or until 
related data offer support 
knowledge of this doesnt of course deter anyone in an 
economic world in which insight into the future can be turned into 
megadollars an entire industry exists on grabbing and analyzing 
any numbers that float by 
among them are stock market analysts academics with or seeking 
a popular following investors the media economists seeking to 
prove that their theses are correct and worry warts of various 
stripes and spots 
worriers and those who feed them proliferate in an economy 
that is seen these days as being on the edge of a precipice any 
piece of statistical dust thus can be the weight that tips the 
precarious balance 
however in a field of economics in which the most basic of 
premises may be incorrect how can a speck of dust be that 
important if doubts exist about the causes of inflation for 
example can one months statistics be that important 
at the moment one of the most widely held theories about the 
current economy is that the budget deficits and federal debt are 
likely to cause a catastrophe it is probably the least 
controversial of all current economic issues 
however some of the sharpest brains in american economics 
disagree 
prof robert heilbroner and peter bernstein authors of the 
debt and the deficit state the national debt will not as is 
widely thought impoverish our grandchildren that only a small 
percentage of it is owed to foreigners and that the national debt 
and deficit are not large by historic standards 
they are not alone prof robert eisner of harvard former 
president of the american economic association contends that the 
true deficit is much smaller than thought and that everyone would 
know it with proper accounting methods 
if such an enormous disagreement exists about such a fundamental 
concept of american life why should one vagrant grain of 
statistical dust have an important and even enormous impact on the 
present and future 
it is something to think about this week when you read the 
reports about construction spending and installment credit and 
factory inventories and nonfarm payrolls

opponent of the divestment crusade and the biggest us operation 
in that country mobils move raised speculation that other 
companies would leave at an accelerated pace 
this was a difficult decision because we continue to believe 
that our presence and our actions have contributed greatly to 
economic and social progress for non whites in south africa 
mobil chairman allen e murray said in announcing the end of nine 
decades of company operations in south africa 
we are proud of what mobil people have accomplished in south 
africa he said but we had to weigh business considerations 
including the impact of recently enacted and proposed us 
legislation and regulations which have made it more and more 
difficult for us to be fully competitive there 
murrays announcement marked a stunning reversal for new 
yorkbased mobil the nations sixthlargest industrial corporation 
and secondlargest us oil company behind exxon corp which 
vacated south africa three years ago mobil had vowed it would 
never capitulate to pressure to leave 
the mobil news came a day after nearly a quarter of unisys 
shareholders voted to sever business ties with south africa at the 
companys annual meeting and four days after 145 percent of ibm 
shareholders did likewise 
although those resolutions were defeated the tallies reflected 
the growing strength of the south africa divestment movement among 
shareholders a few years ago such resolutions generally won 
little more than a 3 percent vote 
like many of the 170 american companies that have vacated south 
africa over the past four years mobil said its primary reason for 
department was economic not political 
but antiapartheid activists noted mobils announcement came 
less than two weeks before its annual meeting activist 
shareholders had placed two south african divestment resolutions on 
the agenda 
theres no question it was partly designed to deflect the 
efforts of those shareholders said ibrahim gassama legislative 
director of transafrica a washingtonbased lobby concern that 
advocates severing us ties with south africa 
antiapartheid activists also said they believed mobils move 
was partly a delayed reaction to a tax change passed by congress in 
1987 that reform introduced by rep charles rangel dny 
eliminated corporate deductions for income taxes paid to south 
africa 
some activists believe the rangel reform has removed what they 
call an excuse many us companies use for justifying their 
presence in south africa they do more good there battling racial 
injustice than they would by leaving 
as mobils departure shows gassama contended we realize now 
they were not there for south africans they were there for the 
money rangel must be congratulated because he flushed out this 
facade 
in other business and economic news this past week 
government figures suggested the economy is slowing the march 
index of leading indicators fell 07 percent consumer spending 
rose only 02 percent the same month and durable goods orders from 
factories rose only 08 percent mostly from aircraft orders that 
fluctuate sharply from month to month financial markets rallied on 
the numbers because they were interpreted as a sign the federal 
reserve wont raise interest rates further to slow the economy and 
curb inflation 
several major companies reported sharp firstquarter earnings 
increases airline giants ual corp delta air lines and usair 
group inc enjoyed a surge in earnings due to higher fares boeing 
co reported an 18 percent jump that underscored its record orders

the stock market turned in a strong showing in 
april thwarting the skeptics who thought its winterlong rally 
couldnt last 
now many analysts say comes the tricky part 
as wall street heads toward midyear the economic slowdown so 
many market participants have been hoping for appears to have 
begun interest rates have shown some tentative signs of turning 
downward 
economic statistics over the next couple of months will go a 
long way toward determining whether those expectations will be 
fulfilled 
the federal reserve will be watching the data closely to try to 
gauge the impact on business activity of a long period of 
credittightening from early 1988 through most of the first quarter 
of this year 
the fed and many stock and bond traders would like to see 
signs that economic growth has indeed slackened and more 
important that the pace of inflation is abating as well 
that would provide evidence that the effort to restrain 
inflation was producing some results without the need to push the 
economy further toward the brink of a recession 
at last the cup seems half full again instead of half empty 
said michael sherman at shearson lehman hutton inc 
what seemed to be generating this optimism was the likelihood 
that the economy would slow allowing a reduction in interest rates 
at both the long and short end and indicating that although 
profits might bend they are unlikely to break 
the ability of the market to trade at new postcrash highs 
shows that investors now interpret the environment as bullish if 
the economy continues to slow we will in all likelihood have a 
further fall in rates and a further rise in stock prices 
the more positive mood of the marketplace brokers warn also 
leaves additional room for potential disappointments 
if events conspire to force the fed into taking more restrictive 
steps they say both stocks and bonds could well suffer a big 
letdown 
and if economic activity starts dropping off too rapidly 
recession fears could weigh on stock prices even as interest rates 
declined whats good for bonds is not necessarily good for 
stocks observed abby joseph cohen and burton siegel in their 
latest investment strategy report for drexel burnham lambert inc 
the stock market overcame such concerns to post a small gain in 
the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 934 to 
241880 to extend its gain for april to 15518 points 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 23 at 17313 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market up 379 at 42755 and the american 
stock exchange market value index up 251 at 34508 
volume on the big board averaged 16064 million shares a day 
down from 17840 million the week before 
in recent years the market has been able to avert a historical 
pattern that yale hirsch who publishes the annual stock traders 
almanac calls the mayjune disaster area 
from 1965 through 1984 the dow jones industrial average gained 
ground through this twomonth period only three times 
in each of the past four years however the average has 
recorded a net gain through may and june of at least 5 percent 
the jinx apparently is off now all stocks need is a little 
help from the inflation statistics and the federal reserve
