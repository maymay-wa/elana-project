she and her family including a teenage daughter and a teenage 
son had asked to have the respirator removed but neumann medical 
center officials fearful of a lawsuit of criminal charges asked

said her physician dr leonard m popowich 
all i want is for you to see her and see what shes going 
through one of her daughters 18yearold joy stussy tld the

i havent changed my mind about having the respirator 
removed she wrote however if the decision is to have the

the hospital sued for the right to comply with her wishes green 
said court approval would make it possible to find a physician or 
nurse who could disconnect the machine

unocal corp joining a growing contingent of 
oil companies with clean air ideas announced thursday it would 
offer to buy 7000 older gaseating cars in an effort to reduce 
smog in the los angeles basin 
unocal has allocated 5 million to purchase the cars which must 
be at least 20 years old and scrap them said richard j 
stegemeier unocals chairman and chief executive the plan would 
eliminate an estimated 6 million pounds of pollutant gases he said 
owners would be offered 700 apiece for the locally registered 
junkers stegemeier said 
we want to take the heaviest polluters off the road and hand 
them over to a scrap yard which will shred and recycle the 
metal stegemeier said 
unocal executives noted that pre1971 vehicles pollute from 15 
to 30 times more than 1990 models with about 410000 such jalopies 
and bombs registered in the region the program is scheduled to 
begin june 1 
another voluntary program to take effect in july offers free 
smog checks and emission control tuneups for pre1975 cars at 
participating unocal 76 service stations 
such tuneups could remove 17 million pounds of carbon monoxide 
nitrogen oxides and reactive organic gases from the los angeles 
basin which has the worst air quality problem in the nation the 
los angelesbased oil company said 
a spokesman for southern californias powerful air quality 
agency voiced support for unocals program which was seen by one 
industry analyst as a growing trend of greening among oil 
companies 
unocals approach also reflects a different philosophical 
approach to eliminating air pollution in the region 
we want to demonstrate ways of reducing smog that are 
efficient and costeffective stegemeier said 
a similar proposal was suggested last year to regional smog 
control officials by the claremont institute a conservative 
nonprofit think tank 
the institute had suggested paying about 1500 apiece to remove 
850000 pre1980 vehicles from the region at a cost of 13 
billion said lucas morel a research associate at the institute 
it moves away from the command and control of a centralized 
bureaucracy by allowing industries in the marketplace to choose 
their own methods to achieve certain reductions of emissions morel 
said 
while unusual in its approach however unocals announcement 
was hardly unique 
theyre all becoming environmentally proactive said 
kenneth b funsten an oil industry analyst with wedbush morgan 
securities in los angeles 
funsten attributed the trend largely to exxons handling of the 
alaskan oil spill which has hardened political opposition to oil 
industry operations 
atlantic richfield co last september introduced a reformulated 
lowemission gasoline to replace leaded regular in its pumps and 
the shell oil co followed suit with a similar reformulation for 
premium gas

india and pakistan agreed wednesday to try 
to reduce military tensions in kashmir a territory over which they 
have fought two wars 
however a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries failed to make progress on the fundamental stalemate over 
kashmir 
india accuses pakistan of supporting terrorism by giving aid to 
moslem secessionists pakistan says india is violating un 
security council resolutions that call for the people of kashmir to 
determine their own future 
the ministers inder k gujral of india and sahabzada yaqubkhan 
of pakistan said the military chiefs of the two countries would 
communicate regarding ways to head off confrontations in the tense 
region 
the two also said in a joint statement that both sides would 
exercise restraint and that diplomatic channels of communication 
would be kept open 
both officials were in new york for a united nations meeting on 
international economic cooperation 
yaqubkhan told reporters afterward that the talks were free 
and frank but indicated there was no progress toward compromise 
on kashmirs future 
a 1948 security council resolution calls for a plebiscite in 
kashmir india and pakistan both agreed to the resolution but 
india holds that it was nullified when political leaders in kashmir 
opted for union with india 
more than 300 people have died in the kashmir valley in 
sectarian violence or in clashes with authorities since jan 20 
when indian security forces began a crackdown on escalating 
protests bombings and attacks on state officials 
initially the secessionists wanted union with moslem pakistan 
but in recent weeks they have declared they want an independent 
nonaligned nation in kashmir 
india and pakistan fought wars over the territory in 1948 and 
1965 india now controls the southern twothirds of jammukashmir 
and pakistan the northern third

doctors today reported development of the first 
treatment to reduce the lungclogging secretions that make cystic 
fibrosis a major killer 
preliminary tests on adults found that a commonly used blood 
pressure medicine given in aerosol form significantly slowed lung 
damage in victims according to the report in the new england 
journal of medicine 
if it proves safe and effective in a large number of patients 
our real fantasy is that we could give it to children at an early 
age when their lungs are not damaged and it could be used as a 
preventative therapy for a long time said dr michael r 
knowles who developed the treatment 
cystic fibrosis results from a genetic defect victims lungs 
produce thick mucous that interferes with breathing and harbors 
bacteria chronic infections damage the lungs and eventually cause 
death 
only about half of all victims live to their mid20s the new 
approach if it works as doctors hope could increase life 
exponentially said dr robert beall research director of the 
cystic fibrosis foundation 
we feel that if we can change the environment of the lung so 
that we dont give bacteria a good place to live we might add 
decades to these kids lives he said 
the treatment is an inhaled form of a medicine called amiloride 
the drug known as a diuretic is ordinarily given as pills to 
treat high blood pressure congestive heart failure and fluid 
retention associated with kidney disease 
beall said another study is planned to test the therapy on 
children knowles cautioned that until the results are in doctors 
should not routinely use the drug on youngsters because it might 
have dangerous side effects 
cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal inherited genetic 
defect among whites in the united states one of every 2500 people 
has the disease 
because of the abnormality cells that line the air tubes in the 
lungs absorb too much salt and water while antibiotics are 
commonly used to reduce infections the new treatment is the first 
to tackle the underlying mixup in the bodys chemistry 
amiloride works by reducing the lung cells absorption of salt 
and water this makes their mucous thinner less likely to promote 
bacterial growth and easier for victims to cough up 
knowles study was conducted on 14 people at the university of 
north carolina 
for two consecutive sixmonth periods they used aerosol 
amiloride or a sham treatment while their conditions did not 
improve the rate of lung damage appeared to be slowed while taking 
amiloride the doctors calculated that it reduced the loss of lung 
capacity by 60 percent when compared to the dummy spray 
amiloride in pill form is ineffective against cystic fibrosis 
knowles and two other researchers hold the patent on the aerosol 
technique and the pharmaceutical firm glaxo has bought the rights 
to produce the inhaled form 
more testing will be necessary before permission is sought from 
the food and drug administration to make the treatment routinely 
available

brace yourselves viewers you loved americas 
funniest home videos are you ready for cincinnatis funniest 
home videos washingtons wackiest denvers drollest 
youd better be the phenomenal success of abcs halfhour home 
video show has prompted enthusiastic knockoffs by local stations 
girding for mays important ratings sweeps 
we have more than a dozen affiliates around the country 
running their own local contests for viewers said judy raskin a 
spokeswoman for americas funniest home videos 
she said she didnt know which affiliates were participating 
but said they are required to relay entries to the network show 
one affiliate involved is wkrc in cincinnati which airs a 
2minute home video segment usually as a kicker to close its 
sunday late news show 
were definitely enlisting and actively searching out home 
videos said steve doerr assistant news director 
people arent sending in as many tapes as expected doerr said 
but he figures thats because wkrc is competing with the network 
show which offers a weekly 10000 prize for the best video and 
100000 for the seasons best 
wkrc is working out a deal with a local company to provide 
prizes for cincinnatis funniest home videos 
theres quite a potential audience out there about 23 million 
video cameras were sold last year and by next year one household 
in 10 will have one according to industry estimates 
our fascination with home video is in its innocence and openness 
as a highly personal form of expression says critic neal gabler 
who helped judge video review magazines amateur video contest 
its a naive kind of folk art very much like folk art of the 
19th century gabler said after showing the winners to reporters 
the grand prize winner was a droll travelogue on the honolululong 
beach calif tunnel 
no kidding 
were so accustomed to things being packaged and manufactured 
i think americas funniest home videos is a kind of unconscious 
rebellion against that he said 
that fascination has spurred competition for videos in tight 
television markets like denver where abc affiliate kusa is airing 
a onehour home video special on may 23 
its something that people want to see said mike watson 
coproducer it could be you it could be your neighbor its 
photojournalism in its truest sense 
kusa got a video store to offer a 5000 home video setup as 
grand prize then solicited videos with the promise to relay them 
to the network show eventually kusa got more than 150 tapes 
some people would send the raw tape with no note telling 
whats funny watson said in a pained voice i hope they really 
pay those people who screen the tapes on americas funniest home 
videos 
watson isnt sure how long it will last i think its a 
passing thing but i have a fun time doing it and the audience 
should have a fun time he said 
kcnc a denver rival owned and operated by nbc started 
soliciting videos a month ago and tries to broadcast at least one 
each tuesday on its early evening news and features show said tom 
lea news operations manager 
were getting a good number of contributions but many of them 
just arent that funny lea said i think its definitely the 
kind of thing where there is definitely a market but i dont know 
how long its going to last 
in washington nbc affiliate wrc is offering washingtons 
wackiest home videos a threeday featurette for its 6 pm 
newscasts during the may sweeps may is one of four months in which 
estimates of viewer size are used to determine a stations 
advertising rates 
crosstown abc affiliate wjla airs the first of four home video 
segments sunday on its late newscast viewers will vote for a 
winner to be announced on the monday night newscast said joyce 
kravitz a spokeswoman 
wjla viewers dont even need their own equipment we have a 
camera from americas funniest home videos and were making it 
available to viewers who want to participate she said 
theres a big advantage to the funny video format that already 
has proved a bonanza for the network it costs practically nothing 
to produce 
its almost a natural resource for television said doerr 
one final question are cincinnatis funniest home videos really 
that funny 
humor like video is in the eye of the beholder doerr 
said early returns indicate people like it

the tide of democracy sweeping eastern 
europe is being felt in black africa but oneparty rule still 
predominates and three of the major states have publicly committed 
themselves to it 
tanzania has had only one party for 26 years and said this month 
the policy will not change kenya did the same and zimbabwes 
leader robert mugabe declared his intention to install oneparty 
rule 
if we have many political parties we will have chaos as 
different tribes rush to form theirs president daniel arap moi 
of kenya told trainee teachers at laikipia in central kenya 
tribal inclinations and consciousness is still paramount in the 
minds of many kenyans 
for now i say no to the multiparty system at least until we 
are cohesive enough as a nation he said 
kenya has 40 tribes in a population of 22 million ethnic 
feuding is common in parliament at public rallies and in the press 
moi a 66yearold a former teacher from the minority kalenjin 
tribe inherited the oneparty system in 1978 from the late 
president jomo kenyatta the nations founder kenyatta had banned 
opposition parties nine years earlier 
kenyatta created a de facto oneparty state by locking up his 
political opponents moi made it constitutional in 1982 
the presidents statement was his first on the subject since 
some other african states began considering more liberalized 
political systems this year 
he spoke after weeks of debate in nairobi newspapers about 
whether kenya should restore the style of democracy bequeathed to 
kenyatta when he led the former british colony to independence in 
1963 
writers supporting the status quo argued that kenya had 
prospered under the current system without tribal strife they 
said a return to the old order might cause ethnic violence and 
drive away tourists and investors 
those who wanted change said kenyans were politically mature 
enough for competition that recent reforms in eastern europe 
should be used as an example and that a parliamentary opposition 
would help check official corruption mismanagement and nepotism 
neighboring tanzania a nation of 100 tribes also was a british 
colony until independence in 1961 under julius nyerere 
unlike its wealthy capitalist cousin tanzania followed 
socialism based on eastern european models both nyerere and ali 
hassan mwinyi who succeeded him as president in 1985 have 
admitted the policies were flawed 
mwinyi 65 has adopted radical economic reforms prescribed by 
western lenders but has rejected suggestions that they be 
accompanied by political change 
while a multiparty system would be suitable for europeans it 
might not be the same with tanzania mwinyi told reporters in dar 
es salaam 
what africans want is a fair return for their sweat through a 
new international economic order this cannot be solved by the 
creation of 100 parties which can bring chaos instead of 
progress 
he said tanzanians had voted consistently for a single party as 
a way to guarantee national unity he did not mention a statement 
nyerere made in february that multiparty democracy now may be 
possible 
nyerere still chairman of the ruling chama cha mapinduzi party 
remains a powerful political figure five years after he resigned as 
president 
only a few of the 50 member nations of the organization of 
african unity have westernstyle democracies 
zimbabwe is one but president robert mugabe declared after an 
overwhelming victory in recent national elections that he will 
transform the former british colony of rhodesia into a oneparty 
state 
mugabe who led zimbabwe to independence 10 years ago said the 
elections were a mandate from the 48 million registered voters to 
get rid of the opposition 
his opponents accused mugabe 66 of seeking a dictatorship 
they noted that only 54 percent of the electorate voted and 
opposition parties got 20 percent of the votes although they won 
only three of the 150 parliament seats 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire said this week he would lift 
a 20yearold ban on opposition parties and his popular movement 
for the revolution since 1970 the only official party no longer 
would have special status 
he said the constitution of the former belgian colony would be 
rewritten and an interim government would be installed by april 24 
1991 to prepare for elections 
benin a former french colony is pledged to eliminate oneparty 
rule gabon is debating the question and there is pressure in the 
ivory coast for a freer political order 
cameroon and niger scenes of recent political upheavals have 
rejected multiparty politics 
significant signals of change are coming from unlikely quarters 
ethiopia and mozambique have abandoned their hardline marxist 
ideologies and the marxist leaders of angola have committed 
themselves to peace talks with usbacked guerrillas that if 
fruitful could lead to open elections

horse breeder leslie combs ii bequeathed 
most of his millions to a cancer foundation but there were strings 
attached the foundation must fire its director 
and there are conflicting ideas about why he did it 
combs founderof spendthrift farm died of cancer april 7 at age 
88 he stipulated in his will that the emphraim mcdowell cancer 
foundation be given an endowment worth 26 million over the next 25 
years on condition that it replace linda mauk as director 
in the will which distributed assets of 63 million and an 
undisclosed amount from two trusts combs said i am not pleased 
with the conduct of linda mauk 
the will stipulated that centre college in danville which combs 
attended for two years receive most of the money if mauk remained 
in her post 
juliette combs trapp combs daughter said in a statement 
tuesday her father made the demand because mauk allegedly told him 
last july that his wifes name might be removed from a cancer 
center if he changed his will 
this was understandably traumatic to him and was enough to 
cause him to include the reference to mauk in his will trapp 
said 
but mauk 37 denied wednesday that she told combs his late 
wifes name dorothy enslow combs would be taken off one of 
buildings in the lucille parker markey cancer center at the 
university of kentucky 
there was no threat said mauk who has been the 
foundations executive director 10 years thats not a building 
for us to take a name off of it belongs to the university of 
kentucky we turned the building over to the university 
marylou whitney a longtime mcdowell supporter threatened last 
week to resign as foundation cochairman if mauk is dismissed mauk 
also has received support in an editorial and several letters in 
the lexington heraldleader 
its nice to know that you have supporters out there said 
mauk adding that she has received flowers and numerous phone calls 
from people wanting her to remain in the post 
the foundation was created to generate donations for the lucille 
parker markey cancer center it has raised 27 million all from 
private sources combs had been involved in the fundraising 
dr ben f roach the foundations chairman has told the 
newspaper he would let trapps statement ride on its own merits 
i dont have any comment roach told the associated press 
ive probably said too much already 
brownell combs ii combs son declined to comment on the 
controversy after meeting with roach on wednesday 
ill let my sisters statement suffice he said 
roach told the newspaper the foundations 15 trustees would meet 
very shortly and might issue a statement one trustee said the 
meeting could be as early as friday but roach would not confirm 
that day 
nobody enjoyed living more than leslie combs mauk said i 
hope people look at this and realize how vulnerable people are when 
facing death 
there are probably a thousand pieces to the pie everything he 
did in the will was impacted by those thousand pieces 
mauk confirmed that she wrote a letter to combs in march 
because i didnt want him to think i was mad at him and that i 
didnt want him to be mad at me or dr roach 
trapps statement said mauks letter tried to mollify the 
remarks about changing the name of the building 
unfortunately dad did what he did and hes no longer here 
so theres no way it can be changed trapp said 
lexington lawyer charles hembree who drafted the will has 
refused to comment on the matter he is also one of three trustees 
of combs trust 
mauk is unsure what she will do 
im stewing on all the options she said

the film industry could be faced with an 
avalanche of lawsuits and the public could see fewer movie classics 
because of the us supreme courts copyright ruling involving the 
thriller rear window 
entertainment industry attorneys said tuesdays ruling means 
film studios rereleasing old movies will have to scour their books 
to make sure all copyrights are covered 
the court said actor jimmy stewart and other owners of rear 
window must share earnings from movies 1983 rerelease with the 
current owner of the renewed copyright to the story on which the 
film was based the author of the story is no longer alive 
the high court relied heavily on a 1909 law that permits a 
copyright to be renewed for 28 years after the initial 28year 
copyright period ends the idea is to give authors other artists 
and their heirs a second chance to reap rewards from successful 
works 
its going to be potentially an additional cost for the 
producers and the distributors said arnold lutzker a washington 
attorney whose clients include the directors guild of america 
you could find third parties coming out of the woodwork 
the ruling could cost producers millions of dollars in profits 
and reduce the financial incentive for making hundreds of film 
classics available in the united states said an attorney for mca 
inc 
its not all good for the authors said sheldon mittleman 
mcas house counsel mittleman said motion picture companies may be 
reluctant to develop movies based on material whose copyrights will 
soon be up for renewal 
for the studios and the public this could be a very serious 
situation mittleman said it could mean that the american 
public will be deprived of the chance to see classic movies 
the decision is a victory for sheldon abend a literary agent 
who paid 650 to chase manhattan bank in 1971 for the copyright to 
the dimemagazine detective story on which rear window was 
based the bank administered the authors estate 
abend said the movies 1983 rerelease infringed on the renewed 
copyright he bought and that the owners interfered with his plans 
to contract with home box office cable tv for a new play and tv 
version of the story 
he said he wants a portion of the more than 12 million the film 
has earned since 1983 for stewart hitchcocks heirs and mca 
artists ltd 
the ruling also could affect the recording industry live 
theater and computer software said stephen kroft a lawyer who 
filed a brief on behalf of several major film companies opposing 
abends claim 
its a noose around the neck for owners of these works 
kroft said its very unfortunate its got potentially very 
broad ramifications 
and a work can incorporate or be based on all kinds of 
different copyrighted work songs especially think about a film 
like american graffiti and all the songs in it kroft said 
stewart was traveling but spokesman john strauss said the actor 
would not discuss legal matters 
rear window which starred stewart and grace kelly is based 
on it had to be murder a short story by cornell woolrich first 
published in 1942 in dime detective magazine

some members of congress are expressing 
growing discontent over president bushs goslow reaction to the 
soviet unions crackdown on lithuania 
i sense that more in congress are beginning to share our 
concern about the administrations policy of inaction said sen 
paul simon dill whose state includes a large number of 
lithuanianamericans 
if the soviets continue their economic blockade against the 
breakaway baltic republic simon said my guess is that congress 
will lead if the president does not 
lithuanians heaped criticism on bush after the president 
postponed any economic sanctions against moscow for fear of boxing 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev into a corner and thus slowing 
the pace of soviet reform 
bush defended his decision on wednesday 
the policies decisions ive taken have had strong support 
from the american people and thats who i work for he said 
some members of congress like house speaker thomas j foley 
dwash and sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee have backed bushs decision 
others have argued for an american response 
my constituents are right said sen barbara mikulski 
dmd disagreeing with bush the us government has an 
obligation to support the lithuanian people 
i will support sanctions against the soviets until they 
respect lithuanias right to selfdetermination she said 
while senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has not 
criticized bush he reiterated his call wednesday for the 
administration to do something to express disapproval and to 
deter further actions against lithuania 
sen dennis deconcini dariz was harsher he blasted bush for 
wanting to have a photo op with gorbachev at kennebunkport 
maine during the planned may summit more than wanting to do what 
is right on lithuania kennebunkport is bushs summer home 
deconcini said the arms control summit ought to be scrapped 
until the soviet union makes a radical change of course on 
lithuania which has declared its independence 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee also said bush should postpone the summit to 
send a message around the world 
republican sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire joined the 
criticism saying the bush administration dishonored the 
principled conduct of previous administrations toward lithuania 
the time for silence has passed we have been patient and 
nothing good has happened he said its time for sanctions 
mr president 
meantime rep richard durbin dill was among members of 
congress who talked with lithuanian president vytautus landsbergis 
by telephone wednesday 
landsbergis told durbin who is of lithuanian heritage that 
moscow continues to stop shipments of fuel and other necessities 
and has blocked the main port 
the soviets are strangling our nation like a boa 
constrictor landsbergis said 
durbin said the united states has squandered its reputation as 
a leader in the area of human rights because of the way it 
handled lithuania 
the president gave a green light for the kremlin to continue 
to apply pressure and intimidation to lithuania durbin said i 
certainly dont believe we can stand by in good conscience while 
the people of lithuania suffer 
the senate appropriations committee has inserted in a 
supplemental spending bill a provision setting aside 10 million to 
build and staff a us embassy in lithuania if the united states 
formally recognizes the republics independence

just eight weeks from now east germans will 
make more money pay fewer taxes and see some of their savings 
triple in size 
but prices will surely rise parts of bank accounts may be 
frozen and workers will still make only about a third as much as 
their neighbors in the west 
that is the scenario both germanys predict will begin to unfold 
july 2 when the countries proclaim economic unity and begin one of 
historys most extraordinary experiments 
east germans will suddenly have greater access to better goods 
but the mere act of buying them may begin to put hundreds of 
thousands of their countrymen out of work as east germans shun 
their countrys goods for better western ones 
factories and former staterun enterprises will be free to 
compete in a free market shorn of communist regulation but they 
will face western competition and many will surely fold 
while all of this is happening investors may begin moving in to 
tap the new consumer market and the cheap labor in the new economic 
frontier the investment may create new jobs raise living 
standards and ultimately bring parity between east and west 
i am optimistic that there will be an economic awakening after 
a period of pain said juergen wagner an economist with 
commerzbank in frankfurt 
chancellor helmut kohl and prime minister lothar de maiziere of 
east germany meeting tuesday in bonn confirmed the two nations 
will officially share an economy july 2 
this is true unification to most germans for whom the cost of a 
heating bill the size of their pension and the price of their 
apartment is more important than the ideological debate on the role 
of a united germany in a changing world 
anybody who thinks west germany will simply load up tons of west 
german marks and ship them across the border while east germany 
burns its virtually worthless old currency is right 
officials say enough uncirculated cash is sitting in the west 
german bundesbank to supply east germanys banks east germany this 
week began destroying tons of its own reserves to create space in 
its treasury 
in the fall a new currency is expected to go into circulation 
for both countries 
many details still need to be worked out but by july 2 there 
likely will be one german economy 
west germanys agreement to swap most of the east german marks 
for west german marks at a 11 rate cleared a basic hurdle to 
unifying the countries 
west germanys central bank had said anything but a 21 trade 
could weaken the mighty west german mark trigger inflation and 
lead to higher interest rates 
but on monday it bowed to political pressures agreeing to back 
the 11 plan put forward by the kohl government 
economists like prospective parents trying to predict the 
appearance of their children can only speculate on how the 
offspring of this odd economic marriage will look 
they do agree that three things will happen in east germany 
after july 2 east german prices will rise thousands will be out 
of work and some inflation may occur in west germany 
nearly 9 million east germans make on average 960 marks per 
month nearly 90 percent of the women work so most families are 
twoincome households 
right now that 960 marks is worth about 320 west german marks 
190 at the official 31 exchange rate but in july east germans 
will get their full wages in west german marks about 560 
the catch is that west germans now average nearly triple that 
salary and consumer goods are priced accordingly by the free 
market 
east germans now pay relatively little for housing food is 
heavily subsidized and jobs guaranteed 
so what could happen in july economists predict prices will 
rise to more closely reflect the market in the new nation 
well see higher prices for groceries energy public tariffs 
railroads and other things that are highly subsidized said 
rudolf zwiener of the german institute for economic research in 
west berlin 
zwiener said east germany will need some sort of price 
protection to keep goods and rents affordable in the short term 
one advantage east germans will have he said is that they will 
pay a smaller share of taxes under west germanys progressive tax 
system 
but he said 1 million to perhaps 2 million could be jobless in a 
year east german factories and businesses will close as more east 
germans spend their new west german marks on better west german 
products 
huge unemployment also is likely in the vast public sector 
east german factories also have about 153 billion in debts 
incurred by the old socialist regime west germany proposes 
converting that to west marks at a 21 rate and assigning the debts 
to the enterprises 
the west germans also want a 11 conversion rate on personal 
savings of up to about 2300 with amounts above that converted at 
a 21 rate 
east germany is pressing for a higher ceiling zwiener predicts 
the ceiling likely will be doubled but with limits on how much 
east germans can withdraw right away 
many economists predict at least some inflation and higher 
interest rates when so many more west german marks flood the 
market zwiener predicts it will be slight 
wagner said he believes there will be enough growth to offset 
the effects of inflation and higher interest rates 
the capital that must go into east germany will come from 
all over the world he said the japanese will invest a lot in 
the country 
its already happening even though there is no real legal 
system in place yet to allow it japans yamaha motorcycles took 
over a storefront in downtown east berlin west germanys dresdner 
bank has moved into a room at the citys palace hotel 
five weeks ago budget rentacar also checked into a 
fourthfloor room at the palace set up two desks and began renting 
western cars 
were here unofficially said a woman who answered the door

violeta barrios de chamorro took the 
presidential oath wednesday ending 11 years of leftist sandinista 
rule in central americas largest country she immediately 
proclaimed a political amnesty and ended the military draft 
this blessed nicaragua instead of burying its sons in a 
fratricidal war will bury its weapons forever so the cannon will 
never roar again mrs chamorro told a crowd of 20000 inside a 
managua baseball stadium 
but some combatants were not ready to lay down their arms 
outside the mountain hamlet of el destino about 500 contra rebels 
rejected a call by a un peacekeeper to begin handing over their 
weapons about two hours after mrs chamorros inauguration 
an estimated 9000 contras inside nicaragua are to gather in 
coming days in five security enclaves inside nicaragua for 
demobilization but many rebels are balking unhappy with mrs 
chamorros appointment of former president daniel ortegas brother 
to head the army 
at el destino rebel leader israel galeano invited the 
guerrillas to surrender their weapons but first delivered a 
stinging antisandinista speech and vowed to be the last to lay 
down his own gun 
anybody who wants to give up his rifle come forward 
galeano told his fighters the guerrillas laughed and when one 
shouted nobody gives up his gun all cheered raucously 
leaders of the contras who have promised to disarm by june 10 
have been demanding sandinista officers resign before they put down 
their guns 
earlier at the downtown stadium where the inauguration was 
held the atmosphere was often rowdy 
spectators on the sandinista side hurled water balloons at mrs 
chamorro as she entered the stadium and one splattered her skirt 
ortega and his wife rosario murillo were pelted with watermelon 
rinds tossed by united national opposition partisans as they made 
their entrance 
the transition follows nine years of a usbacked insurgency in 
which 30000 people died mrs chamorro inherits a legacy of 
suspicion and distrust a nation of 35 million residents that 
resembles an armed camp and an economy shattered by the us trade 
embargo and rampant inflation 
the inauguration of mrs chamorro a conservative elected in 
february brought immediate resumption of us aid and trade 
assistance 
ortega lashed at the united states which backed the contra 
rebels for supporting an unjust and cruel war he promised to 
lead a constructive opposition and said if civil war broke out 
again the elections would have been for nothing 
mrs chamorro said gen humberto ortega the expresidents 
brother will head the army but that she herself would assume the 
post of defense minister to direct personally the processes of 
demobilization and demilitarization and to put an end to the war 
she said she would order gen ortega to establish a plan to 
reduce the size of the sandinista army and got her biggest cheer 
when she decreed an end to the extremely unpopular draft 
mrs chamorro also said she would grant a wide and 
unconditional amnesty to those responsible for political crimes 
the ortega appointment drew objections from mrs chamorros 
allies in the uno a coalition of 14 parties and in the contra 
movement 
at least two top prominent antisandinista leaders said they 
wouldnt serve in mrs chamorros cabinet because of the ortega 
appointment gilberto cuadra president of nicaraguas most 
influential business organization had been slotted as minister for 
construction and transportation jaime cuadra unrelated to 
gilberto had been designated agriculture minister 
dignitaries from 83 countries including vice president dan 
quayle and nine international organizations attended the 
inauguration also present were members of the sandinista cabinet 
and highranking officers of the sandinista army 
envoys of nations that had been on unfriendly terms with the 
sandinistas entered the stadium to catcalls boos and insults el 
salvadors rightist president alfredo cristiani and quayle were 
greeted with chants of assassin assassin 
quayle carried a letter to mrs chamorro from former president 
reagan who told her that with your assumption of the presidency 
the people of nicaragua can live in hope their freedoms can be 
restored their dreams and aspirations can be met 
quayle brought symbolic gifts of flour and cooking oil the 
first installment of 24 million in us food aid nicaraguas 
economy has faltered so much under last years 1800 percent 
inflation rate that shortages of food occurred requiring the 
importing of such staples as beans and rice 
he also brought word that president bush has approved 25 
million in medical supplies signed a formal declaration saying 
nicaragua is no longer a marxistleninist country restored its 
quota for sugar exports to the united states and made businesses 
wishing to invest in the country eligible for lowcost government 
loans 
quayle called mrs chamorros inauguration the miracle of 
managua 
in her speech mrs chamorro said she would ask the national 
assembly to repair injustices committed by seizure of property 
under sandinista rule but added that peasants will be guaranteed 
title to property redistributed under the sandinista agrarian 
reform program 
she also said economic controls would be lifted in an effort to 
spur economic production a process already begun by the 
sandinistas 
the streets of managua were largely empty wednesday a national 
holiday and the 21000seat stadium was nearly filled 
after mrs chamorro made her way onto the podium using a crutch 
because of a fractured knee she kissed president ortega 
the elegant mrs chamorro dressed all in white contrasted 
sharply with the sporty ortega who wore a shortsleeve shirt in 
blackandwhite sandinista colors 
mrs chamorro became a political icon after her husband pedro 
joaquin chamorro a newspaper editor was assassinated during 
dictator anastasio somozas rule that ended with the 1979 
sandinista revolution 
she and ortega a dedicated revolutionary who led the guerrilla 
war against somoza were both members of the junta that took power 
but she became disenchanted with the sandinistas resigned from the 
junta and became publisher of the family newspaper la prensa 
for years the paper was the leading voice of opposition and was 
shut down on ortegas orders several times

a church proposal to scrap the pugnacious second 
verse of god save the queen and replace it with rhymes about 
brotherly love has drawn some crusty responses 
they range from a worried editorial in the times of london to 
the bizarre spectacle of auberon waugh acidtongued son of the 
novelist evelyn waugh going on television with an offkey 
rendition of his own lyrics 
currently the second verse of the anthem goes 
o lord our god arise scatter her enemies and make them fall 
confound their politics frustrate their knavish tricks on thee 
our hopes we fix god save us all 
some church of england clerics feel such language is 
inappropriate in an age of world brotherhood the churchs 
liturgical commission has proposed a different verse 
nor on this land alone but be gods mercies known from shore 
to shore lord make the nations see that men should brothers be 
and form one family the wide world oer 
clerics point out that the bit about scattering enemies and 
frustrating knavish tricks has fallen into disuse and that the 
proposed substitute itself is more than 150 years old having been 
written in 1836 by a london shoemaker 
there is no authorized version of god save the queen and 
the commissions proposal applies only to the singing of the anthem 
at war memorial services 
a government information sheet notes that nowadays it is usual 
on official occasions to sing the first verse only 
the anthem is not universally loved 
the words are atrocious and the tune is worse wrote peter 
mckay in the evening standard last month 
but it is a powerful national symbol capable just by its 
opening drum roll of bringing a stadium full of people to attention 
it is maybe a poorish thing musically but it is our own and 
on the whole we like it wrote margot lawrence in the daily 
telegraph 
to some conservatives the proposed change is just one more 
attempt by the clergy to confuse redblooded english folk with 
wishywashy sentiments about peace and brotherhood 
thus when newsnight bbctvs heavyweight nightly news 
program asked for expert advice it got some sardonic responses 
o lord we got it wrong for peace we now must throng so pass 
the cup sang waugh editor of the literary review and 
archdefender of traditional english ways 
ian hislop editor of the satirical magazine private eye 
parodied diplomatic jargon by singing 
o lord our god arise and report our enemies to the united 
nations make them observe treaties so hostilities may cease and 
we all then live in peace with normal diplomatic relations 
on a slightly more serious note the times warned britain 
built an empire whistling this tune which remains a reassuring 
part of its heritage like brown boots chestnut trees and summer 
rain critics tamper with it at their peril 
first performed in 1745 as a riposte to the jacobite rebels the 
anthems melody was picked up at various times all over europe 
as well as the united states where it became my country tis of 
thee 
haydn beethoven and brahms used the melody in compositions 
poets from shelley onward promoted alternative lyrics all 
failed except a london shoemaker named william hickson who in 
1836 penned the brotherly love verse 
robin brookes consultant to the liturgical commission said in 
an interview that while the panel did not explain its reasons for 
favoring the hickson verse it is clear that they dont regard 
national sentiment as being sufficient in this world and that 
there ought to be an international flavor 
brookes maintained that the fuss was contrived by newspapers 
to excite the conservative instincts most of us have 
most of the protest has appeared in the letters columns of the 
times 
a h atkins wrote in to argue that the existing lyrics 
represent an outspoken and truly british sentiment 
noel brandonjones asked the commission to explain how god is 
to save the queen without frustrating the knavish tricks of her 
enemies both at home and abroad

the fear of fire has gripped this city 
after a series of blazes that left at least 11 people dead and 
25000 homeless 
on wednesday 4000 makeshift homes in three shantytowns on the 
northwestern outskirts of the capital were destroyed in a fire 
officials said 
hundreds of poor men women and children wailing and pleading 
for food stopped traffic and stoned cars saying relief efforts 
were inadequate 
on tuesday fire engulfed 5000 straw and mud huts in the 
northeastern district on monday 3000 shacks were consumed by 
flames in the center of the city and 11 people were killed 
last week fires destroyed 600 shops and new delhis only 
convention center 
fires are common in northern india during the hot dry summer 
when a spark from an unextinguised match can spawn an inferno 
within minutes the latest outbreak is worse than usual but 
investigators say they have found no evidence of foul play 
at least 25000 people have been rendered homeless by the 
fires said ak sharma a social worker look at that he 
said pointing to row after row of burned huts in the motia khan 
area they were once homes 
sharma said no government relief has been forthcoming only 
the political parties are running a limited show of relief he 
said 
israr ahmed a spokesmen for the city government denied the 
government is not helping the fire victims 
we are providing clean drinking water bread and milk he 
said 
ahmed said financial compensation would be forthcoming about 
1175 to the next of kin of those who died 175 to the seriously 
injured and 30 for each destroyed hut 
those hardest hit by the fires are residents of the shantytowns 
that have sprung up all over this sprawling city according to 
government statistics 12 million of new delhis 8 million 
residents live in improvised camps of tents and huts fashioned from 
mud straw and cardboard 
the shantytowns have no civic facilities such as running water 
and sewers 
most residents are poor laborers from rural areas who descend on 
new delhi in search of jobs they also provide blocs of votes that 
can determine the fate of elections 
i came to new delhi 15 years ago said ram bilas who lost 
his 10by10 foot hut in the motia khan fire monday bilas and 11 
relatives are now camping outside 
i was given this plot of land five years ago by a politician 
after i promised him all the seven votes in my family bilas 55 
said 
sita ram 35 lost half of his 40 pigs in the fire i had 
invested all my money in the business now half is lost he said 
as he set out to seek leftover food from restaurants for his pigs 
never before have we had so many cases of serious and medium 
fires in one week affecting residential areas a senior fire 
official said on condition of anonymity 
fire officials said there was no indication of arson 
we dont have any evidence yet said another fire official 
also speaking on condition of anonymity apriljune are the peak 
months for fire in northern india but we admit we are swamped this 
time 
the blazes have exposed inadequate firefighting and fire 
prevention facilities 
the delhi fire service has a total of 125 fire engines and 1100 
firefighters who are hard pressed to cover the rapidly expanding 
city 
in addition there are 158 highrise buildings that do not meet 
regulations for such things as fire alarms fire exits and 
sufficient water supplies according to reports published in major 
newspapers half the buildings are owned by the government

the worlds estimated 1 billion moslems 
today celebrate the end of the islamic fast month of ramadan when 
the faithful abstain from food drink and sex from dawntodusk 
gun salvos and prayer calls from minarets echoed throughout the 
persian gulf at twilight wednesday to herald the beginning of eid 
alfitr the feast of the fastbreaking 
but the rejoicing was restrained casting their shadow were such 
regional issues as the protracted rift between saudi arabia and 
iran the plight of the palestinians and the 15yearold civil war 
in lebanon 
sunni moslems the preponderant sect of islam quickly began 
their celebrations after the cresent moon was sighted in saudi 
arabia marking the end of the fast month saudi arabia is home to 
islams holiest shrines at mecca and medina 
it was not clear whether predominantlty shiite iran would ignore 
the call and rely on local authorities for an independent sighting 
shiites make up less than 10 percent of the worlds moslems and 
have generally had poor relations with their sunni neighbors 
in mosques throughout the region worshippers piled plastic 
sheets high with donations of lamb and rice dates coffee pots 
milk puddings and nut pastries 
the food is generally donated to moslems who cannot afford the 
traditional festive meal that ends the fast 
families also exchange a special honey walnut pastry for the 
holiday in some moslem countries preparing the small pastries has 
become a virtual necessity in recent years a number of divorces 
have been recorded when husbands failed to provide money for the 
holiday pastries 
the fast month of ramadan marks the time islamic tradition holds 
that the angel gabriel revealed the moslem holy book the koran to 
the prophet mohammed 14centuries ago

the national park service has banned sales 
at two parks of a poster favoring the return of the wolf to 
yellowstone 
defenders of wildlife a private agency was using proceeds from 
sales of the 25 posters to ease opposition to the animals return 
in montana by compensating ranchers whose calves and sheep are 
killed by wolves 
but the park service saying it was improper for park stores to 
advocate wolf restoration when the issue is being debated in 
congress banned sales of the posters this week at yellowstone and 
at glacier national park in montana 
the posters portray four howling wolves with the legend 
restoring the wolf to yellowstone 
park officials appear to be divided over restoration 
former park service director william penn mott jr strongly 
supported the return of wolves to yellowstone and the parks 
superintendent bob barbee has called the animals the missing 
link in the parks ecosystem but james ridenour who replaced 
mott last summer has said he opposes restoration 
ranchers drove the wolf from yellowstone at the turn of the 
century under the plan being debated in congress about 10 
breeding pairs of wolves would be captured elsewhere and released 
in the park 
ranchers oppose the plan for fear the wolves will attack their 
herds outside the park 
since last fall defenders of wildlife has sold almost 6000 
copies of the poster some at the parks and some by mail said hank 
fischer a leader of the group 
the groups reimbursement fund which holds about 60000 has 
eased ranchers opposition to wolves in montana said fischer the 
fund in the last three years has reimbursed several ranchers whose 
livestock was killed by wolves from canada 
fischer characterized the ban on poster sales as censorship 
mott was really the inspiration behind the program fischer 
said in an interview from his missoula mont office so its 
terribly disappointing to us not to be able to sell this poster in 
the national park 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo who along with sen alan simpson 
rwyo opposes the return of the wolves said he was happy 
defenders of wildlife would no longer be allowed to peddle their 
propaganda in yellowstone

james j secosky a shortsville ny school 
teacher spent a summer of his youth mowing lawns to buy a 20 
telescope so he could spend clear nights gazing heavenward at 
billions of stars 
ana larson a seattle housewife studied astronomy by 
correspondence while raising two children and began to wonder if 
there was intelligent life somewhere out there 
peter j kandefer saw sputnik historys first artificial 
satellite pass overhead in 1957 and then later sighted two comets 
after that i was hooked on astronomy he said 
now they are in the group of five amateur astronomers who will 
be given viewing time on the hubble space telescope a 15 
billion orbiting instrument that may give the best look ever of the 
universe 
this is absolutely unprecedented said kandefer 43 a new 
hartford conn electrical engineer amateurs just never get 
access to university telescopes to do study of their own there is 
just too much demand on that equipment from the professionals 
but riccardo giacconi director of the space telescope science 
institute decided to give amateurs a chance he set aside part of 
his discretionary time on the hubble and invited amateur astronomy 
organizations to select viewing projects proposed by their members 
i expect that amateur astronomers will use the hubble space 
telescope to ask refreshing new questions and that their findings 
will make a real contribution to the advancement of astronomy he 
said 
the hubble telescope was released wednesday from the end of a 
50footlong mechanical arm on the space shuttle discovery 
in addition to kandefer secosky and larson the amateurs 
selected from the hundreds who proposed projects were ray sterner 
of woodbine md and t john hewitt of berkeley calif 
kandefers study target is one of the most commonly seen points 
of light in the sky a star in the handle of the big dipper known 
as hd112185 
the star which is 110 light years away is one of a small group 
of known variable stars these are light sources that vary in 
intensity at set intervals 
it changes in a regular fashion every 59 days and has been 
observed for well over 40 years said kandefer the change so 
slight that it takes instruments to measure may reveal details 
about star composition and formation 
its such a tough star to measure its really beyond the 
capabilities of earthbased telescopes kandefer said but hubble 
will be able to make the observations with 10minute glimpses over 
a fivenight period 
kandefer said the data he will receive will be charts with 
squiggly lines that he then will analyze on his personal computer 
for secosky a 42yearold high school science teacher the 
hubble will focus on a moon of jupiter called io 
io is very interesting because it has active volcanoes and 
lakes of liquid sulfur said secosky 
he hopes to learn why io changes in brightness when it moves in 
and out of the frigid shadow of jupiter the hubble will be looking 
for evidence of frost forming on the moon and will take a series of 
images just as it moves from the shadow into light 
secoskys hubble experiment continues an intellectual adventure 
that started in high school when he mowed lawns at 50 cents an hour 
to earn money for a telescope 
in high school every clear night i was out looking at the 
stars for hours he recalls 
but astronomy remained a hobby secosky earned a masters degree 
in biology has taught high school science for 18 years and is 
raising a family 
ana larson the seattle mother of two started on her own but 
plans to become a professional astronomer 
she first took astronomy by correspondence while raising a son 
and a daughter and now at 42 she hopes to use what she learns 
from the hubble studies for a masters thesis in astronomy 
her interest centers on one of the most fundamental questions of 
astronomy is there life beyond the solar system larsons hubble 
project is to look for planets orbiting other suns in other solar 
systems 
if we can find just a single planet then that leads to the 
idea that yes there is life out there said larson however 
she admits i get this nagging feeling in the back of my mind 
that perhaps we are alone 
the hubble will look for small points of heat about a select 
group of stars larson said the plan is to detect the heat that is 
generated as matter comes together to form planets 
sterner who works at the johns hopkins applied physics 
laboratory in baltimore will focus his study on mysterious arcs of 
light that have been seen in distant galaxy clusters he thinks the 
arcs may be caused by a gravitational effect that bends light as 
does an optical lens 
hewitts project will be conducted only if a star explodes 
sometime during the year after hubble is launched he will be 
looking for a comet cloud that scientists believe forms around all 
stars 
the cloud cannot be seen normally but an exploding star would 
provide a burst of light rather like a flashbulb to illuminate 
the distant wisp of matter

this tranquil himalayan kingdoms capital 
is becoming a sea of violence and hatred and the latest target is 
the police force widely despised for its longtime repression of 
prodemocracy activits 
until a few months ago nepal was known more for its mountains 
tourist resorts and trekking trails than for riots curfews and 
shootings by police 
then came a crescendo of people power police tried to crush it 
and failed in midapril king birendra loosened his grip on 
absolute power and let the longbanned political opposition take 
the reins of government 
a backlash against the old system has been let loose and the 
police are the target 
the prodemocracy activists were harassed so much by the 
police that the hatred became so intense said lok raj baral a 
professor of political science at katmandus tribhuvan university 
the people really hate us like anything a police inspector 
said a steel helmet on his head and a bamboo shield wrapped around 
his body he spoke from the safe side of a locked gate at his 
police station 
on monday mobs captured and beat to death six policemen 
accusing them of belonging to an underground rightwing 
promonarchy group two of the victims were paraded through the 
streets and pummeled for six hours before they died police shot 
back and five civilians were killed 
at least 17 policemen were injured when the marauding crowd 
attacked several police stations 
on wednesday angry policemen chanting blood for blood 
called for revenge at a funeral for some of the officers 
the violence came 2 weeks after police fired on a crowd of 
200000 prodemocracy demonstrators killing scores of people in 
the worst day of violence in nepal in more than a century 
witnesses claimed as many as 200 people died in the april 6 
shootings 
king birendras government maintained that only 10 people died 
but two days later the monarch bowed to demands for democracy and 
ended a 29year ban on political parties a coalition government 
dominated by prodemocracy forces took office april 19 
after mondays riots thousands of police went into hiding the 
mobs had echoed the widespread belief in katmandu that police 
condoned and sometimes joined the rightwing mandale 
underground group 
the mandale was blamed for arson mugging and looting that 
followed the april 19 installation of the new government police 
officials claim the crime rate has not increased significantly 
it is just a psychological fear of the mandale said a 
senior police officer speaking on condition of anonymity 
baral suggested the linking of the police force with the mandale 
was only an excuse to release the pentup violence of 29 years 
the mandale an abbreviated form of nepal vidyarthi mandal or 
nepal students group went underground in 1979 after king birendra 
officially banned it because of its predilection for violence but 
the mandale remain the most hated and feared symbol of the monarchy 
the easiest way of committing suicide in nepal today is to 
proclaim oneself a mandale member baral said 
he said the recent violence against police grew out of 
psychological fear of the mandale and a hatred of police tactics 
the nepalese are becoming more and more violent people are 
getting used to killings their killer instinct has been aroused 
he said 
political demonstrations and overt opposition to the monarchy 
were virtually unknown in nepal after 1961 when birendras father 
king mahendra dismissed the 20monthold democratically elected 
government of the nepali congress party and introduced a partyless 
system of government 
dissent against the system inspired by the political changes in 
eastern europe grew only in the last year 
nepals first mass popular movement was launched feb 18 by the 
nepali congress and the united left front a coalition of leftwing 
parties the two formerly banned groups now dominate the new 
cabinet 
several prodemocracy activists have alleged that they were 
tortured in police detention the methods included being immersed 
in cold water for hours at a time and having pins forced under 
their finger nails they said 
the hatred for police appears to have deep roots they are 
policemen by morning and terrorists by night said taxi driver 
salik ram spitting vehemently out his car window 
meanwhile the government is caught between the deteriorating 
law and order and its inability to use the police with its 
nearzero credibility to control crime

the shell games over teenage mutant ninja 
turtles call off the hunt for red october drive miss daisy 
somewhere else 
here comes the judge to a theater near you 
when the film version of judge edwin torres novel q amp a 
debuts friday a name ordinarily affixed to court orders will be 
splashed across the silver screen 
the movie directed by sidney lumet stars timothy hutton as a 
young prosecutor caught in a web of corruption it is taken from 
one of three books torres wrote in the mid1970s when he was a 
prosecutor 
news of the movie has brought torres much attention and some 
ribbing from colleagues and attorneys one morning he arrived at 
the courthouse carrying a fullpage ad for the movie prompting one 
court officer to say remember i knew you when you were a mere 
mortal 
at 59 the sternfaced slightly graying torres looks like 
central castings idea of a judge in 13 years on the bench he has 
earned a reputation for handing out stiff sentences he said most 
of his cases are career criminals and lost causes 
they gravitate toward me a lot of the heavier cases guys 
with records that boggle the imagination he said with a heavy 
new york accent in a recent interview so what is one to do 
except you know bang em 
torres saw many of his peers go the same route while growing up 
on the crimeridden streets of spanish harlem 
he got out he said thanks to luck and strict parental 
supervision 
my experience is certainly not unique he said plenty of 
guys come out of harlem the south bronx bedstuy 
bedfordstuyvesant an area of brooklyn they just dont make the 
news copy as often as the bad guys do 
sitting with his feet up on a table in the jury room next to his 
courtroom torres described himself as a happygolucky guy 
who after three years in the navy during the korean war toyed 
with the idea of becoming a police officer 
instead at his fathers insistence he enrolled in brooklyn law 
school then joined the manhattan district attorneys office 
torres said he never set out to be a writer either but sat down 
at a desk late one night at his wifes urging after hearing him 
complain about the way hollywood portrayed life on the streets 
she said if you can do it better why dont you do it he 
said 
a dyedinthewool movie devotee torres said i never 
intended to write novels what i thought i was writing were more 
screenplays or screen vehicles 
but he did write three wellreceived novels carlitos way 
q amp a and after hours full of authentic characters culled 
from his youth and his professional experience 
the movie interest came right away he said people like david 
susskind francis ford coppola and al pacino paid to option his 
books but never developed them into films 
i didnt think they ever made movies after a while he said 
i thought they bought options maybe for tax purposes 
two years ago torres dropped off a copy of q amp a with 
lumet known for gritty new york films like serpico dog day 
afternoon and prince of the city 
within a week he immediately jumped on it torres said 
the next thing i knew the thing was in full gear

the heirs of edward steichen a pillar 
of new yorks museum of modern art are battling the museum over an 
800000 painting by matisse that was bequeathed to the 
photographers 6yearold greatgranddaughter 
although steichen and his family have been longtime benefactors 
the museum is refusing to hand over the painting which has been in 
the photography pioneers family since henri matisse gave it to him 
in 1908 
the museum argues the painting loaned to them by steichens 
youngest daughter in 1973 was meant as a permanent gift even 
though kate steichen in her will left the work to her grandniece 
ariana rodina calderone stahmer of pennington nj 
lawyers for the estate contend the museum is waging a war of 
attrition against a modest estate a strategy they say may 
eventually backfire 
who else is going to lend works to the museum of modern art if 
theyre afraid theyll treat loans as gifts asked attorney l 
douglas shrader who filed suit in federal court this month to 
force the museum to relinquish the painting and for 1 million in 
damages in the securities area in which i usually work that 
would be regarded as a fraud 
matisse presented edward steichen with the painting vue de 
collioure a leglise in 1908 to thank him for helping arrange 
the first american exhibition of his works and to commemorate the 
birth of steichens daughter kate 
steichen gave her the painting on her 53rd birthday and she in 
turn loaned it to the museum in 1973 the year her father died she 
also bequeathed the painting to the museum continuing the 
relationship established by her father he had run its photography 
department from 1947 to 1962 and put together a number of 
exhibitions including the widely viewed the family of man 
she had given the museum works by her father works of rodin 
and shes a woman of very modest means shes been very generous to 
that museum because of the steichen family connection shrader 
said why theyre taking this tack with a family thats been so 
good to them over the years is a mystery 
but miss steichen who lived in wilton conn changed her will 
in 1978 and bequeathed the painting to her sister mary calderone 
shrader said miss steichen was upset because the museum had touched 
up a splotch of paint that matisse had apparently put on the 
painting by accident 
her feeling was look if matisse had wanted to clean up this 
blob he would have done it himself shrader said 
miss steichen changed her will again in 1985 leaving the 
painting to her sisters grandchild when miss steichen died in 
1988 the estate contacted the museum to obtain the painting for 
the little girl 
museum officials said they are sorry the relationship with the 
steichen family has soured but contend the work is theirs they say 
they were never told miss steichen had changed her will and only 
learned of the change when she died of cancer in 1988 in the 
meantime they gave up opportunities to acquire other paintings 
from that period 
museum director richard e oldenburg said miss steichen fully 
intended to make the painting a gift citing a 1973 letter to the 
museum in which she thanked god that my little matisse is home 
safe 
as an institution we have to rely on good faith the promises 
that are made to us especially when no one ever tells us about the 
changes said kirk varnedoe museum director of painting and 
sculpture 
arianas mother francesca calderonesteichen said she wants to 
preserve the sense of history that the painting a view of a town 
in southern france represents to the family 
i guess i feel just very strongly its something that went 
from matisse to my grandfather and from my grandfather to my aunt 
and she wanted to pass it on to ariana she said and i feel if 
my aunt wanted to pass it on that was her right 
the painting which arianas parents have said they planned to 
hang in her bedroom remains on display in one of the museums 
galleries 
no hearing date on the lawsuit has been set in federal court in 
new haven

house democratic leaders tout their budget as 
a forwardlooking alternative to president bushs plan but 
conservatives within their party say its equally lacking in 
political courage 
i am angry said conservative rep dave mccurdy dokla as 
the house began debate wednesday on the 12 trillion blueprint for 
fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 it is another example of 
dodging important issues 
the leaders budget would cut 8 billion from the presidents 
3038 billion pentagon spending request for next year and put 
most of that money toward domestic programs such as space aids 
research and education 
it is time we rebuild america restore our economic leadership 
in the world and begin to address unmet needs said budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif principal author of the 
plan 
the house planned today to debate two republican alternatives to 
the democratic plan one a partial freeze on spending at current 
levels and the other to cut red ink through the use of goldbacked 
bonds to refinance the national debt 
final action on the house budget is planned next week house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo said wednesday he was 
confident the leadership plan would prevail 
but mccurdy said he wouldnt count those votes yet with 
republicans unified in their opposition it was possible 
conservative democrats could sink the plan 
but rep charles stenholm dtexas said that while his fellow 
conservatives were frustrated most would stick with the leadership 
in order to move things toward a budget summit with the white house 
panetta conceded more needed to be done to reduce the deficit 
than the 36 billion in claimed savings in his plan but he said 
that without bushs leadership it couldnt pass 
there is a difference between posturing on tough choices and 
getting the institution to adopt tough hard choices he said 
in the senate the budget committee was scheduled today to 
continue work on its version of the budget committee chairman 
james sasser dtenn has been struggling to find consensus among 
his democrats without success 
the budget plan that finally emerges will be the basis for 
individual spending bills for government programs later this year

a popular republican plan to finance the drug 
war with taxdeferred savings bonds is under attack by democrats 
who call it another step away from payasyougo government 
senior democrats on the house ways and means committee 
complained that if the drug war is so important republicans should 
be willing to raise taxes to pay for it rather than passing the 
cost to future generations through borrowing 
theres another addiction occurring in this country an 
addiction to debt rep byron dorgan dnd said wednesday as 
the committee heard testimony on the drugbonds bill 
if the war on drugs the education deficit we have the war on 
crime are truly national priorities we should be honest and pay 
for them said rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
committee 
rep jerry lewis rcalif chief sponsor of the bonds bill 
defended it as a practical way to get americans especially school 
children directly involved in fighting drugs 
as important as it is to reduce the budget deficit lewis said 
the no 1 priority way ahead of anything else is drugs 
lewis bill cosponsored by 249 of the 435 house members would 
authorize the treasury department to issue up to 4 billion in 
savings bonds as with present savings bonds taxation of interest 
could be delayed until they were redeemed the bonds would pay for 
education building prisons and other antidrug programs 
a key part of the proposal would allow children to save their 
nickels and dimes to buy 25cent savings stamps a filled stamp 
book could be exchanged for a savings bond in much the same way 
that americans helped finance world war ii 
isnt it better to interest students in fighting drug abuse 
and saving for their future in the second grade before they are 
hooked by crack in the sixth grade lewis asked 
rep charles rangel dny who chairs the house committee on 
narcotics abuse and control questioned whether we should be 
borrowing from our children to teach them the dangers of drugs 
when many of the most vulnerable children are the poorest 
endorsing the bill were representatives from the elks and the 
general federation of womens clubs so did television cop dennis 
franz of hill street blues and nasty boys 
the national beer wholesalers association announced its support 
and pledged to buy the first 100000 in bonds 
roger chapin president of citizens for a drugfree america and 
an author of the bond proposal said the nation does not want a 
protracted statefederal battle over who should command the drug 
war 
the fact is that we taxpayers are going to wind up paying the 
bill in any case and we dont much care what portion comes out of 
our right pocket to pay the irs or out of our left pocket to pay 
the states he said 
rep fortney stark dcalif contended the bond bill is part of 
a larger plan by some republicans and conservatives to force 
sterilization of drugaddicted mothers and set up nazilike 
prison camps where guards can beat some sense into offenders 
lewis denied any such intent however chapin recommended the 
bonds be used for a demonstration workstudy boot camp that 
would not only shake up young adult offenders but more 
importantly shape them up with the education and skills necessary 
to a productive troublefree life 
the treasury department spoke against the bill as it does 
against most proposals to issue bonds for special projects

the united states could have its smallest army 
since 1940 if troop cuts under study by top army officials are 
enacted 
army secretary michael stone says some onethird of the armys 
soldiers could be removed from the ranks over the next five or six 
years if budget pressures continue 
we think the army is going to come down somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 200000 to 250000 people from a baseline of 
750000 activeduty soldiers stone told a pentagonsponsored 
panel this week 
stressing that defense secretary dick cheney hadnt made the 
final decisions stone said such cuts would mean that the army is 
going to be something around onethird lower than it is today in 
force structure by the time that we get to 1995 to 1996 
stone made the comments in a speech monday evening to the 
defense advisory committee on women in the services a tape of his 
remarks was made available by the army 
the army has the largest segment of the nations 
21millionstrong military force and thus is the biggest target 
for possible budget savings 
army officials acknowledge that they are being forced to look to 
personnel cuts to salvage money for training and other accounts 
that would leave them with a smaller but what they believe will be 
an effective fighting force 
telling his audience there are three stages of force reduction 
that were looking at stone described proposals army officials 
have been mulling over in response to budget pressures and the 
apparent lessened soviet threat 
in response to a request last year from cheney the army made 
plans in its current budget to cut about 135000 troops by 1994 
stone said 
additional cutbacks are being reviewed to strip an additional 
50000 from the army in a secondstage cutback he said the 
decisions will be made in the next few months as cheney reviews 
the military services fiveyear budget plans 
pentagon sources reported two weeks ago that the army was 
planning such cuts which would bring the army to a low of 580000 
troops by oct 1 1996 the beginning of the 1997 fiscal year 
at the end of january the defense departments count of 
soldiers stood at 760818 and the preliminary headcount for the 
end of february was 755164 
there were 269023 people in the army in 1940 the number 
skyrocketed to 82 million in 1945 at the end of world war ii and 
dropped to 554030 by 1948 
there were 780000 people in the army in 1986 stone said 
adding weve come down a fair chunk in a short time 
the cutbacks he said are coming at a time when the threat is 
uncertain all we know is there is a lot of uncertainty 
stone said the discussion of the troubles afflicting the soviet 
economy reminds him of what happened in germany in the early 
1930s when out of the economic chaos arose somebody weve 
learned a great deal about mr hitler 
instability can produce some things that are pretty difficult 
to handle he said

the government could close banks convicted of 
moneylaundering under a houseapproved bill that critics contend 
still leaves a giant loophole for drug kingpins to hide their 
illicit earnings 
on a 4060 vote wednesday the house approved a bill that for 
the first time would let regulators revoke the charters and 
deposit insurance of banks and savings and loan institutions 
convicted of moneylaundering 
however under intense opposition from the bush administration 
the federal reserve and the banking industry the house refused to 
take the first step toward making banks keep detailed records on 
the source and destination of wire transfers through which most 
drug profits are funneled 
the house defeated 283127 an amendment by rep esteban 
torres dcalif to establish a pilot program in drug center 
cities that would require banks to keep records of the names 
addresses and account numbers of parties on both sides of a wire 
transfer 
opponents of the amendment including most members of the house 
banking committee contended it would impose a burdensome new 
recordkeeping requirement on banks and thrift institutions 
a misstep here could cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
said rep doug barnard dga while very wellmeaning this 
amendment is overkill 
barnard a former banker said the amendment could lead to 
adding a 10 to 15 paperwork cost to each of the 100 million wire 
transfers handled by us financial institutions annually 
supporters of the amendment however contended the bill is a 
bucket without a bottom for snaring launderers of drug money if 
there is no way to trace the source and destination of wire 
transfers 
i hope we come to the day sometime when all of us are against 
the drug traffickers more rather than concerned about how much of a 
burden were placing on our banking friends said rep charles 
rangel dny chairman of the house select committee on narcotics 
if you dont think the banking industry doesnt know what 
these drug traffickers are doing and are not making a big profit 
off of it youre putting us on rangel said 
the bill is aimed at addressing the 110 billion in us cash 
drug transactions that the treasury department estimates are 
laundered through the world financial system every year despite 
laws to thwart it 
we put the street dealer in jail and we put the drug kingpin 
in the penitentiary but no one has found a way to imprison a 
bank said the bills chief author rep frank annunzio dill 
when you consider that a moneylaunderer can earn 10000 
laundering just a single days take for a drug dealer you realize 
just how inadequate mere fines are he said the provisions 
hold out the death penalty for any financial institution convicted 
of moneylaundering 
as originally introduced the house bill would have required 
regulators to lift the charter and deposit insurance of banks 
convicted of moneylaundering because of opposition from the 
administration and the bank and thrift lobbies it was weakened in 
the house banking committees financial institutions subcommittee 
however the bill does mandate hearings on revoking the charter 
and deposit insurance of a bank or sampl within 30 days after the 
institution and two or more of its senior officers are convicted of 
moneylaundering 
in the hearings regulators would have to consider the extent of 
involvement in moneylaundering by senior managers of the bank or 
sampl the institutions cooperation with law enforcement officials 
and steps it had taken to prevent the practice 
in addition the bill would prohibit anyone convicted of 
moneylaundering from working in a financial institution again and 
would raise from 500 to 5000 the possible fines for civil 
violations 
similar legislation in the senate is awaiting action by the 
senate banking committee

through the magic of amendments president bushs 870 million 
aid request for nicaragua and panama has multiplied along its route 
to the senate which begins debate on the measure today 
the addons include such items as 
185 million to build an automated fingerprint identification 
laboratory planned in clarksburg wva the home state of 
appropriations committee chairman robert c byrd dwva 
74 million to cover increased court expenses in florida 
georgia and alabama which have handled not only noriegas case but 
an influx of other extradited drug suspects noriega is awaiting 
trial in miami 
8 million for the agriculture department to combat 
grasshoppers in the state of committee member quentin burdick 
dnd as well as in south dakota and minnesota 
an order for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration to begin building a fish farming experimental 
laboratory at stuttgart ark sen dale bumpers dark is a 
member of the appropriations panel 
supplemental appropriations bills regarded as mustpass 
measures because they are requested by the president each year 
become vehicles for pet projects of lawmakers 
the bill began as an 870 million request from bush to pay for 
three items not envisioned in the 1990 budget 300 million in aid 
for nicaragua 500 million for panama and 70 million for refugee 
programs 
when the house took it up the measure grew to 24 billion with 
the addition of disaster relief for flooding in the southeast 
house appropriations chairman jamie whitten is a mississippi 
democrat lowincome energy assistance for the northeast senior 
committee republican silvio conte is from massachusetts money for 
veterans health care and pensions food stamps and forest service 
firefighting 
there was no controversy over the 300 million for newly 
democratic nicaragua but other congressional initiatives were 
causing headaches at the white house 
a fight appeared certain for example over language added by 
sen brock adams dwash that would allow the district of 
columbia to use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women 
bush vetoed other bills twice last year that contained similar 
abortion language and administration budget director richard 
darman said it was virtually certain the president would do the 
same thing again unless the provision is dropped or changed 
after winning senate approval the bill still faces a 
housesenate conference to work out differences between competing 
versions before it is sent to the white house 
among other congressional riders added to the bill were 
a directive that the department of veterans affairs stick to 
the schedule for building an addition to its medical center in 
huntington wva rather than delaying construction as the 
department has proposed 
78 million to monitor volcanic eruptions at mount redoubt 
near anchorage alaska the state of sen ted stevens a republican 
member of the appropriations committee 
the transfer of a 112foot coast guard ship the agile from 
beaumont texas to the government of american samoa to provide 
transportation among the samoan islands 
238 million to build an army explosives plant in louisiana 
the state of democratic committee member j bennett johnston the 
house had sought to eliminate money for the plant 
a special reduced interest rate for israel for 400 million in 
us loan guarantees to build housing for jewish immigrants from 
the soviet union the move sponsored by sens patrick leahy 
dvt and robert kasten rwis could save israel more than 25 
million in loanservicing costs over the 30year life of the loan 
in both its house and senate versions the bill was being 
largely financed through cuts or transfers from the pentagons 1990 
budget the senate bill claimed 28 billion in defense savings 1 
billion more than the house

ethnic dissension and mass defections of 
junior officers threaten to undermine the soviet military private 
us analysts say in a view that strengthens the cia downgrading of 
any soviet threat to the west 
the soviet military is not growing leaner and meaner and its 
not on the road to growing leaner and meaner stephen meyer of 
the massachusetts institute of technology told the house armed 
services committee on wednesday 
meyer and john hines of the rand corp provided a grim picture 
of a soviet military plagued by public criticism limited support 
from president mikhail s gorbachev and even a significant number 
of troops unable to speak russian 
the testimony follows us intelligence reports predicting 
continuing instability of the broader soviet economy despite 
gorbachevs efforts to institute reforms 
elsewhere on capitol hill a soviet legislator said that if his 
government fails to take immediate steps to fix the economy the 
system will collapse and spawn widespread discontent 
vladimir tikhonov an agricultural economist who is also a 
member of his countrys congress of peoples deputies told the 
joint economic committee that the soviet economy is extremely 
ill 
last weeks joint ciadefense intelligence agency report said 
the soviets cut military spending 4 percent to 5 percent last year 
strengthening the position of those in congress calling for bigger 
us defense cuts in response to changes in the soviet union and 
eastern europe 
members of congress including rep les aspin dwis chairman 
of the house armed services committee point to the recent reports 
and cia director william websters testimony as a clear argument 
for further reductions in us military spending 
aspin asked the analysts whether the soviet military could 
launch an offensive outside its borders 
they would respond but it would take a great deal of time it 
would be a relatively ineffective force and potentially one that i 
think any serious commander would not want to take into offensive 
operation hines replied 
problems for the military include the attitude of gorbachev who 
despite pleas from military officials approved student deferments 
from the armed forces 
the gorbachev regime has a deaf ear to the military meyer 
said 
the military leadership is alienated from soviet society blamed 
for the war in afghanistan and the widespread economic problems 
that plague the country he said 
in addition people in the military get paid less than the 
industrial wage work seven days a week and according to recent 
soviet statistics 170000 officers and their families are without 
housing 
complicating the militarys problems is the division between 
senior and junior officers many of the latter have sided with 
civilian reformers and joined informal ethnic groups meyer said 
about 40 percent of the soviet military are nonrussians or 
nonslavics and between 10 percent and 30 percent of them do not 
speak russian he said 
in one instance hines said a soviet commander complained that 
in his unit attached to a landbased nuclear missile project only 
two of the 40 azerbaijanis spoke russian 
the soviet ministry of defense has released figures showing 40 
percent to 70 percent of disciplinary violence is tied to 
nationalism 
the result is a mass exodus of junior officers from the 
military even under substantial economic loss to themselves said 
meyer who noted military personnel have to sign documents claiming 
they are mentally deficient or criminals to gain their release 
in addition education standards have dropped for the military 
as shown by a sharp increase in the number of accidents and deaths 
among troops using military equipment meyer said

house speaker thomas s foley said he 
supports president bushs decision not to impose sanctions against 
the soviet union for blockading lithuania 
it might be more difficult for gorbachev to negotiate a 
peaceful solution if sanctions were imposed because that might be 
seen as yielding to united states pressure foley said 
the democrat made his remarks wednesday in response to questions 
following an address to the 104th annual convention of the american 
newspaper publishers association 
foleys speech to the publishers focused on the need to turn 
from emphasis on defense to the crucial issues of education health 
care the environment and the deficit 
he faulted bush for failing to use his immense public popularity 
to impress on americans the need to meet these domestic challenges 
the president is presently popular he said but the 
president needs to engage that popularity more and challenge the 
country and the congress 
he added i understand the presidents reluctance to address 
the problem of the deficit without a relaxation of his position on 
taxes 
he drew laughter and some applause when he paraphrased george 
bernard shaw and said there are two types of sins in american 
politics some are committed by politicians who dont keep their 
campaign promises but some more mortal sins are committed by 
politicians who keep their campaign promises 
he was referring to bushs campaign promise not to impose new 
taxes 
foley pinpointed education as the nations greatest crisis 
our effectiveness will not be calibrated on how many missiles 
we have and how many silos but how our primary classrooms are 
performing he said 
foley said us students in primary and high schools 
consistently perform 12th to last in international scholastic 
competitions 
higher education is not where the problem is he said 
primary and secondary education is 
in response to a question he said the imbalance of trade with 
japan is partially a problem of our own making and he blamed 
poor education for leading to poor productivity by american 
companies seeking to compete with japan 
he said that even if japan agreed to a totally open market we 
would still have a very substantial trade deficit with japan

of bright amp blue birds amp the gala sun is a 
fulllength dance that paul taylor choreographed for the paul 
taylor dance companys 35th season 
program notes say its an allegory 
its stunningly choreographed and danced even for a viewer who 
has to guess at the allegory part 
the dance performed for the first time on wednesday at the city 
center is taylors third fullevening work 
the music most of it melodic was composed by donald york its 
often reminiscent of the first part of coplands appalachian 
spring sometimes it sounds like a movie score behind a scene of 
spring sunshine 
elie chaib stands at the top of two steps with reeds at each 
side at the beginning dancers there are 18 in light green 
khaki and tan enter and do an ebullient dance the women wear 
split skirts over leotards of the same color a curtain falls and 
dancing in front of it is charming to lyrical music when the 
whole stage is seen again dancers in more modern dress seem to be 
in a disco dancing to a jazzy beat 
then for a long time everybody dances as though demented arms 
and legs flail fast jumps are done with a grand twitch women 
pursue men kicking out 
act 1 ends on a calm note 
in act 2 people in front of a curtain are trying to get through 
to people seen behind it this may be todays generation reaching 
back to the previous 
in the next scene dancers are in shiny leotards which may 
indicate the future now the steps where chaib stands seem a 
throne where he observes his people dance 
later as he dancers walk by twos between the reeds we could be 
seeing the portal to adult life act 2 also ends serenely 
last week taylor premiered a funny ballet the sorcerers 
sofa a takeoff on psychiatry the couch a chaste lounge 
danced on her toes by mary cochran in quilted blue holding a 
matching bolster pillow has more sense than the pyschiatrist 
a timid young client thomas patrick lies down on the couch and 
tells christopher gillis in long gray beard his problem 
the demon within sandra stone in red with spikey red hair 
appears in the room instead of the psychiatrist exorcising her 
her duplication francie huber appears 
then seven dancers called a lot more duplications arrive 
the couch bops the psychiatrist lies down on the patient and is 
ready to take over 
the demons do a kick line but their days are numbered 
the company will be at the city center through may 13

the census tries to overcome a deluge of 
criticism today returning to its roots to count americans door to 
door 
workers will hit the streets in more than 100 cities seeking to 
find and count the more than one in three households that hasnt 
been heard from yet 
the count got under way in march with the mailing of more than 
95 million questionnaires 
but mistakes in addressing meant that millions of people failed 
to get forms and millions more havent mailed theirs back the 
problems including large apartment buildings and whole blocks and 
small towns seemingly overlooked have drawn heavy criticism for 
the census bureau 
now things are moving into the next stage as census workers 
known as enumerators begin marching door to door 
in the last few decades the system of mailing out census 
questionnaires and asking people to send them back has become 
common practice it replaced the traditional but laborintensive 
process of having someone visit every home 
now the doortodoor count is reserved only for sparsely 
populated areas and for followup on people who dont answer by 
mail 
original plans had anticipated that about 70 percent of 
households would mail back their forms so far only 63 percent 
have responded and the low return rate means more hiring and more 
costs 
originally expected to cost 13 billion this year the price of 
counting americans could well increase by 150 million or more 
according to congressional sources 
in addition to problems in the mail portion of the count a 
coalition of cities and interest groups has filed suit against the 
census bureau contending that minorities are being undercounted 
and seeking to force a statistical adjustment of the final figures 
the work getting under way today covers more than 100 
metropolitan areas nationwide trying to track down people who 
either didnt get a census form or failed to mail theirs back 
individual counting expands to an additional 300 smaller 
communities on may 3 census officials report 
in rural areas that were not included in the mail portion of the 
count personal visits by census takers have been going on since 
march 
the official workers can be identified by their red white and 
blue identification badges and satchels the census bureau reported 
although the housetohouse count is now starting government 
officials continue to encourage americans to mail back forms if 
they have not done so 
counting americans on their doorsteps will continue at least 
through june and longer if needed officials said

stonefaced dallas cowboys coach tom landry was 
the closest thing to the sphinx ever seen in giants stadium until 
now 
a 55foot replica of the egyptian wonder is coming to new jersey 
in june for a spectacular 7 million production of the opera 
aida 
while most operas arent over til the fat lady sings this one 
wont be done until 1200 cast members a 100piece orchestra a 
menagerie of exotic animals and the eightton sphinx are paraded 
through giants stadium for two nights 
promoters are hoping for 39000 people each night for the june 
12 shows not including jimmy hoffa the exteamsters boss 
allegedly buried in one end zone 
the promoters are also aware that a stadium off the new jersey 
turnpike deep in the heart of bruce springsteen country is not 
the usual spot for a musical work that premiered 119 years ago in 
cairo 
so theyre going for the hard sell sending costumed egyptian 
wannabes to shopping malls in an effort to plug the show ads in 
the local media proclaim think sphinx while ad copy trumpets 
the opera spectacular 
twenty new jersey malls were targeted for the blitz with folks 
dressed as aida radames egyptian soldiers and high priests 
spreading out from a midtown manhattan motel and heading into the 
garden state 
giants stadium is the latest stop for the opera which is billed 
as the biggest production of any opera ever aida has played 
in montreal sydney melbourne vancouver tokyo and toronto in the 
past two years in japan 102000 people attended 
but aida is more than an opera said tony attanasio who has 
been training the mall roamers verdi wrote his grand opera with 
jugglers animals and dancers designed for grandscale popular 
entertainment the publicist said 
maestro giuseppe raffa who is directing the production said 
opera is for the people rather than the privileged few 
attanasio said auditions for the operas 500 extras bear the 
maestro out 
in australia we had the president of the government the 
president of the largest company two olympic medal winners 
everybody tried out nobody has special privilege attanasio said 
everybody has in the back of his head the dream of being in 
show business once in his life 
casting for many of the giants stadium extras has already been 
held at sleepy hollow high school in tarrytown ny everyone 
chosen gets two 35 seats tickets also are sold at 50 and 75 
a sweatshirt and an invite to the cast party 
a may 5 audition for 200 soldiers will be held in central park 
raffa 38 got the idea for the traveling spectacular after 
watching italian film director mauro bolognini direct aida in 
giza egypt with the real sphinx and pyramids in the background 
the 1987 show inspired him to put together the financing and 
hire bolognini the set producer and the costume designer 
the traveling aida had to build sand dunes pyramids the 
nile and a sphinx they went the real thing one better putting 
motors and drivers inside the 55foot eightton replica sphinx and 
letting it split and show its profile on each side of the stage 
during the triumphal entry scene 
after giants stadium aida will play the los angeles 
memorial coliseum june 29 and 30 san francisco in midjuly and 
possibly washington dc in september grace bumbry of the united 
states will sing aida bruno sebastian of italy will sing radames 
and ruza baldani of yugoslavia will sing amneris 
a giant screen on each side of the stage will show closeups and 
the words in english a 1 million amplification system has been 
built in holland 
but the aida production will not bring the only sphinx to 
giants stadium this summer the rock band kiss is coming to town in 
the summer and their stage show will feature a towering version of 
the egyptian monument too one with an attitude promised kiss 
vocalist paul stanley 
ours is going to talk and it hates opera stanley said

an experimental aircraft the pentagon wants to 
abandon is being touted as the passenger plane of the future 
welcome to the dawn of a new age in aviation said house 
aviation subcommittee chairman rep james oberstar dminn after 
he arranged for a xv15 tiltrotor aircraft to swoop down and land 
alongside the us capitol on wednesday sending spectators 
scurrying up the steps 
the defense department has spent 2 billion to develop the xv15 
and its successor the v22 osprey for military use but defense 
secretary dick cheney wants to end funding in favor of conventional 
helicopter development 
the xv15 and the osprey land like helicopters but fly at up to 
340 mph as fixedwing airplanes much faster than a helicopter 
large rotors on the ends of the wings tilt up for vertical flight 
and rotate forward for the long haul 
two xv15s were made pentagon contracts call for six ospreys 
two of which have been delivered by a partnership between bell 
helicopter textron inc and boeing helicopter 
oberstar told his public works subcommittee it took everything 
but a papal decree to allow the 12yearold plane landing rights at 
the capitol looking like a giant insect out of a science fiction 
movie the xv15 went through a series of maneuvers a few yards 
from the capitol 
this is the most significant contribution to civilian aviation 
since the dawn of the jet age oberstar told reporters on the 
capitol lawn 
both democratic and republican subcommittee members blasted the 
fact that the pentagon wants to stop funding the osprey 
the marines sought the tiltrotor for use as an assault 
transport to carry 24 troops or weapons and supplies from ship to 
beachhead in amphibious landings but the defense department argues 
that helicopters already are doing the job and money for the osprey 
can be better used elsewhere in an era of budget cuts 
committee members showed nearly unanimous support for 
development of the osprey as a passenger plane to serve 
spacestarved cities and rural communities without conventional 
airports they also praised its potential for use in rescues drug 
interdiction and oil spill cleanup 
of 14 committee members at the hearing only rep john j 
duncan rtenn raised a negative note asking why if the plane 
has such great potential isnt private industry funding its 
development 
supporters said it often is necessary for expensive new aircraft 
to begin as military hardware 
rep peter defazio a liberal democrat from oregon brought 
applause at the hearing when he said i can count on less than 
one hand the new military weapons systems i will support but this 
is one of them 
rep curt weldon rpa carrying a boxed plastic model of the 
plane said the japanese and europeans will build a similar 
aircraft and sell it to us airlines if the united states doesnt 
move ahead with the technology 
he noted that his plastic version was made in korea and said 
let the koreans and the japanese build the model well build the 
real thing 
joseph del balzo faa systems development chief said the 
japanese are working on a tiltwing aircraft possibly to be built 
in texas but likely would be interested in taking up the 
tiltrotor technology if the united states abandons it 
a group of european countries also is working on a project to 
build a similar plane he said and soviet aviation officials have 
shown some interest

president bush can discontinue twicedaily 
treatment with eye drops even though he has a mild form of 
glaucoma the white house says after getting a second opinion on 
the presidents eyes 
dr burton lee the white house physician made the announcement 
after bush was examined by two glaucoma specialists during an 
hourlong visit to bethesda naval medical center on wednesday 
lee said the examination confirmed the finding made by other 
doctors during bushs annual checkup at the hospital april 12 that 
the president has one type of early glaucoma 
extensive testing of the eye including detailed photographs 
once again revealed no abnormalities and no visual loss the 
white house doctor said it was decided to stop the betagan eye 
drops and follow him closely for now on no treatment 
after the physical exam bush began using the medicine every 12 
hours his doctors said he would need to take it for the rest of 
his life 
the examination wednesday was conducted by dr richard brubaker 
of the mayo clinic in rochester minn and dr harry quigley of 
johns hopkins hospital in baltimore 
it was the experts opinion that the medication was not 
warranted said stephen hart a deputy white house press 
secretary he said bush had suffered no side effects from the 
medication 
hart said the decision to take the president off the medication 
was just simply a difference of opinion with the other doctors 
there is no progression or regression in the glaucoma he said 
there is no change in his eyes 
bush wore dark glasses as he emerged from the hospital and 
flashed a thumbsup sign to reporters as he was driven past them in 
his limousine 
lees statement said the physical findings were reviewed by 
the consultants and the diagnosis of exfoliation syndrome was 
confirmed with slightly increased intraocular pressure noted again 
in the left eye one type of early glaucoma 
the april 12 examination was conducted by lee assisted by 
several staff doctors at bethesda including capt ralph sawyer an 
ophthalmologist

sen bob kerrey dneb says he resents bush 
administration criticism of his call for a multiyear commodities 
support program in the 1990 farm bill 
we have followed the administrations guidelines to develop a 
specific piece of legislation kerrey said wednesday 
despite his junior status kerrey has taken the lead in the 
senate agriculture committee on the commodities section of the farm 
bill but finds himself at odds with another nebraskan agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter 
president bush on tuesday dismissed kerreys contention that a 
farm crisis could occur if the government doesnt provide 12 
billion annually for five years to support program crops wheat 
corn rice soybeans and cotton 
yeutter who appeared with bush at a convention of farm 
journalists said congress should realize that besides subsidies 
theres a market out there that can support farmers 
i really resent the agriculture secretarys continued 
statements to the public that we dont understand the markets out 
there said kerrey im alarmed at the rhetoric thats coming 
back from the administration 
the administration has said that no more than 102 billion 
should be spent on the commodities programs in fiscal 1991 and the 
government should wait for the outcome of international trade talks 
before determining levels for the next four years of the farm bill 
but kerrey said a wellfinanced farm program will save the 
government money in the long run 
i fully confess that part of my concern is based on having 
gone through this while i was governor said kerrey who served 
as nebraskas chief executive from 198286 
i remember very vividly what can happen when the government 
says we are going to put together a farm bill based on budget 
only he said in reference to cuts devised by david stockman who 
was president reagans budget director in the first years of that 
administration 
it ended up being most expensive and destructive kerrey 
said if you only keep the budget number down and dont 
understand that the program has a purpose there is trouble 
we understand there is limitation on what we can spend he 
said we have attempted to do that 
the senate committee has not acted on kerreys bill although 
six of the 19 members are cosponsors 
in the house a new spending package announced last week by 
budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif would hold 
spending on commodity programs to 98 billion in the next fiscal 
year 
the house agriculture subcommittee working on the commodities 
section of the farm bill has been trying for weeks to come up with 
a plan that satisfies budget writers

president bushs decision to let nicaragua 
sell its sugar to the united states will aid that countrys 
economy but more importantly to food makers it also will help 
cut sugar prices here 
the united states badly needed the sugar ken arnold of the 
sweetener users association said wednesday after the administration 
announced it would buy more sugar from 40 countries including 
nicaragua for the first time since 1985 
us manufacturers of sweets have been pressuring the bush 
administration to open the doors to more foreign sugar because a 
domestic shortage was causing prices to rise 
the sweetener users association is pleased that usda raised 
the quota level by the amount we had requested said thomas 
hammer president of the association 
the announcement from the agriculture department coincided with 
vice president dan quayles visit to nicaragua for the transfer of 
power from the sandinistas to the new president violeta chamorro 
luther markwart chairman of the american sugar alliance said 
the only way the administration could give nicaragua back its quota 
was to increase the total amount allowed into the united states 
from other countries 
there was no way they could take quotas away from other 
countries he said the administration does use the sugar 
program as foreign policy 
markwart who represents american sugar cane and sugar beet 
producers said consumers may see sugar prices at the supermarket 
drop a penny or two as a result of the quota increases 
the only countries on usdas list that were not told they could 
increase sales in the united states were el salvador costa rica 
and honduras which were given most of nicaraguas quota in 1983 
when the reagan administration began cutting back on trade with 
managua 
the action wednesday allows nicaragua to export 54328 metric 
tons of sugar to the united states making it the tenthlargest 
foreign supplier 
the highest quotas go to the dominican republic at 460997 tons 
the philippines at 413850 brazil 379798 and australia 217401 
about 17 percent of the sugar used in the united states comes 
from other countries 
this is the fourth time in the past eight months that usda has 
increased the sugar import quota level in response to market 
conditions previous increases were made on sept 12 nov 24 and 
jan 16 
arnold said the government uses the foreign quotas as a 
spigot that it turns on and off to stabilize sugar prices 
if there is a shortage in domestic production the government 
increases the flow of foreign sugar to keep prices from getting too 
high if there is an oversupply the government can limit quotas 
what we pay attention to specifically are the raw prices of 
sugar said arnold market stabilization price is the price the 
government wants the price of sugar to be at 
the price of sugar has been running a couple cents above the 
market stabilization price thats the first thing that sets 
sweetener users off that something is wrong here 
then the other thing we look at is wholesale refined prices 
those prices had been rising rather dramatically over the last 
couple of months

two weeks after a crowd of 1500 attended aids 
victim ryan whites funeral in indianapolis his mother was 
fighting for his memory just as she had fought for his right to be 
treated like any other child 
i think its made a big impact me being here jeanne white 
42 said wednesday after a round of meetings with senators to drum 
up more sponsors for an emergency bill providing 600 million to 
fight aids 
i think its different to have something on a piece of paper 
than to meet the people in real life and to see the tragedy and 
everything this disease has she said in an interview 
mrs white was continuing her round of quickly scheduled 
meetings today the fresh memory of her sons lingering illness 
made it possible for her to gain appointments that others must wait 
for weeks to obtain 
keeping busy has helped ease the grief for mrs white whose 
sons death called attention to the indiscriminate way in which 
aids strikes ryan was a hemophiliac who contracted the fatal 
disease through contaminated blood products when he was 13 he was 
18 when he died april 8 
the disease is spread through sexual intercourse blood 
transfusions and cuts or punctures with infected objects 
including hypodermic needles and scalpels infected women can pass 
the disease along to their unborn children 
the disease has struck mostly homosexual men and intravenous 
drug users but mrs white said any family is vulnerable to the 
tragedy 
it can be your brother your sister your mother your 
father she said it could be a loved one a friend its 
eventually going to hit everybody 
i think aids is here to stay she said i think that 
because we would all have to quit having sex completely i think 
thats the main issue 
the bill mrs white is lobbying for was passed 160 on april 4 
by the senate labor and human resources committee ryan was in the 
hospital in critical condition at the time and the senators 
dedicated the bill to him 
the bill cosponsored by sens edward m kennedy dmass and 
orrin hatch rutah would provide 600 million a year for the next 
two years in emergency assistance 
ryan had hoped a cure could be found in his lifetime and was 
just very disappointed that so few resources were devoted to 
fighting the disease mrs white said 
although refraining from direct criticism of the reagan and bush 
administrations she said 
ryan met ronald and nancy reagan a week before he died and i 
felt like ryan made a very emotional impact on them and i think 
had they maybe met him four years ago or three years ago i think 
they would have related more to the issue of aids it seems there 
wasnt anybody who met ryan who didnt love him 
among those are the celebrities such as pop singers elton john 
and michael jackson who had befriended ryan years before attending 
his funeral she said television star phil donahue and his wife 
actress marlo thomas invited mrs white to their house after the 
funeral for a few days respite 
none of them was just a onetime deal she said nobody 
did it just for attention or publicity

the social democrats candidate for 
chancellor was in serious condition today after a woman stabbed him 
in the neck during a campaign rally with a knife hidden in a 
bouquet of flowers officials said 
it was unclear whether 46yearold oskar lafontaine the popular 
governor of saarland state and chancellor helmut kohls leading 
challenger will be able to lead his leftofcenter party in the 
campaign for dec 2 national elections 
interior ministry officials said the stabbing severed a neck 
artery and doctores at the hospital where lafontaine was being 
treated said he lost large amounts of blood 
lafontaine was attacked near the close of the cologne rally at 
about 9 pm wednesday by a blackhaired woman in a white dress who 
approached him on the dais seeking his autograph witnesses and 
officials said 
the woman stabbed the politician as he was about to sign a 
poetry album she presented him police said the zdf television 
network said the knife had been concealed in the flowers 
cologne police identified the woman as adelheid streidel 42 
from the town of bad neuenahr southwest of bonn 
the motive for the attack was not immediately known 
hansjuergen foerster a spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office said there was no evidence the woman had a terrorist 
background 
todays editions of the colognebased tabloid express said the 
woman was a doctors assistant who suffered from mental disorders 
the newspaper quoted neighbors as saying she was a divorcee who had 
asked for weapons several times to defend herself against men she 
believed were following her 
the ard television network showed the social democrat politician 
lying on the floor as blood poured from his neck with several 
people crowded around him trying to administer first aid 
the stabbing suspect was shown sitting impassively as a throng 
of police men screamed at her who are you who are you tell us 
your name say it 
the woman said nothing and was then hustled by police out of the 
stadthalle auditorium in suburban muelheim where about 2000 people 
had gathered for the rally 
lafontaine was rushed by helicopter to the university clinic in 
the cologne suburb of lindenthal where he was listed in serious 
condition early today 
the politician is an unrelenting critic of kohl and has strongly 
opposed quick reunification of the two germanys advocating a more 
gradual approach 
in paris for a west germanfrench summit kohl said the attack 
has deeply shaken me at this hour one can only hope that oskar 
lafontaine survives the statement was released by kohls office 
in bonn 
lafontaine is known for making bold and brash political 
statments and delighted in his role as a political gadfly he is 
divorced and his active social life has received prominence in west 
germanys tabloid press 
the candidates most recent liaison is with a frankfurt 
hoteliers daughter whose dyed blond punkstyle haircut delighted 
news photographers 
the outspoken politician whose party trounced kohls christian 
democratic union in state elections in january has been considered 
a tough opponent for the december national elections 
lafontaine a party activist at age 21 became mayor 11 years 
later of saarbruecken capital of tiny saarland state which 
borders france 
in 1987 he became deputy chairman of the social democrats 
despite opposition from the partys conservative wing headed by 
former chancellor helmut schmidt 
he strongly opposed plans under schmidts government in the late 
1970s to station us mediumrange nuclear weapons in west germany

consumer advocates attorneys and journalists 
say court agreements that allow companies to keep information about 
potential hazards involving their products secret are endangering 
lives and public safety 
however corporate lawyers argue that such arrangements are a 
legitimate part of the civil justice system offer an alternative 
to lengthy court battles and help protect trade secrets of us 
businesses and american competitiveness 
secrecy buries critical facts and the public good is 
ignored and damaged russ herman president of the association of 
trial lawyers of america said wednesday at a conference on secrecy 
sponsored by his group 
information discovered during product liability litigation 
ought to be made available to the public so the danger isnt 
repeated over and over again he added 
in many instances that includes documents and decisions 
involving unsafe products dangerous drugs toxic wastes all with 
potentially devastating effect on people unaware of the danger 
said paul mcmasters deputy editorial director of usa today 
mcmaster heads the freedom of information committee of the 
society of professional journalists cosponsor of the conference 
protective orders confidentiality agreements or court sealing 
of files in product liability cases prohibit lawsuit participants 
from distributing any of the information obtained limit what can 
be share with others not involved in the lawsuit or make all 
records in a case unavailable 
one corporate defense attorney said that opening court records 
could violate privacy by revealing sensitive information about 
businesses or individuals 
if you can summons my medical records from my doctor my diary 
from my psychiatrist or records of design from a company 
privacy goes out the window said james morris iii a virginia 
lawyer 
opponents to secrecy should not be allowed to use the court 
system to disseminate information that might not otherwise be 
available morris said 
us businesses are at a competitive disadvantage because 
international agreements dont force foreign companies to release 
the same extensive information he added 
foreign corporations are subject to the same rules as american 
corporations in this country countered eugene i pavalon a 
chicago trial lawyer 
for children keeping secrets is a game but for public 
health and safety secrets can be nasty said devra davis a 
toxicologist at the national academy of sciences 
the practice of secrecy in the courts can result in a failure 
to tell the public about proven hazards endangering lives 
perverting science and ultimately undermining democracy itself 
she said 
davis said that in january 1983 she suffered a nearly fatal 
allergic reaction to the prescription painkiller zomax which was 
eventually withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer 
later she said she discovered the manufacturer doctors and 
other patients had known of the possible severe reaction but the 
information was not available because of secrecy agreements 
obtained in product liability case settlements by mcneil 
pharmaceutical the drug manufacturer 
davis said had she known about the possible reaction she would 
not have taken the drug 
the opponents said they didnt oppose secrecy in all instances 
most said companies trade secrets should be protected and in 
personal cases such as divorce and some criminal cases some 
information should not be available to the general public

the inauguration of violeta barrios de 
chamorro was hardly a solemn and decorous affair of state the new 
president made her entrance in a hail of water balloons and her 
predecessor was pelted with watermelon rinds 
mrs chamorro tried to get off to a running start in her 
inaugural speech wednesday but her government ran into trouble 
even before she donned the presidential sash in the first 
democratic transfer of power in nicaraguan history 
she declared a general amnesty and proclaimed an end to the 
despised military draft the dawn of peace and the rebirth of a 
free market economy 
but she also said gen humberto ortega one of the architects of 
the leftist sandinista state that her supporters thought they had 
ousted in the feb 25 election would remain in command of the 
armed forces 
key groups within her conservative united national opposition 
rebelled including two people who had agreed to serve in the 
cabinet the nation also braced for the unraveling of an accord on 
disbanding the contra rebels by june 10 
about 500 rebels in northern nicaragua simply laughed when the 
top contra commander israel galeano asked if they were ready to 
hand over their weapons to waiting un peacekeeping troops 
nobody gives up his gun they said 
and as uno supporters publicly celebrated victory for the first 
time since the election the cry was as loud and clear as the 
crackle of the fireworks overhead and as insistent as the tropical 
music to which they danced in the capitals main plaza humberto 
should go 
mrs chamorro had tried to soften the blow by saying shed serve 
as defense minister the post ortega held until the change of 
government 
she said she chose her cabinet with national reconciliation in 
mind but neither gilberto cuadra or jaime cuadra who had been 
chosen for cabinet posts could reconcile themselves to serving in 
a government that included ortega 
i wouldnt like to think that she feels that in her moment of 
greatest need im not there but i had warned her jaime cuadra 
told the associated press 
he is a coffee farmer and rancher who was to have been 
agriculture minister 
gilberto cuadra president of the nations most important 
business group and a leader of the private sector that is the 
foundation of mrs chamorros support was to have been minister of 
construction and transport 
the two cuadras who are not related refused the posts on the 
eve of the inauguration after being informed mrs chamorro was 
keeping ortega a move the uno political council opposed and 
something she publicly said she would not do 
until a few days ago ortega the brother of former president 
daniel ortega was one of the nine members of the sandinista 
national directorate 
he was the revolutions chief military strategist oversaw the 
military buildup that created central americas largest armed force 
and led the sandinista army through nine years of war against the 
usbacked contras 
control of the armed forces is regarded as critical to mrs 
chamorros ability to govern and retaining ortega puts that 
control in doubt 
she insisted in her inaugural speech that she not ortega 
would call the shots he was under orders she said to cut the 
budgetdraining military and retrieve weapons from the thousands of 
civilians the sandinistas have armed 
we have to melt down our arms and sell the metal to buy 
machinery for agriculture and industry she said 
both the army and the police were party organs under the 
sandinistas and their loyalty is a question mark despite an accord 
saying they would be depoliticized 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez has loaned mrs 
chamorro a commando team to handle her security rather than leave 
it in local hands 
the sandinistas did not relinquish power gracefully 
sandinista rowdies pelted the 60yearold widow and her escorts 
with waterfilled plastic bags as she entered the national baseball 
stadium for the inaugural ceremony 
when outgong president ortega entered the stadium on foot uno 
partisans pelted him with watermelon rinds and blueandwhite uno 
flags and police quickly charged into the stands 
thousands of sandinistas in the stands at the stadium formed a 
gauntlet that presidents prime ministers foreign ministers and 
ambassadors had to run 
representatives of nations deemed friends of the sandinistas 
such as cuba and the soviet union were greeted with cheers and 
waves of redandblack sandinista party flags 
envoys of nations unpopular with the sandinistas entered to 
catcalls boos and insults 
killer killer killer killer the crowd chanted when el 
salvadors rightist president alfredo cristiani went by 
vice president dan quayle got the same greeting as well as 
shouts of son of a bitch go home and here there the 
yankees will die 
quayle was supportive of mrs chamorros controversial decision 
to retain ortega 
it shows she is trying to reconcile the differences in her 
country he told reporters

a power station exploded wednesday night 
blacking out downtown toronto and surrounding areas causing 
traffic chaos and sending thousands of people into the streets 
it took two to three hours to restore power in many areas and 
some looting was reported 
the blackout forced management at the eaton centre to close down 
and evacuate the huge shopping mall but police said shops had been 
broken into 
groups of people have grabbed clothing out of stores said 
police staff sgt lou villani 
he said offduty officers were asked to report in to help patrol 
the downtown area 
one radio report said 90000 homes and 10000 businesses were 
affected by the power outage which ontario hydro said began at 
about 810 pm edt and lasted about two hours in much of downtown 
in some sections of the city center power continued to be out past 
11 pm edt 
subway trains ran slowly the platforms lighted with emergency 
lights 
ontario hydro spokesman bill friday said the power outage began 
after an explosion and fire at a transformer station he said the 
station was shut down and evacuated 
the spokesman blamed the explosion on equipment failure 
stores and restaurants downtown were plunged into darkness and 
the streets filled up with rubberneckers 
traffic lights were knocked out pedestrians picked their way 
across congested streets 
the emergency department at st michaels hospital was blacked 
out for more than 1 hours but patients and ambulances were 
redirected to other hospitals not affected and no one was in 
danger spokeswoman leanna wilson said 
she said the rest of hospital had power from an emergency backup 
system 
television stations were knocked off the air but programming 
flickered back on and off 
police said most elevators had enough emergency power to get 
people to the ground 
but a police spokesman reported all traffic control signals 
are out weve put every available officer to try and control 
traffic and other problems that go with blackouts 
a clerk at a store in the eaton centre cary legree said 
security people quickly cleared out the mall after the blackout 
began adding 
some idiot went running through the store saying its a 
bomb but otherwise it was cool thank god it was not busy

american women see most men as lecherous 
egotistical slobs and they dont like motherinlaw jokes either 
a survey says 
the national poll released wednesday found increasing numbers 
of women expressing annoyance at sexism and describing men as 
manipulative oversexed and mean it compared responses to 
identical questions asked 20 years ago 
in 1970 for example twothirds of the women surveyed agreed 
that most men are basically kind gentle and thoughtful in the 
new poll only half of the women interviewed agreed with that 
statement 
prurience also took a pounding fiftyfour percent of the women 
agreed that most men look at a woman and immediately think how it 
would be to go to bed with her that was up from 41 percent who 
agreed in 1970 
majorities in the new poll conducted by the roper organization 
also rated men negatively on their egos and domesticity sizable 
minorities went further fortytwo percent called men basically 
selfish and selfcentered 
the reason womens growing dissatisfaction with men is 
undoubtedly derived from their own rising expectations the 
pollsters reported the more independent women of today expect 
more from men 
the poll financed by philip morris usa in the name of its 
virginia slims cigarettes was conducted july 22 through aug 12 by 
personal interviews with a random sample of 3000 women the margin 
of error was 2 points 
respondents expressed greater awareness of discrimination 
against women than they did 20 years ago but they also said 
overwhelmingly that women have made progress in job opportunities 
fair pay and political leadership 
six in 10 of the women who work full time said juggling jobs and 
families puts them under a lot of stress and nearly as many 
said they felt guilty about time they spend at work and away from 
their families 
their frustration comes out of trying to be superwomen said 
ellen merlo a philip morris vice president women are handling 
so many aspects of life trying to achieve success in careers 
wanting to be a wife and a mother run a home and do it all well 
its a lot for anyone to handle 
indeed the secondgreatest cause of resentment in respondents 
lives was their mates failure to help with household duties cited 
by 52 percent only money was a greater cause of woe 
as women contribute more to family income they expect a more 
equitable division of the household responsibilities in return 
the poll report said women indicate that men are failing to live 
up to this ideal and that their failure is a major source of 
irritation 
diapers and dishes are by no means the sole problem many women 
expressed negative views of male attitudes as well as behavior 
among the findings 
fiftyeight percent of the women agreed that most men think 
only their own opinions about the world are important up from 50 
percent in 1970 
given the statement most men find it necessary for their 
egos to keep women down 55 percent agreed up from 49 percent 20 
years ago 
fiftythree percent agreed that most men are interested in 
their work and life outside the home and dont pay much attention 
to things going on at home that was up from 39 percent in 1970 
the poll found similar increases in sensitivity to sexism 
fiftythree percent said they were annoyed by jokes about women 
drivers mothersinlaw or dumb blondes up from 32 percent in 
1970 sixtyone percent were annoyed by pictures of nude women in 
mens magazines up from 43 percent 
eighty percent resented a woman being looked upon as sex 
symbol instead of as having sense in her head up from 66 percent 
in 1970 and 53 percent were annoyed by men referring to them as a 
girl rather than a woman up from 31 percent 
the poll results indicated that men must have some redeeming 
factors however asked their idea of the best kind of life more 
than nine in 10 of the women named marriage

an environmental group says the energy 
department is planning to install a prototype of a more powerful 
submarine reactor at an upstate new york laboratory 
the natural resources defense council disclosed the plans which 
it said it learned about through declassified records of 
congressional hearings and complained wednesday that the 
government is going ahead without studying the impact on the 
environment 
the council said a prototype of the advanced fleet reactor 
would be installed at the kesselring site of the departments 
knolls atomic power laboratory near albany and schenectady ny 
the department has argued a new environmental impact statement 
is not required because one was performed for the site in 1972 for 
the reactor used to power the trident submarines said nrdc which 
was joined in its statement by a local group the knolls action 
project 
three department spokesman said wednesday night they were not 
familiar enough with the issue to comment 
the new york times reported in thursday editions that the 
department said the core of the new reactor will be tested not the 
whole reactor 
the core contains the enriched uranium fuel support elements 
and control rods that govern the nuclear reaction by absorbing 
neutrons it will be inserted in an existing reactor during the 
next two years according to the departments statement 
no commercial utility could get away with building a new 
reactor in the 1990s based on an almost 20yearold eis on a 
different reactor said dan w reicher a staff attorney for nrdc 
the advanced fleet reactor has been under development for 
several years it is designed to power the seawolf class of attack 
submarines when they are built in the mid1990s 
in budget documents submitted to congress earlier this year the 
department said the new reactor would encompass longterm 
developments now coming to fruition and will deliver more power 
more quietly than any previous submarine reactor and will do so 
without a commensurate increase in size or weight 
the department quoted declassified testimony from 1988 as saying 
the advanced fleet reactor is of the pressurized water design used 
by all other naval reactors and most of the nations civilian power 
reactors 
nrdc said the reactor most likely would be installed in a 
prototype plant that has no containment system the steel and 
concrete structure surrounding civilian reactors to confine 
radioactive material in an accident 
the department statement said there is a containment structure 
but an nrdc expert was quoted as saying it is not comparable to one 
on a civilian power plant

a federal official says studies in two states 
have tied the sometimes fatal blood disorder linked to the dietary 
supplement ltryptophan to a single japanese company 
these are the first preliminary reports linking consumption of 
ltryptophan from one specific company to this syndrome food and 
drug administration spokesman jeff nesbit said wednesday 
ltryptophan has been linked to 21 deaths and more than 1500 
reports of illness from a disorder called eosinophiliamyalgia or 
ems 
the fda last month declared ltryptophan a major public health 
problem and expanded its recall of the supplement commonly sold 
in health food stores as a remedy for insomnia appetite control 
and depression 
federal researchers who conducted studies in oregon and 
minnesota presented their results at a forum at the centers for 
disease control in atlanta on wednesday said nesbit 
he said the studies strongly suggest something contaminated the 
ltryptophan produced by the company 
the washington post in todays editions quoted a spokesman for 
the showa denko co one of japans largest chemical manufacturers 
as saying the studies showed a strong statistical association 
between our product and ems 
but it is important to note that the studies do not 
independently identify the precise cause of ems the spokesman 
bob schwadron told the newspaper 
nesbit said three other studies in progress are expected to be 
completed in a month or two 
the first two cases made public in atlanta do indicate that 
one company is responsible but we wont know whether that will 
hold true for the remaining three until were finished he said 
ems is marked by severe muscle and joint pain breathing 
difficulties swelling of the arms and legs skin rash fatigue 
cough and sometimes fever in some cases victims show signs of 
congestive heart failure and develop a condition that causes 
progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis

angered over continued sandinista 
domination of the army and police the contras are defying 
president violeta barrios de chamorros appeals to lay down their 
weapons and rejoin civilian life 
a representative of the president roberto ferrey traveled 
wednesday to a special security zone where the rebels are supposed 
to disband under un supervision 
hours after mrs chamorro was sworn in on wednesday he urged 
about 500 armed rebels seated in columns on a sunbaked slope to lay 
down their weapons 
you of the resistance must understand that you are not 
defeated soldiers that you are heroic combatants who for love of 
your country are willing to lay down your arms and return to 
civilian life ferrey said at the close of his 15minute address 
through a megaphone 
previous speakers one a representative of nicaraguas roman 
catholic archbishop and the other arturo garzon of the 
organizaton of american states received polite applause 
but ferrey was met with stony silence and stares 
guerrillas who rose during the following 40 minutes to challenge 
and question him were heartily cheered especially when they said 
they were unwilling to disband while the sandinista army remained 
intact 
garzon issued what he termed an invitation and an 
exhortation to the contras to avail themselves of oas aid once 
they decided to hand over their weapons 
of the dozens interviewed at the assembly however not a single 
contra said he would hand over his weapon as long as the 
sandinistas controlled the army and security forces 
under an agreement signed last week by leaders of the contras 
the sandinistas and the new government the rebels were to begin 
demobilizing wednesday 
but the accord appeared headed for a breakdown because mrs 
chamorro decided as a concilatory measure to allow gen humberto 
ortega brother of former president daniel ortega to stay on as 
head the army 
top contra commander israel galeano addressed the troops after 
meeting briefly with maj jose luis grazia of spain who was in el 
destino representing the un central american peacekeeping force 
the guerrillas broke out in laughter over the suggestion they 
lay down their arms nobody gives up his gun shouted one and 
all cheered 
the peacekeepers have no mandate to forcibly disarm the contras 
el destino is part of security zone 1 which is 85 miles north 
of managua and covers 174 square miles 
while it is not the largest of five zones designated for the 
contra demobilization it is thought to harbor the most fighters 
about 3000 contras are estimated to have arrived in the past week 
about 9000 contras are to gather in the zones in coming days 
the rebels in zone 1 who roam the area at will are 
unsupervised and have sovietmade assault rifles grenade launchers 
and other weaponry 
ferrey appealed for demobilization before june 10 the date 
agreed to in the pact signed last week by oscar sobalvarro the no 
2 man in the contra command 
several contras though rose to challenge ferrey 
jackson a regional contra commander told the group id 
rather take to the mountains live in the jungle with my comrades 
until our conditions are met and those conditions have not yet 
been met

saxophonist dexter gordon who had dazzled 
jazz audiences since the 40s with his complex bebop stylings and 
lumbering yet dignified stage presence is dead at 67 
he died wednesday of kidney failure at thomas jefferson 
university hospital where the new yorker had been admitted march 
18 with cancer of the larynx said don lucoff spokesman for blue 
note records in new york 
gordon helped define bebop in the 40s and he was the last in a 
line of saxophone geniuses that included lester young charlie 
parker and john coltrane 
he reached a new audience as the oscarnominated star of the 
1986 film round midnight and recently finished filming the 
movie awakenings with robert de niro and robin williams 
its very very difficult to even contemplate that weve lost 
such a great master of his instrument and incredible human being 
said guitarist george benson 
he was one of the true giants of the tenor saxophone 
fluegelhorn player art farmer said from his home in vienna he 
was an inspiration to me although i didnt play saxophone going 
back over 40 years 
drummer art blakey performing in seattle said he and gordon 
played together in one of the early billy eckstine bands and he 
played on one of gordons last albums 
he called me last week wanted me to see him i thought he was 
coming back to new york blakey said gonna miss him 
gordons style was his own but his life bore tragic similarities 
to the other jazz greats exile bouts of drug and alcohol abuse a 
stint in prison on drug charges 
gordon combined youngs melodic approach with the harddriving 
sound and complex harmonics of coleman hawkins and parker at a 
sets end he would hold out his horn as if presenting it to the 
audience for a share of the applause 
gordon went to europe in 1962 for a threemonth tour and ended 
up staying for 14 years first in paris then denmark 
i met him in europe in a jazz club in copenhagen benson 
recalled they called him i think it was correct king gordon 
dexter his music was always par excellence 
it was those years as an expatriate that led director bertrand 
tavernier to cast gordon in round midnight the bittersweet 
tale of an american jazz musician in paris and an admiring french 
fan 
the film was loosely based on the life of pianist bud powell but 
had many parallels with gordons and with those of many jazz 
artists who fled bigotry and rough times in america for europe in 
the 1950s and 60s 
the 6foot5 gordon who dominated the film with his smoky 
voice smooth sax playing and worldweary yet regal bearing was 
nominated for an academy award a first for a musician 
the story is so personal i dont mean dexter gordon but this 
long line of musicians who have been underappreciated and 
swindled he said in 1986 
the film sparked new interest in his career which began in the 
1930s when he went to jazz concerts with his father a los angeles 
physician whose patients included duke ellington and lionel hampton 
gordon performed in clubs as a teenager and soon played with 
the big bands of hampton louis armstrong and eckstine 
his mentors were young and herschel evans and he refined the 
innovations parker had laid down gordon in turn helped shape the 
style and music of coltrane and sonny rollins 
he left eckstine to work on 52nd street the jazz capital in 
new york performing with parker miles davis powell and max 
roach and recording with dizzy gillespie 
by the late 40s he was fronting his own groups he and his 
style of music faded from view in the 50s during which he served 
two years in prison in california on drug charges after prison he 
recorded five acclaimed albums for blue note from 1961 to 1965 
among his more highly regarded albums are long tall dexter 
the savoy sessions doin alright dexter calling our 
man in paris and a swingin affair 
gordon was survived by his wife maxine two daughters and three 
sons 
a memorial was planned for may 6 in new york lucoff said

baskinrobbins inc will build a 30 
million ice cream plant near moscow sweetening the deal with a new 
flavor called gorba chocolate 
the factory to open in 1992 in the suburb of ostankino will be 
a joint venture with a soviet trade ministry about 100 soviet 
workers will be employed at the plant said william i savel 
baskinrobbins president and chief executive 
its yearly production of 8 million gallons will begin with 10 
kinds of ice cream far fewer than the companys famous 31 flavors 
its a lot more than muscovites are used to though only chocolate 
and vanilla are now available in the soviet union 
their ice cream is good but our ice cream is better and we 
have a greater variety savel said 
the glendalebased franchiser a subsidiary of britains 
alliedlyons plc reached the soviet agreement tuesday it said it 
will inaugurate the deal with its new gorba chocolate flavor a 
white and dark chocolate concoction 
the ice cream initially will be sold at thousands of 
governmentmanaged food stores in the moscow area savel said 
baskinrobbins hopes to expand its selection and markets for 
nationwide distribution 
if they go into private ownership we could sign on 
franchisees there too savel said 
baskinrobbins which has sold ice cream at the rossiya hotel in 
moscow since 1988 will generate hard currency by selling about 10 
percent of its product at soviet stores that cater to tourists and 
accept only convertible currency 
nonconvertible rubles from the food stores will be used for 
plant supplies and expansion

the tokyo stock exchanges key index fell 
moderately today and the dollar declined against the yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 13978 points or 047 
percent closing at 2942458 the index which rose 6298 points 
wednesday had added more than 100 points by midmorning thursday 
before falling back 
traders attributed the decline to caution ahead of a long 
holiday period as well as concern over us interest rate movements 
nobody wants to buy issues ahead of long holidays especially 
when they are discouraged by the recent uptrend in the us 
interest rates said a nomura securities trader speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
japans golden week series of holidays starts saturday and 
continues through may 6 for most japanese companies next week the 
stock and currency markets will be open only on tuesday and 
wednesday 
the trader said the index rose in early trading following the 
yens recovery against the dollar but then fell back as market 
players took to the sidelines 
todays trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 
550 million shares down from wednesdays 700 million 
meanwhile the tokyo stock exchange announced that arbitrage 
trading for the previous week amounted to 579 million shares worth 
503 million arbitrage selling totaled 224 million shares worth 
195 million 
arbitrage selling to take profits on price gaps between the 
spot and the futures markets has been cited as one cause of the 
markets plunge since the beginning of this year 
it was the first time the exchange announced arbitrage figures 
a move intended to reduce investors uncertainties 
meanwhile the dollar closed at 15877 yen down 048 yen from 
wednesdays close of 15925 yen it opened at 15865 yen and ranged 
between 15865 yen and 15900 yen 
dollaryen dealing was inactive ahead of the holidays said 
yoshitsugu hanada a dealer with mitsui taiyo kobe bank 
predicting a strengthening of the yen after the holidays hanada 
said considering the higher nominal interest rates in japan 
whose longterm interest rates have stayed above 7 percent it is 
about time for investors to shift their interest to the yen 
the dollar gained in early trading as market players bought west 
german marks for yen on news reports that the west german central 
bank may raise its official discount rate shortly to help stem 
inflation said minori takeuchi a dealer with chemical bank in 
tokyo 
higher interest rates tend to make a countrys currency more 
attractive to foreign currency investors 
the price of benchmark no 119 10year japanese government bonds 
closed at 8609 points up from wednesdays close of 8592 the 
yield slipped to 7350 percent from the previous days 7385 
percent

the acquittal of a former foster care 
counselor marked prosecutors third defeat in three attempts to 
hold social workers responsible for the death of a toddler dunked 
headfirst in a toilet for soiling his pants 
shirley duboise was acquitted wednesday on a misdemeanor charge 
stemming from the death last year of 2yearold bradley mcgee 
ms duboise and three other health and rehabilitative services 
workers were the first state workers ever charged with neglecting 
to report suspected child abuse 
so far two of the workers have been acquitted charges were 
dropped against a third and the last is awaiting trial 
i think its political defense attorney nat white said of 
the prosecution at the time bradley died everybody was 
outraged the public wanted some heads and the state attorneys 
office delivered 
bradley abandoned as an infant was in foster care most of his 
life until he was returned to his parents two months before his 
death he died july 28 after being dunked headfirst in a toilet 
during potty training authorities said 
bradleys mother sheryl coe of lakeland was sentenced last 
week to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder the 
murder trial of her husband thomas coe is set for july 
bradleys foster mother pam kirkland testified that the boy 
had returned upset from an unsupervised visit with his parents 
april 26 1989 with cuts on his hand a cigarette burn and a red 
mark behind his ear 
she said she showed the marks to ms dubois who testified she 
took no action because all she remembers was little more than a 
splinter on the boys finger 
the trial evolved into a question of who the jury believed the 
43yearold defendant or the foster mother 
after barely an hour the jury returned its innocent verdict 
we were frankly a little surprised the judge didnt dismiss it 
right after the prosecution brought out its case said jury 
foreman hazen kelley 
we felt we would be doing a disservice if our decision made 
people scared they would have to call the hrs every time they see a 
scratch on a child 
mrs dubois who could have faced up to 60 days if convicted 
said assistant state attorney john aguero should have owned up 
and been a man and dismissed all these cases when he realized he 
didnt have anything 
aguero refused to comment 
the last worker to face trial is bradleys caseworker margaret 
barber who in addition to the misdemeanor of failing to report 
suspected abuse is charged with child abuse if convicted she 
could face up to 5 years in prison

after at least six people were killed 
by a bomb police said drug traffickers hid in a dump truck police 
helicopters dropped leaflets on medellin seeking help in capturing 
colombias top cocaine lord 
authorities blame pablo escobar the leader of the powerful 
medellin cocaine cartel for wednesdays bombing and hundreds of 
other attacks in response to the governments 8monthold war on 
drugs 
it is easy to see that pablo escobar is behind all of these 
violent criminal actions said interior minister horacio serpa 
we have to say frankly that pablo escobar is colombias public 
enemy no 1 
authorities intensified the search for escobar in this cocaine 
center and nearby towns police patrols swept neighborhoods where 
he was suspected of hiding and the citys army intellegence unit 
said it was ready to check any leads from citizens 
the bomb packing more than 400 pounds of dynamite exploded 
wednesday morning as a vehicle full of elite antinarcotics police 
passed by 
two police officers and four civilians were killed including 
three women and a child scores of people were injured including 
many aboard a bus 
commuters their clothes torn and their bodies bloodied pleaded 
for help as they crawled from the bus shattered windows witnesses 
said 
the explosion severely damaged many buildings and homes in the 
middleclass neighborhood in west medellin 
im furious and scared said a toy shop owner who 
identified herself only as claudia its one thing when you see 
this kind of thing on television its another when the bomb goes 
off on your doorstep 
she said two of her female employees were killed as they walked 
from a nearby cafeteria to open the shop 
the truck bombing was the second blast this month targeting 
antiterrorist police in medellin 
on april 11 a car bomb exploded on a busy highway killing 20 
people including eight members of the special antinarcotics 
police unit 
since then police have sent thousands of reinforcements to the 
area to search for escobar 
on tuesday night president virgilio barco put the military in 
charge of two towns near medellin bello and estrella and scores 
of troops and armored cars mounted with cannons moved into the 
towns 
another nearby town envigado was put under military rule last 
month 
authorities blame the medellin cartel for the deaths of 60 
medellin police officers this year the cartel has offered to pay 
4300 for each policeman murdered 
the terrorism campaign began in august after the barco 
government intensified a war on the countrys cocaine cartels 
based in the cities of medellin and cali 
medellins mayor juan gomez said in a televised interview that 
bombers should quit damaging the city 
he has called repeatedly for government negotiations with 
traffickers to end the violence the barco administration has said 
it will never negotiate with the cocaine cartels 
i dont know why we have to put up with a mayor that wants to 
talk to these monsters said the toy shop owner 
but a neighborhood resident francisco alvarez said he was 
angry at the barco administration 
the government says it is fighting with the drug traffickers 
but it is the common people who are dying he said the only 
way to stop this insanity is through a dialogue with the drug 
mafia 
the traffickers demand that the government stop extraditing drug 
suspects to face trial in the united states colombia has 
extradited 15 alleged cartel middlemen since the crackdown began

sothebys departing from its role as an auction 
house is financing the 1428 million purchase of the contents of 
a distinguished new york art gallery 
sothebys has agreed to finance the purchase of the pierre 
matisse gallery one of the foremost inventories of 20thcentury 
art in an agreement with art dealer william acquavella said diana 
c brooks president of sothebys in north america 
the gallery was founded by pierre matisse the son of painter 
henri matisse its inventory has 2300 works by artists such as 
joan miro marc chagall and alberto giacometti 
acquavella will be managing partner of the joint venture 
company which will be called acquavella modern art the new york 
times reported today acquavella said he plans to sell the 
paintings privately over a period of time 
until now sothebys has represented sellers and has not owned 
most of the works it has sold but with this move sothebys 
acquires a substantial inventory of artwork and enters the gallery 
business 
sothebys has expanded its operations in the art world since 
real estate tycoon a alfred taubman bought it in 1983 
the auction house in 1988 started sothebys financial services 
a subsidiary that lends money to sellers buyers and owners of art 
more recently sothebys has offered guaranteed minimum prices 
for consigned pieces of art even if the work does not sell at 
auction

dealer and board member of the art dealers association of america 
told the times to any longer describe themselves as an objective 
middleman is wrong

georgias human resources chief says a state 
mental hospital followed procedure in releasing a man who shot and 
killed someone at a shopping mall the next day 
james ledbetter commissioner of human resources said 
psychiatrists determined james calvin brady 31 was no danger 
himself or others when he was released from georgia regional 
hospital in atlanta on monday 
brady on tuesday killed one person and wounded four in a 
shooting rampage police said 
its a very difficult decision to predict future behavior and 
thats essentially what our staff is called on to do ledbetter 
siad we are not perfect 
a court hearing was scheduled today to determine which hospital 
records should be turned over to the public defenders office and 
police 
ledbetter said gov joe frank harris asked him to review the 
decision to release brady 
when i looked at it i just didnt find the weaknesses that 
the tragedy would suggest ledbetter said i believe that the 
decisions that were made were consistent with standard medical 
procedure and with the policies of the department 
the gunman smiling and wearing a gray suit fired a handgun 
into a lunchtime crowd at perimeter mall after throwing his gun 
into a trash can brady surrendered just outside the main entrance 
police said 
brady told authorities his attack was motivated by revenge 
against people in california who seeking to control him had 
implanted a mechanical device in his body 
brady has been charged with murder in the death of michael 
gregory musick 24 and four counts of aggravated assault he was 
taken to a state mental hospital in milledgeville to a await a 
preliminary hearing may 1 
two of the victims remained hospitalized one in serious 
condition and another in fair 
before the preliminary hearing psychiatrists will attempt to 
determine whether brady is competent to stand trial said his 
lawyer public defender larry schneider 
obviously when he walks in and shoots a bunch of people before 
200 witnesses you think about an insanity plea schneider said 
dekalb county police said the gunman carried documents from the 
hospital in atlanta indicating he had been diagnosed as having 
homicidal tendencies 
but harris said i think youll find when the information 
comes out that thats not exactly the case 
police said brady bought the revolver and 12 rounds of 
hollowpoint ammunition a type designed to expand on impact and 
cause particularly severe wounds for 139 monday at a pawn shop in 
an atlanta suburb

after the last five rebellious inmates surrendered 
at strangeways prison debate began immediately over whether 
authorities should have used force early on to end what became a 
25day standoff 
todays headline in the daily mail newspaper which supports 
prime minister margaret thatchers government said prison farce 
ends at last 
the inmates have strutted simpered and snarled at the 
tv cameras said an editorial the home office its ministers 
and its prison service have been humiliated repeatedly and 
publicly 
but the secretary of the home office which is in charge of 
prisons said after visiting strangeways on wednesday night i 
think the end result justified the tactics employed 
secretary david waddington denied suggestions at a news 
conference that the decision not to use force had made the prison 
service a laughingstock i ask you to examine your conscience and 
if you would be making the same criticism of me if the prison had 
been stormed and five officers killed he said 
the defiance at strangeways in the northern city of manchester 
prompted copycat trouble at more than a dozen other prisons 
the siege at strangeways ended wednesday when the last five 
inmates were lowered at their own request from the roof of the 
prison chapel to the courtyard 150 feet below in a hydraulic lift 
the trouble began april 1 at sunday services in the chapel 
about 300 inmates overpowered guards stole their keys and got into 
other parts of the prison other inmates joined what became a riot 
starting fires and destroying large areas of the prison but most 
surrendered within days 
a prisoner awaiting trial on charges of sexually assaulting 
children died of injuries suffered at the hands of other inmates 
prisoners relatives told of overcrowding in the prison which 
was built in 1868 to house 970 men and held 1648 when the rioting 
erupted 
during the siege prison authorities used sirens and 
firecrackers to deprive the rebellious inmates of sleep and try to 
wear down their resistance other tactics included spraying jets of 
water to drench the prisoners and put out fires they started the 
inmates responded by hurling roof tiles and bricks and shouting 
abuse at guards 
they danced on the roof for scores of tv and press cameras as 
relatives and supporters gathered to cheer them on 
on one occasion tv viewers saw one inmate appear on the roof 
bawl out good morning manchester and do exercises 
on wednesday morning 100 guards in riot gear moved into the 
prison trapping the five on the prison chapel roof but again no 
violence was used 
the renegades had armed themselves with crudely fashioned 
weapons and erected barricades and booby traps and authorities 
feared loss of life or injuries in force was used 
news reports indicated some anxiety among mrs thatchers 
governing conservatives over possible harm to their image as the 
party of law and order the party is already in deep political 
trouble with voters over an unpopular new tax 
the liberal london newspaper the guardian quoted rankandfile 
tory legislators as saying only the partys electoral fragility had 
prevented an explosion of indignation over how the standoff was 
handled 
john bartell chairman of the prison officers association the 
guards trade union also criticized the way the siege was allowed 
to continue

ms pilchaks courtappointed attorney was suffering from 
alzheimers disease and had not prepared a defense stevens said 
the jurors came from a pool selected by the sheriff a common 
practice but in this case the sheriff had investigated the case 
ms pilchak said she was not angry about the way the case had 
been handled 
it was extremely unfortunate that this happened to me ms 
pilchak said im mostly sad about it i hope it doesnt happen 
to anybody else 
she was arrested in jefferson city in december 1981 and charged 
with aiding and abetting her boyfriend in the sale of 26 ounces of 
cocaine to an undercover drug agent her sentence came although she 
was a firsttime offender 
a few months after her trial it became known that her attorney 
j paul allred jr was suffering from alzheimers disease and a 
lawyer in another case discovered after ms pilchaks trial that 
the jury pool was chosen by the sheriff who investigated the case 
ms pilchaks boyfriend gary mccaw was tried separately and 
sentenced to life in prison a judge ruled that the jury selected 
in that case also was flawed and ordered a new trial mccaw pleaded 
guilty and was sentenced to 26 years in prison he has since been 
freed 
ms pilchak has two children a 20yearold son and an 
8yearold daughter the younger child has been in foster care and 
a hearing is scheduled may 4 to determine whether ms pilchaks 
parental rights should be terminated 
steve hawke of the attorney generals office said the state 
would contend in its appeal that a state court had found 
allegations about the improper defense and stacked jury to be 
groundless 
under her original sentence ms pilchak could not have been 
released from prison until december 1993

lawmakers say they will ignore a judge who found 
the state health chief in contempt for failing to provide money for 
mental health programs 
superior judge bernard dougherty on wednesday gave the 
department of health services director ted williams 15 days to 
request an additional 452 million from the legislature which 
would provide it 
legislators said doughertys order is meaningless and predicted 
that it would be ignored they said the money requested is not 
available 
the judge is in nevernever land said house appropriations 
committee chairman john wettaw 
doughterty did not say what action he would take if williams 
failed to seek the additional money or if the legislature refused 
to provide it 
the battle over funding for the chronically mental ill began 
with a classaction lawsuit against the state in 1981 
dougherty ruled in june 1985 that the state had to fully fund 
programs mandated by the legislature for people with chronic mental 
illness and the order was affirmed in march 1989 by the arizona 
supreme court 
an advocacy group the center for law in the public interest 
sought contempt sanctions against williams and gov rose mofford 
contending neither had sought adequate funding to comply with the 
order 
the center argued that the state would have to spend an 
additional 452 million next year to begin implementing the order 
while williams sought only 123 million in his budget request to 
the governor and mrs mofford asked the legislature for only 16 
million 
the state supreme court dismissed the proceedings against mrs 
mofford on grounds that she was not a party to the original suit 
and that her actions are protected by the state constitution but 
the high court allowed the case against williams 
beryl dulsky an assistant state attorney general who 
represented williams said no decision had been made on an appeal 
vada manager a spokesman for mrs mofford said we are exploring 
the options 
lawmakers were skeptical that doughertys order will result in a 
substantial increase in funding for the chronically mentally ill 
the legislature does not respond very well to judicial 
threats said senate majority leader john mawhinney 
wettaw said lawmakers would do our best to provide 
additional funding for mental health programs but that it would 
not be anywhere near 452 million

a blackout plunged much of this city of 610000 
people and its environs into darkness for several hours and 
traffic chaos downtown gave way to a big street party 
the power outage occurred about 8 pm wednesday after equipment 
failure caused a transformer at a midtown station to explode and 
catch fire ontario hydro spokesman bill friday said 
several people reported seeing a fireball after the blast but 
officials said there were no serious injuries at the plant which 
was evacuated the fire was out by 10 pm 
everything was back on as of 110 am friday said today 
ninety percent of the people affected had their power back by 
1130 pm 
police staff sgt lou villani said about 175 gallons of liquid 
containing cancercausing polychlorinated biphenyls spilled during 
the fire but were contained inside the plant 
hydro spokesmen said the liquid did not pose a danger because 
the pcb levels were well below provincial standards 
at the height of the blackout about 90000 homes and 10000 
businesses were in the dark in toronto and parts of suburban 
scarborough east york and north york 
downtown stores closed but there were reports of young looters 
carrying leather jackets and stereos out of the eaton centre 
villani said security staff sealed off the huge fourstory mall 
and no arrests were reported 
wednesday was the citys hottest april 25 on record 86 degrees 
and thousands of people strolled along yonge street the main 
thoroughfare reveling in the disorder and giving the street the 
goodtime chaotic energy of a saturday night 
were having an amazing time said 19yearold michelle em 
who took a break from her job at a leather goods store to cruise 
the streets with two friends in a rented rickshaw 
weve seen people preaching and singing you name it theyre 
doing it she said 
police officers mixed with the crowds and cruisers joined the 
traffic on the street 
for several hours pedestrians and drivers had to guess each 
others intentions before proceeding 
offduty officers eventually were asked to direct the busiest 
intersections particularly around the skydome where more than 
30000 people poured out of a toronto blue jays game the stadium 
did not lose power 
at the king edward hotel some guests were led to the lobby by 
staff and treated to tea coffee and pastries another staff member 
played the piano 
the show never started at the pantages theatre where the 
phantom of the opera was to have been performed 
the bar was open said theatergoer dorothy lillie people 
bought drinks and watched the beautiful people go by she said as 
she joined hundreds of others strolling along younge street 
joe luciano of the big slice pizzeria moved a table onto the 
street and hawked slices of pizza and soda 
gordon miller 64 who served in world war ii said it was 
just like london in the blitz

public was barred 
crowds of up to 500000 people have greeted shuttles in the 
past nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato said she expected only 15000 
to 20000 people sunday because shuttle landings are becoming 
routine again 
difficulties getting to the site also may decrease the number of 
spectators 
the main access road from the south is closed for resurfacing 
and wouldbe spectators driving from los angeles will be forced to 
approach take a detour that will add about an hour to the usual 
2hour drive lovato said wednesday

the bronx is getting burned by hollywoods 
portrayal of the new york city borough in the film the bonfire of 
the vanities the borough president says 
the city and this borough do not have an obligation to help a 
company make a motion picture that goes out of its way to denigrate 
the bronx borough president fernando ferrer told reporters 
wednesday 
the warner bros film now in production is based on tom 
wolfes scathing best seller of the same name which tells the 
story of a highpowered wall street executive who becomes entangled 
in the citys kafkaesque court system 
parts of the film which features tom hanks bruce willis and 
morgan freeman were shot at the bronx county courthouse 
ferrer asked warner bros to run a 55word statement at the end 
of the film stressing the boroughs positive aspects and ending 
with the words bronx neighborhoods are home to cultural 
institutions attracting more than 2000000 visitors a year 
in response warner bros offered to run this statement this 
film is a work of fiction and is not intended to reflect actual 
events or conditions in the localities portrayed 
ferrer claims the film company also offered to donate 10000 to 
the charity of ferrers choice i not only find that offer 
strange but frankly bordering on the improper the borough 
president said 
the mayors office of film theatre and broadcasting said the 
idea for the contribution had come from ferrers office but ferrer 
said the idea came from either that citywide office or warner bros 
fred caruso the films coproducer said the charity donation 
was not something generated or offered by us 
one of the scenes ferrar found objectionable was between two 
bronx district attorneys 
he pulled a knife on a 70yearold lady robbed her raped her 
and then shoved her in a garbage can one says 
jesus the other replies 
welcome to the south bronx laughs the first one 
said caruso the movie is not derogatory toward the bronx nor 
is it a racist film 
ferrers criticism was reminiscent of a furor raised over the 
1981 film fort apache the bronx that film triggered protests 
and a boycott ferrer suggested a similar boycott might be 
warranted against bonfire

after years of stateencouraged passivity soviets 
today marked the fourth anniversary of the chernobyl nuclear plant 
disaster with widespread protests a 24hour telethon and a strike 
at a major factory 
it was the biggest national commemoration yet of the 1986 
tragedy the worlds worst nuclear power acccident 
we have been silent too long said a reporter on the tv news 
program vremya which focused its afternoon show on chernobyl 
reports 
officially 31 people were killed when one of four reactors at 
chernobyl caught fire and exploded on april 26 1986 about 90 
miles north of kiev in the soviet ukraine unofficial reports say 
at least 250 died 
the blast spewed radioactive cesium strontium and plutonium 
isotopes across much of the ukraine byelorussia and russia and 
sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world 
for the first two days after the accident the soviet union 
refused to report it to the outside world and withheld information 
from its own people only last year did officials admit the full 
scope of the contamination and decide to resettle 100000 more 
people 
the official willingness to play up the chernobyl anniversary 
today appeared to reflect both the growing awareness of the 
catastrophes aftermath and the prodemocracy views of many newly 
elected local governing councils 
residents in the southwestern soviet regions most contaminated 
by the blast organized protests to demand better medical treatment 
protection from radiation and punishment for the officials who 
covered up the accidents effects activists said 
in the byelorussian city of gomel most of the 35000 workers of 
the gomselmash industrial complex walked out on a daylong strike 
said alexander korniev a plant worker 
strikers were demanding better medical care and wanted all 
officials who participated in the coverup brought to trial he 
said 
the chernobyl telethon one of the soviet unions first 
experiences with television fundraising collected 38 million 
organizers announced 
the live broadcast originating in moscow interspersed singing 
groups and interviews with tragic footage showing chernobyl 
rescuers and children in the contaminated zone suffering from 
radiationcaused cancers along with money pledges to the telethon 
center included donations of radiationfree fruit and even 1100 
pounds of honey for children in the contaminated area 
cnn showed live scenes of the telethon to american viewers many 
of the donations came from the united states japan and western 
europe the soviet news agency tass said 
the ukrainian legislature declared today chernobyl tragedy 
day and its byelorussian counterpart passed a similar measure 
other government bodies in the affected areas sanctioned widespread 
demonstrations 
on the eve of the anniversary the soviet legislature adopted a 
26 billion program that would involve resettling an additional 
200000 people from irradiated areas 
the program was adopted wednesday even though many members of 
the legislature the supreme soviet criticized it as inadequate to 
deal with the health agricultural economic and environmental 
aftermath of the accident 
after a day of debate including charges of an official coverup 
of the disaster and bungled evacuations legislators endorsed a 
program for dealing with chernobyl from 19901992 tass reported 
about 180000 to 200000 people still living in contaminated 
areas four years after the accident are to be resettled 
in the months after the accident 116000 people were evacuated 
and some soviet scientists and politicians have been campaigning 
since then for further resettlements they say 4 million soviets 
are living on contaminated land 
the 26 billion is a major increase in spending on the chernobyl 
aftermath it is twice the level spent in the four years since the 
accident but still short of the 405 billion legislator yuri 
scherback has estimated is needed over the next 10 years 
many chernobylarea residents have complained of inadequate 
medical care and cases of anemia leukemia and cancers have been 
reported rising among people living on irradiated land many 
residents still eat irradiated food because alternatives are not 
available 
dealing with the larger questions posed by chernobyl the 
supreme soviet directed the government to draft a bill on the use 
of nuclear energy and nuclear safety and to phase out the 
chernobyl power plant 
the three reactors not involved in the accident are still 
operating the ukrainian legislature wants the plant closed by 1995 
several other nuclear power projects around the country were 
canceled because of the heightened safety concerns generated by the 
chernobyl accident 
soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov said in an interview published 
today that the soviet union will not phase out nuclear energy 
altogether but it will improve safety systems

israeli soldiers shot and killed two 
palestinians and wounded about 120 today in the worst violence in 
the uprising in nearly a year hospital officials and arab 
witnesses said 
the clash began as thousands of moslem worshipers were passing 
an army base in the gaza strip en route to a cemetery for a 
religious holiday to honor the dead witnesses said 
an army spokesman who demanded anonymity said some of the 
palestinians started to throw rocks and bottles at the soldiers 
the soldiers concerned about the potential danger to their lives 
responded with tear gas and later various types of ammunition the 
spokesman said 
the army confirmed two palestinians had been killed it said 
about 50 arabs and seven soldiers were injured by stones in the 
clash which occurred on the moslem holiday of id alfitr that 
celebrates the end of the month of ramadan 
according to witnesses interviewed in gaza city hospitals the 
clash began as 4000 palestinians left two mosques after prayer 
services in the crowded jabaliya refugee camp where the 
palestinian uprising against israeli occupation began more than 28 
months ago 
the army imposed a curfew on the camp of 53000 residents and 
declared the entire gaza strip a closed military zone a move that 
bars journalists from entering the area 
doctors said 61 gunshot victims were treated at ahli hospital 
39 at shifa hospital and 20 at un clinics more than 15 received 
injuries from rubber pellets or were beaten with nightsticks 
jorgen rosendal of denmark administrator of al ahli arab 
hospital said it was the worst violence since three palestinians 
were killed and about 50 wounded during the id alfitr holiday on 
may 6 1989 
the casualties represented one of the largest tolls of wounded 
from a single incident since the uprising began and contrasted with 
the low level of conflict in recent months 
an unemployed street vendor who was wounded in the right arm 
told a reporter that soldiers fired tear gas when crowds chanting 
allahu akbar or god is great approached a fencedoff army 
encampment en route to a cemetery to honor the dead in accordance 
with moslem tradition 
the vendor who gave only his first name ahmad and other 
witnesses said about 20 israeli soldiers watching the crowd 
apparently became alarmed and fired tear gas 
we were heading to visit our dead people and then they started 
shooting tear gas at us ahmad 25 said i think the army 
thought we wanted to attack them after they saw such huge crowds 
heading towards them but if they hadnt fired tear gas nothing 
would have happened 
after the tear gas was fired arab witnesses said scores of 
palestinians hurled stones at the army camp then a dozen border 
police jeeps several armored personnel carriers and a helicopter 
came to the help the soldiers 
army spokesmen in tel aviv said the crowds interfered with 
army activity but gave no details of why the soldiers started 
firing they said senior officers were investigating 
killed in the clash were two camp residents awadallah ibrahim 
awadallh 25 a laborer who was shot in the chest and khaled musa 
aswad 35 a mosque prayer caller who was shot in the stomach 
todays deaths brought to 678 the number of palestinians killed 
in clashes with israelis since dec 8 1987 when the uprising 
began against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
in addition 209 palestinians have been killed by other 
palestinians most accused of collaborating with israeli 
authorites fortythree israelis have died in the clashes 
israel seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war

a black student will run the university of 
mississippi school newspaper for the first time 
lee eric smith was named editor wednesday by a selection 
committee set up last month after protesting campus journalists

im the first black editor smith said wednesday

named editor of the daily mississippian over three other 
candidates all of them white he was chosen by a board of 
students professional journalists and staff said samir hussni 
journalism professor and chairman of the selection board 
for 50 years the editor of the daily mississippian was elected 
sometimes after spending hundreds of dollars on posters and fliers 
critics said fraternities and sororities controlled the annual 
elections turning them into popularity contests 
this year the newspaper staff and other students launched a 
protest including producing an edition containing the us 
constitution in place of the usual stories and another with several 
blank pages some students upset by the protest responded by 
scrawling obscenities on copies of the paper and scattering 
hundreds of issues across campus 
but in march the student government voted to do away with 
elections and create the selection committee 
im happy that we selected the right person for the job 
husni said he won by a large margin the fact that hes black 
had nothing to do with it but now its a historic decision

site of race riots in 1962 after a court ordered that a black 
student be admitted about 20 students work on the editorial side

west germanys most colorful acidtongued and popular politicians 
he was rushed to the university clinic of cologne in critical 
condition after being stabbed with a butcher knife at a campaign 
rally by a woman who repotedly had a history of mental problems 
the candidate underwent two hours of surgery late wednesday 
doctors upgraded his condition overnight and he awoke at 5 am 
considering the circumstances his condition is 
satisfactory said dr heinz pichlmaier the head of the team of 
physicians treating lafontaine 
vogel who rushed to cologne after the attack said the knife 
missed a main artery by just a couple of milimeters 
otherwise we would be mourning he said 
the knife cut a vein in lafontaines neck but not one of the 
two carotid arteries that carry blood to the brain said joachim 
hofmanngoettig a saarland state spokesman 
hofmanngoettig said that lafontaine could be released from the 
hospital as early as this weekend but added that it was too early 
to tell whether he would be able to challenge kohl 
well have to see how things go politically after he has 
completely recovered physically and psychologically 
hofmanngoettig said 
it was the most serious attack on a topranking politician in 
west germanys 41year history and was likely to result in a 
review of security measures as the election campaign intensifies 
police this morning resumed questioning the woman arrested in 
the stabbing attack 
lafontaine was attacked near the close of campaign rally in 
cologne at about 9 pm by the blackhaired woman in a white dress 
who approached him on the dais seeking his autograph witnesses and 
officials said 
the woman stabbed lafontaine with a butcher knife as he was 
about to sign a poetry album she presented him police said the 
zdf television network said the knife had been concealed in a 
bouquet of flowers 
the ard television network showed lafontaine lying on the floor 
as blood poured from his neck with several people crowded around 
him trying to administer first aid he was rushed by helicopter to 
the hospital 
the motive for the attack was not immediately known 
hansjuergen foerster a spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office said there was no evidence the woman had a terrorist 
background 
she was identified as 42yearold adelheid streidel of bad 
neuenahr southwest of bonn news reports said she had a history of 
mental illness 
after the attack the woman sat impassively as a throng of 
policemen screamed at her who are you who are you tell us your 
name say it 
but the woman said she was refusing to make any statements and 
police hustled her out of stadthalle auditorium in suburban 
muelheim where about 2000 people had gathered for the rally 
zdf said she was convicted of arson in 1986 and had been sent to 
a psychiatric institute 
the cologne newspaper express said that she suffered from a 
persecution complex and quoted neighbors as saying she had 
repeatedly sought to obtain weapons to defend herself from men she 
thought were pursuing her 
reinhard klimmt the social democratic member of the saarland 
state parliament said after visiting lafontaine that he was weak 
but mentally alert and cracking jokes 
vogel told colleagues lafontaine had found his usual humor 
again 
lafontaine is known for making bold and brash political 
statments and has delighted in his role as a political gadfly 
the outspoken politician whose party trounced kohls christian 
democratic union in state elections in january has been considered 
a tough opponent for the december national elections

of the men of working age have left the village for jobs in the

president violeta barrios de chamorro 
may have stalled a sandinista revolt by letting gen humberto 
ortega stay on as army chief but the shortterm solution to her 
problems spells longterm trouble for her new government 
two wouldbe cabinet ministers have refused their posts and 
contra rebels are reneging on a demobilization accord 
the contras last week signed an accord with gen ortega and mrs 
chamorros united national opposition uno to demobilize 
but not a few laughed at the idea after mrs chamorro received 
the presidential sash from daniel ortega on wednesday 
mrs chamorro took over as defense minister but that did not 
ease the anger over gen ortega staying on what the contras want 
says rebel chief israel galeano is for the sandinistas to 
relinquish all control of the military 
the sandinistas have warned of a renewed civil war if any 
attempts are made to alter the armed forces in any profound way 
how mrs chamorro and her government solve this deadlock will 
show whether they can deal with nicaraguas complicated problems 
mrs chamorros decision to stick to an agreement last month 
that effectively allows the sandinistas to keep control of the 
armed forces has heightened the political split in the country 
mrs chamorro has been trying to close that chasm with calls for 
reconciliation 
but for either the contras or the sandinistas to give up their 
weapons would be tantamount to surrender and both sides claim 
military victory in the 9yearold civil war 
observers were surprised last week when the contras who had 
said they would only negotiate demobilization with mrs chamorro 
once she was in power signed an accord less than 24 hours later to 
lay down their weapons 
what was more surprising was that they did so without imposing 
any conditions that led to speculation that there had to be some 
sort of secret pact between uno and the contras 
many of the estimated 9000 rebel fighters inside nicaragua have 
begun streaming into five security zones staffed by a 700member 
un peacekeeping force the rebels are to give up their weapons 
voluntarily 
once they do that they can begin receiving food and medical 
supplies from a mission of the organization of american states 
many contras interviewed in the countryside have said they are 
indeed tired of fighting and want to go home others reportedly 
have staged a rash of highway robberies and the new government may 
find its hinterland controlled by small bands of 
rebelsturnedbandits 
the thieving probably will increase if the rebels have to 
continue living off ever more skeptical peasants 
ortega ortega the weapons will not be handed over was one 
of the chants that greeted daniel ortega as he walked into a 
baseball stadium for his last act as president turning over power 
to mrs chamorro 
the chant by an unruly sandinista crowd was a telling sign 
weapons mean power for the sandinista front which brooked little 
opposition during its decade of rule after forging itself on the 
premise of armed revolution 
and as long as the sandinista armed forces remain intact 
nicaraguans long inured to dictatorships propped up by control of 
the army understand that they retain the real power 
that power is constitutionally vested in the executive office 
but can rise against the president at any time it is a lesson 
deeply ingrained in latin american politics 
it also is something the contras have warned about and 
brandished as one more reason for their reluctance to disarm 
uno members also are angry over gen ortega staying on 
we campaigned throughout the countryside during the elections 
without money without anything said jaime cuadra explaining 
tuesday night at an uno cabinet meeting why he rejected his 
appointment as agriculture minister 
we told those peasants that once uno won the elections we 
would get rid of all the sandinistas now how am i going to look 
all those peasants if i take a post in the government and humberto 
is still there 
cuadra is president of the matagalpa coffee planters 
association a group of 260 private farmers in nicaraguas 
heartland 
he once was jailed by dictator anastasio somoza for smuggling 
guns for the sandinistas now he refuses to have anything to do 
with them 
gilberto cuadra president of nicaraguas most influential 
private business group the superior council of private enterprise 
also rejected his appointment as construction and transportation 
minister 
the men who are not related are influential both inside the 
country and among nicaraguas exiles while others were appointed 
in their place wednesday night their dissatisfaction is bound to 
find ready audiences 
at a party celebrating the change of government uno revelers 
chanted humberto must go 
vice president virgilio godoy a strong sandinista critic was 
at the party at the lakeside plaza of the revolution 
asked about mrs chamorros decision on gen ortega godoy said 
tonight were celebrating well get back to work tomorrow

president chaim herzog today invited rightwing 
leader yitzhak shamir to try to form a new government after labor 
party leader shimon peres failed to do so officials said 
the presidents office said peres informed herzog he had been 
unable to break a deadlock in the knesset or parliament and 
herzog asked shamir to come to his residence 
i am unable to establish a government based on a majority and 
i am therefore returning the mandate peres said in a letter to 
herzog according to a spokesman who demanded anonymity 
it was the first time in israels 42year history that a 
candidate selected by the president has failed to form a government 
the 66yearold peres was assigned the task of putting together 
a new coalition five weeks ago after shamir leader of the 
rightwing likud bloc lost a parliament vote of no confidence on 
march 15 
the vote was triggered by peres demand that shamir accept us 
terms for convening palestinianisraeli talks in cairo shamir 
declined saying he needed more time 
peres spent 35 days trying to forge an alliance that included 
both ultraorthodox religious parties and small leftwing factions 
he gave up the effort only hours before a midnight 6 pm edt 
deadline set by the president 
peres predicted shamir also would fail to form a coalition in 
the deadlocked parliament but he warned that if shamir succeeded 
he would create an extremist rightwing government the like of 
which israel never had 
in an earlier radio interview thursday peres blamed the 
opposition of leading rabbis for the failure of his effort 
he said two small religious parties changed direction after 
rabbi eliezer shach 96 condemned the secular groups that back 
labor 
peres indicated he had no chances left after a prospective likud 
defector economics minister yitzhak modai rejected labors 
offers his decision to stay with likud left peres with only 60 
supporters in the 120seat parliament 
israeli newspapers said intensive efforts were under way in 
likud to win back avraham sharir a former tourism minister who 
defected to labor 
shamir will have 21 days to form a coalition and a possible 
extension of an additional 21 days 
peres was given a 15day extension on april 11 after his initial 
21day mandate expired 
the yediot ahronot daily said likud hoped to muster a majority 
of 65 within several days that majority would include extreme 
rightwing factions and ultraorthodox religious parties

us and soviet negotiators today ended their 
latest round of talks on chemical weapons and the soviets said 
there would be no accord on destroying stockpiles unless the united 
states agrees to halt production 
both sides said however that they hoped a draft accord could 
be signed at the washington summit between presidents bush and 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the agreement already reached in principle would reduce 
superpower stockpiles to 5000 tons each following up on a 
proposal first submitted by bush in a speech to the un general 
assembly last year 
the united states says that by taking the lead in destruction 
the superpowers would give new impetus to the multilateral talks on 
a chemical weapons ban in the 40nation geneva conference on 
disarmament 
us chief negotiator stephen ledogar told the geneva conference 
on tuesday that such an accord would reduce the us stockpile to 
roughly 20 percent of the current level 
it would mean that the us total never officially disclosed up 
to now would be about 25000 to 30000 tons the soviet union has 
announced it has 50000 tons a figure us experts have said was 
below the actual size 
speaking to reporters ledogars soviet counterpart serguei 
batsanov said it was vital for moscow that the bilateral 
accord on destruction include a us commitment to stop the 
chemical weapons modernization program approved by congress in 1985 
after production had been suspended for 16 years the soviet union 
continued to build up its capability until 1987 
batsanov said continuation of us production could force the 
soviet union to reconsider its 1987 decision inclusion of a us 
commitment in the accord is a very important position for the 
soviet side he said 
it is a vital position he added i cannot imagine that we 
would agree to any bilateral accord that would not include that 
commitment

the supreme court today upheld an eviction 
order against 150 jewish settlers who occupied a complex owned by 
the greek orthodox church in the christian quarter of jerusalems 
old city 
the settlers who moved into st johns hospice on april 11 
must leave the 72room complex near the church of the holy 
sepulchre by tuesday said chief justice meir shamgar reading the 
ruling by a threejudge panel 
the judges said the panamabased company sbc that subleased 
st johns hospice to the settlers could keep up to 20 guards and 
maintenance employees there until the tenancy dispute was settled 
by a lower court 
the jewish settlement provoked deep anger among clerics and 
palestinians both christian and moslemthe state department called 
the settlement which came during easter week an insensitive and 
provocative act 
adding to the anger was the admission by the government after 
repeated denials that it had provided 18 million of the money 
for the settlement the admission brought protests from american 
proisraeli and jewish groups 
during arguments today the justice ministry contended that the 
continued presence of the settlers would inflame arabs and provoke 
violence 
every event in the area has influence on the fabric of 
relations problematic these days between members of different 
religions and faiths argued the ministrys representative nili 
arad 
she told the threejustice panel that the settlement site is a 
very sensitive placeboth sides recognize there has been a 
disturbance of the peace 
avraham socholovsky an attorney for the greek orthodox church 
which owns the compound accused the settlers of provocative 
behavior the group had entered the building with weapons he said 
it was like an occupation is this what they call subletting 
the old city captured from jordan during the 1967 middle east 
war is divided into moslem christian jewish and armenian 
quarters each group jealously guards its sector which contains 
holy sites and shrines and the slighest changes in the status quo 
have historically led to violence 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said the settlement brought 
horrible damage to jerusalem by heightening tensions between 
the religious communities 
in an unprecedented move leaders of 10 major christian sects 
said they would close all christian shrines in the holy land on 
friday in protest 
city officials had said they hoped a supreme court decision 
upholding the eviction orders would ease the tensions and prompt 
christian leaders to call off the demonstration 
the eviction would be the first time that settlers have been 
forced out of homes in occupied areas since april 1982 when the 
army oversaw the evacuation of 300 settlers from yamit in the sinai 
desert the sinai was returned to egypt under the 1979 peace treaty 
the jerusalem settlers claimed they had subleased the 
fourbuilding complex from an armenian christian tenant the greek 
orthodox church contends the lease is illegal two lower courts 
upheld the churchs claim and ordered the jews out 
the settlers have argued they were upholding the rights of jews 
to live anywhere in jerusalem

president bush gave a warm welcome to 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez today praising him for 
restoring his countrys economic health and for his struggle on 
behalf of democracy in nicaragua 
this is a time to celebrate said bush noting that perez had 
come here after attending the inaugural wednesday of nicaraguan 
president violeta chamorro 
with the venezuelan leader standing at his side during an 
arrival ceremony on the white house south lawn bush said the 
political evolution in nicaragua came about in part because perezs 
deep personal commitment to the advance of democracy never 
wavered 
discussing perezs economic policies bush said they have 
brought some pain to the venezuelan people but at the same time 
have laid the foundation for future growth 
perez in turn said that latin american nations are determined 
to modernize their institutions but complained that they dont 
always get understanding and encouragement from the 
industrialized democracies 
he added that latin america is now in a position to help shape a 
world of peaceful neighborliness 
perez was to be guest of honor tonight at a white house dinner 
after his morning meeting with bush and a luncheon hosted by 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
a senior us official who briefed reporters tuesday on 
condition of anonymity said perez has shown courage in sticking to 
an austerity program in the face of enormous domestic opposition 
its a model for how a democracy can change an economy the 
official said asserting that perez virtually had to decree a 
recession in order to get over the hump of economic reform 
perez imposed his austerity program after riots erupted about 
three months after he took office at the end of 1988 the us 
official said perez is a far different president this time compared 
with his initial term in office between 1974 and 1979 when he was 
far more supportive of a dominant state role in the economy 
his shock program among other benefits has improved export 
performance and reduced inflation the us official said 
the official said the shortterm consequences of austerity are 
serious in terms of unemployment but the medium to longterm 
effects are worse if nothing is done 
if you do it right if you make your country competitive then 
at one point youve got a country thats not only competitive 
the industries begin to work more efficiently and the standard of 
living goes up the official said 
one example of creditor confidence in perezs economic policies 
was demonstrated last month when venezuela and the banks that have 
lent it money reached agreement in principle on reducing the 
countrys 20 billion debt to those banks 
final agreement is expected in july 
venezuela has an overall foreign debt of 37 billion the fourth 
largest in latin america it has fallen behind on interest and 
principal payments in recent years 
perez will host a luncheon friday in honor of the members of the 
international banking community

lithuanian lawmakers decided today to impose food 
rationing on may 1 as the rebellious republic continued to struggle 
under an economic blockade that has reduced its supplies of fuel 
and medicine 
lithuania widened efforts to circumvent sanctions imposed last 
week by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who wants lithuania 
to rescind laws designed to implement its march 11 declaration of 
independence 
a lithuanian delegation was due in the northern russian city of 
leningrad on friday to talk with local officials about a direct 
exchange of goods either for hard currency or barter a leningrad 
journalist said 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene announced wednesday that 
lithuania had halted its usual supplies of meat milk and other 
food products to the rest of the soviet union she instead urged 
lithuania to settle its accounts with the republics almost in 
marketplace conditions of bartering for other goods 
gorbachev visiting the central russian city of sverdlovsk was 
asked by citizens why he had refused to open negotiations with the 
lithuanian leadership the soviet news agency tass reported he 
replied that the kremlin only negotiates with foreign governments 
not its own republics 
rita dapkus a spokeswoman for the lithuanian parliament or 
supreme council said lawmakers decided to ration some food 
products beginning may 1 although no details were released 
unlike most soviet republics lithuania produces all the meat 
and dairy goods it needs so the rationing presumably would be of 
those foodstuffs it does not produce or of meat and milk products 
earmarked for export 
gasoline already is being rationed in the republic of 38 
million people since gorbachev cut off its oil and curtailed 
natural gas deliveries by more than 80 percent individuals are 
limited to 78 gallons of gasoline per month 
the supreme council on wednesday also endowed its council of 
ministers with broad control over the economy and local governments 
during the period of the embargo ms dapkus said 
the powers include the ability to change supply plans transfer 
workers to different jobs and use natural and financial resources 
in a centralized manner she said 
effects of the embargo mounted hospitals running low on 
medicine discouraged all but emergency surgery radio vilnius 
reported in addition newspapers prepared to cut back the size of 
their editions by as much as half 
prunskiene said lithuania wanted to start immediate trade 
negotiations with sympathetic groups in moscow leningrad the 
oilrich tyumen region of siberia and the ukrainian city of lvov 
according to ms sinnig 
even if lithuania struck such deals however transporting the 
goods would be difficult because moscow controls the train truck 
routes and pipelines throughout the nation 
the kremlin began cutting off natural gas oil and other 
supplies to lithuania one week ago stepping up pressure on the 
baltic republics leaders to reverse their drive for independence 
lithuania forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 along with 
its sister republics of latvia and estonia declared independence 
on march 11 
lithuanian deputy prime minister algirdas brazauskas estimated 
the republics oil reserves would last until may 20 the soviet 
union is lithuanias sole supplier of fuel 
other shortages of grain sugar salt and margarine have been 
noted and soviet supplies of wood products also have been 
reportedly cut off

aerial pesticide spraying to attack an infestation 
of mediterranean fruit flies in one southern florida county began 
today after a threehour delay caused by equipment problems 
a helicopter loaded with syrupy insect bait spiked with the 
pesticide malathion took off at midmorning for up to seven hours of 
spraying over parts of dade county said phyllis habeck 
spokeswoman for the eradication task force in miami 
the helicopter had been airborne shortly after sunrise but 
quickly returned after spray nozzles clogged she said 
agriculture commissioner doyle conner ordered the spraying in 
dade county to protect floridas 14 billion citrus industry 
in southern california which is also waging a battle against 
the pest a federal judge ruled wednesday that malathion spraying 
to eradicate the medfly does not violate environmental aviation or 
pesticide laws 
us district judge alicemarie stotler said the cities of azusa 
and alhambra which sued to stop the spraying should have sought 
action instead by the federal aviation administration or the 
environmental protection agency 
deputy attorney general charles getz said the medfly infestation 
was declared a state emergency thus eliminating any need for 
approval from the cities 
in florida the spraying that began this morning was to cover a 
16squaremile area near miami international airport in about a 
month millions of sterile medflies will be released to foul up the 
pests breeding cyle 
the target area will be covered with pesticide in a 
concentration of 24 ounces or about three tablespoons of 
malathion per acre that compares with 31 ounces of malathion per 
acre routinely sprayed throughout florida to control mosquitoes 
the female medfly found tuesday in a port everglades back yard 
trap brought to 10 the number of medflies discovered in south 
florida in as many days 
officials were hopeful that the medfly in broward county just 
north of dade did not signal an outbreak but was a lone 
hitchhiker the other medflies were found in dade county 
there are no plans to spray broward county said habeck of the 
eradication task force 
a quarantine went into effect wednesday for an estimated 
100squaremile area including parts of miami springs hialeah and 
sections of unincorporated miami the quarantine means most produce 
wont be allowed out of the area until inspected 
medflies could strike a harsh blow to floridas citrus industry 
which was crippled by a christmas freeze medfly larvae hatch 
inside more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables turning 
them into mush 
environmentalists in california and here have objected to use of 
malathion contending too little is known about the chemicals 
longterm health effects 
in southern california where the medfly has spread into orange 
and grapefruit groves in some of the regions richest farmland 
aerial spraying of malathion in suburban neighborhoods has caused 
an uproar 
following the court ruling wednesday attorneys for azusa and 
alhambra said they would seek a court order forcing the faa to 
prohibit the helicopter sprayings which have occurred on almost a 
nightly basis over more than 400 square miles in southern 
california since july

prime minister lothar de maiziere of east 
germany called on his countrymen today to stop complaining that a 
proposed monetary union with west germany treats them unfairly 
de maizieres comments in parliament followed agreement on a 
basic 11 exchange rate of the strong west german mark for the 
faltering east german currency for wages pensions and savings up 
to 2300 
east germans across the country have rushed to their banks to 
withdraw savings above that level which would be exchanged at two 
east marks for one west mark under the proposal 
de maizieres government is trying to raise the 11 exchange 
level above the 2300 limit and he said his countrymen should 
keep their money in the bank until the issue has been resolved 
we have already made achievements in that area considering 
there is now a willingness to exchange wages at 11 in a country 
where until now there was a rate of 1465 not to mention the 
black market rates he said 
black market exchange rates shortly before the countrys first 
free elections march 18 were as high as eight east marks for one 
west german mark 
commenting on charges that the monetary proposal makes east 
germans secondclass citizens de maiziere said until now we 
have been third or fourth class 
de maiziere refused to discuss monetary union in detail saying 
it could disturb negotiations between the two germanys that began 
wednesday 
about 1000 farmers and foresters gathered outside the 
parliament building to demand protective measures after 
unification fearful of how they will fare in a market economy when

nucleargenerated electricity produced by 
the longdelayed 65 billion seabrook nuclear power plant will 
flow to consumers briefly this weekend for the first time plant 
officials said 
workers are expected to open valves directing steam to the 
plants huge turbinegenerator when the plant reaches about 10 
percent of its operating capacity said edward brown president of 
new hampshire yankee 
the plant has generated electricity briefly before but with 
steam generated by the friction of water rushing through a piping 
system not from nuclear power 
the plant has been conducting tests and operating at low power 
since receiving its federal operating license last month after a 
yearslong battle with critics who questioned its safety the 
reactor previously was taken to 10 percent power without generating 
electricity 
plant spokesman ron sher said today that the electricity will 
flow into the new england power network he said the generation 
would last for a few minutes and then longer periods would follow 
perhaps also during the weekend

new yorks top court today awarded the 
americas cup to the san diego yacht club ruling that the club 
legally won yacht racings most coveted prize and that 
sportsmanship was none of the courts business to decide 
possession of the trophy which was fought for as hard in the 
courts as on the water is worth millions of dollars to the host 
community during cup defenses 
the 52 ruling by new yorks court of appeals ends a legal 
battle for the 139yearold silver trophy that began even before 
the san diego yacht clubs speedy catamaran trounced the huge 
singlehulled yacht from new zealands mercury bay club in 
september 1988 
the question of whether particular conduct is sporting or 
fair is wholly distinct from the question of whether it is 
legal said judge fritz alexander writing for the court majority 
according to the americas cup deed of trust a 19th century 
document the new york court of appeals is the final arbiter of cup 
disputes 
challenger michael fay in a statement this morning from 
auckland new zealand said the ruling is final and we accept 
it he said he looked forward to another race in 1992 
the catamaran stars and stripes with dennis conner captain 
easily defeated mercury bays yacht new zealand in two match races 
in the pacific ocean just off san diego in 1988 
the legal battle had begun the previous year in february 1987 
conners san diego club had won the cup back from australia 
avenging a loss four years earlier when the aussies became the 
first racers from outside the united states to take possession of 
the cup 
then five months later fay issued an unwelcome challenge to 
the san diegans calling for a radical departure from the 
traditional americas cup format he wanted the race held in 1988 
instead of waiting four years until 1991 and he wanted to use a 
boat roughly twice the size as the 12meter yachts that had been in 
use in recent years 
san diego rejected the challenge but lost in the first round of 
court battles the club then made a countermove deciding to use a 
twinhulled catameran which is far faster and more manueverable 
that a large singlehulled yacht that led to the onesided victory 
in the race in 1988 that was upheld today 
fay had complained that by using the catamaran san diego made a 
farce of the race and broke rules of sportsmanship 
in fact the disparity between the two crafts was so large that 
chief judge sol wachtler during court arguments in february said 
racing a monohull against a catamaran was like putting a new york 
city bus against a ferrari 
while there have been disputes over the americas cup in the 
past this was the first to reach new yorks highest court 
lower state courts had split on the question of who deserved the 
cup in march 1989 state supreme court justice carmen ciparick 
disqualified conner and awarded the trophy to mercury bay but a 
midlevel new york appeals court reversed that decision in september 
and returned the trophy to san diego 
in a 31page dissent to todays opionion judge stewart hancock 
jr said that san diego had a higher obligation to attempt to make 
the race a fair match because the yacht club was the defender of 
the cup and therefore its trustee

one of nine people injured in an explosion 
at an aluminum recycling plant died today and the plant manager 
suggested that a foreign material in the scrap metal caused the 
explosion 
the explosion wednesday at the culp smelting and refining co 
occurred just after workers put a compressed bundle of aluminum 
into the main furnace said plant manager bob pine 
the bales of industrial aluminum sheets are melted into ingots 
to be used in manufacturing automobiles and other products 
there appeared to be some foreign item of material that was in 
with scrap aluminum he said but he added that he could only 
speculate about the possible cause of the blast 
pine said wednesdays blast followed a smaller explosion tuesday 
night in the same smelting area that injured one worker and other 
less serious blasts he said an investigation was under way to 
determine the supplier of the aluminum bundle 
john hall of the occupational safety and health administration 
which has begun an investigation said that such a blast could 
occur if scrap material containing water was lowered into the 
furnace 
anything could get into the metal he said he said it is 
too early to tell exactly what caused the blast and that that it 
might take osha several weeks to make a determination 
the explosion which was felt 10 miles away in rainbow city 
blew apart the furnace and part of the building 
one of those injured jeffrey howell 23 of gadsden died today 
at university hospital at birmingham hospital spokesman hank black 
said howell was burned over 90 percent of his body 
two other workers remained in intensive care but their condition 
was upgraded from critical to serious black said six other 
employees were treated and released for minor injuries

go into town wearing jeans and opennecked shirts

pupils said a statement issued thursday 
we try to keep a balance between comfort and looking 
respectable if the more informal rules for windsor result in 
scruffiness we shall review them again anderson said

traditional uniform at work but to be in tune with the times when 
relaxing

a us sailor began serving a 
60day sentence thursday for injuring and insulting two filipino 
reporters in what officials said was the first case of an american 
serviceman being jailed here 
prosecutor dorentino floresta said michael carpaneto a crewman 
on the uss midway was taken to the olongapo city jail three weeks 
after a court convicted him of the charges no hometown was given 
for the 27yearold sailor 
olongapo is the home of the us navys subic bay base floresta 
said that since 1980 95 percent of the complaints lodged against 
us military personnel in olongapo were dismissed before reaching 
trial 
of those cases that went to trial only 1 percent ended in 
conviction in those cases americans opted to serve sentences in 
the us navy brig or were sent out of the country the prosecutor 
said this is unprecedented floresta said of carpanetos case 
subic bay is among six us military installations in the 
philippines on a lease that expires in september 1991 manila and 
washington are to begin talks in may on whether to extend the 
agreement 
opponents of the bases have complained that us personnel 
involved in crimes against filipinos escape prosecution or arrest 
because american authorities intercede on their behalf 
carpaneto was accused of punching and shouting profanities at 
two filipino reporters during an altercation last year the two 
filipinos refused a 50 outofcourt settlement and hired a lawyer 
to pursue the case 
after nearly a years delay carpaneto was convicted april 4 he 
was sentenced to 60 days in jail and ordered to pay damages of more 
than 1700 to the plaintiffs

a hospital has suggested that top 
communist party and government officials be prosecuted for failing 
to take measures to reduce the impact of the chernobyl nuclear 
disaster a newspaper said thursday 
the daily mlada fronta said the proposal was made by the staff 
of a hospital in novy jicin 156 miles southeast of prague 
the newspaper also published an open letter by the dailys 
editor in chief libor sevcik to prosecutors he accused 
authorities of official silence and inaction in the wake of the

this country to danger by not fulfilling their duties and by 
doing nothing to protect the lives and health of the 
inhabitants the letter said

reactors at the chernobyl plant in the soviet ukraine caught fire 
and exploded april 26 1986 unofficial reports say 250 people died 
as a result of the accident

area and sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world 
after the catastrophe czechoslovak authorities failed to warn 
people about possible dangers 
while all top representatives of the ruling communist party 
were informed and were eating clean food imported from abroad for 
hard currency the uninformed mothers were exposing their infants 
to the danger of the radioactive fallout feeding them contaminated

the french fur industry is fighting back against 
slumping sales a series of warm winters and an international 
animal rights campaign waged by conservation groups celebrities 
and others 
two top fashion houses yves saint laurent and christian dior 
staged shows wednesday and thursday to present their new fur styles 
for the 1990s 
the shows featured younger sportier styles putting 
oldfashioned minks into the closet and bringing out swirly light 
looks blousons and furlined luxury cashmere taffeta or poplin 
styles 
the shows came amid a growing movement against furs in the 
united states and europe the industrys most visible setback was 
the closing in february of the fur salon at londons giant harrods 
department store it said sales had dropped more than 40 percent in 
the past four years 
some of the new styles seemed to anticipate the hostility that 
has been directed at fur wearers 
dior designer gianfranco ferre hid some of the furs in his 
garments making furs reversible dying them or disguising them to 
look like fabric 
his new angle on astrakhan came out in blazers patterned to look 
like chevron tweed but the disguised fur outfits dont come 
cheaply even though featured in the boutique rather than the haute 
couture line a blazer will sell for nearly 4000 
diors show was grouped under either boutique luxury 
readytowear or haute couture categories both were designed by 
ferre who said its wonderful to work with such fabulous furs 
these included minks and sables decolored and dyed in shades 
of gold or caramel the boutique collection had a younger look 
featuring trendy duffels lamblined moire trench coats or blouson 
jackets with big collars one model dyed red tied by a moire 
taffeta bow at the waist 
ferre had fun using his favorite organzas and chiffons as bows 
at waists and necks underneath or topping the furs 
one of ferres favorite shapes was a terrific short full 
pyramid also appearing in shortie jackets 
saint laurents fur collection was designed by robert merloz 
who has been at the house since graduating four years ago from the 
paris chambre syndicale couture school 
merloz presented garments that included soft trapeze or shortie 
trench coats in moire poplin or taffeta lined in lamb or mink 
he used plenty of curly persian lamb touches putting wavy 
piping on nappa leather coats with bold heartshaped buttons 
or contrasting dark gray lapels and cuffs on swirly little white 
beaver short coats 
merloz also draped chinchilla sable or mink coats with ribbons 
over lace and satin dresses 
taking a bow after the show the parisianborn merloz 25 wiped 
away tears of relief and happiness 
i was trying to give furs a lighter more supple and yet full 
look he said 
will merloz be the successor to yves saint laurent at 53 saint 
laurent is often ailing and rumors are flying about his possible 
retirement 
following a nervous collapse just before his last readytowear 
collection saint laurent was hospitalized and missed the show 
according to associates he is resting outside of paris and plans 
to begin work again in june 
pierre berge chairman of the saint laurent empire declined to 
discuss a possible successor but when asked if saint laurent would 
be designing the winter couture collection to come out in july he 
exclaimed i certainly hope so

this time it really is the end of the line a 
chorus line broadways longest running show plays its 6137th 
and final performance saturday night 
the evening a benefit for the new york shakespeare festival 
has a top ticket price of 500 and the 1483seat shubert theater 
has been sold out for weeks the last performance promises to be an 
event especially with most of the original cast in the audience 
and possibly on stage at the finale and it will be a celebration 
and remembrance of michael bennett the man behind the musical who 
died of aids in 1987 at age 44 
in a funny way we all felt the show wasnt going to close 
said tom porter who probably has seen the broadway production more 
than anybody but now were beginning to realize it certainly is 
going to happen and ill miss it when the show closes there 
wont be a michael bennett musical on broadway 
porter the musicals production stage manager has been with 
a chorus line for more than 12 years first with the chicago 
company for eight months and then in new york from a spot in the 
back of the house or by watching a television monitor in his 
backstage office he keeps an eye on each performance 
a chorus line tells the stories of 17 dancers who compete 
for eight roles in a big broadway musical it was bennetts baby 
born out of more than 40 hours of taped conversations by broadway 
dancers who talked about their lives loves hopes and fears 
during an extended series of workshops at the new york 
shakespeare festival bennett conceived the show hiring nicholas 
dante and james kirkwood to fashion the book from the tapes marvin 
hamlisch to write the music and ed kleban the lyrics 
the show which arrived at the shubert on july 25 1975 after 
performances at the shakespeare festival offbroadway was an 
immediate hit more than 65 million people have paid 150 million 
to see the musical on broadway the show which also has been 
performed in more than 20 countries has made 38 million in net 
profit for the festival 
but grosses have been dwindling and the show incurred heavy 
losses last january joseph papp head of the shakespeare festival 
announced feb 21 that the show would end its 15year run the 
following month it set off a boxoffice stampede with grosses 
doubling to nearly 400000 a week the original closing date 
march 31 was extended by four weeks 
the extension enabled the show to do a special benefit on april 
8 bennetts birthday which raised more than 50000 for equity 
fights aids 
it was an emotional night porter recalled the dancers 
went back to their dressing rooms changed their clothes and the 
audience was still on its feet applauding 
in the weeks since papp announced the closing the news media 
have descended on the shubert 
i think we started outdoing the statue of liberty in terms of 
visitors said porter 
television crews some from as far away as sweden and japan 
were nightly visitors original cast members sang and cried on phil 
donahues and geraldo riveras tv talk shows current performers in 
the show were profiled on nightline with ted koppel 
the musical spawned four books in the last year including a 
biography of bennett by boston globe theater critic kevin kelly and 
on the line remembrances by members of the original cast 
according to ken mandelbaum author of a chorus line and the 
musicals of michael bennett the musicals main legacy is the way 
it was put together through the workshops 
from then on almost every musical that got to broadway went 
through some form of workshop mandelbaum said when the 
workshop of a chorus line started there was no script really and 
no songs they went into rehearsal to create the show 
today he added most directors and producers of musicals dont 
use workshops as effectively as bennett did they use them mostly 
as additional auditions or as extra rehearsals 
a chorus line also represents broadway in a way that 
probably no other show did mandelbaum added no other musical 
was so about broadway and as it traveled around the country 
people really got that feeling

mongolias president will visit china next month 
and formally end decades of strained relations between the asian 
neighbors the foreign ministry announced thursday 
president punsalmaagiin ochirbat will tour china from may 49 
he will be the first mongolian head of government to visit china 
since 1962 the ministry said 
ochirbat became chairman of the grand peoples hural or 
parliament last month in changes that resulted from weeks of 
protests for democratic reforms 
the reforms promised by mongolias new leaders reportedly worry 
the conservative beijing government and mongolian sources say 
china has stepped up surveillance of its mongol minority in inner 
mongolia 
in china ochirbat will be seeking greater economic exchanges a 
relaxation of border tensions and access to a chinese port as a 
transit point for mongolian trade 
china and mongolia have often been opponents in war with 
genghis khans successors ruling china for a century and china 
later occupying mongolia 
the mongolians were allied with the soviet union in gaining 
independence and establishing the worlds second communist state in 
1921 inner mongolia with a heavy chinese presence stayed under 
beijings rule 
china did not recognize mongolian independence until the chinese 
communists came to power in 1949 
china and mongolia maintained good relations in the 1950s but 
mongolia joined its patron state the soviet union in splitting 
with china in the early 1960s relations began to thaw as the 
soviet union and china patched up their differences in recent years

the government vowed thursday to crack 
down on a growing wave of labor unrest and thousands of riot 
police surrounded the countrys largest shipyard where striking 
workers have put up barricades 
the governments action came a day after thousands of workers at 
the shipyard of hyundai heavy industries co went on strike labor 
protests also continued at the staterun kbs television and radio 
network 
the government issued a statement thursday vowing to act firmly 
against illegal labor protests it warned that if unchecked the 
protests would increase social unrest and hurt south koreas 
sluggish economy 
the government has decided to take strong countermeasures 
against spreading unlawful labor strikes the statement said 
the warning came after an emergency meeting of economic and law 
enforcement cabinet ministers presided over by prime minister kang 
younghoon to discuss the labor unrest which mainly involves 
political issues 
the warning did not specify what measures the government would 
take but there were strong indications of possible police action 
police were on increased alert after militant unions in other 
major industrial centers threatened protest actions in support of 
the striking shipyard workers 
in the southern industrial city of changwon thousands of 
workers rallied at a dozen companies threatening to begin a 
general strike if police moved into the hyundai shipyard 
militant unions affiliated with the dissident national labor 
federation said they would stage a nationwide support strike on may 
day radical leaders urged students to support striking workers 
police reinforcements were rushed to the hyundai shipyard in the 
coastal city of ulsan about 200 miles southeast of seoul 
government officials said 
no official figures were given but newspaper reports said up to 
12000 riot police gathered near the shipyard police brought in 
bulldozers helicopters and fire trucks newspapers said 
witnesses said shipyard workers had pitched 200 tents and put up 
iron barricades at the main gate and other strategic points they 
also said workers had stacked steel bits stones and firebombs in 
anticipation of a police attack 
in march 1989 riot police launched an air sea and land attack 
on the shipyard that ended a violent threemonth labor protest the 
dispute began when workers broke away from a companysanctioned 
union and set up a separate union to demand better pay and working 
conditions 
the latest strike broke out just days before wage negotiations 
were to begin but union leaders said the dispute was not over 
wages 
they said the shipyard workers were demanding the release of 
four union leaders who were jailed earlier this year for labor 
protests and the dropping of criminal charges against three 
fugitive union activists involved in last years strike 
government officials said the shipyard strike is illegal because 
workers did not go through the required legal steps including a 
coolingoff period 
union leaders say the complexity of labor laws make it virtually 
impossible to stage a legal strike 
about 20000 of the shipyards 24000 employees are members of 
the union but union leaders said the number of workers 
participating in the strike had dropped to 12000 since police 
surrounded the shipyard 
in another development more than 1500 kbs workers staged a 
sitdown protest in the lobby of the networks seoul headquarters 
to press their demands that their new president resign theey 
contend the new network head suh kiwon is progovernment and 
antireform 
kbs workers have staged daily protests involving up to 4000 
people for the past two weeks 
the networks three television channels and five radio stations 
have been crippled by the dispute broadcasting old movies 
shortened news casts documentaries and music 
at hyundai motor co in ulsan the nations largest car maker 
union leaders said thursday they would go on strike may 10 to press 
their demand for an 189 percent wage hike

in the new atmosphere of reduced 
eastwest tensions the nato alliance may end controversial plans 
to add a new shortrange missile to its nuclear arsenal sources 
said thursday 
the north atlantic treaty organization also could decide in the 
coming months to make cuts in its stockpile of nuclear artillery 
said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
theres a possibility that there could be an announcement of 
unilateral reductions of those arms said one source 
a diplomat said its a near certainty that the allies will 
agree to end the nuclear missile project and to trim their 
battlefield nuclear artillery 
all these things are being discussed right now said another 
diplomat shortrange nuclear forces is very much a hot subject 
the sources emphasized that no final decisions have been made 
us officials said in washington last week that the bush 
administration was postponing indefinitely the development of new 
shortrange nuclear missiles that were to be based in west germany 
natos defense ministers meet may 910 in canada to discuss the 
wests future nuclear posture at a time of tremendous change in 
east european countries once considered adversaries 
aides to the defense ministers meet friday in brussels to 
discuss nuclear issues in advance of the canada meeting 
in recent months nato diplomats have said there was dwindling 
support for the us plan to develop a new more powerful 
generation of shortrange nuclear missiles it would replace the 
aging lance surfacetosurface missile 
one source said there was a possibility the defense 
ministers at their canada meeting would declare the project dead 
another said it was unlikely a third said he had not seen any 
draft statements making such a reference 
there is strong opposition to the new weapon in west germany 
that is where most of the missiles would be based 
the lance was introduced in 1972 and military analysts say it 
will become obsolete in 1995 its maximum range is about 75 miles 
its replacement would be designed to hit a target more than 250 
miles away just under the limits of the 1987 intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty 
at a summit last may president bush and other nato leaders 
agreed to delay until 1992 the decision on deploying the new weapon 
the decision was part of a summit compomise that linked 
reductions in conventional or nonnuclear weapons to the start of 
negotiations on clipping shortrange nuclear forces 
germany had demanded immediate negotiations with the sovietled 
warsaw pact on slashing nuclear weapons us and british officials 
wanted attention focused first on negotiations in vienna to reduce 
conventional arms 
negotiators want to wrap up a conventional arms accord by the 
end of this year once a treaty is signed officials say the two 
sides could quickly enter into bargaining on reducing battlefield 
nuclear weapons 
in vienna us and soviet negotiators said petty bargaining was 
slowing the talks on troop reductions 
the talks began in march 1989 with the goal of reaching an 
accord before the end of 1990 
the superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195000 troops each 
in central europe with the united states able to keep up to 30000 
troops elsewhere in europe 
however the negotiations have been bogged down in definitions 
of weapons categories the two sides also disagree on the number of 
combat aircraft each side should have 
nato has proposed a ceiling of 4700 aircraft for each side 
with an additional 500 air defense interceptors but the east would 
like a higher ceiling

alluring eyes and a sunny smile are not enough 
if you want to find an attractive face a new hightech study 
suggests look for one that is basically average 
averageness is probably a necessary condition for 
attractiveness said researcher judith langlois of the university 
of texas at austin 
the bad news for ordinary joes and janes is that as langlois 
put it there are probably not that many faces that are exactly 
average in the way she studied 
langlois and a colleague used a computer to construct faces that 
blended facial features of up to 32 people averaging out such 
features as nose length and chin prominence in this way the more 
faces that went into a composite the more it represented an 
average face for the population of collegeage students from which 
it was drawn 
when other students judged the attractiveness of the composites 
and of individual faces without being told which was which they 
found the composites made from 16 or 32 faces to be more attractive 
than the real faces that went into them and the more faces went 
into a composite the more attractive it became 
although other factors probably make movie stars unusually 
handsome or beautiful ill bet their faces have the fundamental 
attribute of averageness langlois said wednesday and without 
that they would not be very attractive 
we dont know yet about all the other components of 
attractiveness but i would say this is a major one and its a 
required one 
langlois presents the study in the march issue of the journal 
psychological science with lori roggman who is now at the 
university of arkansas in fayetteville 
i think the research is absolutely fascinating commented 
university of minnesota psychologist ellen berscheid 
i would say this is about the first time anyone has even begun 
to unravel what the standards of beauty are she said 
but she cautioned that the experiment involved faces of white 
collegeage students and said similar work must be tried with 
faces from other racial and age groups to see if the results still 
apply 
if the principle does apply generally langlois said it might 
help dentists and surgeons in reconstructing faces shattered by 
accidents or disfigured by abnormalities the average face for a 
person of the patients age and race could be used as a guide for 
the reconstruction she said 
langlois said the appeal of an average face might be explained 
by evolution individuals best exhibiting the central tendencies of 
a population might be preferred for mating because their genes 
might be less likely to contain harmful mutations she suggested 
another possible explanation is that in a sense average faces 
might be the most facelike if humans evolved to respond to faces 
to get social information they may respond most strongly to the 
most facelike faces they see the researchers wrote 
previous studies show that even infants prefer faces that adults 
consider more attractive langlois said 
the new study used faces of 192 undergraduate psychology 
students at the texas university plus the composites for each 
sex a computer built composite photos that blended two four 
eight 16 or 32 faces 
attractiveness was judged by a different group of 300 students 
using a scale of one to five with five being the most attractive 
male individual faces averaged a rating of 251 compared with 
327 for composites of 32 male faces for females individual faces 
averaged 243 compared with 325 for 32face composites

unexpected strength in the us economy has 
led many analysts to double their estimates of growth for the first 
part of the year some pegging it as high as 3 percent rather than 
the puny 1 percent they thought earlier 
but some economists noting continued high interest rates as 
well as the warm weather and other special factors pushing growth 
so far this year say the pace cannot be sustained 
and inflation running hotter than expected is also a worry 
the gross national product the nations output of goods and 
services grew 3 percent in 1989 but had slowed to a rate of 11 
percent in the final quarter of the year the figures for the first 
three months of 1990 will be released friday 
where many private economists had predicted growth of between 1 
percent and 15 percent for the januarymarch period they now 
foresee an increase between 2 percent and 25 percent some believe 
it could be as high as 3 percent 
while opinions differ on the growth rate during the rest of this 
year there is virtual unanimity that the federal reserve has 
achieved its soft landing slowing the economy without tipping 
it into a recession 
but the central bank so far has not been able to achieve the 
goal that made it want to slow things down in the first place 
holding back price increases inflation rose from 46 percent in 
1989 to an annual rate of 85 percent in the first quarter of 1990 
as measured by the labor departments consumer price index 
the weather that helped propel business growth also pushed up 
prices especially for food and energy although they have since 
moderated 
at the same time the stronger economy created about 726000 
jobs during the first three months of 1990 driving unemployment 
down to 52 percent its lowest rate in a year 
lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser at the wefa group in 
bala cynwyd pa said his forecasting service has changed its 
firstquarter growth prediction from between 1 percent and 15 
percent in late december to 25 percent now 
and it actually wouldnt surprise me if it is higher than 
that he told a reporter 
robert g dederick chief economist with the northern trust co 
in chicago also said in an interview that firstquarter gnp will 
show a 25 percent gain up from his 1 percent forecast in january 
if its outside the 225 percent range it most likely will 
be on the up side rather than the down side he added 
michael k evans of evans economics a washington forecasting 
service also predicted a 25 percent growth rate and is looking 
for a pretty solid growth rate probably 3 percent or a little 
higher for the remaining three quarters of the year 
chimerine on the other hand says he is reluctant to conclude 
that the economy is picking up steam for the long run 
some of what were getting in the first quarter is 
temporary he contended saying that growth will advance only 18 
percent or 19 percent for the year 
a lot of people are ignoring the fact that over the last four 
months longterm interest rates have moved up almost a percentage 
point he said so were clearly going to see construction and 
interestrate sensitive sectors of the economy remain very weak and 
may weaken more as we move through the year 
chimerines projection mirrors the 19 percent consensus 
forecast in the latest survey of 51 top economists by blue chip 
economic indicators in sedona ariz 
economic strength in the firstquarter included building 
construction particularly housing which was much stronger than 
expected but analysts point to unusually warm weather in january 
and february which caused builders to borrow activity from 
subsequent months 
the trade deficit also narrowed but a stronger dollar may make 
further improvement difficult since us goods exported overseas 
will be more expensive while imported products will be cheaper and 
thus more attractive to american buyers 
other pluses were strong expansion of business investment and 
moderate consumer spending increases

plo leader yasser arafat said thursday 
the influx of soviet jews to israel is more ominous for the arabs 
than the creation of the state of israel 
he made the statement in a speech to a crowd gathered for dawn 
prayers marking the moslem feast of eid alfitr the feast ends the 
holy month of ramadan during which moslems fast from dawn to dusk 
arafat urged arab and islamic nations to confront the issue of 
increased soviet jewish emigration with effective measures and 
not with mere resolutions 
the jewish immigration is a more dangerous conspiracy than 
those of 1947 and 1948 he said 
the immigration has been spurred by growing anxiety over the 
soviet unions future and the spread of antisemitism there as 
well as by us visa restrictions it is expected to total 100000 
this year 
about 24200 soviet jews have gone to israel so far this year 
according to figures released by the israeli government

sweden and norway which were in the

years ago said thursday many of their lakes and rivers are still 
dangerously contaminated 
finland wedged between its scandinavian neighbors and the 
soviet union escaped with less contamination because it had no 
rainfall for several weeks after the accident april 26 1986 
winds carried radiation from the nuclear reactor in the soviet 
ukraine to the wilderness of central sweden and norway 1200 miles 
to the northwest 
radioactive cesium soaked into the ground contaminating lichen 
and other plants eaten by wildlife 
finnish scientists said they were continuing studies to 
determine if fallout had increased the incidence of cancer first 
results should be available next year 
swedish researchers said 14000 lakes or about 15 percent 
still contained fish too contaminated to eat it may be 30 years 
before the lakes will be considered safe 
fish have been found containing radiation levels 66 times higher 
than the permitted level according to researchers who examined 644 
lakes 
in norway newspapers reported that the level of cancercausing 
substances in the most effected regions was 10 times normal levels

more than 30 prominent figures urged congress 
on thursday to assure the survival of the national endowment for 
the arts in the face of attacks from conservative lawmakers over 
federal support for controversial art 
in a fullpage open letter to congress published in the new york 
times and the washington post the signers strongly supported the 
grantmaking endowment as the primary catalyst for extending the 
arts to millions of americans in the last 25 years 
it is unfortunate that recently the nea has become a subject 
of political controversy the letter said misrepresentation 
and misunderstanding threaten its integrity perhaps even its 
survival 
the 31 signers urged congress to safeguard what has evolved 
from a national resource to a national treasure as the house and 
senate consider legislation authorizing a fiveyear extension of 
the endowment an independent 171 million federal agency 
the letter published in the name of the bipartisan emergency 
committee for the arts was initiated by new york publisher 
arthur levitt jr andrew heiskell former chairman of time inc 
david rockefeller former chairman of chase manhattan bank and 
former postmaster general winton blount 
the other signers included arthur ochs sulzberger publisher of 
the new york times s dillon ripley former secretary of the 
smithsonian institution chicago business executive marshall field 
derek bok president of harvard university former treasury 
secretary c douglas dillon former democratic national chairman 
robert s strauss vernon e jordan former president of the 
national urban league and philanthropist paul mellon 
the neas political troubles began last summer when sen jesse 
helms rnc protested the agencys previous financial support 
for traveling exhibitions of controversial works by the late 
photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano 
the mapplethorpe show the object of an antiobscenity court 
battle in cincinnati includes several homoerotic images and 
pictures of nude children serrano was criticized for depicting a 
crucifix submerged in urine 
at helms urging congress voted last fall to prohibit the nea 
from financing works that may be considered obscene and lack 
serious literary artistic political or scientific value rep 
dana rohrabacher rcalif and conservative religious groups are 
demanding that congress eliminate all funds for arts endowment 
attacks on the nea have continued despite repeated declarations 
by endowment chairman john e frohnmayer that the agency will 
refuse to finance obscene art this agency is not a pornographer 
this agency is not a blasphemer he said during a recent 
interview with television evangelist pat robertson 
levitt said the letter to congrss published thursday was 
prompted by its sponsors fears of an imminent threat to the 
arts endowments reauthorization because of the controversy 
levitt said the issues raised by helms and his conservative 
allies were dangerous issues in that they are the kind of issues 
it is very easy to mislead the public about 
he said the letters signers many of them influential in local 
arts institutions around the country believed it was time to 
remind congress of the endowments achievements in sparking 
private communitybased support for the arts through matching 
federal grants

former us surgeon general c 
everett koop says promoting oldfashioned morality is the key to 
preventing deadly diseases 
at the base of each one of these painful tragic destructive 
and of course preventable health problems is an equally tragic 
and destructive human behavior koop told 500 people wednesday at 
a fundraiser at butterworth hospital 
the donations will go toward research education and patient 
care at the hospital which marked its 100th anniversary tuesday 
koop who retired as surgeon general last year said the biggest 
lesson he learned was the link between peoples behavior and 
disease including smoking alcohol abuse unwanted pregnancies 
child abuse domestic violence and aids 
stern warnings about behavior can eventually lose their 
effectiveness if they are used too often koop said instead 
we must affirm in the next generation a new sense of respect for 
each human life 
perhaps a return to good oldfashioned morality will do the 
trick

a radical iranian newspaper said thursday 
that a congressional resolution endorsing a united jerusalem as the 
capital of israel will delay the release of western hostages in 
lebanon 
syria also denounced the resolution by the us house of 
representatives saying it emphasized an american desire to defy 
arabs and moslems by stealing their rights without any lawful or 
historical justification 
irans daily islamic republic said the congressional move made 
things more complicated by blocking the way for solving problems 
calling the resolution a deliberate snub to world moslems it 
suggested washington does not want to save the seven americans and 
10 other western hostages in captivity in lebanon 
the hostage takers will delay their release in a natural 
reaction it said 
excerpts of the papers commentary were carried by the islamic 
republic news agency which is monitored in nicosia 
the nonbinding resolution approved by the house on tuesday goes 
against longstanding us policy of refusing to recognize jerusalem 
as israels capital 
the eastern half of jerusalem was occupied by israel during the 
1967 arabisraeli war it contains the thirdholiest site in islam 
after the mosques in mecca and medina in saudi arabia 
the resolution was passed two days after us educator robert 
polhill was released by proiranian lebanese captors after 1182 
days in captivity 
both iran and polhills kidnappers the islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine had called on the united states and the 
west for a goodwill gesture to facilitate the release of the other 
hostages 
along with syria iranian president hashemi rafsanjani is 
believed to have played a major role in gaining polhills release 
in damascus the syrian capital a government statement said 
arab countries should work to overturn the houses unfair 
decision before it becomes official us policy 
a similar resolution was passed last month by the us senate 
provoking an outcry in the arab world 
the syrian state newspaper althawra said the senate resolution 
was a test balloon and that arab inaction had allowed the house of 
representatives to act 
it is not enough for the arabs to cry they must find a way to 
support a powerful struggle the editorial said 
the iranian newspaper which is aligned with rafsanjanis 
radical rivals said the timing of the resolution is not 
coincidental and it shows that the us does not want the hostage 
issue to be ended once and for all 
the us representatives either lack political insight and 
have launched on this foolish move or have signed the resolution 
deliberately to stop the process of the release of hostages the 
paper said 
most of the western hostages in lebanon are believed held by 
proiranian shiite factions 
the longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985 
in sidon lebanon meanwhile four officials of the 
international committee of the red cross arrived to explore chances 
for the release of two kidnapped red cross workers 
their arrival followed appeals by libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
and lebanese and palestinian groups for the quick release of 
orthopedic technicians emanuel christen 33 and elio erriquez 24 
the pair were abducted from the red cross orthopedic center for 
artificial limbs in sidon provincial capital of south lebanon on 
oct 6

the bush administration is resisting heavy 
pressure to place japan on a trade hit list but members of 
congress are threatening to block approval of other trade 
agreements unless there is a change of heart 
us trade representative carla hills gave strong indications 
wednesday that japan will not be targeted a second time as a 
country deemed to have erected the most onerous barriers against 
sales of american products 
the issue was to be reviewed today by president bushs cabinet 
with a final decision expected before the end of the week 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the matter is being 
considered by the domestic policy council and president bush has 
not made a decision he said he did not know when the decision 
would be made the deadline is monday and a decision then is a 
possibility he said 
the administration a year ago targeted japan brazil and india 
under a tough section of the 1988 trade law that provides for 
economic retaliation against countries that fail to remove 
objectionable trade barriers 
the provision of the law known as super 301 was written with 
japan in mind several members of the senate finance committee let 
hills know wednesday that they believe japan should be targeted 
again 
however hills objected that the super 301 designation was not 
appropriate in current circumstances and called on congress to give 
her more negotiating flexibility 
she lavished praise on japan and the government of prime 
minister toshiki kaifu saying the japanese had made significant 
strides in the past month to reduce trade tensions between the two 
countries 
we have witnessed a remarkable transformation in japanese 
public attitudes about its protectionist trade policy hills 
said praising kaifus government as responsive and decisive 
she announced to the committee a lastminute agreement in which 
japan met american demands to remove barriers blocking sales of 
us forest products she said the pact which lowers tariffs and 
revises japanese building code standards should boost sales of 
us wood products by more than 1 billion in the next year 
the forest products issue was one of three raised in last years 
super 301 case against japan the other issues expanding sales of 
us supercomputers and satellites were resolved in recent weeks 
as japanese officials rushed to make concessions in hopes of 
heading off designation again as a country with unfair trade 
barriers 
despite the concessions many us industry groups and members 
of congress are calling on the administration to target japan again 
to keep pressure on a country that accounts for nearly half of 
americas overall trade deficit 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
the administration would be making a serious mistake if it failed 
to cite japan he contended that the country has a poor record in 
honoring its marketopening commitments 
bentsen and sen john danforth rmo held out the threat that 
congress would block legislation needed to implement pending trade 
agreements with eastern european countries the soviet union and 
china and new rules being negotiated as part of a global round of 
trade liberalization talks 
if the administration ignores a trade law that congress has 
constitutionally enacted i am concerned it may poison the well for 
the consideration of those agreements bentsen told hills 
some in the administration have argued that no country should be 
cited this year for fear that it would be wrong to antagonize other 
nations when the united states is seeking their help to conclude 
trade liberalization talks under the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade which regulates world trade 
but sen john heinz rpa said failure to cite japan and other 
countries would send a dangerous and inaccurate message that 
the administration is not serious about protecting the interests of 
us businesses 
danforth complained that the administration was confusing 
achieving agreements with obtaining results 
sen donald riegle dmich told hills that he would push for 
legislation to extend the requirement for the administration to 
target countries which was to expire this year 
however sens bob packwood rore and daniel patrick 
moynihan dny both said japan should be rewarded for its 
newfound willingness to negotiate

stole it 
rita reichel last saw the 200pound brass school bell in her 
basement around christmas now its gone and she has no idea who 
could have carted it up the steep stone steps 
i know it would take at least two strong men said reichel 
who recently discovered the bell missing and reported it to police 
reichel 40 said her father gave her the bell on her 16th 
birthday so she could someday build an oldfashioned wishing well 
like her grandmother had 
its so valuable just to me she said the bell was 
estimated to be worth about 1500 
reichel remembers that even getting the bell down to the 
basement was an experience we used ropes i just cant figure

awaiting the start of the grand jury 
investigation she had fought for joyce cutshall strolled in the 
woods where her kidnapped daughters clothing was found 
it is in the wood duck wildlife refuge ms cutshall said that 
she feels close to her missing child 
she gave the best hugs ms cutshall recalled her voice 
cracking 
ms cutshall who spent weekends in shopping malls collecting 
more than a thousand signatures to force the grand jury probe saw 
her long campaign bear results today when the grand jury was chosen 
madison county district judge richard garden selected 16 grand 
jury members and three alternates from a pool of 40 people and 
instructed them to report friday for a meeting with a prosecutor 
testimony is expected to begin monday 
jill cutshall was 9 when she was abducted on aug 13 1987 from 
the steps of a baby sitters home in this city of 20000 about 110 
miles northwest of omaha her father roger had dropped her off in 
the morning and she was waiting alone for the baby sitter to 
arrive when she disappeared 
four months later a hunter found some of jills clothing at the 
wildlife refuge but an extensive search yielded no other trace of 
the girl 
no one has been arrested 
authorities said the kidnapping may have been a random sexual 
assault 
thousands of fliers with jills picture have been distributed 
throughout north america and the case was the subject of a 60 
minutes report 
the cbs show identified two former norfolk residents who were 
questioned by local police but were not charged including one who 
said in an interview with an omaha tv station he was involved in 
the abduction 
but the man told norfolk police he made the statements because 
he was threatened roy stephens a private investigator who worked 
on the cutshall case has acknowledged firing a gun into the air 
before the man made his videotaped statements 
frustrated by what she considered lax police work ms cutshall 
launched a petition drive to force a grand jury investigation 
under state law a court is required to convene a grand jury if 
presented with petitions from at least 10 percent of the countys 
voters who took part in the last governors election ms cutshall 
needed 1024 signatures and collected 1471 
it wont be over for me until i can bring jill home ms 
cutshall said tuesday the answer i want is where is jill and 
when can we get her back here once we get her back we will have 
all of the other answers 
she said she believes police overlooked or did not follow up on 
information and failed to put pieces of the puzzle together ms 
cutshall said she is confident the grand jury will have no other 
choice than to hand down indictments 
but police chief bill mizner said he is proud of the work done 
on the case i think the police division has done an excellent 
job and its not only the police division but all other law 
enforcement agencies involved he said 
a special prosecutor assigned to the case james d smith said 
that a grand jury probe will only duplicate investigators efforts 
and that it holds the danger of a premature indictment 
ms cutshall who was living in kansas and divorced from jills 
father at the time of the kidnapping moved back to norfolk to 
pursue her quest for answers into the girls disappearance 
she finds herself coming back to the refuge there she said 
she feels close to her daughter who enjoyed music and writing 
poetry 
sitting among the trees and dense underbrush she lightly patted 
the ground where her daughters clothes were found in a neat 
leafcovered pile shoes first then jeans and her purple shirt on 
top 
intellectually i know shes not going to come home the 
mother said theres probably 2 percent of me that believes she 
is alive and thats because you always have to have some kind of 
hope

iran said thursday that a number of 
people convicted of spying for the united states will be executed 
in the next few days 
irans official islamic republic news agency did not say how 
many alleged spies would be executed and it did not identify any 
of them 
irna in a dispatch monitored in cyprus quoted ibrahim raisi 
the tehran revolutionary courts prosecutor as saying in a bid 
to deal a blow on the islamic revolution the us intellignce 
service used to regularly receive information from these people on 
the countrys social and economic situation 
it said the people will be hanged within the next few days 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said in april 1989 that a 
network of spies who provided the cia with details and documents 
about iranian military planning had been broken 
the new york times reported in august that us officials 
confirmed the iranian report 
four alleged us spies were hanged in november in iran 
revolutionary courts in iran are usually run by radicals the 
report of expected executions appeared designed to fan 
antiamerican sentiment an issue that might complicate president 
hashemi rafsanjanis efforts to end irans decadelong isolation 
thursdays announcement followed the release in beirut of 
american educator robert polhill who was held 39 months by 
proiranian shiite moslem zealots 
tehran was reported to have played a major role in securing his 
release rafsanjani is believed to favor an end to the hostage 
issue to normalize ties with the west and attract investment and 
technology for his countrys flagging economy 
rafsanjanis opponents want the hostages to remain as the major 
hurdle blocking good ties with the west especially the united 
states

czechoslovakias transition from a communist 
to private enterprise economy will be swift and thorough in order 
to avoid the halfway reforms that are causing economic chaos in 
the soviet union the czech finance minister said thursday 
partial reform of a distorted economy is much worse than a 
nonreform and delays to prepare a comprehensive blueprint mean 
postponing it to eternity minister vaclav klaus said 
such a cautious approach leads very soon to chaotic 
disintegration of the economy as we see in the soviet economy just 
now klaus added in a speech to the world banks second annual 
conferening the problem to see what was 
wrong 
either we are getting the wrong information to make our 
calculations or we are making a mistake somewhere procedurally 
he said we are just going to have to slowly and systematically 
work through that before we decide what is wrong 
originally officials had said the second outage also lasted 
about 45 minutes but four hours later the center still had not 
communicated with the high gain antennas which are the primary 
communications links to relay science data to the ground during 
normal operations elliott said there was contact with the 
telescopes low gain antennas which can be used in emergencies 
the telescope embarking on a 15year search for new worlds was 
released from the shuttles cargo bay wednesday after a lastminute 
snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk 
mission control awakened the crew early today with a loud 
rendition of the song shout a fraternity house favorite 
good morning discovery i guess youre awake after that 
song said kathy thornton shuttle communicator there are a 
lot of happy people down here we saw a great deploy yesterday and 
hubble had a good night while you were asleep 
we appreciate the good words from everybody replied 
discovery commander loren shriver 
after wednesdays deployment shriver gently backed discovery 
away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of 
maneuvers the last one completed this morning to park 
discovery in orbit 46 miles behind hubble 
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and 
we sure hope it does good work shriver said wednesday 
well it sure is now loren and thanks for all the great work 
youve done replied mission control galileo is real proud of 
you 
scientists have hailed the hubble nasas most expensive 
unmanned spacecraft as the greatest advance in astronomy since 
galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago 
discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope 
while controllers at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt 
md make sure hubble is operating properly such as responding to 
directional commands 
the next milestone is friday when the telescopes 10foot 
aperture door is to be opened exposing the finely polished 
945inch mirror to starlight 
then on tuesday nasa expects to release the first image from 
the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina 
data will follow in a month or two 
if the aperture door doesnt open properly discovery could 
return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk 
to fix it 
hubble project manager fred wojtalik said the telescope would be 
tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door 
is opened 
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the 
hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he 
said too much light could damage the telescopes sensitive 
instruments 
on wednesday mission specialist steve hawley used the shuttles 
50foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12ton telescope and hoist 
it from the cargo bay 
one of the telescopes solar arrays unreeled from its mast as 
expected and started providing power to the telescopes batteries 
which otherwise had only eight hours of charge 
but there was trouble with the second panel it wouldnt budge 
when the latches were released and then moved about a fifth of its 
39foot length and stopped again the panel rolled all the way out 
on the third attempt 
by the final attempt astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn 
sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock 30 minutes away 
from taking tools in hand and going on an outerspace maintenance 
call 
wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown 
the 8hour procedure was performed 380 miles above earth 70 
miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown the orbit was 
dictated by the need to put hubble above the earths distorting 
atmosphere 
astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the 
beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their 
light has taken 14 billions years to reach earth they hope to 
determine how and when the universe was formed currently estimated 
at 15 billion years ago 
the telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but 
was delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident 
discovery which blasted into orbit tuesday is scheduled to 
land sunday at edwards air force base calif

the house foreign affairs committee defied 
president bush on thursday voting to cut us military aid to el 
salvador in half and to impose strict new conditions on the money 
on a voice vote the democraticdominated panel moved to cut the 
85 million a year that the united states provides to help el 
salvadors military the action amended a bill that would authorize 
spending of emergency aid bush wants this year for nicaragua and 
panama 
congressmen expressing the bush administrations opposition to 
the move called it partisan and unwise giving legitimacy to 
leftist rebels 
but supporters of the changes said the new conditions would 
encourage both the government and rebels to negotiate a peace 
agreement it would be up to the president to decide whether the 
conditions have been met 
if the rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
continue to receive weapons shipments from outside the country 
thwart peace talks or mount a military offensive the governments 
military aid would be restored if the government fails to 
negotiate in good faith or adequately investigate last years 
murders of six jesuits it would lose the other half of its 
military aid 
any military aid that is cut would not be lost entirely by the 
government but would be funneled instead into humanitarian 
programs for the country 
there are real consequences for either side in the event they 
misbehave said rep gerry studds dmass who sponsored the 
amendment 
it remained unclear whether the restrictions on aid would ever 
be finally enacted into law house democratic leaders planned to 
meet next week with secretary of state james a baker iii in an 
effort to begin drafting a new bipartisan us policy toward el 
salvador which could head off the restrictions 
the administration which voiced strong disapproval of 
thursdays move by the house committee saw it largely as an 
attempt to improve democrats negotiating position as they enter 
discussions with baker 
the fmln has waged a decadelong civil war in the countryside of 
el salvador and rightwing military elements have responded with 
deathsquad killings the war has claimed an estimated 70000 lives 
weve already waited too long studds said weve been far 
too patient far too timid and weve watched far too many people 
die 
the two sides recently agreed to negotiate under the auspices of 
the united nations that coupled with a change in governments in 
neighboring nicaragua which is expected to shut down the weapons 
flow to the rebels has created the most hopeful climate for peace 
in years 
republicans on the house panel argued that any tampering with el 
salvadors aid would damage that climate this is an effort to 
score partisan political points said rep william broomfield 
rmich 
rep henry hyde rill said the move would grant credibility 
to the fmln which it does not deserve this assumes there is only 
one set of thugs in el salvador he said why do we want to 
legitimize the other thugs the fmln

us negotiators announced today that they 
have reached basic agreement on a new trade accord with the soviet 
union that would normalize trade relations between the two 
countries for the first time in nearly a half century 
us deputy trade representative julius katz the leader of the 
us negotiating team said fundamentally we have reached 
agreement on the text of the new pact 
he said that the exact language still needed to be worked out on 
four minor issues but he did not believe they would pose an 
obstacle to signing a final document when president bush meets 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev in washington from may 30 to 
june 3 
as far as i am concerned we have substantial agreement and i 
do not see an obstacle to its signature at the time of the 
summit katz said in a telephone conference call 
he spoke to reporters in washington after the end of thursdays 
negotiating session in paris the discussions were allowed to 
continue this week after bush decided against imposing economic 
sanctions on the soviet union because of its crackdown in lithuania 
bush on tuesday announced that he was not imposing any 
sanctions ending days of debate inside the administration over 
whether the economic talks with the soviets should be cancelled in 
an effort to bring pressure to bear on gorbachev to seek a 
negotiated settlement of the lithuanian situation 
even after all the minor issues have been cleared up the new 
economic agreement cannot be signed by bush until he certifies that 
the soviet union is allowing free emigration of soviet jews and 
other dissidents from the country 
bush has said he will sign such a waiver once the soviet unions 
more liberalized emigration policy is written into law by the 
soviet parliament 
at the summit with gorbachev in malta bush expressed the hope 
that normalizing trade relations would give a boost to the soviet 
economy 
the trade agreement is needed to grant the soviet union the 
trade status of most favored nation qualifying it for the 
lowest tariffs granted to any other country 
currently soviet exports into the united states bear duties as 
much as 10 times higher than imports from other nations 
us officials have predicted that trade between the two 
countries could double or even triple over the next three years 
with a new trade agreement

mexican president carlos salinas expressed 
strong displeasure to vice president dan quayle today over the 
us handling of a drug arrest and called for new ground rules for 
usmexican cooperation in the war on drugs 
quayle and salinas met for nearly three hours at the presidents 
residence in what the us vice president conceded was a 
contentious session 
mexico has accused the united states of a role in the abduction 
of a mexican doctor dr humberto alvarez machain who now is 
awaiting trial in los angeles in the 1985 torture and murder of a 
us drug enforcement agent 
president salinas expressed to me his strong displeasure with 
the dr alvarez incident quayle told a news conference after his 
meeting 
the session was quayles final stop on a fencemending mission 
assigned to him last january by president bush to soothe latin 
american hard feelings over the us invasion of panama 
mexico claims us dea agents violated its sovereignty in 
seizing alvarez 
quayle again reiterated us insistence that it had not sent dea 
agents into mexico to seize alvarez machain 
however quayle appeared to indicate that his reassurances to 
salinas fell short of calming the situation 
quayle said that salinas told him that mexico wants new rules 
and agreements to govern future usmexican cooperation on drug 
investigations and arrests 
however while claiming that bush was always open to new 
ideas quayle gave no indication that the administration was 
ready to progress toward a new drug agreement 
a bush administration official who attended part of the 
quaylesalinas session told reporters that among the new rules 
that salinas wants are provisions for better advance notice by the 
united states of its drug operations that involve mexico 
the official who spoke under conditions of anonymity also said 
that salinas wants a better system for sharing information with the 
united states 
the official said quayle told the mexican president he 
thought we already were sharing information 
quayle said us agents did not go into mexico in the alvarez 
machain matter and said the administration was not ready to 
consider recalling the dea agents that are now working on mexican 
soil 
quayle said these agents are a constructive force for 
conducting a cooperative effort in the war on drugs 
quayle insisted that the flap did not undermine long friendly 
usmexican ties 
mexico is a friend mexico is a neighbor quayle said 
and the vice president said there should be no doubt 
whatsoever that we respect the sovereignty of mexico 
todays trip to the united states closest ally in latin america 
wraps up a fencemending assignment that bush gave quayle after the 
december 1989 us invasion of panama that toppled the government 
of manuel antonio noriega 
the purpose of my visit is to once again emphasize on behalf 
of president bush the importance that we place on this 
relationship quayle said in arrival remarks at the mexico city 
airport 
quayle on thursday attended the inauguration of nicaragua 
president violeta chamorro bringing her the first installment of a 
24 million us food aid package and promising additional us 
support in the future 
this was quayles third latin american swing in the aftermath of 
the panama action and this trip completes the mission said the 
vice presidents press secretary david beckwith 
the justice department said last week there were no plans to 
return alvarez machain to mexico saying he would be held to face 
charges in los angeles for alleged participation in the murder of 
drug enforcement administration agent enrique camarena 
the mexican government claims us agents violated mexican 
sovereignty in the arrest of alvarez machain suggesting he was 
kidnapped to the united states 
he was arrested at the el paso texas airport on april 3 
the dea has denied published reports that it paid bounty hunters 
to capture the mexican doctor and bring him to the united states 
attorney general dick thornburgh said last week that dea agents 
were not involved in alvarez machains capture in mexico 
the arrest sparked a diplomatic protest from the mexican 
government and the mexican attorney general enrique alvarez del 
castillo has said it could end usmexican cooperation on drugs 
quayle represented bush on wednesday at mrs chamorros 
inauguration in managua nicaragua her election in february ended 
the 11year rein of sandinista leader daniel ortega 
quayle praised mrs chamorro as a symbol of unity in 
nicaragua but he also said she faces herculean economic 
problems in taking over from ortega 
he voiced us support for her decision unpopular even among 
many of her own backers to retain gen humberto ortega daniel 
ortegas brother as chiefofstaff of the armed forces 
quayle called it a very delicate decision she had to make 
but suggested retention of humberto ortega could help heal 
divisions in the country 
and in naming herself defense minister mrs chamorro made it 
clear the military will be civiliancontrolled and 
civilianruled quayle said

house republican whip newt gingrich will host 
a satellite broadcast american opportunities workshop that he 
says is a nonpartisan outreach program designed to attract 
disaffected voters 
yet the may 19 broadcast from five locations around the country 
estimated to cost at least 250000 is being bankrolled by gopac 
a fundraising committee that helps republican candidates 
there are references to ideas but there are no references in 
the entire show to either political party gingrich said in an 
interview before wednesdays announcement of the program 
gingrich said he is trying to convince americans of all 
political stripes that the bureaucratic welfare state and 
permissive attitudes are responsible for many of todays problems 
they must be replaced with a new model for government he 
said in which americans solve problems by helping themselves 
rather than relying on the government 
gingrich said some democrats such as former carter 
administration attorney general griffin bell and polly williams a 
member of the wisconsin legislature who once was on welfare will 
join in the effort 
the program will originate from gingrichs home district in 
georgia and will contain appearances by participants in four other 
cites some 500 workshops have been set up around the country he 
said where people will watch the program by satellite hookup and 
debate the issues 
gingrich long has worked to increase the ranks of republicans in 
the house where they are outnumbered by democrats 258 to 176 but 
he insisted the telecast which may set the stage for a series of 
such workshops is not a partybuilding effort per se 
gingrich said that if a democrat such as sen bill bradley of 
new jersey or sen charles robb of virginia someday ends up as 
president on a platform made up of these kind of ideas thats 
fine 
our goal is not the shape of the parties its the shape of 
the country he said 
gingrich acknowledged that while he will avoid preaching gop 
gospel as such the selfhelp appeal is designed to attract 
disaffected democrats and others from the nearly 50 percent of the 
voting population that did not participate in the last presidential 
election 
it is true that a lot of democrats for ideological reasons 
dont feel comfortable being involved gingrich said because 
in their party it wouldnt be positive to be involved in something 
like this but it seems to me thats a commentary on the democratic 
party not a commentary on what were trying to do 
asked whether it was an effort to build the republican party 
the nonpartisan label notwithstanding he replied oh sure 
it is fair to say that it is part of a continuing effort 
to expand the republican base he said but it is also fair to 
say that in the tradition of franklin roosevelt that you become 
less partisan and more interested in serving

soldiers fired into a crowd of 4000 
palestinians in the occupied gaza strip on thursday killing three 
and wounding more than 120 in the worst clash in nearly a year 
hospital officials and arab witnesses said 
in the west bank soldiers killed a palestinian youth when a 
procession of moslem worshipers pelted an army compound with stones 
as they marched to a cemetery to honor the dead the military said 
the gaza confrontation began as thousands of chanting believers 
left two mosques after morning prayer services for the eid alfitr 
which celebrates the end of the holy month of ramadan 
it was one of the worst incidents of the 2yearold arab 
rebellion and the bloodiest since three palestinians were killed 
and about 50 wounded during the same holiday last may 6 the 
upsurge of violence came in marked contrast to the subdued level of 
conflict in recent months 
the army confirmed that two palestinians were killed and 117 
wounded in the jabaliya refugee camp a shantytown of 53000 where 
the revolt against israeli occupation began more than 28 months ago 
it said 12 soldiers were slightly injured by stones in the clash 
and that it was checking a hospital report of the third death 
ahmad a street vendor who was wounded in the arm told a 
reporter from his hospital bed that soldiers panicked when crowds 
chanting allahu akbar god is great approached a fencedoff 
army encampment on their way to a traditional cemetery visit 
about 20 soldiers inside the camp then fired tear gas he and 
other witnesses said 
we were heading to visit our dead people and then they started 
shooting tear gas at us he said refusing to give his last name 
because he feared arrest i think the army thought we wanted to 
attack them after they saw such huge crowds 
witnesses said scores of arabs responded with a barrage of 
stones until a dozen border police jeeps several armored personnel 
carriers and a helicopter came to the soldiers assistance 
they said troops and border police clashed with the worshipers 
as the helicopter dropped dozens of tear gas canisters 
gaza commander brig gen shmuel zucker told army radio soldiers 
had been given special orders to restrain from opening fire 
he said soldiers avoided shooting until the stones began to 
endanger their lives the event is completely out of the 
ordinary jabaliya has been quiet for a long time 
the army put the camp under curfew and declared the gaza strip a 
closed military zone barring journalists from entering 
jorgen rosendal the administrator of ahli arab hospital said 
nearly 140 palestinians were treated for wounds in the citys two 
major hospitals 
its the highest number of casualties we have had since last 
may he said in a telephone interview 
arab reports identified those killed as three camp residents 
awadallah ibrahim awadallah 25 a laborer shot in the chest 
khaled musa al aswad 35 a mosque prayer caller who was hit in the 
stomach and muhammed ali muhammed abu sammam 30 
in qabatiya in the west bank troops fatally shot 20yearold 
naher shelaby and wounded five other palestinians during a similar 
religious procession the army command said 
the army imposed a curfew on nablus and surrounding camps home 
to 120000 palestinians in bethlehem reinforcements were posted 
near cemeteries to prevent violence 
cemetery visits also came in response to a call issued by the 
proplo underground leadership of the uprising for honoring the 
graves and families of martyrs killed in the revolt 
thursdays deaths brought to 680 the number of arabs killed by 
israeli gunfire in the rebellion in addition 209 palestinians 
have been slain by other arabs as suspected proisraeli 
collaborators fortythree israelis have died in the violence

the 63yearold republican whose previous term in office was 
19771985 called for a renewed effort to balance vermonts 
environmental desires and its needs in view of a faltering economy 
we have held on to much of the spectacular beauty which was 
bequeathed to us by our forefathers he said but we all know 
that we have been losing some of these wonderful elements of our 
inheritance and that without determination hard work sound 
planning and prudent investment we will not be able to give to 
children that which was given to us 
but we cannot neglect an equal responsibility to assure a 
standard of living that enables vermonters to stay in vermont 
the political landscape in the gubernatorial race was turned 
upside down this month with the decision by gov madeleine kunin a 
democrat not to seek reelection 
former state sen peter welch jumped onto the democratic ticket

bodyguards police said the plane returned to bogota where the 
leftist politician died one hour after being admitted to a 
hospital officials at the hospital said

the legislature has overwhelmingly 
approved a campaignreform package that its supporters hope will be 
a model for similar legislation in congress 
the elections and ethics reform act of 1990 which sets 
voluntary spending limits and provides public financing for 
congressional races cleared the house on wednesday by 1280 the 
senate sent the bill to gov rudy perpich for his signature on a 
vote of 611 
perpich said hes inclined to sign the bill 
the bill also prohibits state lawmakers from soliciting campaign 
contributions from lobbyists during legislative sessions expands 
lobbyist disclosure requirements requires the legislature to 
conduct its business in public and establishes a new screening 
process for judicial appointments 
supporters say minnesota is the first state to enact such 
legislation 
people everywhere are frustrated with the excessive influence 
that money plays in politics today especially when it comes to the 
united states congress said state house speaker robert vanasek 
we will be sending the strongest possible message to congress 
that the time has come for congress to mend its ways and enact 
campaign finance reform on its own said vanasek of the 
democraticfarmerlabor party which controls the house and senate 
the way to get the federal government moving again is to end 
the money monopoly that has weakened our elections and made the 
voters cynical and turned off when election time comes he said 
many independentrepublicans said they saw the reform package as 
a step in the right direction and voted for it despite reservations 
that it may be found unconstitutional ben ginsburg chief legal 
counsel for the national republican committee has said if the 
campaign finance provisions become law they will be challenged 
the bill sets voluntary spending limits of 425000 for us 
house candidates and 34 million for us senate hopefuls 
effective jan 1 
if both major party candidates for an office agreed to abide by 
the limits neither would receive taxpayer subsidies if one 
candidate agreed and the other did not the candidate who limits 
expenditures would receive public financing of up to 25 percent of 
the limit established for the office they seek 
under a 1974 state law candidates for the legislature and state 
constitutional offices including governor receive a partial 
public subsidy if they agree to accept spending limits 
the bill also reinstates a state income tax credit for 
contributions to political parties and to state and federal 
candidates who agree to abide by spending limits under the bill 
individuals can claim a credit equal to contributions of 50 or 
less and couples can claim a credit equal to contributions of 100 
or less

president francois mitterrand and west german 
chancellor helmut kohl urged lithuania on thursday to meet moscows 
demands for a suspension of its independence drive 
in a letter mitterrand and kohl said lithuanian president 
vytautus landsbergis should rescind proindependence laws to clear 
the way for talks with the kremlin so that the current crisis 
ends in a solution acceptable to all parties 
without doubt it would facilitate the start of such talks to 
suspend temporarily the effects of decisions taken by your 
parliament the letter said lithuanian lawmakers declared the 
republic independent march 11 
the letter said temporarily rescinding proindpendence laws 
would take nothing away from their validity since they were taken 
under a universally accepted principle the principle of the 
selfdetermination of peoples 
the letter was drafted during a twoday summit in which kohl and 
mitterrand discussed a wide range of issues it came two days after 
president bush refused to impose economic sanctions against the 
soviet union for its military and economic campaign against 
lithuania 
kohl and mitterrand said a copy of their letter was sent to 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the two western leaders said 
at a news conference that they wanted to avoid complicating 
gorbachevs problems 
the soviet union said monday it might negotiate with lithuania 
if the baltic republic froze its march 11 declaration of 
independence for two years and agreed to adhere to the soviet 
constitution for achieving independence 
lithuanian leaders repeatedly have refused to do that saying 
their country was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 and 
was never legally incorporated into the soviet union they also 
contend soviet laws would make actual secession extremely difficult 
landsbergis has denied reports lithuania would consider 
suspending its declaration however an aide has said a lithuanian 
delegation waiting in moscow for a chance to negotiate with soviet 
leaders would consider such a proposal if it were formally made 
in an article published thursday in the conservative french 
newspaper le figaro landsbergis wrote that moscow was becoming 
its own worst enemy by persisting with a hard line against 
lithuanias bid for independence 
if the soviet union continues to use force to crush lithuanian 
independence we will all lose it will prove that perestroika 
is a collection of political failures and not an authentic 
transition toward democracy landsbergis wrote 
landsbergis said his people were under no illusion about our 
economic dependence on moscow 
but we dont understand why today this masterslave 
relationship must be prolonged and why to our great surprise 
it is considered by certain of our western friends to be the 
solution to the problem

ground controllers at the goddard 
space flight center finally made contact today with the two main 
antennas on the 15 billion hubble space telescope after trying 
for more than six hours to lock on 
applause erupted in the hubble control center in greenbelt md 
as the glitch that marred hubbles first full day in space was 
solved 
we have confirmation that we have achieved communication with 
the tracking and data relay satellite through the highgain antenna 
system said nasas dave drachlis 
engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were 
working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing 
either the satellite or the tdrs an orbiting communications 
satellite that acts as a switchboard 
in the successful attempt they nearly doubled the width of the 
antennas beams to take in more territory from a sweep of 62 
degrees to 108 degrees 
the telescopes lowgain antennas which receive and transmit 
information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies 
were working well 
space shuttle discovery was 46 miles away available to remedy 
certain problems the outage was not a problem for which space 
walkers would have been summoned 
the five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of 
storms over texas from their 380milehigh perch and doing 
experiments 
steve terry director of a team calibrating various aspects of 
the telescope said the first outage was caused by human error and 
was not a serious problem it began between 1 and 130 am edt and 
lasted 45 minutes to an hour he said 
the second failure occurred at 644 am when controllers 
attempted to send a signal to the telescopes two highgain 
antennas through the tdrs 
this time it was a pointing problem said jim elliott a 
goddard spokesman its a new spacecraft and we think 
inexperience dealing with it was the cause 
the telescope embarking on a 15year search for new worlds was 
released from the shuttles cargo bay wednesday after a lastminute 
snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk 
mission control awakened the crew early today with a loud 
rendition of the song shout a fraternity house favorite 
good morning discovery i guess youre awake after that 
song said kathy thornton shuttle communicator there are a 
lot of happy people down here we saw a great deploy yesterday and 
hubble had a good night while you were asleep 
we appreciate the good words from everybody replied 
discovery commander loren shriver 
after wednesdays deployment shriver gently backed discovery 
away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of 
maneuvers the last one completed this morning to park 
discovery in orbit 46 miles behind hubble 
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and 
we sure hope it does good work shriver said wednesday 
well it sure is now loren and thanks for all the great work 
youve done replied mission control galileo is real proud of 
you 
scientists have hailed the hubble nasas most expensive 
unmanned spacecraft as the greatest advance in astronomy since 
galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago 
discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope 
while controllers at the goddard center make sure hubble is 
operating properly such as responding to directional commands 
the next milestone is friday when the telescopes 10foot 
aperture door is to be opened exposing the finely polished 
945inch mirror to starlight 
then on tuesday nasa expects to release the first image from 
the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina 
data will follow in a month or two 
if the aperture door doesnt open properly discovery could 
return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk 
to fix it 
hubble project manager fred wojtalik said the telescope would be 
tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door 
is opened 
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the 
hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he 
said too much light could damage the telescopes sensitive 
instruments 
on wednesday mission specialist steve hawley used the shuttles 
50foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12ton telescope and hoist 
it from the cargo bay 
one of the telescopes solar arrays unreeled from its mast as 
expected and started providing power to the telescopes batteries 
which otherwise had only eight hours of charge 
but there was trouble with the second panel it wouldnt budge 
when the latches were released and then moved about a fifth of its 
39foot length and stopped again the panel rolled all the way out 
on the third attempt 
by the final attempt astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn 
sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock 30 minutes away 
from taking tools in hand and going on an outerspace maintenance 
call 
wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown 
the 8hour procedure was performed 380 miles above earth 70 
miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown the orbit was 
dictated by the need to put hubble above the earths distorting 
atmosphere 
astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the 
beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their 
light has taken 14 billions years to reach earth they hope to 
determine how and when the universe was formed currently estimated 
at 15 billion years ago 
the telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but 
was delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident 
discovery which blasted into orbit tuesday is scheduled to 
land sunday at edwards air force base calif

freed hostage robert polhill 
returned to american soil thursday offering a broad smile and a 
thumbsup salute but no word on his 39 months in captivity 
polhill 55 stepped off a military jet minutes after landing at 
andrews air force base outside washington 
he smiled broadly and offered intermittent waves and thumbsup 
signs but would not respond to questions shouted by reporters he 
pointed to his throat at one point when pressed to speak and 
mouthed the words i cant 
his reception was lowkey with a state department protocol 
official and army and air force officers on hand to welcome the new 
yorker and his lebanese wife feryal 
polhill walked from the plane to a government car and was 
whisked away under sunny skies to walter reed army medical center 
for a physical and other medical tests 
he gave a final salute as the car passed by reporters and about 
30 other people most of them uniformed air force personnel 
gathered on the edge of the tarmac 
polhill was flown here from wiesbaden west germany where he 
spent three days in an air force hospital after his weekend release 
army doctors on hand for the arrival said the length of 
polhills stay at walter reed depends on his condition polhill a 
diabetic lost 25 pounds during his captivity he was reported to 
have had a voracious appetite in wiesbaden 
rather than speculate what his problems will be we would like 
to take some time to evaluate and allow him to rest said one of 
the doctors russ zajtchuk 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that 
president bush planned to have polhill in for a visit soon but that 
a date had not been set 
also leaving wiesbaden on thursday was the us team that 
debriefed polhill a development that further dampened hopes 
another american hostage might soon be freed 
immediately after polhills release there was some hope that at 
least one of the seven americans still held in lebanon would be 
released in the last few days however a number of developments 
have suggested otherwise among them demands from shiite militants 
that arab prisoners held by israel and kuwait be freed before they 
release another hostage 
house passage earlier this week of a resolution recognizing 
jerusalem as the capital of israel also angered arab leaders 
we have no indication that there is going to be a release in 
the near future fitzwater told reporters 
polhill a business professor was abducted with two other 
american educators on jan 24 1987 the others jesse turner of 
idaho and alann steen of boston remain captives all taught at the 
american university in beirut 
during his stay in wiesbaden polhill reportedly gave the 
debriefing team a detailed account of his captivity and kidnappers 
us officials said polhill likely was kept in the same beirut 
building as other western hostages

defense secretary dick cheney proposed today 
to sharply reduce the pentagon plan to purchase 132 b2 stealth 
bombers to 75 planes as he unveiled a package of aircraft cutbacks 
designed to save 348 billion through 1997 
testifying before the house armed services committee cheney 
said the changes were warranted because nato faces fewer enemy 
aircraft and a reduced ground threat as a result of the dramatic 
changes sweeping eastern europe and the soviet union 
but committee chairman les aspin dwis told reporters after 
the morning session that cheneys reductions may not placate the 
budget cutting ardor on capitol hill 
he faulted cheneys program contending it was still based on 
an unrealistically pessimistic view of the soviet threat 
cheneys blueprint follows a detailed pentagon study of military 
needs and came one day after an army official said troop levels 
would probably be cut by 250000 over the next five or six years 
he was scheduled to testify later in the afternoon before the 
senate armed services committee 
the proposed reductions in aircraft would also affect the size 
of the navy in answer to a question from aspin cheney said 
reducing the number of a12 attack planes could mean elimination of 
two of the navys 14 aircraft carrier battle groups 
the defense secretary testified that his plans would trim 241 
billion from earlier estimates of pentagon spending plans for 1991 
and 348 billion through 1997 cheney offered his plan at the same 
time the democraticcontrolled house and senate are drafting 
spending blueprints for 1991 expected to call for sharp cuts in 
pentagon spending 
the proposal drew mixed reactions from members of the armed 
services committee 
let me tell you where i think this proposal is in trouble 
said rep john kasich rohio and an opponent of the b2 bomber 
were cutting a little bit and were stretching a lot and 
when you cut and stretch you drive up the cost 
but rep robert davis rmich said cheneys cut in the number 
of b2 purchases gives the republicans a very dependable 
position something we can sell to the house and the american 
people 
in his statement cheney said the reduced purchases and delays 
will save 168 billion in 1991 through 1994 the departments 
current fiveyear spending plan and another 18 billion during 
1995 through 1997 
he said the stealth cutback would lower the projected cost of 
the plane from 754 billion to 611 billion a saving of 143 
billion over the life of the program 
cheney also said he intends to cut planned purchases of the c17 
longrange transport plane and the navys a12 attack aircraft and 
delay purchases of the air forces advanced tactical aircraft and 
the advanced tactical fighter 
congressional pressure has intensified to reduce the pentagons 
budget following the lessened soviet threat and the budget crunch 
supporters of the 530 million radarevading bomber have warned 
that the perplane cost could double if fewer aircraft are ordered 
cheneys statement said some of the widespread changes were 
necessary because nato forces will face fewer enemy aircraft and 
a reduced ground threat once announced soviet withdrawals from 
warsaw pact nations are completed 
but the secretary insisted that despite such developments the 
nations current bomber force must be updated with the b2 by the 
turn of the century the primary contractor for the batwinged 
plane is northrop corp 
soviet air defenses both missiles and fighter aircraft will 
pose an increasing challenge to our current standoff and 
penetrating bombers cheney said in the statement 
cheney said he intends to cut the number of b2 aircraft to be 
purchased in the next fiscal year to two planes from the five 
currently proposed at a cost in the fiscal 1991 budget of 55 
billion and the maximum number of planes to be built during peak 
years of production would be reduced to 12 instead of 24 cheney 
suggested 
on the other aircraft programs the secretary proposed to buy 
120 of the c17 longrange transport planes instead of the 210 
originally planned at a proposed savings of 119 billion over the 
life of the program the plane is designed to replace the aging 
c141 transport plane 
cheney noted the new transport planes ability to land on the 
shorter runways typical of the third world the statement was a 
plug for its use by the armed forces of the future designed to 
fight in conflicts such as the panama invasion as the threat of a 
major land war in europe recedes 
the secretary also proposed that the pentagon buy a smaller 
number of navys a12 allweather medium attack planes cutting the 
original request of 858 to a minimum of 620 
the a12 is designed to replace the navys a6e intruder which 
is now reaching the end of its service life as a aircraftcarrier 
based longrange strike jet 
cheney said the air forces version of the plane the advanced 
tactical aircraft which is supposed to be used for deep attack 
missions now handled by the f111 and f15 can safely be delayed 
given the current nature of the threat and capabilities of aircraft 
in inventory 
production of the ata would be delayed beyond 1997 the end of 
the pentagons longterm fiveyear budget cycle cheney said 
cheney also suggested that purchases of the advance tactical 
fighter be delayed from 1994 to 1996 the aircraft is intended to 
replace the air forces f15 the number to be purchased should 
remain at 750 cheney said 
the delay in that fighter will also delay the procurement of the 
navys version by two years and reduce the number of aircraft to 
546 from the original 618 planned the pentagon statement said

the supreme court on thursday ordered the 
eviction of jewish settlers who stirred an international protest by 
moving into a building in the christian quarter of jerusalems old 
city 
officials of the greek orthodox church which owns the building 
were dissatisfied because the ruling allows maintenance workers and 
20 guards hired by the settlers to remain until a lower court 
resolves the tenancy dispute 
the church argues the settlers are in the building under an 
illegal sublease it said it would close all christian shrines in 
the holy land on friday to protest the presence of the 150 armed 
settlers 
the jewish settlers moved into the 72room st johns hospice on 
april 11 the action brought protests from christian clerics 
palestinian christians and moslems the us state department 
proisraeli lobby groups and the government of greece 
the neot david settlement in jerusalem was seen as part of a new 
settlement drive by prime minister yitzhak shamir the hawkish 
leader of the rightwing likud bloc who was chosen thursday to form 
a new government 
the state department called the neot david settlement an 
insensitive and provocative act the us government opposes all 
settlements on land israel captured in the 1967 war saying it is 
an obstacle to peacemaking with the arabs 
the walled old city is divided into moslem christian jewish 
and armenian quarters each sector contains holy sites and shrines 
and the slighest changes in the status quo have historically led to 
violence 
in its ruling the threejudge panel said the settlers who are 
affiliated with the ateret cohanim seminary must leave by tuesday 
settler representatives said they would comply 
church attorney avraham sochovolsky claimed victory twenty 
people is not a settlement the main point was to have their 
children and women now they have watchmen and maintenance 
but church spokesman bishop timothy margaritis said the court 
did not go far enough 
we were expecting that the building would be evacuated 
completely and that somebody else would undertake to guard the 
place he said now its like recognizing the rights of the 
panamanian company 
the panamabased sbc says it subleased st johns from martyros 
matossian an armenian christian for 35 million and that the 
settlers were its guests the government admitted this week that it 
contributed 18 million to the settlement 
a spokesman for the settlers said in a statement we are 
pleased that the court has recognized sbc as having legal 
possession of the property and hope the courts will decide to let 
the company continue to operate the guest house 
the church says matossian had no right to sublet it has filed 
separate eviction orders against matossian and sbc and the supreme 
court urged the lower court to act quickly in the tenancy dispute 
dan aviyitzhak an attorney for sbc said the case was a test 
of jewish sovereignty over jerusalem if we give up the right to 
settle in the capital of israel where do we have the right to 
settle aviyitzhak asked the court during the sevenhour hearing 
israel captured arab east jerusalem including the old city 
from jordan during the 1967 middle east war it annexed the sector 
but israels claim to sovereignty over the entire city is not 
recognized by most countries 
church officials said they opposed jewish presence in st johns 
because it was so close to the church of the holy sepulcher which 
marks the sites where many christians believe jesus was crucified 
and buried 
we dont want people with machine guns walking near our church 
and frightening the pilgrims said archbishop cornelius of 
sebastian who attended the court session 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek who argued the settlement provoked 
strife among religious groups welcomed the court ruling and said 
he hoped it would help restore calm in the city 
to my great sorrow the damage that has been caused will 
nonetheless take years to repair he said

the labor department on thursday promised 
quick new safety rules for the petrochemical industry in an effort 
to prevent disasters such as last years phillips explosion that 
killed 23 workers in texas 
the occupational safety and health administration plans to 
establish the new safety guidelines by the end of the summer the 
agency said in a report to president bush outlining causes of the 
oct 23 blast at the plant in pasadena a houston suburb another 
130 workers were injured 
the probe showed the explosion could have been prevented through 
better safety procedures and that it demonstrated the need for 
mandatory safety rules at plants that use and store highly 
flammable liquids and chemicals the report said 
the investigation of the phillips catastrophe has caused osha 
to take stock and consider a strong course of action to prevent 
such disasters the report said 
phillips petroleum co has said its own investigation showed 
company safety procedures were not followed it plans to appeal at 
least part of the 57 million in fines osha proposed last week for 
alleged willful safety violations 
phillips is eager to review any recommendations osha can offer 
that will further improve the safety of our operations the 
bartlesville oklabased company said in a statement thursday 
most of oshas new requirements will be fundamental safety 
procedures that many firms already are following said gerard 
scannell assistant labor secretary in charge of osha 
the mandatory safety guidelines which would affect about 2300 
petrochemical plants nationwide would include requiring companies 
to analyze hazards in the workplace ensure equipment works 
properly train and inform employees on hazards and develop 
emergency response procedures scannell said 
the agency is required to review public comment on the proposed 
rules so it could be up to a year before they take effect 
ct roberts a phillips employee at the texas plant who was off 
duty when the blast occurred said the new osha guidelines are long 
overdue 
the only way these companies are going to take safety 
seriously is to be pushed into it said roberts who was in 
washington for an aflcio event to spotlight attention on workplace 
injuries and deaths 
osha also will consider revising the way it sets priorities for 
inspections and devoting more attention to the petrochemical 
industry scannell said 
right now osha allocates resources according to a priority 
system based primarily on industry injury rates the report to bush 
said osha may start considering other factors as well such as the 
potential risk to workers 
historically the petrochemical industry has had a lower injury 
rate than other industries the report said but it noted that 
major disasters have occurred recently in the industry including 
the 1984 disaster in bhopal india where a deadly chemical release 
killed more than 2000 people and in mexico city where an 
explosion of liquified petroleum killed about 650 
sectors of the petrochemical industry with a high potential for 
fire explosion or catastrophic release include those involving 
plastics synthetic rubber and petroleum refining the report said 
oshas investigation into the texas blast showed that four 
highly flammable gases escaped from an open valve forming a huge 
vapor cloud that traveled through the plant within seconds under 
high pressure 
a series of explosions occurred after the cloud came in contact 
with an unidentified ignition source 
contrary to phillips own procedures as well as standard 
industry practice there was no backup protection such as a double 
valve to protect against valve failure or protect against an 
untimely valve opening scannell said

shes that cosmo girl its her 25th birthday 
and she still wants it all a man who loves her good sex a great 
bod and a job that makes her happy 
what does she read cosmopolitan of course helen gurley 
browns magazine for women who are ambitious achieving man 
loving 
the magazine was for and still is for a woman who loves men 
loves children is very female loves sex but she doesnt want to 
live through other people said the 68yearold editor in chief 
the may issue mrs browns 300th was published tuesday it 
features a brunette madonna red lips just parted in a white dress 
with the plunging neckline that has become a trademark of the 
sultry cosmo covergirls 
i think people like to look at bosoms i do mrs brown said 
in an interview wednesday in her office i think if you have a 
terrific bosom youre wondering how you compare if you dont have 
a wonderful bosom you still enjoy looking 
the magazines topics have stayed as constant through the years 
as the cover cleavage sex malefemale relationships mrs browns 
deadly sins anger greed hate fear and jealousy and 
careers and health 
the format is so sound and solid that there is really no 
reason to change it she said 
in 1965 when mrs brown revamped the format of what was then an 
ailing 79yearold magazine its circulation was 783000 today 
it is bought monthly by 27 million americans according to the 
audit bureau of circulation there are 24 foreign editions in 10 
languages 
in line with the cosmo format the silver anniversary issue 
includes articles on how to improve your selfesteem invest in 
your looks be wellinformed choose supportive men and how to 
boost your sexual confidence learn to satisfy yourself dont hide 
erotic skills forgive your flaws 
theres also a centerfold of tv celebrity david hasselhoff with 
two wellplaced sharpei puppies 
mrs brown was a 38yearold disgruntled copywriter at a los 
angeles advertising agency when she wrote the titillating 1962 best 
seller sex and the single girl a howto book on having an 
affair 
she and her husband david brown the film producer then 
parlayed the book into a magazine proposal that they pitched to 
hearst magazines 
hearst was unwilling to risk starting a new magazine but was 
interested in a makeover of the fading literary cosmopolitan 
which had published john steinbeck ernest hemingway and w 
somerset maugham 
in march 1965 mrs brown recalled she walked into the office 
of cosmopolitan as editor in chief after weeping up a storm 
the night before because she knew nothing about publishing and 
editing 
thus a new cosmo was born along with that cosmopolitan girl 
the personification of the magazines readership in advertisements 
the magazine preached that single girls could have their own 
jobs and apartments fall in love and enjoy sex shocking concepts 
in days before americas sexual revolution 
although the rising feminist movement would soon reject the 
magazine as one that fostered reliance on men contemporary 
feminists now recognize that cosmopolitan played an important part 
in reshaping womens views of themselves 
i think that helen gurley brown in her editorship has 
been a rather spirited and gutsy example in the revolution of 
women said betty friedan 
mrs brown says she has always been a devout feminist 
i totally sympathize with what they did and had to do but at 
the same time the cosmo format was and still is along the lines of 
my philosophy which is that life is better with somebody to love 
the magazine that was so long a leader is now being criticized 
by some as outdated 
cosmo still has a peculiar 1972 singles orientation to it 
said danielle crittenden a writer and analyst of womens magazines 
where the magazine once popularized sexual freedom for women 
she said it now reflects a kind of desperation and loneliness 
that is very depressing that things didnt work out for whatever 
reasons 
circulation has dropped slightly from an alltime high of 3 
million in 1985 according to the audit bureau its readership is 
slightly older than it was 10 years ago 307 years old up from 
301 half the readers are married 
mrs brown still believes in a cosmo girl who can have it all 
i get absolutely incensed that women are told that we cant 
have it all that its not working out its too much work that 
weve got to go home and behave ourselves because its never said 
to men

twelve roman catholic womens groups on thursday 
termed as scandalous a plan by us bishops to launch a 
multimilliondollar public relations campaign against abortion 
we were shocked by your decision the groups said in an open 
letter urging the bishops to halt the project 
more fetal life could be saved by 5 million spent on caring 
for pregnant women and their children than by developing slick 
slogans or by bullying politicians 
the letter was addressed to archbishop daniel pilarczyk of 
cincinnati president of the national conference of catholic 
bishops and cardinal john oconnor of new york chairman of the 
bishops antiabortion committee 
a spokesman for oconnor declined to comment on the letter until 
it had been reviewed 
oconnor announced recently that a new york public relations 
firm hill amp knowlton and the wirthlin group a polling 
enterprise had been retained for a broadbased national campaign 
against abortion 
he said about 1 million a year was expected to be spent during 
the next three to five years in the campaign directed at catholics 
and noncatholics 
the womens groups in a letter released by catholics for a free 
choice in washington dc said the resoundingly negative public 
reaction to the plan should have persuaded the bishops to abandon 
it 
if not we must add our voices to the growing chorus of the 
faithful who insist that these efforts which are seriously 
damaging to the credibility of all catholics who work in the public 
arena on justice issues cease 
detailing other church financial needs the letter said 
our church is in economic trouble many dioceses are running 
deficits elderly nuns are on welfare innercity parishes are 
closing daily because the buildings cannot be maintained 
parents can barely manage to pay the rising tuition rates 
necessary to keep their children in parochial schools teachers are 
so poorly paid they need two and three jobs to care adequately for 
their own families 
social problems related to the churchs mission abound 
feeding the hungry clothing the naked sheltering the homeless 
caring for the sick and elderly are these needs not more urgent 
than the politics of abortion 
spending 5 million on the politics of abortion when the 
church is unable to provide for the spiritual and social needs of 
catholics is scandalous the womens groups said 
among the organizations were several major groups such as the 
national coalition of american nuns the national assembly of 
religious women and chicago catholic women all based in chicago 
other groups included the womens ordination conference based 
in fairfax va quixote center womenchurch of mount rainier md 
institute of women today of chicago and womens alliance for 
theology ethics and ritual of silver spring md

a former marine communications officer 
was sentenced thursday to 10 years imprisonment in a psychiatric 
facility for selling classified information to the soviet union 
us district court judge ts ellis iii issued the sentence 
after a courtordered psychiatric exam found that frank nesbitt 
45 suffered from severe personality disorders depression and 
apparent episodes of psychosis a disability that can impair ones 
touch with reality 
doctors however also had raised the possibility that nesbitt 
was pretending to be ill 
nesbitts attorney david hopkins said the sentence was 
appropriate as did assistant us attorney mark hulkower 
nesbitt served from 1963 to 1966 in the air forces electronic 
security command in west germany and from 1969 to 1979 in the 
marine corps where he dealt with classified communication 
gathering 
he also worked at the los alamos naional laboratories from 1983 
to 1984 during all his jobs he maintained a top secret clearance 
he pleaded guilty to espionage charges earlier this year after 
admitting he had agreed to cooperate with the soviets but he 
claimed he did not know the information was classified 
it was my true and honest effort not to do that nesbitt 
told the court on feb 1 
an fbi special agent testified nesbitt abandoned his wife and 
two children at their millington tenn home last june and left 
behind a note that said dont look for me im gone 
nesbitt will serve his time at a federal facility in buttner

on a sunbaked slope hundreds of 
contras rebels listened to an aide of presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro telling them to lay down their weapons 
but the attitude among contras outside this mountain hamlet 
recalled us gen george mcauliffes famous world war ii response 
to a german generals invitation to surrender 
nuts the rebels replied wednesday in loosely translated 
spanish invective to their earlier agreement to disarm when mrs 
chamorro was inaugurated 
others met the appeal by the chamorro aide roberto ferrey with 
silence and stares 
the rebels laughed when israel galeano one of 12 rebel chiefs 
standing at the bottom of the hill asked anybody who wants to 
give up his rifle come forward he said would be the last 
handing over his gun 
when one shouted nobody gives up his gun all cheered and 
applauded 
the rebels are angered and alienated by mrs chamorros 
concessions to the leftist sandinistas which allow them to keep 
command of the army 
were prepared to hand over our weapons only when not a trace 
of those elements is left one rebel told ferrey calling the 
sandinista officer corps insects 
members of the antisandinista army created by the united 
states in 1981 and sustained by washington until early this year 
were to begin handing over their weapons to un peacekeepers 
wednesday after mrs chamorros inauguration 
a pact signed last week by leaders of the contras the 
sandinistas and the new government committed the rebels to 
demobilize by june 10 
el destino is about 85 miles north of managua it is one of five 
zones where about 9000 contras are to gather and voluntarily 
surrender their weapons to un soldiers 
about 3000 came here during the past week and this week and 
2000 more are expected in coming days they roamed the 
180squaremile zone at will still armed with sovietdesigned 
ak47 assault rifles grenade launchers and weapons 
a few dozen un peacekeeping soldiers mostly venezuelan with 
spanish and irish officers were on duty but under their 
mandate they could do nothing other than receive weapons that were 
voluntarily handed over 
the contras were low on food and were supposed to receive 
rations and demobilization aid from the organization of american 
states after surrender but few if any apparently had received 
the aid 
immediately after she became president mrs chamorro canceled 
compulsory military service become her own defense minister and 
temporarily retained gen humberto ortega the brother of former 
president daniel ortega as army chief 
in an interview with the associated press galeano was asked 
what the contras specific conditions before demobilizing were he 
replied a state of law with guarantees that we dont have a 
politicized army 
galeano said it was up to mrs chamorros administration to find 
a formula for meeting those conditions but hinted the rebels 
wanted the sandinista army virtually abolished and suggested it be 
temporarily replaced by an international security force 
the problem is not one man humberto ortega the problem is 
the whole repressive structure of the army if they remove humberto 
ortega there are 10 or 20 other humberto ortegas to replace him 
galeano added 
no 2 rebel leader oscar sovalbarro who signed last weeks 
demobilization accord for the contras was asked if he believed the 
rebels will demobilized by june 10 
if the climate of confidence necessary for these men to give 
up their arms is improved it could be done he replied 
he talked of reforming the sandinistadominated army instead 
of abolishing it like galeano he insisted that demobilization is 
the voluntary decision of each fighter 
but that now appears to be a more uncertain prospect than ever 
said one regional commander who identified himself only as 
jackson i for one am not disposed to hand over my rifle id 
rather take to the mountains live in the jungle with my comrades

edward l rowny quit thursday as a senior arms 
control adviser to president bush sources said rowny resigned over 
what he felt was undue haste in completing a treaty with the soviet 
union to limit strategic nuclear missiles 
bush acccepted rownys resignation with deep regret and said 
he had always valued his advisers candor and loyalty 
you have served as one of the principal architects of the 
american policy of peace through strength bush said in a letter 
the 73yearold retired army lieutenant general 
rowny who will leave his post on june 30 said in a statement 
that he looked forward to contributing to his bushs efforts 
for peace through strength 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said rowny had authorized 
him to say there was no disagreement or reason to leave other than 
a desire to take two positions outside government 
but the sources who spoke only on the condition of anonymity 
said rowny disagreed with secretary of state james a baker iii 
over bakers pushing to complete the treaty at what rowny felt was 
too fast a pace 
he wanted to slow down start the strategic arms reduction 
treaty talks before we give up too much said a source outside 
the government and close to rowny he is saying whats the 
rush 
the administration would like to conclude at least a framework 
agreement on the key start issues for initialing by bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev at their summit meeting that begins 
in washington may 30 
he is saying by resigning why sacrifice the national 
security in a rush to get a glad hand and a smile from 
gorbachev the source said he will now make that point as a 
private individual 
rowny will become a senior associate at the center for strategic 
and international studies a private research group in washington 
and a visiting professor at george washington university 
the united states and the soviet union remain far apart on 
several key issues in the start talks among them are the 
procedures for verifying that missile reductions have been carried 
out whether to impose ceilings on landbased and sealaunched 
cruise missiles with multiple nuclear warheads and what kind of 
limitations to place on cruise missiles carried aboard jet fighters 
rowny has also strongly advocated concluding a treaty between 
the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact to 
reduce sharply us and soviet troops tanks artillery and other 
nonnuclear weapons in europe 
an administration official also insisting on anonymity said 
rowny was resigning because he had limited influence within the 
administration in projecting his views 
rowny was an adviser to both bush and baker he had also served 
as an arms control adviser to thenpresident reagan and his 
secretary of state george p shultz 
in 1979 he quit as an arms control specialist for the carter 
administration during negotiations to conclude the 1979 strategic 
arms limitation treaty 
that ussoviet accord which imposed some limitations on 
longrange nuclear weapons was denounced by reagan as he sought 
the presidency after reagans election rowny returned to the 
government to serve as chief start negotiator 
in a recent speech rowny said the soviets would have a 
completely modern formidable nuclear force even after carrying out 
cutbacks under a start treaty with the united states 
the cutbacks now being negotiated in geneva would trim the 
size of the soviet arsenal rowny told the reserve officers 
association 
in the meantime he said soviet strategic forces longrange 
nuclear missiles bombers and submarines are being upgraded to 
provide for a powerful arsenal after the treaty takes effect 
the ussr is intent on retaining its claim to the status of 
a superpower equal to the united states that only firstrate 
nuclear forces can provide rowny said 
the soviets are upgrading their strategic nuclear weapons far 
more aggressively than is the united states he said for instance 
rowny said the soviets are making their landbased ss18 
intercontinental ballistic missiles more accurate and more powerful 
while continuing to deploy ss24s with 10 warheads both in silos 
and as mobile weapons

two weeks before the world war ii allies meet 
to discuss germanys military future east germany said thursday it 
does not want a united germany to be part of nato 
in a parliamentary session prime minister lothar de maiziere 
said his reluctance until now to set out an official east german 
stance toward nato was no accident we want to overcome the 
military blocs not rearrange them he said 
the united states the soviet union britain and france meet in 
bonn on may 5 to resolve the international aspects of german 
unification including the sticky issue of its military standing 
asked about east germanys stance toward nato east german 
foreign minister markus meckel said membership in nato is not 
our goal he spoke in favor of building up a new european 
security system 
however since unification will come about sooner than a new 
system he said a temporary solution may be necessary if under 
those circumstances east germany has to consider membership in 
nato then the western alliance would have to substantially change 
its strategy meckel said 
he did not say how nato would have to change 
president bush and the entire nato alliance have insisted the 
new germany be a full member of nato including its military arm 
the soviet union has dropped its insistence that germany be 
neutralized but suggested overlapping nato and warsaw pact 
membership 
also thursday in parliament a new oath of allegiance for 
soldiers was passed that strikes the word socialism and uses 
peace instead 
the new oath says soldiers must do everything in their power to 
maintain peace and protect east germany that and similar 
wording replaces passages that for more than 40 years referred to 
fighting alongside the armies of the soviet union and our 
socialist allies 
as the two germanys scramble to accomplish monetary economic 
and social union by july 2 heated debates are taking place over 
how to bring the mighty west german mark into east germany 
west germanys proposal of a 11 exchange rate for wages 
pensions and savings up to 4000 marks 2300 is at the heart of 
the discussion 
the east german government has said it will push for a higher 
ceiling for the savings exchange 
de maiziere addressed the issue in parliament thursday 
we have already made some achievements considering there is 
now a willingness to exchange wages at 11 in a country where until 
now there was a rate of 1 west mark to 465 east marks de 
maiziere said drawing a round of applause 
commenting on charges that under the current plan east germans 
would become secondclass citizens de maiziere quipped until 
now we have been third or fourthclass 
in west germany the central bank said it could not rule out a 
tax increase to finance unification with east germany 
we cannot simply discount a tax increase out of hand 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl said at a conference in bonn 
he added that all other options for financing the union would be 
tried first 
the bank said the proposed exchange rate represents the limits 
of what west germanys economy can take 
the bank had suggested a 21 swap saying a 11 exchange would 
dilute the value of the west german mark and possibly cause high 
inflation and rising interest rates

civil liberties groups on thursday demanded 
tighter control of britains mi5 intelligence service after the 
23nation council of europe found it guilty of breaching human 
rights 
in a ruling this week the west european nations censured mi5 
for spying on two former officers of the british national council 
for civil liberties in the 1970s and classifying them and their 
organization as subversives 
the councils court the european court of human rights based in 
strasbourg france has found britain guilty more often than any 
other country 
the latest ruling sparked a new dispute over what critics see as 
a warping of civil liberties in britain and resistance to reform by 
prime minister margaret thatcher 
charter 88 a pressure group that includes retired judges 
academics and politicians said the ruling underlined the need for 
britain to have a written constitution and bill of rights 
one of the people classified as subversive and a communist 
sympathizer harriet harman is now a senior legislator in the 
opposition labor party and likely to become a cabinet minister if 
the socialists win the next election 
the other patricia hewitt was press secretary to labor party 
leader neil kinnock in the 1980s 
the two women demanded thursday that mi5 destroy files it 
presumably has amassed on them through surveillance including 
suspected phone taps 
ms harman said the surveillance casts a shadow over me which 
is totally unjustified and which i bitterly resent 
i want my file destroyed she said at a news conference at 
the house of commons 
she urged that mi5 and mi6 which gathers intelligence abroad 
should be directly accountable to parliament in the style of the 
us central intelligence agency 
the demand was echoed by the civil liberties council and 
legislators from both parties who consider current controls too 
lax 
the government made no comment in accordance with its practice 
of refusing to discuss the security services 
according to leaks to british newspapers mi5 has removed the 
civil liberties council from its classified list 
the government has also said it has rectified the human rights 
charge with a 1989 security service act 
this laid out a charter for mi5 for the first time provided for 
a complaints tribunal for people who suspect they are under 
surveillance and it required agents to get a cabinet ministers 
approval to bug or break into buildings 
but mi5 continues to report only to the prime minister and 
another cabinet minister the home secretary not parliament 
mi5 has been accused in recent years of infringing civil 
liberties by tapping telephones of labor union activists and 
antinuclear campaigners according to the memoirs of a retired 
agent peter wright mi5 tried to destabilize the labor government 
of harold wilson in the 60s and the 70s 
britain has been convicted of 22 violations of the european 
human rights convention including several on issues related to 
northern ireland such as nojury trials and imprisonment of 
terrorists 
britains frequent runins result partly from the fact that it 
is the only country in western europe that has no written bill of 
rights or constitution 
human rights issues are automatically transferred to the 
european court instead of being filtered through domestic courts 
the nearest thing in britain to a constitution is a 1689 
declaration accepted by william iii that ensured the ascendancy of 
parliamentary power over royal power

poverty and despair facing many american 
children are not only personal tragedies but a staggering 
national tragedy that threatens americas future a federal 
commission reported thursday 
the national commission on children said in an interim report 
that children have become the poorest age group in the united 
states with one child in five living below the poverty level 
it said the childhood poverty more than any other factor places 
young americans at risk for a range of longterm problems 
including poor health failure in school teenage pregnancy crime 
and drugs 
as a result it said many of todays children will reach 
adulthood unhealthy illiterate and unemployable 
the health and vitality of our economy and our democracy are 
increasingly in danger sen jay rockefeller dwva chairman 
of the panel said in releasing the report 
these are personal tragedies rockefeller said they are 
also a staggering national tragedy 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we 
have very deep concerns about the children of this country and the 
poverty level that they may be facing we know this problem 
exists 
he added its always constructive to get the best kind of 
analysis we can over how deep and how wide this problem is 
the commission was established by congress and its members were 
appointed by the president and house and senate leaders it made no 
recommendations in its interim report which was required by law 
but its findings are expected to form the basis for suggestions for 
new spending next year 
at a news conference with other members of the commission 
rockefeller acknowledged the recommendations likely will be 
expensive but commission members said the recommendations will 
involve efforts by business and families as well as government and 
are needed to head off future costs to society 
we know these kids are going to cost us billions in the 
future if not helped said dr t berry brazelton professor of 
pediatrics at harvard university theyre going to be the 
terrorists of the future 
in the report rockefeller said it is a tragic irony that at a 
time of prosperity the united states seems to be failing its 
children 
the evidence of this failure is pervasive he said the 
seriousness of the problems afflicting many of the nations 
children and their families is now largely beyond debate 
the report cited an array of jarring statistics all of them 
previously reported about childhood poverty 
malnutrition affects nearly a halfmillion children and 
100000 children are homeless 
among black and hispanic children poverty is even worse the 
poverty rate in 1987 the year the report cited was 15 percent for 
white children but 45 percent for black children and 39 percent for 
hispanic children 
one of every four rural child is poor and rural families are 
less likely than urban ones to receive public assistance 
us children on average are economically better off now than 
they were in the 1960s primarily due to rising family incomes 
through 1973 and the trend toward smaller families it said but 
those figures do not reflect the growing disparity among families 
the report said 
the 20 percent of children living in a poor family was up from 
15 percent in 1970 it said 
the problems of poor children are compounded by a patchwork 
health care system that omits many with harsh and senseless 
consequences the commission said 
more than 10 million children have no health insurance coverage 
including medicaid the report said every day 100 babies die 
before reaching their first birthday many for lack of prenatal 
care it said 
the report lamented the rise in singleparent families which 
are more likely to be below the poverty level the pervasiveness of 
drugs and the school dropout rate about one in four 18 and 
19year olds have dropped out of school it said and among 
hispanics the figure was 45 percent 
the report said that at a time when the conditions of children 
call for more flexibility in the schools many school systems are 
becoming more rigid in their operation and less accommodating to 
students needs

about 30 people demonstrated at the 
headquarters of an insurance company that has withheld 11 million 
in payments from a toledo center that uses recreational activities 
to treat alzheimers disease patients 
the protesters presented nationwide insurance officials with 
petitions demanding a review of the dispute prompted by the 
insurers finding that the treatments arent covered by medicare 
the treatment center intergenerational services inc has 
challenged the insurance companys decision to reject its claims 
and an internal review of the contested claims is expected to be 
finished by monday a company official told the demonstrators 
but the official william p ramsey vice president of 
nationwides medicare operations told the demonstrators he agreed 
with the original decision to reject the claims columbusbased 
nationwide insurance administers medicare plan b in the area 
since october the insurer has rejected 40000 claims worth 11 
million filed by intergenerational services for psychotherapeutic 
services to alzheimers patients the claims involve some 2000 
families 
nationwide says the claims are for recreational and social 
services and so fail to qualify as psychotherapy under medicare 
guidelines 
the rev al baumann president of the board of 
intergenerational said its program in which patients reminisce 
about the past sing songs and examine objects that will spark 
their memories is psychotherapy 
were trying to get them to relate to an object and to people 
because their problem is mainly depression and not being in touch 
with reality he said constant reinforcement is a form of 
behavior modification and that is psychotherapy 
alzheimers is an irreversible disease characterized by the 
degeneration of brain cells and often leads to severe dementia 
if the company review goes against intergenerational the 
program could appeal to an administrative law judge 
but baumann said after monday it will be too late 
eighty percent of the agencys budget is medicare money he said 
at the end of april were out of money baumann said 
sure we could get into a court thing which would take a year 
two years its not good because ultimately we may win the battle 
but lose the war 
among the protesters was judith messinger chairman of the 
advocates for alzheimers victims who said that no matter what the 
fate of the agency her organization would pursue the case 
quite clearly we dont intend to give up on this other 
alzheimers patients not only in ohio but in other states are 
going through the same kind of problems theyll be looking at us 
to see how this is settled she said 
the protesters also took their case to gov richard celeste 
delivering petitions with 10000 signatures 
spokesman reuven carlyle said the petitions had been received 
but that there was little the state could do because medicare is a 
federal program

pesticidelaced insect bait rained upon 
neighborhoods west of miami on thursday as authorities sought to 
snuff out a mediterreanean fruit fly infestation that could 
threaten floridas 14 billion citrus industry 
it was the first assault on medflies in dade county in three 
years state biologists meanwhile examined fly traps about 25 
miles north to check the scope of the infestation 
hopefully what weve done is the beginning of the end for the 
medflies said maeve mcconnell a spokeswoman for the eradication 
task force in miami were keep our fingers crossed 
a helicopter loaded with syrupy insect bait spiked with 
malathion blanketed a 16squaremile area near miami international 
airport where the first flies were found last week 
ms mcconnell said experts from the florida department of 
agriculture will be checking traps around fort lauderdale this week 
for any indication of more medflies whose larvae eat the core of 
fruit a female medfly found tuesday near port everglades was found 
not to be pregnant she said 
officials have speculated the fly could have been trapped inside 
a ship or plane 
as of late thursday 10 medflies had been discovered in south 
florida scientists have determined that for every medfly found in 
a trap there are probably 500 to 1000 fles nearby according to 
the state agriculture department 
present plans call for three more aerial applications in the 
miami area in may with a mixture of about 24 ounces of malathion 
per acre that compares with 31 ounces of malathion or about 
four tablespoons per acre sprayed throughout florida to control 
mosquitoes 
the use of malathion to kill medflies has caused controversy in 
southern california but there were no organized protests reported 
in miami on thursday 
a few school officials and parents complained that afternoon 
spraying coincided with release of students from class and one 
environmentalist blasted the effort 
there is no choice involved here the malathion is sprayed 
directly on places where people live i have a problem with that 
said joseph podgor jr dade county chairman of the friends of the 
everglades at least if its sprayed on fruits you can wash it 
off 
officials advised remaining indoors and keeping small pets under 
cover during spraying malathion which can irritate eyes also can 
damage paint on automobiles wateruse restrictions were waived for 
the spray zone to allow residents to rinse their cars 
next month millions of sterile medflies will be released in a 
slightly larger area in an attempt to break the insects onemonth 
breeding cyle 
a quarantine went into effect wednesday for about a 
100squaremile area west of downtown miami that requires 
inspection of all medflyhost produce including some 250 
varieties of fruits and vegetables leaving the area 
the last medfly spraying in florida occurred in 1987 in hialeah 
a city neighboring miami

shotgun booby trap that killed an intruder in his warehouse will 
get a deferred sentence for reckless manslaughter under a plea 
bargain announced thursday

will be cleared of the conviction if he has no further runins with 
the law denver district attorney norm early said 
the deal is subject to approval by a judge who does not have 
the option of accepting the guilty plea alone and imposing a 
sentence where none is recommended early said 
early said he decided to file a felony charge of reckless 
manslaughter and a misdemeanor charge of violating the states 
boobytrap law because the facts failed to support filing first or 
seconddegree murder charges connaghan will plead guilty to the 
charges under the agreement 
philip connaghan an otherwise lawabiding citizen 
knowingly stepped beyond the lawful means of protecting property 
because of the severe frustration created by repeated 
victimization early said 
michael mccomb 19 was killed by a blast from a 12gauge 
shotgun on april 14 after he and three juveniles broke into the 
warehouse that connaghan rented 
the three youths who have been released into their parents 
custody face possible burglary charges 
connaghan who was in kansas on vacation when mccomb was killed 
surrendered on april 20 and was released on 5000 bond monday 
under the plea bargain early will recommend that connaghan be 
given a deferred sentence and be required to perform community 
service 
if the judge rejects the agreement early said his office would 
have to consider new charges 
connaghan was pleased with earlys decision said connaghans 
lawyer bob ransome connaghan will not comment until it is 
resolved ransome said 
before the april 14 killing the warehouse which contained 
about 7000 worth of connaghans tools had been burglarized six 
times ransome said 
it became a battle of wits ransome said he couldnt get 
any satisfaction 
connaghan a handyman set two shotgun booby traps in the 
warehouse in january after it was burglarized a fourth time 
ransome said 
during the fifth burglary in march one of the booby traps was

he dismantled one of the traps and spent about 200 hours 
repairing damage to the warehouse that was caused by the burglars

booby trap rigged ransome said 
i think when he got in his car he just drove away he thought 
about turning around and then thought well theyre not going to

after learning of mccombs death connaghan felt remorse 
he realizes that even though the young man was burglarizing 
him in fact he was a human being and someones son ransome 
said 
the boobytrap case aroused sympathy for connaghan from people 
who have become frustrated with rising crime rates 
telephone calls to the residence of tim and rosalie mccomb 
parents of michael mccomb went unanswered thursday 
but in a letter to the editor published wednesday in the denver 
post the mccombs defended their son and criticized those who 
offered sympathy and support to connaghan 
our son fell off lifes path for a period of time he was on 
the road back when he was robbed of the chance to justify his 
life they wrote everyone who knew mike loved him he was not 
scum he was not a career criminal nor to our knowledge was he 
convicted of anything other than being a teenager trying to make 
his way in a world gone mad 
as colorado business owners for 30 years we have experienced 
the anger of being broken into many times however killing anyone 
has never crossed our minds alarms and insurance are certainly a

the government on thursday approved the sale 
of most eastern airlines foreign routes to american airlines and 
awarded a new texastokyo route to continental airlines 
president bush has authority to reject either deal if he 
believes it will harm us national security or foreign policy 
interests 
the transportation departments decision made tentatively 10 
days ago includes transfer to american of easterns central and 
south american routes as well as its miamimadrid flights and a 
miamilondon route operated by continental easterns sister 
corporation in the texas air group 
the department refused to allow transfer of easterns 
floridatoronto route as part of the deal saying it would examine 
the proposal further and consider selecting a carier other than 
american to operate the service three other carriers have 
indicated an interest officials said 
a bankruptcy judge last week turned over eastern to a trustee 
removing it from the control of texas air corp owner frank lorenzo 
easterns previous management had said sale of the routes to 
american approved by the bankruptcy court was key to easterns 
financial plans american had agreed to pay 349 million but that 
sum included the toronto route 
the awarding of a houstonhonolulutokyo route to continental 
ended competition among six carriers for a service formerly 
belonging to federal express 
the cargo service lost by federal express when it took over 
flying tiger line which already had usjapan cargo authority has 
been expanded to include both passenger and cargo service 
continental and three other carriers america west aloha and 
delta proposed a honolulutokyo route to replace the federal 
express service hawaiian airlines wanted to run the service 
between honlulu and nagoya and american proposed a service between 
san jose calif and tokyo 
the department said the honolulutokyo market provided the 
greater pbulic benefit and continental was selected largely because 
it proposed to serve houston with the same planes it flies to japan 
no singleplane service now exists between houston and tokyo 
and continentals cargo service should significantly increase 
houstons exports to japan the department said 
if continental decides it does not want the route america west 
will be allowed to operate its proposed route between tokyo 
honolulu and las vegas nev and phoenix ariz the department 
said

notebooks were tossed in the trash and job 
postings tacked on the bulletin board thursday at the st louis 
sun the new metropolitan newspaper that abruptly stopped 
publishing after only seven months of business 
the newspaper didnt publish a farewell edition its last 
edition the 213th appeared wednesday morning 
the sudden demise came as a shock to employees readers 
newspaper analysts and others and it also underscored the nagging 
slowdown that has hit the newspaper industry 
local and national newspaper advertising around the country grew 
just 4 percent last year its smallest increase in more than five 
years daily newspaper circulation has been stagnant at about 62 
million for a decade and its been declining the past two years 
about the only thing going well for newspaper publishers is that 
the price of newsprint is about 23 percent lower than last year 
the newspaper market is in turmoil said ralph ingersoll ii 
chairman and chief executive officer of ingersoll publications co 
and editorinchief of the sun this is at least the third such 
crisis i have personally lived through 
but ingersoll who personally directed the creation of the sun 
which debuted sept 25 1989 said he didnt know what role the 
industrywide troubles played in determining the suns fate 
i think it had a direct impact said kenneth berents a 
stock analyst in baltimore with alex brown amp sons inc its 
tough enough to do a startup but its almost impossible to do in a 
bad climate like this 
when he first set out to bring a second daily newspaper to st 
louis to compete with the 111yearold st louis postdispatch 
ingersoll said he hoped his effort would help invigorate the 
newspaper industry 
and even though the sun didnt make it he hasnt ruled out the 
possibility of trying it again somewhere else certainly no one 
else is going to try it analysts say 
first of all ingersoll was a maverick and there arent many 
mavericks around second of all this is a very unfriendly 
environment for newspapers right now said lisa donneson a stock 
analyst in new york for county natwest usa 
at a wednesday news conference ingersoll said the reason the 
sun didnt last longer was its failure to sell enough newspapers 
out of vending boxes and newspaper racks in stores 
ingersoll expected to sell most of the news newspapers on a 
singlecopy basis but soon after the paper started homedelivery 
sales outnumbered singlecopy sales by a twotoone margin 
that cost the sun 5 million more than planned ingersoll said 
the newspaper had spent more than 25 million to start up but he 
didnt know how much of that would be recoverable 
on thursday in the sun newsroom where windows overlook the 
gateway arch and clocks tell what time it is in tokyo some of the 
newspapers 194 fulltime employees cleaned out their desks and 
pondered the future 
some showed up in white shirts and ties and talked about job 
interviews they had just returned from some still peppered their 
sentences with words like shocked and stunned and some 
talked about thursdays softball game the first of the season 
were going to play as far as i know said the suns 
business editor dan kadlec who was in the office with his wife and 
fivemonthold daughter he left a job at usa today and moved to 
st louis from new york to work for the sun 
i havent even unpacked he said 
some reporters said they were upset that ingersoll didnt give 
the sun more time to prove itself and more notice of the 
newspapers collapse they said the general consensus in the office 
was that they had two years to try to make it 
i knew that this newspaper might not be around after 
twoandahalf years but it didnt think he would pull the plug so 
soon said ellen whitford a general assignment reporter who came 
to the sun from virginia 
im going to start applying for jobs but the markets pretty 
bad so i guess you could say i feel pretty grim at the moment 
she said 
ingersoll said all employees would be given at least 12 weeks 
severance pay and efforts would be made to find them jobs at other 
newspapers in the ingersoll chain 
meetings were scheduled for monday and tuesday to discuss 
parting benefits

the interior department will reopen refurbish 
and manage a 25 million gallon oil spill test tank at a navy site 
in leonardo nj according to an agreement signed thursday 
the tank which fell into disrepair after closing in 1987 is 
the only one of its kind in north america that accommodates 
fullscale oil cleanup equipment research there has produced most 
of what experts know about oil spill response 
officials hope to reopen the oil and hazardous materials 
simulated environmental test tank near the earle naval weapons 
station by 1991

the delaware river politicians began focusing attention on 
reactivating the wavegenerating tank which simulates open water 
conditions for testing prototypes of booms and small skimmers 
jim nash a former engineer at the facility has estimated it 
will cost 500000 to resume operations at the tank which is 667 
feet long 67 feet wide and 8 feet deep 
according to thursdays agreement the cost of operating the 
tank will be shared by the minerals management service the coast 
guard and environment canada which is canadas environmental 
department 
angela calos a spokeswoman for minerals management declined to 
disclose how much money is being set aside for the project but 
said the american petroleum institute indicated willingness to 
underwrite some research at the facility

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
thursday that the united states is reviewing loans granted to iraq 
that allow it to buy american farm products 
baker in comments to reporters after he met with venezuelan 
president carlos andres perez said officials are reviewing the 
situation with respect to the relationship with iraq 
particularly the matter of ccc credits 
through the agriculture departments commodity credit 
corporation the united states guaranteed loans for iraq to buy 
500 million in agricultural products last november baghdad has 
asked for another 500 million in credits 
baker said stronger sanctions similar to those imposed against 
libya and iran have never been under consideration 
he spoke shortly after assistant secretary of state john h 
kelly reiterated to a house committee the bush administrations 
objection to sanctions against iraq that have been proposed in 
congress 
iraqs leader saddam hussein has reportedly used chemical 
weapons to kill thousands of kurds living in his nation a charge 
the iraqi government denies and has threatened to use the weapons 
against israel 
while we do not rule out appropriate responses to recent 
actions by the government of iraq we are not prepared to see 
economic and trade sanctions legislatively imposed at this point 
kelly told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on the middle 
east 
his comments were met with incredulity by several committee 
members 
there is an aliceinwonderland element in your testimony 
rep tom lantos dcalif told kelly at what point will the 
united states recognize that iraqi president saddam hussein is 
not a nice guy 
rep howard berman dcalif and the author of legislation that 
would bar giving iraq the agricultural credits and disallow the 
sale of items such as computers that can be used for both 
military and peaceful purposes asked what would trigger stronger 
administration action 
kelly acknowledged the saddams recent behavior had damaged 
relations between washington and baghdad 
recent developments taken together are serious he said 
they raise questions in our minds about the intentions of iraqs 
leaders towards such international commitments as the 
nonproliferaton treaty and the geneva protocol banning the use of 
chemical weapons 
still kelly said the administration doesnt think legislatively 
imposed sanctions would work to temper saddams actions in fact 
they would hurt the us trade deficit by reducing us exports 
kelly said the united states is interested in seeing saddam 
change his ways there is a possibility of improvement and we 
want to encourage that improvement he said 
in general the united states is interested in having relations 
with iraq because of the country importance in the middle east the 
country is second to saudi arabia in oil reserves

imelda marcos blood pressure soared thursday 
forcing a recess of her trial after she heard testimony about the 
day she and her husband fled the philippines with a tremendous 
amount of jewels and cash 
us district judge john f keenan adjourned the trial until 
friday morning provided the former philippines first lady was able 
to return her lawyer gerald spence said he expected her back in 
court 
i think it was the reliving of probably the saddest day of her 
life spence said it brings back vividly her memories of that 
day 
spence said mrs marcos 60 wanted the testimony to continue 
but her doctor would not permit it 
mrs marcos was sobbing during the testimony and went to the 
nurses station in manhattans federal court when the lunch recess 
was called her doctor examined her and found her blood pressure 
was extremely high and the nurse confirmed his findings spence 
said 
her blood pressure is going up and down at this particular 
time spence said mrs marcos rested in the nurses office then 
left the courthouse on foot and with friends 
shes very distressed about her memories spence told 
reporters she has been the pillar of strength for our side up to 
this time 
the nurse marian leonard refused to answer questions about 
mrs marcos physical symptoms but said she became very upset 
kind of emotional shes under a lot of stress as you know 
shes improved she just needs a little rest 
another marcos attorney john tigue said later that mrs marcos 
returned to her manhattan apartment and was resting 
comfortably he added we expect her to be well enough to be in 
court tomorrow 
mrs marcos husband died last september in hawaii 
the incident climaxed a morning of dramatic testimony and a 
surprise visit to the courtroom by film actress bo derek 
accompanying members of the family of saudi arabian financier adnan 
khashoggi mrs marcos codefendant 
mrs marcos became upset during the testimony of us customs 
agent leslie e kinney he supervised the arrival of mrs marcos 
and her husband ferdinand e marcos in honolulu on feb 26 1986 
the day after marcos was ousted as president in a civil revolt 
kinney told of the official greeting party and red carpet that 
awaited the marcoses and their entourage of 90 people at hickam air 
force base hawaii 
he said some of the hundreds of suitcases and boxes that 
accompanied the entourage contained a tremendous amount of jewels 
and luxury items as well as money 
kinney said one of the most striking things he found was a case 
on which was embossed ferdinand marcos on our 24th wedding 
anniversary inside kinney said were 24 gold bars each weighing 
about a kilogram that would be worth about 286000 at thursdays 
gold prices 
mrs marcos has been on trial since march 20 she has pleaded 
innocent to charges of racketeering racketeering conspiracy 
obstruction of justice and mail fraud for allegedly stealing 220 
million from the philippines treasury to buy new york real estate 
and art 
her husband had been charged in the 1988 indictment 
when keenan excused jurors for the day he told them not to 
speculate on why the trial was recessed saying the reason was 
nothing unusual 
as he does at the end of every day the judge told jurors not to 
read watch or listen to any media reports about the case 
mrs marcos lawyers earlier asked keenan to caution the jury 
against watching a miniseries a dangerous life which 
dramatized the fall of the marcos regime the threepart series was 
televised on a cable station this week

president violeta barrios de chamorro 
encountered a political crisis in her first full day in office 
thursday for allowing the sandinistas to retain temporary control 
of the army and security forces 
her decision to be her own defense minister but to allow gen 
humberto ortega to stay on as army chief drew fire from rebel 
leaders and split her coalition in the national legislature 
ortega is the brother of former sandinista president daniel 
ortega 
two ministers mrs chamorro had named to her cabinet refused to 
serve as long as gen ortega remained rebel leaders refused to 
surrender their weapons to united nations peacekeepers and talked 
about taking to the hills and renewing their war against the 
sandinistas 
a news conference scheduled for 11 am by mrs chamorro was 
canceled without explanation and she remained out of sight for most 
of the day 
journalists telephone calls to the presidential office went 
unanswered 
immediately after her inauguration wednesday mrs chamorro 
abolished the unpopular compulsory military service that forced 
youths into the sandinista army to fight a nineyear war against 
the usbacked rebels known as contras 
she also announced plans to depoliticize the army and reduced it 
in size with an estimated 150000 soldiers it is the biggest in 
central america 
her transition team explained that her decision to retain 
humberto ortega and other sandinista security officials was a 
temporary one 
but this did not mollify her united national opposition the 
coalition of 14 parties ranges from communist to conservative uno 
representatives in the national legislature are split between those 
willing to go along with mrs chamorro and those who demand 
ortegas removal 
an agreement signed last week by mrs chamorros transition 
team the contras and the sandinistas called for the contras to 
voluntarily surrender their weapons to un military peacekeepers 
and disband by june 10 
up to her inauguration mrs chamorro remained vague about 
allowing sandinista officers to keep command of the army the 
sandinistas warned all along of renewed war if she made any attempt 
to alter the armed forces in any profound way 
when word leaked that the sandinistas would remain in control 
the contras balked at disarming 
hours after mrs chamorros inauguration wednesday israel 
galeano and oscar sovalbarro commanding about 3000 out of 5000 
contra fighters in safety zone 1 in the northern village of el 
destino refused to disarm there are a total of 9000 contra 
rebels inside nicaragua 
like zone 1 reports from the other four internationally 
monitored enclaves showed that few if any contras had actually 
surrendered their weapons 
mrs chamorros uno coalition handily won elections on feb 25 
ending 11 years of sandinista rule and confrontation with the 
united states washington accused the sandinistas of endangering 
regional security with their close military ties to cuba and the 
soviet union and imposed an economic embargo 
the 60yearold mrs chamorro is the widow of publisher pedro 
joaquin chamorro whose assassination helped ignite the 1979 
revolution that brought the sandinistas to power 
nicaraguas confrontation with the united states ended when mrs 
chamorro was sworn in for a sixyear term vice president dan 
quayle attended the inauguration and the bush administration lifted 
trade and other sanctions against nicaragua and prepared to help 
revive its battered economy 
but the sandinistas who got 41 percent of the vote remained 
nicaraguas single biggest political party this became evident 
after the inauguration 
manuel espinosa information minister while daniel ortega was 
president called reporters thursday to tip them that the defense 
ministry just told me to say the contras are reconcentrating in san 
rafael del norte a town near one of the security zones 
no one knew for sure if he still had a government job 
lt col rosa pasos was still defense ministry spokeswoman but 
when journalists called to check out the report she was not 
immediately available an aide said 
a brawl after much drinking broke out at a popular 
fiesta in managua late wednesday to celebrate mrs chamorros 
inauguration and was put down by the sandinistacontrolled police 
three people were injured and about a dozen revelers were 
arrested 
a man who had four front teeth knocked out by police said the 
fray apparently started over an argument that the square where the 
fiesta was held should be renamed plaza of the republic and not 
plaza of the revolution as the sandinistas had it

president bush won applause from conservative 
leaders thursday by voicing support for an array of causes ranging 
from a cut in capital gains taxes to a constitutional amendment 
allowing prayer in public schools

before the conservatives but the leaders were still appreciative 
anyway 
bush spoke before nearly 200 people in the old executive office 
building in the latest in a series of meetings with conservative 
leaders whom bush credited with helping him win the presidency

i dont see it more seriously he said his vision revolves 
around an america that is prosperous and at peace 
calling for a reduction in the capital gains tax rate bush said 
a cut would spur business investment and create new jobs 
along with his call for a constitutional amendment on school 
prayer bush also urged that presidents be given a power known as 
lineitem veto permitting them to delete individual items in large 
appropriation bills 
he won loud applause by saying that in any federal program for 
child care i will not see the option of relgiousbased child 
care restricted or eliminated were going to fight against that 
he made only a passing reference to lithuania which is 
struggling against soviet pressure to break away from moscows 
control 
in lithuania as in czechoslovakia and nicaragua budapest 
berlin the words of thomas dewey ring true you cant beat down 
ideas with a club today freedom is on the march and will not be

a bill extending the ban on imported 
saturday night specials to domestic arms manufacturers would 
deprive some americans of the ability to defend themselves with 
handguns the bush administration said thursday 
gun control opponents paint the attempt to outlaw small cheaply 
made handguns as a class and racial issue because poor people 
especially blacks are more often the victims of crime and 
inadequate police protection 
assistant attorney general sg dennis jr told the house 
judiciary committees subcommittee on crime thursday that a total 
ban on the handguns commonly known as saturday night specials 
would deprive citizens who do not already own a handgun of their 
ability to obtain one suitable for selfdefense but not for 
sporting purposes 
but the committees chairman william j hughes dnj and 
other democrats said it was hypocritical to ban imports and not 
domestic versions of the weapons 
i regret that you have to come up here and advance that 
argument hughes said 
i just think if you cant take it in you ought not to be able 
to sell it here said rep romano l mazzoli dky 
but dennis said the administration was called to testify on the 
bill that is being proposed not the law that has been on the books 
since the late 1960s the administration has no proposal to repeal 
that law he said 
the proposed legislation the handgun violence prevention 
act would ban the manufacture assembly acquisition and future 
transfer of the saturday night specialtype pistols said sponsor 
rep larry smith dfla 
the gun control act of 1968 banned the import of guns that 
lacked sporting purposes and required the treasury departments 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms to create a panel to screen 
weapons using a point system 
the administration used that standard last year to ban the 
import of rapidfire multiround rifles that have been used by drug 
dealers and in mass killings the subcommittee has approved 
legislation covering the usmade versions of those socalled 
assault rifles 
among those testifying was former white house press secretary 
james brady who used the occasion to argue for another proposed 
bill bearing his name the brady bill would require a waiting 
period for anyone wanting to buy firearms to let authorities check 
the record of the wouldbe purchaser 
the bill is sonamed because brady the former press secretary 
to president ronald reagan was seriously wounded and remains 
disabled as a result of the assassination attempt on reagan in 
1981 the attacker john hinckley was able to buy a 22caliber 
pistol easily despite a record of mental illness 
another james brady james c brady allegedly used a 
highercaliber pistol made by the same company to gun down five 
people at an atlanta shopping mall on tuesday 
brady had bought a pistol hours after being discharged from a 
mental hospital where he had been treated for homicidal and 
suicidal tendencies

lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said 
thursday he will carefully study a proposal from france and west 
germany that the baltic republic temporarily suspend its 
independence drive 
the letter from french president francois mitterrand and west 
german chancellor helmut kohl delivered to lithuanian 
representatives in moscow said such a suspension could lead to 
talks with the kremlin so that the current crisis ends in a 
solution acceptable to all parties 
also thursday vilnius radio reported lithuania will begin food 
rationing may 1 the republic of 38 million people is struggling 
under an economic embargo imposed last week by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to break its campaign for independence 
gorbachev himself was confronted thursday by activists 
protesting his crackdown in lithuania during his visit in an 
industrial city in the ural mountains demonstrators raised a 
banner that called him a political hypocrite 
landsbergis described the letter from mitterrand and kohl as a 
step forward toward the realization of lithuanian independence 
said parliamentary spokesman ed tuskenis speaking by telephone 
lithuania wants an immediate dialogue landsbergis said and a 
termination of the soviet economic blockade against lithuania would 
be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue 
the leadership of lithuania greatly appreciating this act of 
goodwill on the part of two noted leaders will carefully study 
this letters proposition he added 
tuskenis said landsbergis viewed as positive that the letter 
from kohl and mitterrand did not mention revoking lithuanias march 
11 declaration of independence the letter discussed temporary 
suspension of some decisions by the lithuanian parliament 
the letter from the french and german leaders came two days 
after president bush said he would put off sanctions against moscow 
for bringing economic and military pressure against lithuania 
kremlin authorities on monday urged lithuania to suspend for two 
years its declaration of independence 
lithuanian leaders have refused to revoke the declaration but 
the baltic republics leadership has always been willing to 
discuss the timing and the form of independence whether or not 
thats a year or two tuskenis said after talking to landsbergis 
lithuania has increased its efforts to circumvent the sanctions 
imposed last week by gorbachev 
a lithuanian delegation was due in leningrad on friday to talk 
with officials about a direct exchange of goods either for hard 
currency or barter a leningrad journalist said another group 
arrived in kiev the capital of the ukraine and met with local 
lawmakers according to the grassroots group rukh 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene announced wednesday that 
lithuania had halted its usual shipments of meat milk and other 
food to the rest of the soviet union she instead urged lithuania 
to settle its accounts with the republics almost in marketplace 
conditions of bartering for other goods 
the emergency committee of lithuanias leadership considering 
responses to moscows embargo has decided to start rationing some 
food products beginning may 1 according to vilnius radio no 
details were released 
unlike most soviet republics lithuania produces all the meat 
and dairy goods it needs so the rationing presumably would be of 
those foodstuffs it does not produce or of meat and milk products 
earmarked for export 
gasoline already is being rationed in the republic since 
gorbachev cut off its oil and curtailed natural gas deliveries by 
more than 80 percent last week individuals are limited to 78 
gallons of gasoline per month sugar and soap detergent also is 
being rationed the radio said 
hospitals running low on medicine discouraged all but 
emergency surgery radio vilnius reported in addition newspapers 
prepared to cut back the size of their editions by as much as half 
even if lithuania were able to strike barter deals with other 
soviet republics transporting the goods would be difficult 
because moscow controls the train truck routes and pipelines 
throughout the nation 
lithuania may be getting some help from neighboring estonia 
that republics leadership is expected to order its railway workers 
to ignore directives from moscow to stop sending goods to 
lithuania according to a spokesman for estonias foreign ministry 
lithuania estonia and latvia were forcibly annexed by the 
soviet union in 1940 
lithuanias top diplomat in the west said in rome thursday the 
baltic state was prepared to make all possible concessions to 
moscow except revoking its independence declaration 
stasys lozoraitis jr who heads the lithuanian diplomatic 
mission to washington and the vatican also distanced himself from 
sharp criticism of the bush administration by landsbergis for not 
instituting sanctions 
lozoraitis speaking at a luncheon of the american club of rome 
called the united states a staunch friend of lithuania and said 
it was probably too late to influence moscow through economic 
pressure 
it moscow will not react to the sanctions he said

soviets joined wdespread protests a 24hour 
telethon and a strike at a major factory thursday to mark the 
fourth anniversary of the worlds worst nuclear accident the 
reactor explosion at chernobyl 
it was the soviet unions biggest national commemoration of the 
1986 disaster and it followed years of stateencouraged passivity 
on the topic 
this year the ukrainian legislature designated thursday as 
chernobyl tragedy day and its byelorussian counterpart passed a 
similar measure other government bodies in contaminated areas 
sanctioned demonstrations 
official reports say 31 people were killed when one of four 
reactors at the chernobyl plant in the ukraine caught fire and 
exploded april 26 1986 unofficial reports say 250 died the blast 
spewed cesium strontium and plutonium over a wide area of the 
ukraine byelorussia and russia and sent a cloud of radioactive gas 
around the world 
for the first two days after the accident the soviet union 
refused to report it to the outside world and withheld information 
from its own people on the scope of the contamination 
residents in the southwestern soviet regions most affected by 
the partial meltdown organized demonstrations thursday to demand 
better medical treatment protection from radiation and punishment 
for officials who covered up the accidents effects activists said 
in kiev the ukrainian capital 70 miles south of chernobyl 
70000 people gathered for mass outside the 11th century saint 
sophia cathedral reported rukh press international a branch of 
the ukrainian peoples front in a subsequent protest drivers 
stopped traffic for five minutes and honked their car horns the 
report said 
in the byelorussian city of gomel most of the 35000 employees 
of the gomselmash industrial complex staged a daylong strike said 
alexander korniev a plant worker 
their demands included prompt closure of the chernobyl plant and 
criminal charges against all officials involved in the coverup 
three of chernobyls four reactors continue to operate 
the chernobyl telethon one of the soviet unions first 
experiences with televised fundraising collected the equivalent 
of about 115 million in rubles as well 5 million in us 
dollars organizers said 
the live broadcast from moscow interspersed singing groups and 
interviews with gripping footage of chernobyl rescuers and children 
from the contaminated zone suffering radiationcaused cancers 
along with money telethon pledges included donations of 
radiationfree fruit and 1100 pounds of honey for children in the 
contaminated area 
in the byelorussian cities of minsk and gomel and throughout the 
ukraine tens of thousands of residents gathered for church 
services and mourning protests soviet tv reported 
vetka north of gomel was among the small villages staging 
demonstrations and strikes according to local councilman oleg 
gromyko 
after dusk minsk residents lighted thousands of candles and 
rang church bells tass reported 
on the eve of the anniversary the national parliament adopted a 
26 billion program that would involve resettling an additional 
200000 people from irradiated areas 
after the accident about 116000 people were evacuated and 
some soviet scientists and politicians have been campaigning for 
further resettlements they say 4 million soviets live on 
contaminated land 
many chernobylarea residents have complained of inadequate 
medical care cases of anemia leukemia and cancers have been 
reported rising among people living on contaminated land many 
residents still eat irradiated food because alternatives are not 
available 
social and environmental fallout from the chernobyl accident 
continue in neighboring countries as well 
in sweden which was in the path of the radioactive cloud 
authorities reported that fish from about 15 percent of its lakes 
still are too contaminated to be eaten it may take 30 years before 
health authorities will clear the lakes 
in norway newspapers reported that the level of cancercausing 
substances in the most affected regions is 10 times the normal 
levels in plants and up to 20 times above normal in topsoil 
in czechoslovakia greenpeace environmentals scaled a cooling 
tower at a nuclear power station to cheers from onlookers they 
hung a banner saying stop csfrnobyl greenpeace csfr is the 
initials for the name of the czech and slovak federative republic 
a czechoslovak hospital urged prosecution of its countrys 
communist party and government officials whom it charged with 
failing to take measures to protect citizens after the chernobyl 
accident 
official soviet willingness to play up the chernobyl anniversary 
reflected the growing awareness of the catastrophe as well as the 
reformist views of many new local governing councils 
the television news program vremya focused its afternoon 
show on chernobyl reports we have been silent too long a 
vremya reporter said 
the soviet legislatures new program was adopted wednesday even 
though many members criticized it as inadequate to deal with the 
health agricultural economic and environmental aftermath of the 
accident 
the 26 billion earmarked wednesday is twice the level spent in 
the four years since the accident but still far short of the 405 
billion ukrainian legislator yuri scherback has estimated is needed 
over the next 10 years

the senate budget committee on thursday 
refused to endorse a 365 billion social security tax cut for next 
year the nonbinding vote was congress first formal show of 
sentiment on the politically sensitive proposal 
by 176 the panel rejected the offering by sen ernest 
hollings dsc it was based on an almost identical measure 
advanced last december by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny as 
a way of forcing action on the federal deficit 
this nonsense has got to stop hollings said before the 
vote we are wrecking ourselves we are wrecking our country 
budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said he 
supported the idea of reducing the tax rate but feared the 
consequences it would have on the budget deficit 
weve got to have a way to replace that revenue loss he 
said 
nine democrats and eight republicans voted against the tax cut 
plan while four democrats and two republicans supported it 
earlier thursday the committee rejected four 1991 
deficitreduction plans after the panels majority democrats failed 
to unite behind a single package 
the votes on the deficit plans left the committee floundering in 
its search for a way to slash at least 37 billion from next years 
budget shortfall which the grammrudman law requires the panels 
work is expected to continue into next week 
across the capitol the house continued debating a 124 
trillion budget for next year that provides less for defense and 
more for domestic programs than president bush prefers final house 
approval of the democraticwritten plan is expected tuesday 
the house rejected two republicansponsored alternatives a 
proposal by rep john kasich rohio to freeze military and 
domestic spending at current levels lost 305106 a plan by rep 
william dannemeyer of california featuring the use of goldbacked 
bonds to reduce the governments debt costs was defeated 35448 
the social security vote was only symbolic in nature congress 
budget committees set targets for revenue collection but other 
committees decide which taxes will be raised and by how much 
but the issue has been sensitive the white house has accused 
supporters of the tax cut of ultimately wanting to reduce social 
security benefits 
some democrats have supported the proposal because of the 
attractiveness of offering a tax cut but others have opposed the 
plan arguing that it would simply make the deficit even larger 
the provision would have lowered the 62 percent payroll tax to 
51 percent next jan 1 the tax is paid by both wage earners and 
employers a family with a median income of 32000 would save 400 
a year 
over five years the reduction would have lowered payroll taxes 
by 267 billion 
moynihan and hollings have complained that the social security 
trust fund is building up huge surpluses each year that make the 
governments overall deficit appear smaller cutting the social 
security tax and thus reducing that surplus would force lawmakers 
to address the shortfall problem the two senators say 
in defeating the four deficitreduction proposals republicans 
on the senate panel did what they have been promising to do for 
weeks they have said any budget written solely by congress will be 
meaningless because bush will veto elements he opposes such as 
deep defense cuts and tax increases 
it cant be carried out it cant be implemented the 
committees ranking republican sen pete domenici of new mexico 
said during a break you just have to have both houses of 
congress and the president involved to get anything meaningful 
the committees 13 democrats divided their votes about evenly 
as a result the panel rejected four democratic plans that called 
for savings ranging from 50 billion to 565 billion 
all the democratic plans relied more on defense cuts and tax 
collections than bush wants they also surpassed the 37 billion in 
deficit reduction the president proposed in january 
but each one of them was turned down as democrats skeptical that 
the savings could be enacted into law joined the bloc of 
republicans 
the only proposal that came close to approval was offered by 
sen timothy wirth dcolo which lost on an 1111 tie measures 
must receive a majority of votes to be approved 
wirth proposed imposing a 5 per barrel oil import fee and 
spending the 64 billion raised for environment education and 
deficitcutting efforts

argentinas congress voted 
thursday to claim the falkland islands eight years after losing a 
war with britain over the remote south atlantic archipelago 
britain immediately objected to the measure which appeared to be 
largely symbolic 
the legislation approved despite opposition by argentinas 
foreign ministry declares the falklands known in argentina as 
the malvinas to be part of the new argentine province of tierra 
del fuego it also covers the sandwich and south georgia islands 
also british possessions 
in london a spokesman for the british foreign office speaking 
on condition of anonymity said we dont accept this or any 
other argentinian claim to british territory 
the senate has already approved the legislation and president 
carlos menem was expected to sign it 
menem said the measure does not signify that england recognize 
our sovereignty but rather simply that we ratified the malvinas 
are ours 
he added he did not expect the move to cause obstacles in 
relations with britain 
britain has held the falklands since 1833 in 1982 britain and 
argentina fought a 74day war over the windswept islands causing 
the deaths of nearly 1000 men 
argentinas ruling peronist party had pushed for the inclusion 
of the falklands in the legislation creating the new province 
however critics warned that the measure could backfire 
they said the move could hamper argentinas continuing claims of 
sovereignty by giving credence to british arguments that argentina 
might try to impose its will on the 1900 islanders 
the islanders are british subjects and say they prefer to remain 
so 
for seven years after the war argentina refused to formally 
declare a cessation of hostilities diplomatic ties were severed 
and relations handled through third countries commerce trade 
travel and investment declined 
improving ties was one of menems top foreign policy goals after 
he became president last july consulates were upgraded to 
embassies direct air travel resumed and a military exclusion zone 
around the islands lifted 
britain and argentina restored full diplomatic relations feb 
16 following two days of talks between the two countries in madrid 
britain agreed to lift a 150mile military protection zone 
enforced around the islands since argentina invaded them in june 
1982 
the agreement said new arrangements to ensure the security of 
the islands would involve advance notice by both sides of military 
maneuvers in the area 
by mutual assent their agreement did not touch on the two 
countries conflicting claims to the falklands 
the british foreign office spokesman in london said the 
recent progress made on britishargentine relations was only 
possible on the understanding that we were not willing to discuss 
sovereignty and we will be repeating our views via diplomatic 
channels 
the new province was created in response to demands by argentine 
residents of the island of tierra del fuego for greater government 
representation it had been argentinas lone territory 
chile shares ownership of the island at the foot of south 
america the dividing line between chile and argentina was extended 
years ago through tierra del fuego 
under the measure residents of the new province would elect a 
governor who is now appointed by the president representation in 
the national chamber of deputies would double to four and two 
senate seats were to be alloted 
the provincial capital is to be ushuaia 2260 miles south of 
buenos aires and the southernmost city in the world

defense secretary dick cheney on thursday 
called for slashing pentagon plans for the b2 stealth bomber and 
other sophisticated aircraft citing a diminishing soviet threat 
cheney pressed by congressional democrats to cut military 
spending in response to rapid changes in europe testified his 
blueprint would trim 24 billion from president bushs 307 
billion defense budget for 1991 and would save 348 billion 
through 1997 
in addition to cutting the proposed number of b2 bombers from 
132 to 75 cheney said he intends to cut planned purchases of the 
c17 longrange transport plane and the navys a12 attack 
aircraft and to delay purchases of the air forces advanced 
tactical aircraft and the advanced tactical fighter 
the chairman of the house armed services committee rep les 
aspin dwis commended cheney for coming to grips with some 
things he clearly needs to come to grips with but said he didnt 
go far enough 
citing analysts testimony one day earlier on the internal 
problems in the soviet military as well as us intelligence 
reports predicting instability of the broader soviet economy aspin 
said cheneys plan is based on an unrealistically pessimistic 
view of the soviet threat 
cheney later presented his plan to the senate armed services 
committee where the panels chairman sen sam nunn dga gave 
the secretary high marks for his efforts but declined to adopt the 
program totals 
nunn was puzzled however by cheneys ability to reduce 
aircraft programs without final figures on the armed forces 
how can you make the decision on the numbers without having a 
firm force structure in mind nunn asked 
cheney said the present situation dictates cuts in the b2 and 
c17 and possible reductions in aircraft carriers and air force 
wings will decide the other programs 
i can tell you with some conviction that both the navy and the 
air force are going to be a lot smaller in the future than they are 
today cheney said 
the democraticcontrolled house is already debating a fiscal 
1991 budget that would make significant cuts in proposed pentagon 
spending the senate is working on its own version 
cheney told the house committee soviet military capability 
will continue to be robust but we can in fact afford to slow down 
the pace of developing and fielding the next generation of aircraft 
he said nato faces fewer enemy aircraft and a reduced ground 
threat as a result of the dramatic changes sweeping eastern 
europe and the soviet union 
the defense secretary said that although the soviet union has 
consistently found a way to upgrade its military despite economic 
woes we expect the overall performance of their economy to have 
an impact on what theyre able to build and deploy by the way of 
sophisticated new weapons systems 
he predicted a slip in the years in which the new systems will 
be deployed 
cheney said his proposed cutback would lower the projected cost 
of the b2 program from 754 billion to 611 billion but he said 
building fewer planes would drive up the cost of a single plane 
from about 530 million to more than 800 million 
we are in fact looking at targeting requirements cheney 
said noting the obvious change in what would be deemed targets in 
eastern europe since the collapse of the warsaw pact 
cheney said he intends to cut the number of b2 aircraft to be 
purchased in the next fiscal year to two planes from the five 
currently proposed at a cost in the fiscal 1991 budget of 55 
billion and the maximum number of planes to be built during peak 
years of production would be reduced to 12 instead of 24 cheney 
indicated 
conservatives on the house panel suggested that cheneys plan 
for the b2 will help the program survive on capitol hill 
it could make it more palatable to members on defense rep 
ike skelton dmo said following the hearing 
rep robert davis rmich said cheney has given republicans 
a very dependable position something we can sell to the house 
and the american people 
but rep charles bennett dfla said lawmakers still will alk 
at the imponderable tremendous amounts of money either for the 
overall program or the unit cost 
in other specifics cheney proposed 
buying 120 of the c17 longrange transport planes instead of 
the 210 originally planned at a proposed savings of 119 billion 
over the life of the program the plane is designed to replace the 
aging c141 transport plane 
purchasing a smaller number of the navys a12 allweather 
medium attack planes cutting the original request of 858 to 
minimum of 620 the a12 is designed to replace the navys a6e 
intruder which is now reaching the end of its service life as an 
aircraftcarrier based longrange strike jet 
the cuts could mean elimination of two of the navys 14 aircraft 
carrier battle groups he said 
cheney said the total cost of the a12 program is 52 billion 
and the pentagon has spent 51 billion on the aircraft the total 
cost amounts to about 84 million per plane 
the air forces version of the plane the advanced tactical 
aircraft is supposed to be used for deep attack missions now 
handled by the f111 and f15 production of the ata would be 
delayed beyond 1997 the end of the pentagons longterm fiveyear 
budget cycle cheney said 
cheney also suggested that purchases of the advanced tactical 
fighter be delayed from 1994 to 1996 the aircraft is intended to 
replace the air forces f15 the number to be purchased should 
remain at 750 cheney said 
the delay in that fighter will also delay the procurement of the 
navys version by two years and reduce the number of aircraft to 
546 from the original 618 planned cheney said

a major presidential candidate on 
thursday urged the west to withold aid to romania until all 
vestiges of communist rule are removed as antigovernment protests 
went on here for a fifth straight day 
ion ratiu considered interim president ion iliescus chief 
rival in the the may 20 election said he opposed a recent european 
economic community decision to allocate immediate aid to romania 
because he feared it might strengthen the position of iliescus 
national salvation front 
the front dominates the interim government running romania until 
the elections and ratiu said it seized power illegitimately 
he told reporters he was against any gestures at this moment 
that could reinforce the power of the front in any way 
demonstrators numbering 20003000 during daytime but down to 
a few hundred in early morning hours have lashed out at what they 
say is communist infiltration of the interim government 
protesters at the antigovernment rally at university square 
accused iliescu of being a closet communist despite his 
repeated promises to break with the countrys communist past 
iliescu was a senior communist official until he fell afoul of 
dictator nicolae ceausescu who was executed during a revolution in 
december 
many western countries including the united states have 
already sent limited aid to romania including food and medicine 
ratiu apparently was referring to pooled economic assistance from 
the 12 eec countries but he did not elaborate and eec officials 
were not immediately available for comment 
ratiu 72 candidate of the 600000member national peasant 
party accused iliescu and his front of being unrepentant 
communists guilty of manipulating the media in the electoral 
campaign 
ratiu also said his life was threatened by a mob organized by 
the front in buzau about 200 miles northeast of bucharest 
the state rompres news agency reported on thursday the official 
formation of a new intelligence service to replace securitate the 
old state police agency which ceausescu used to terrorize his foes 
and ordinary romanians 
the new service will gather data solely on espionage services or 
terrorists planning subversive actions to undermine romanias

researchers in four states have now linked a 
single manufacturer of the dietary supplement ltryptophan to a 
potentially deadly blood disorder which has struck 1500 people 
federal epidemiologists from south carolina and new york 
reported thursday that many of their states cases of 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome a painful blood disorder linked late 
last year to ltryptophan occurred after patients took the product 
from just one japanese manufacturer 
researchers from oregon and minnesota reported similar findings 
wednesday at a national epidemiology conference at the centers for 
disease control 
the ltryptophan use thats causing people to get ill is 
virtually universally from one particular company said dr ed 
kilbourne a cdc specialist in eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome or 
ems significantly fewer users were unaffected if they were using 
that companys products 
ltryptophan has been widely taken in this country by dieters 
insomniacs and people fighting depression before its recall by the 
food and drug administration earlier this year it was widely sold 
in health food stores 
several japanese manufacturers make ltryptophan and their 
products are sold under a host of different brand names the cdc 
has refused to specify the company whose product has been 
implicated because there are still a number of ongoing 
investigations which are not yet complete kilbourne said 
but the washington post on thursday quoted a spokesman for the 
showa denko co one of japans largest chemical manufacturers as 
saying the studies showed a strong statistical association 
between our product and ems 
showa denko has already been named in at least one lawsuit from 
an ems patient a 20 million claim from a oregon woman 
but it is important to note that the studies do not 
independently identify the precise cause of ems said the showa 
denko spokesman bob schwadron 
the fact that one specific manufacturer has been implicated 
means the likely cause of the illness is some sort of product 
contamination and not simply ltryptophan itself kilbourne said 
but researchers still dont know what sort of contaminant might be 
responsible in that manufacturers product or how it got there 
this is still a very complicated investigation kilbourne 
said 
nationwide nearly 1500 cases of ems have been reported to the 
atlantabased cdc twentyone patients have died 
a minnesota telephone survey reported wednesday found that 3 
percent of households contacted had someone taking ltryptophan 
between august and november 1989 
south carolina researchers found a number of ems cases in one 
psychiatric clinic that prescribed ltryptophan for more than 
threequarters of its 654 patients in 1989 fortyseven confirmed 
ems cases were found and 45 were in patients taking one particular 
brand from the implicated japanese manufacturer said mary kamb a 
federal epidemiologist in south carolina 
in new york which has reported 145 ems cases the majority of a 
study group of cases were linked to the same manufacturer said 
epidemiologist ephraim back and most patients took the product 
between december 1988 and may 1989 
the epidemic rise of ems supports the role of a contaminant as 
the source of this disease he said 
ems is marked by severe muscle and joint pain breathing 
difficulties swelling of the arms and legs skin rash fatigue 
cough and sometimes fever in some cases victims show signs of 
congestive heart failure and develop a condition that causes 
progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis

chief justice william h rehnquist rejected a 
final appeal thursday to delay startup of the seabrook nh 
nuclear power plant in a decision that clears the way for the 
reactor to begin routine operations 
rehnquist without comment rejected a bid by opponents of the 
plant to hold up operation until a lowerlevel federal appeal can 
be heard next september 
we and the other opponents continue to have very serious 
concerns about the operation of that plant and thats why we could 
not in good conscience go ahead without exhausting every legal 
remedy available said mary breslauer a spokesman for 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon who is leading the 
antiseabrook forces 
shannon along with the seacoast antipollution league and the 
new england coalition on nuclear pollution will present the case 
against seabrook to the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia on sept 18 the chief argument against the 
plant all along has been that its location could trap thousands of 
coastal residents and tourists in a nuclear emergency 
plant spokesman ron sher said the seabrook reactor is currently 
being operated at 8 percent power and the power plant is on the 
verge of producing its first commercial electricity more than two 
decades after it was first conceived 
that will be the most significant milestone in seabrook 
stations history sher said that will mark the first time 
that seabrooks electricity will be traveling through the power 
lines of new england to homes and businesses and industries 
now that seabrook opponents have exhausted their last bid to 
delay the plant sher said plant officials hoped massachusetts 
would stop its opposition and work with us constructively to 
continue to update the emergency response plans for the communities 
near seabrook

the worst mormon cricket infestation in nevada 
since the 1930s appears under control a state agricultural 
official said thursday as the federal government launched a second 
aerial attack on the voracious insects 
the infestation covers some 700000 acres in five counties of 
northcentral nevada with crickets counted at up to 100 per square 
foot in some areas near winnemucca 160 miles northeast of reno 
i think weve made real progress in killing the insects 
although theres a lot of them out there said dick rowe 
coordinator of the nevada department of agricultures plant 
industry program at the present time i think weve got things 
under control 
i might change my mind 30 days down the road but for now it 
looks like were doing ok and the insects havent done any real 
damage yet 
rowe said the crickets which are related to grasshoppers are 
about three quarters of an inch long now but will grow up to two 
inches long within the next month the size of a small mouse 
if the juicespitting insects arent killed at the mouths of 
canyons where they hatched theyll merge together in a hungry 
march across rural nevada at a rate of onehalf mile to one mile a 
day eating everything organic in sight such as crops gardens and 
grasses 
migrating bands can be onehalf to one mile across and one to 10 
miles long and usually arent stopped except by cold weather or 
poison the barbedlegged insects have few natural predators 
authorities said 
the insects which can bite humans if disturbed got their name 
from a similar infestation reported in utah in the 1800s sea gulls 
from salt lake city reportedly flew over the infested land eating 
the crickets to save the area from total destruction according to 
mormon legend 
during the past few weeks state agriculture officials on the 
ground have been spreading bran bait laced with the pesticide 
carbaryla to kill the crickets in the canyons 
on wednesday the federal government began aerial spraying of 
the pesticide in the battle mountain area where there arent any 
nearby waterways that could get contaminated 
silvia holman a spokeswoman for the plant protection and 
quarantine division of the us agriculture department said more 
than 5000 acres were sprayed wednesday officials planned to spray 
an additional 6000 acres in the area during thursdays second 
flight 
the crickets are really coming out of the woodwork she 
said but were fighting them every day 
ranchers such as eldon crawford of golconda have their own crews 
killing crickets 
ive had them for the past three years but this is the 
worst crawford said this week i dont know how strong theyre 
going to get my gut feeling is that were going to stop them 
but its anybody guess 
several dry winters in a row and a lack of predators created 
perfect conditions for the record infestation experts said

a former state senator convicted of 
accepting payment to push a bill through the legislature was 
sentenced to 6 years in prison thursday 
in sentencing state sen joseph montoya us district judge 
milton schwartz called montoyas voteselling the most serious 
type of whitecollar crime 
it attacks every single person and it attacks the process of 
being able to continue a representative form of government 
schwartz said 
montoya chairman of the senate business and professions 
committee was the first california legislator in 35 years to be 
convicted of a felony while in office he was the first person to 
stand trial on charges stemming from an fbi sting of statehouse 
corruption 
he resigned from the senate on feb 9 a week after he was 
convicted of one count of racketeering one count of money 
laundering and five counts of extortion 
the case stemmed from a lengthy fbi investigation he was 
convicted of demanding campaign contributions and honorariums in 
exchange for votes and other legislative favors 
montoya who turns 51 on monday showed no emotion during the 
hearing but two of his daughters who sat behind their father had 
tears in their eyes 
i believe in this system montoya told schwartz the 
system found me guilty i will live with those consequences and 
so will my family 
schwartz also ordered montoya to spend three years probation 
after serving his sentence fined him 32000 and ordered him to 
pay 8000 in restitution to cover money he collected in connection 
with the case 
the judge ordered the former lawmaker to surrender by june 29 to 
begin serving his sentence defense attorneys said they would file 
a motion to allow montoya to remain free pending an appeal 
the prosecutions case focused on a videotape of a breakfast 
meeting the lawmaker had in 1988 with an fbi undercover agent who 
posed as a southern businessman seeking legislation to help a dummy 
company 
during the meeting at a downtown sacramento restaurant the 
undercover agent gave montoya an envelope containing a 3000 check 
prosecutors contended the check was a payoff requested by 
montoya for his help in getting a bill through the senate 
the defense denied that montoya had done anything special for 
the bill and argued that the money was a legal honorarium

scores of puyallup indians received 20000 
checks thursday under the largest indian landclaims settlement 
outside alaska and a state official said tribal leaders feared the 
cash would draw con artists 
this money is the candy the frosting but hardly the most 
important element of the settlement said michelle aguilar 
executive director of the washington state office of indian affairs 
puyallup leaders refused to speak with reporters and barred them 
from headquarters where checks were being distributed to more than 
800 adults through monday another 700 members are entitled to the 
checks when they turn 21 
there has been some concern that when you hand out this much 
money to any large group of people puyallup tribal members or 
anybody else some people will be conned aguilar said 
i know the tribe has done what it can she said it has 
offered financial planning classes but whether people availed 
themselves of those classes was up to them 
the payments were made under a 162 million landclaims 
settlement that took six years to negotiate the tribe relinquished 
its centuryold claim to thousands of acres in the industrial heart 
of tacoma and other parts of pierce county in exchange for cash 
programs and real estate from federal state and local governments 
as well as private land owners 
everybody is focusing on the money but thats the least of 
this settlement ms aguilar said 
the settlement will give the tribe and its members an 
opportunity to participate in their own destiny through 
development of valuable real estate and other financial avenues 
provided by the settlement she said 
the settlement is second in size only to the alaska native 
claims settlement act of 1971 in which congress gave 960 million 
and 44 million acres to eskimos aleuts and alaska indians in 
exchange for their giving up land claims 
earlier tribe officials told the morning news tribune of tacoma 
they were carefully guarding the membership list to try to keep con 
artists at bay 
lena landry head of the tribes trust fund board which is 
overseeing the cash payments said she and other leaders were 
confident most recipients would spend the money wisely 
the tribe took measures to spot problems including forming an 
alcohol crisisintervention team and monitoring schoolchildren for 
signs of family problems 
some puyallups were less optimistic recalling the alcoholism 
and domestic abuse that plagued the klamath tribe in oregon after 
members received cash payments more than 20 years ago 
ara satiacum told the paper that drug dealers had come around 
her home the last few days she sold crack cocaine before 
undergoing treatment earlier this year and the dealers hoped to 
front her a large quantity of crack to peddle in smaller amounts 
she said 
others have said they wouldnt bank the money for fear of taxes 
even though just the interest would be taxable 
theres going to be a lot of people carrying their money 
around because they dont want to put it in a bank account said 
shirley satiacum aras mother im worried people will be hit 
over the head and robbed 
tribe members told the paper some have already bought cars from 
dealers who offered deferred payment plans 
tribe member dennis lapointe a 36yearold father of three 
made an offer on a small green house this week 
lapointe said most in the tribe were using their money to buy 
necessities that have long been out of reach to many 
we have a lot of hardworking puyallup people who are just 
waiting for a chance to show people what they can do lapointe 
said

ground controllers cheered after 
reestablishing contact thursday with the 15 billion hubble space 
telescope through its main antennas 
an attempt six hours earlier had failed 
im pretty relieved i must say said al boggess hubble 
project scientist at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md 
applause erupted at goddards space telescope operations control 
center when the highspeed contact was made thursday afternoon 
controllers sent information to the telescope about its 
location and this basically improved the telescopes knowledge 
where it was what its position was said goddards dave 
drachlis they also widened the radio beam to cover a larger area 
around the two highspeed dish antennas 
we have confirmation that we have achieved communication with 
the tracking and data relay satellite through the highgain antenna 
system drachlis reported 
the antennas are the primary communications links for relaying 
scientific information to the ground 
controllers lack of experience with the new satellite was part 
of the problem boggess said 
this probably wont be the last time we have a problem he 
said well keep working at it until we have all these things 
that need to be done done well get them right 
the problem began thursday morning when engineers tried pointing 
the two highspeed antennas toward two widelyseparated tdrs 
satellites without success two lowspeed antennas were working 
fine but boggess said they would be excruciatingly slow for 
sending data 
there had been a communications outage with the telescope 
earlier it lasted only 45 minutes and was due to human error 
in addition one of four rate gyros wheels whose spin 
maintains the telescope in a stable position was disconnected by 
an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain 
immediately but it was restored later and the stability of the 
satellite was unaffected 
the problems wont delay the schedule for putting the telescope 
into use said jean oliver hubble deputy project manager at 
marshall space flight center in huntsville ala 
now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what 
part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do 
differently in the future to make it continue to work boggess 
said having done it once weve got confidence we can do it and 
that means the mission can proceed 
space shuttle discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope 
and was to stay nearby until the hubbles aperture door was opened 
set for friday morning its five astronauts spent the day doing 
experiments and taking pictures of storms over texas and other 
views of earth from 380 miles up the highest a shuttle has ever 
flown 
when the door covering the telescope aperture is opened 
starlight will strike the telescopes finely polished 945inch 
mirror for the first time 
if signals fail to activate the 10footwide aluminum aperture 
door mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan 
will go into open space and crank it open saturday 
the shuttle is scheduled to land sunday at edwards air force 
base calif the mission would be extended a day if the space walk 
became necessary 
on tuesday the national aeronautics and space administration 
releases its first image from the telescope an open star cluster 
in the constellation carina scientific data will follow in a month 
or two 
the 12ton 43footlong telescope about the size of a bus is 
named for astronomer edwin p hubble who died in 1953 the 
missouriborn hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe 
is expanding a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe 
was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion 
astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space 
telescope

prime minister yitzhak shamir leader of the 
rightwing likud bloc was chosen to form a new government thursday 
after labor party chief shimon peres gave up trying to forge what 
he called a peace coalition 
a shamirled government could spell trouble for us efforts to 
arrange a palestinianisraeli dialogue 
at a likud meeting thursday defector avraham sharir announced 
his return to shamir ranks giving the prime minister the edge over 
labor 6159 with the support of nonlikud deputies in israels 
120seat knesset or parliament 
sharir earlier switched over to labor when it seemed that peres 
had a chance to form a government 
peres predicted earlier that shamir would also fail to form a 
coalition but added that if shamir did succeed he would create 
an extremist rightwing government the like of which israel never 
had 
on thursday peres called president chaim herzog and announced 
he was unable to break a standoff in parliament 
herzogs office said the president would give the job to shamir 
head of the caretaker government that took over after parliament 
voted march 15 to end the laborlikud coalition 
peres as he left the presidents residence thursday evening 
said shamir should count his 61 votes carefully israeli radio said 
shamir 74 will get the mandate in a ceremony friday morning at 
the presidents residence a spokesman said he would accept 
the polishborn shamir who lost his parents and two sisters in 
the nazi holocaust was a prestate radical underground leader who 
later served as a senior official in israels mossad intelligence 
agency 
shamir has rejected any dealings with yasser arafats palestine 
liberation organization and has forged ahead with settlement 
building in israelioccupied lands despite increasing signs of 
strain with washington 
in recent weeks for example shamirs government approved 
settlements in the occupied gaza strip and the west bank it was 
also revealed that it secretly gave 18 million to a jewish 
settlement in the christian quarter of the old city of jerusalem 
the new settlement activity sparked sharp protests from the us 
state department which considers settlements in the occupied 
territories an obstacle to peace 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said the united states was dismayed by reports of new settlements 
at dugit in the gaza strip and alon in the west bank 
it is disturbing that the caretaker government is taking steps 
that the national unity government was unwilling to take on 
settlements boucher said it is our longstanding position that 
settlement activity in the occupied territories is an obstacle to 
the achievement of a just and lasting peace 
peres spent 35 days trying to forge an improbable alliance of 
ultraorthodox religious parties and small leftwing factions he 
abandoned the effort only hours before a midnight deadline 
peres 66 triggered the crisis by demanding that shamir accept 
secretary of state james a baker iiis terms for convening 
palestinianisraeli talks in cairo shamir refused and peres won a 
vote of noconfidence in parliament 
roni milo the communications minister said shamir would not 
respond positively to bakers peace proposals and opposed sharing 
power with labor 
peres who has headed the labor party since 1977 is likely to 
face a major challenge to his leadership especially from the 
supporters of yitzhak rabin who served as prime minister from 1974 
to 1977 
at a party meeting thursday night rabin said labor should 
consider entering a unity government with likud if shamir agreed to 
electoral reform within six months

a powerful earthquake on thursday killed more 
than 100 people and damaged hundreds of homes in a remote region of 
central china populated mainly by tibetan herders officials said 
the quake thursday evening measured 69 on the richter scale 
striking hainan tibetan autonomous prefecture in qinghai province 
about 900 miles southwest of beijing a state seismology bureau 
said friday 
a bureau official who did not give his name said 109 people 
were killed and 120 were hospitalized more than 1000 homes in the 
sparsely populated rugged area collapsed from the initial quake 
and more than 500 aftershocks he said 
aftershocks as strong as 5 on the richter scale were felt in the 
provincial capital of xining about 70 miles northeast of hainan 
prefecture and in lanzhou a city 180 miles the east 
the official xinhua news agency said homes in heka township of 
xinghai county were damaged and a landslide occurred at the 
longyangxia reservoir on the yellow river a hydroelectric power 
station at the reservoir was not damaged it said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by a quake 
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph a quake 
measuring 6 can cause severe damage in a populated area and one 
measuring 7 is 10 times stronger and can cause widespread heavy 
damage 
qinghai is a mountainous region inhabited by miners and herders 
where quakes occur fairly frequently with few casualties a quake 
measuring 67 struck the region in january damaging some buildings 
but causing no casualties 
the far western chinese province of xinjiang was hit by a quake 
measuring 64 on april 19 about 1300 homes were damaged but only

environmental advocates announced 
thursday they had collected 800000 signatures favoring the states 
big green initiative which would curtail pesticide use 
offshore drilling and timber cutting 
the alldemocratic leadership of the big green environmental 
initiative intended for the november ballot predicted that it would 
bring out voters like never before 
earth day gave us just a hint of how deeply californians care 
about our environment on election day well deliver the whole 
message nothing can stop us from passing big green john van de 
kamp the state attorney general and a democratic candidate for 
governor told a capitol news conference 
the news conference and ones in los angeles and san francisco 
were called to announce that 800000 signatures had been collected 
in favor of placing the initiative on the ballot the measure needs 
372178 valid signatures the signatures will be checked by the 
secretary of states office 
if big green wins approval it would go on the books as the 
environmental protection act of 1990 
the act proposes stringent controls on pesticide use 
preservation of ancient redwood stands bans on clear cutting 
timber blocks on offshore drilling and the creation of an 
environmental czar to oversee enforcement and implementation it 
would appropriate 20 million to seek alternatives to pesticides 
al meyerhoff of the natural resources defense council called it 
the most sweeping measure ever put before the voters by 
environmentalists anywhere in the country he said it would serve 
as a litmus test for political candidates and send a message to 
congress 
two opposing ballot issues are being readied to challenge some 
of the provisions of big green 
under the aegis of californians for responsible food laws or 
careful agribusiness interests are trying to get a less 
restrictive pesticide measure on the ballot and the timber 
industry is backing a measure to cancel out the initiatives 
provisions to save trees 
van de kamp whose staff wrote the measure with the help of 
environmental groups has touted it as evidence of his commitment 
to environmental issues 
big green also has the support of van de kamps rival in the 
june democratic primary for governor former san francisco mayor 
dianne feinstein who endorsed it on earth day 
the gop candidate for governor pete wilson hasnt taken a 
stand 
in addition big green is sponsored by environmental groups 
including the sierra club the natural resources defense council 
and the national toxic campaign 
the proponents said they expect to spend 1 million to 3 
million campaigning 
van de kamp in explaining support for the measure said some 
800000 californians have signed up to ban cancercausing 
pesticides from our food to protect our coast from oil drilling 
and tanker spills to stop the dumping of sewage and industrial 
waste in the ocean to save our virgin redwood forests and to lead 
the fight against global warming

with eastwest tensions subsiding the 
nato alliance may abandon a controversial plan to deploy a new 
shortrange missile in europe sources said thursday 
the alliance may also cut its stockpile of battlefield nuclear 
artillery the sources said 
north atlantic treaty organization officials will begin a series 
of meetings next week that could result in dramatic policy changes 
as they seek to shape the alliance from a military organization to 
a more political one 
an announcement of moves to end the nuclear missile project and 
trim battlefield nuclear artillery could come at an expected 
summit possibly in the summer of the leaders of the 16 nato 
nations the sources said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the sources emphasized that no final decisions have been made 
however a diplomat said its a near certainty that nato will 
agree to the measures 
all these things are being discussed right now said another 
diplomat shortrange nuclear forces is very much a hot subject 
the moves are being considered in light of the prodemocracy 
revolutions that have swept through eastern europe and the 
resulting changes in military strategy 
the alliances defense ministers meet may 910 in canada to take 
a look at the wests future nuclear posture aides to the defense 
ministers will gather friday in brussels to discuss nuclear issues 
in advance of the canada meeting 
in recent months nato diplomats have said there was dwindling 
support for an american plan to develop a new more powerful 
generation of shortrange nuclear missiles the new weapon would 
replace the aging lance surfacetosurface missile 
one source said there was a possibility the defense 
ministers at their canada meeting would declare the project dead 
but another said it was unlikely a third said he had not seen any 
draft statements about the project 
the bush administration said last week that it was postponing 
development of the weapon it said the army had put on hold plans 
to issue a formal request for contractors proposals to build the 
new missile 
the new lance weapon is strongly opposed in west germany where 
most of the missiles would be based 
the lance introduced in 1972 has a range of about 75 miles 
its replacement would be designed to hit a target more than 250 
miles away

a study linking cancer in 
rats to fluoride was inconclusive a government scientific panel 
said thursday after reviewing research on the cavityfighting 
chemical 
the review by scientists of the national toxicology program was 
intended as a guide to government policy makers on the safety of 
the chemical which is consumed by 53 percent of americans in their 
drinking water and is a standard ingredient in toothpaste 
the government study released in february was seized on by 
opponents of fluoridation who have waged an emotional 
decadeslong battle against adding the chemical to the water supply 
to prevent tooth decay many previous studies had found 
fluoridation safe 
the panel the national toxicology programs board of scientific 
counselors voted after debate and public comment to label the new 
evidence equivocal 
it is like a little flashing yellow light on the instrument 
panel saying you need to look at this more closely said dr 
david rall a government scientist at this moment i dont think 
it implies any change in policy 
rall is director of the national institutes of environmental 
health sciences and the national toxicology program whose 
scientists carried out the study 
what were trying to say is we really dont know said panel 
member robert garman 
dr james mason assistant secretary for health in the 
department of health and human services issued a statement 
thursday saying no information existed that would call for a change 
in public health service policy supporting the use of fluorides for 
the prevention of tooth decay 
mason said the panels action was one step in a continuing 
evaluation of health risks and health benefits of fluoridation 
underway by the public health service 
the findings will be incorporated into a broader review with 
other animal and human studies involving fluoride to ensure that 
every possible avenue of research has been reexamined in light of 
the ntp findings he said 
the public health service scientists reviewing the research are 
expected to report their conclusions in july 
the study released thursday found bone cancer in five of 130 
male rats given high doses of fluoride no tumors were found in 
female rats or either sex of mice 
the panels report said the study found a marginal increase of 
tumors that may be related to the chemical 
in the emotionally charged atmosphere surrounding the 
fluoridation debate panel members labored long just to reach that 
seemingly mild conclusion the panel labored for nearly an hour to 
choose words that wouldnt become weapons for either side in the 
fluoride fight 
before arriving at the final version of its report the panel 
voted down a motion to say there was absolutely no evidence of a 
cancer link in the study 
the more we do this the more i recommend that we dont do 
this said ellen silbergeld who said the panel might be 
lending ammunition inadvertenly or whatever to one side or 
another 
before the vote dr john stamm dean of the school of dentistry 
at the university of north carolina at chapel hill argued that the 
results were too weak even to be called equivocal stamm also 
is a spokesman for the american dental association

clear evidence that fluoride is carcinogenic the safewater

the white house chided congress thursday for 
its resolution declaring jerusalem to be israels capital saying 
the lawmakers need to give more serious consideration to unintended 
consequences of such resolutions 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater made the comment when 
asked about criticism of the resolution in the arab world and 
suggestions that it might hinder the possible release of additional 
us hostages 
our only comment would be that congress needs to consider 
these resolutions more seriously than they have in the past and 
that sometimes they can have unintended consequences fitzwater 
said 
on wednesday hussein musawi the reputed spiritual mentor of 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine urged the terrorist 
group not to release another hostage because of the resolution 
passed by the house 
syria sharply condemned the resolution thursday saying it was 
intended to emphasize the american desire to defy arabs and 
moslems by stealing their rights without any lawful or historical 
justification 
in iran a radical newspaper said the resolution would delay the 
release of western hostages in lebanon the farsilanguage jomhuri 
islami or islamic republic said it made things more complicated 
by blocking the way for solving problems 
the nonbiding resolution was approved by the house 37834 on 
tuesday it conflicts with official us policy which does not 
recongize jerusalem as israels capital and calls for negotiations 
to determine the final status of the city 
israel declared jerusalem its capital in 1967 after capturing 
the citys east side from jordan in the sixday war 
jerusalem contains sites considered sacred by christians 
moslems and jews 
the house resolution is identical to one passed march 22 by the 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan has said that this 
measure was a mistake and has damaged the bushs administrations 
efforts to foster middle east peace negotiations 
rep howard l berman dcalif one of the supporters of the 
resolution brushed off fitzwaters criticism thursday saying i 
think the white house has little standing to criticize congress 
since this entire resolution developed as a response to president 
bushs reckless comments about jerusalem 
berman referred to bushs unexpected remark last month linking 
east jerusalem with the occupied territories of the west bank and 
gaza by saying israel should not settle soviet jews coming to 
israel in any of those three territories previous us 
administrations had always treated east jerusalem separately 
arguing the status of the entire city should be settled in peace 
negotiations 
as for comments in iranian newspapers berman said for 10 
years now iranians have found one thing or another to justfiy 
falling short of the fundamental standards of civilized nations 
this is just another excuse

a man on a suicide mission pulled out a 
submachine gun on a crowded colombian jetliner thursday and 
assassinated a presidential candidate before being killed in a 
blaze of pistol fire from bodyguards 
a drug trafficking group called the extraditables claimed 
responsibility for shooting former leftist guerrilla chief carlos 
pizarro and said his name was picked in a drawing the radio 
network caracol said 
the group mainly from the medellin cocaine cartel said other 
candidates will be killed until traffickers are pardoned 
pizarro until last month commander of the notorious april 19 
movement a rebel outfit known as the m19 was the fourth 
colombian presidential candidate to be assassinated in the past 31 
months drug traffickers were blamed in all four deaths 
as an apparent precaution against any violent reaction to 
pizarros assassination mayor andres pastrana ordered all public 
and private schools closed friday in bogota the capital in a 
communique pastrana also ordered a ban on alcohol sales for the 
metropolitan area of 6 million people until further notice 
an anonymous telephone caller said the names of three other 
presidential candidates were in the death lottery and that another 
candidate will die 
passengers screamed and ducked down in their seats as shooting 
broke out eight minutes after the avianca airlines boeing 727 left 
bogotas el dorado international airport the pilot capt fabio 
munevar said 
the plane en route to the caribbean coastal city of 
barranquilla where pizarro was to campaign returned immediately 
to bogota 
no one else on the plane was hurt 
the killer 25yearold alvaro rodriguez apparently retrieved 
the submachine gun from an airplane bathroom munevar said 
he told caracol rodriguez went to the restroom at the back of 
the jet shortly after takeoff then returned and took his seat two 
seats behind pizarro 
minutes later he stood up and whipped out the weapon from his 
black leather jacket 
leaning over a passenger in the row in front of him rodriguez 
pointed the gun at pizarros head about a foot away and opened 
fire police said only pizarro was hit 
eight bodyguards accompanied pizarro on the flight caracol 
quoted an unidentified campaign worker accompanying pizarro as 
saying 
two men with submachine guns were arrested at barranquilla 
airport a police spokesman there told the associated press they 
apparently were part of an assassination squad with orders to kill 
pizarro if he survived the flight disturbances broke out in 
barranquilla to protest pizarros death and three buses were 
burned the spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity 
it was not immediately clear how the submachine gun was smuggled 
onto the plane air passengers boarding at bogota are frisked and 
their belongings are searched however it is normal for 
presidential bodyguards to carry weapons even on passenger flights 
caracol said in an unconfirmed report that five bullets smashed 
into the window near pizarro but none penetrated the thick 
laminated plastic 
the plane carried 91 passengers and a crew of six an avianca 
spokeswoman told the ap 
the man calling caracol said two gunmen were part of the plot to 
kill pizarro but did not say if both were on the plane 
police mentioned only one gunman 
the caller said the other three candidates in the drawing were 
alvaro gomez hurtado and rodrigo lloreda both of the conservative 
party and cesar gaviria of the governing liberal party 
the next drawing will be between gaviria and lloreda he 
said 
the traffickers are no longer fighting extradition the caller 
said 
now he said presidential candidates will be killed until the 
government gives traffickers pardons as if they were part of a 
politicalmilitary organization 
months ago the traffickers said they should get the same 
treatment as leftist guerrillas who are pardoned last month the 
government pardoned hundreds of guerrillas of pizarros m19 
movement 
pizarro died 45 minutes after arriving at a government hospital 
about three miles from the airport the hospital said in a 
communique the bogota morgue said pizarro was hit by 13 bullets 
the son of a colombian navy admiral pizarro spent most of his 
adult life as a member of the the april 19 movement which took its 
name from the date of a presidential election pizarro and other 
university students said was rigged he commanded m19 when it 
disbanded last month as part of a peace agreement with the 
government 
m19 then became a political party and pizarro was its 
candidate for the may 27 presidential elections 
the assassination of sen carlos louis galan last august led to 
the governments crackdown on colombias drug cartels 
at the time of his death galan of the liberal party was the 
leading presidential contender and had urged a hard line against 
drug traffickers 
since the crackdown began the government has extradited at 
least 15 drug suspects to the united states to face charges the 
drug lords have waged a campaign of terror in an effort to halt the 
feared extraditions 
the government also blamed drug traffickers for the killings of 
jaime pardo leal of the communist party and bernardo jaramillo 
of the leftist patriotic union party 
pardo was killed oct 11 1987 in an ambush on a dirt road near 
bogota 
jaramillo was killed when a man walked up to him at bogotas 
airport and opened fire with a submachine gun hidden inside a 
folded newspaper 
the government said drug traffickers killed pardo and jaramillo 
because of the traffickers hatred for leftists traffickers own 
vast amounts of land in colombia much of it cattle country where 
leftist guerrillas have long extorted ranchers for money to support 
their war against the government 
pizarro opposed extradition of traffickers to the united states 
his aides said that was because he believed colombia should solve 
its own problems 
since the crackdown began drugrunners have killed more than 230 
people including judges politicians policemen soldiers and 
newspaper employees 
the bloodiest act occurred nov 26 when a bomb exploded aboard 
an avianca jet shortly after it left bogota all 106 people aboard 
were killed

the senate late thursday rejected an effort to 
cut the aid president bush is seeking for panama and use it instead 
for a variety of domestic programs 
senators left the 420 million panama aid intact when on a 
5148 vote they defeated an amendment by appropriations committee 
chairman robert c byrd dwva 
the senate then labored late into the night as it tried to deal 
with dozens of proposed amendments but prospects appeared remote 
for quick approval of the overall aid bill which included 300 
million for the government of new nicaraguan president violeta 
chamorro 
mrs chamorros term may expire before we get the aid down 
there cracked minority leader bob dole rkan 
the bill still faces a veto threat from president bush who 
opposes a provision that would allow the district of columbia 
government to use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women 
such payments have been banned for the past two years 
byrd had proposed to slash panama aid to 300 million and use 
the largest chunk of the savings for cleaning up department of 
energy nuclear plants other money would have gone for sanitation 
in indian housing agricultural disasters and a nutrition program 
for women and children 
capitalizing on the general unpopularity of foreign aid in 
congress byrd cast his amendment as an effort to make charity 
begin at home 
if we do not take a long hard look at the way we parcel out 
our scarce dollars the day will come when the american people are 
going to say enough byrd said the support for foreign aid 
programs is dwindling and it will continue if those programs are 
not well justified and well crafted 
but sen mark o hatfield rore said the united states has an 
obligation to panama stemming from the us economic embargo and 
the damage inflicted by decembers invasion which ousted dictator 
manuel noriega 
we owe them hatfield said this is a bill thats due 
byrds move came as the senate began consideration of a 34 
billion spending bill that included the panama money as well as 
300 million for the new democratic government of nicaragua and 
funds for a laundry list of congressional addons 
among the additions were flood relief food stamps and veterans 
benefits as well as items included for individual lawmakers byrd 
for example won inclusion of 185 million for an fbi fingerprint 
lab planned for clarksburg wva 
supplemental spending bills are sent to congress late in each 
fiscal year to cover shortages in government programs that have 
been underfunded or to meet unforeseen needs that have arisen 
during the year 
bush asked congress for 500 million for panama 300 million 
for nicaragua and 70 million for refugee programs when the house 
passed the bill april 3 it cut the amount for panama to 420 
million and added domestic spending items that pushed the measures 
overall cost to 24 billion the senate panel added still more 
pushing it to 34 billion 
most of the new spending in both versions of the bill is covered 
by cuts in the pentagon budget including personnel weapons 
systems and research and development 
sen j bennett johnston dla a sponsor of byrds amendment 
said many purposes of the panama aid such as restoring tourism and 
providing student scholarships were not emergency needs and could 
wait 
should this 120 million be used for nonpriority needs in 
panama or should it be used for emergency needs here in the united 
states its that simple he said 
referring to environmental problems at energy department 
facilities such as rocky flats colo savannah river sc 
fernald ohio hanford wash and oak ridge tenn johnston said 
if theres an emergency in the united states this is it

the coast guard seized a soviet trawler 
thursday for allegedly fishing in us waters off alaska and was 
escorting the vessel to port officials said 
the soviet factory trawler ilya ilyin was being escorted by the 
coast guard cutter yocona to kodiak about 250 miles southwest of 
anchorage the coast guard said 
operators of the 3147ton vessel will be charged with violating 
the magnuson act a 1976 law that established the nations 200mile 
exclusive economic zone said assistant us attorney tim burgess 
in anchorage the ship expected to reach port by sunday will be 
subject to possible forfeiture he said 
coast guard surveillance aircraft spotted the soviet trawler 
allegedly fishing inside us waters northwest of the pribilof 
islands in the bering sea the coast guard said 
the yocona was dispatched to intercept the trawler and thursday 
morning ordered the soviet ship to halt but the vessel attempted 
to elude the cutter and return to international waters 
the cutter pursued the vessel at high speed for the next hour 
and a half crossing into international waters before the vessel 
stopped and was boarded the coast guard statement said 
inspectors told aides to sen frank murkowski ralaska that 
they had found records that provided evidence of illegal fishing 
this one is pretty clearcut said bill woolf a fisheries 
expert on murkowskis staff 
the soviet trawler believed to be fishing for pollock was 
observed by the coast guard cutter and several electronic fixes 
confirmed the ship was fishing inside the exclusive zone woolf 
said the ship was observed with its fishing gear in the water he 
said 
the last time the coast guard seized a soviet fishing vessel in 
the north pacific was in may 1989 when the trawler novoelnya was 
captured with 940 metric tons of pollock aboard that case was 
recently settled when the soviets agreed to pay 275000 in fines 
burgess said 
both seizures were in an area of the bering sea known as the 
doughnut hole 
the doughnut hole is a circular area surrounded by soviet 
and us exclusive fishing zones where coast guard and american 
fisheries officials suspect foreign ships await the cover of night 
or bad weather to sneak into the fishrich us zone 
the united states and several other nations with highseas 
fishing fleets have clashed for years over the rich north pacific 
fisheries

since the revolution the museum for german 
history in east berlin is putting more truth and less distortion 
into its exhibits covering events of the last 1500 years 
huge chunks of the berlin wall stand in the courtyard as part of 
a new display about the peaceful uprising that reversed four 
decades of stalinist rule less than six months ago an exhibit 
glorified the walls construction in 1961 
museum officials have closed the section covering east germanys 
history from its founding in 1949 which was redone just before the 
dramatic political events of autumn 1989 
they seem embarrassed by their collection of everything from the 
office furnishings of the former communist rulers to clothing and 
dishes produced at the first staterun enterprises 
in the section on the period from the end of world war ii to the 
nations founding is a new panel acknowledging the museums guilt 
and responsibility for a display that as we know today 
permitted no active living relation to history and the present 
dr kurt paetzold a history professor at humboldt university in 
east berlin is offering a course this spring called historical 
thinking and history teaching in the crises of our time 
there is a need for a course like that he said in an 
interview you cant teach as if nothing happened 
a new west german guidebook claims the exhibit beginning in 1949 
was closed because it offered an all too euphoric view of east 
german history 
the display on the revolution opened april 12 has a collection 
of banners and posters carried by protesters in prodemocracy 
marches 
visitors have snapped up sets of postcards with the most famous 
slogans already sold out is a picture featuring the wide grin and 
large teeth of egon krenz the first successor to erich honecker 
the leader ousted in october 
poor sellers include a book titled lenin in berlin and 
postcards of the soviet army supplying east germany with food from 
the soviet union 
despite the tacit apology in the 194549 section the communist 
states creation still is called a wonder in the history of the 
german people and europe the communist party which now has 
changed its name is portrayed as incorporating the best traditions 
of german history 
this is unbelievable said klaus geberts a retired factory 
worker from west berlin on his first visit to the museum 
one can even laugh its not forbidden anymore he said 
inspecting a collection of hand tools that belonged to wilhelm 
pieck first president of east germany 
this museum wont be here much longer geberts predicted 
entries in the guest book indicate however that many visitors 
believe the exhibits should remain as they are 
leave everything as it is and build a new one with whole 
truth wrote andreas kiest who identified himself as a schoolboy 
from west germany 
werner fuehrer wrote this museum is also part document leave 
it as is 
a swedish history teacher wrote in imperfect english please 
save this exhibition for the future it is itself a monument of to 
lie with the help of history 
the marxist viewpoint permeates exhibits from the middle ages to 
1949 
medieval conflicts between peasants and rich craftsmen are 
portrayed as an example of class warfare the defeat of 
imperial germany in world war i was made possible the exhibit 
says by the efforts of the working class 
no mention is made of the molotovribbentrop pact of 1939 
secret provisions of which divided the independent baltic states 
and much of poland between nazi germany and the soviet union

the population is growing so fast it 
threatens to overwhelm the economy but the philippine government 
demographers and roman catholic church cant agree on what to do 
about it 
an official survey conducted in 1988 found the philippines to be 
the 14th most populous country in the world and the eighth in asia 
its population grew from 764 million in 1903 to 19 million in 
1948 then more than doubled in two decades to 481 million in 
1980 when the last census was taken the government report said a 
new census is to be taken this month 
official projections put the number of filipinos at 75 milllion 
to 80 million in the year 2000 or 10 times the number a century 
ago 
president corazon aquino has called for a program to make sure 
the population increase now about 24 percent a year will not 
outstrip our other resources and annul what gains we make every 
year 
government populationcontrol programs have stalled since the 
late president ferdinand e marcos fled and mrs aquino gained 
power in 1986 with strong support from the catholic hierarchy 
critics say there is little evidence of an effective program or 
the political will to forge one 
local governments also have been lax because large populations 
mean more economic aid from manila virtually all birth control 
programs such as distribution of condoms are financed by foreign 
governments or the united nations 
population growth has declined from a peak of more than 3 
percent annually in the 1950s but filipinos still multiply faster 
than the people of more prosperous nations of southeast asia the 
rate is a full percentage point above thailand and about 01 
percent ahead of malaysia 
nearly four of 10 filipinos are under age 15 which strains 
educational health and other public services 
officials and demographers say most filipinos in the rural 
areas where nearly 48 percent of the people live prefer large 
families to provide cheap farm labor high infant mortality also 
encourages having more children 
awareness of birth control methods is more widespread but the 
number of couples using them dropped from 45 percent in 1986 to 36 
in 1988 according to a survey by the population institute at the 
university of the philippines 
lack of complete information and the strong male dominance in 
philippine society are major reasons women avoid contraceptives 
officials say 
despite growing awareness of the risks of overpopulation 
critics say there is no consensus of the government church and 
demographers on how to avoid it 
mamita pardo de tavera secretary of social welfare and head of 
the population commission disputes the idea that a large 
population must be a national burden 
she takes a dual approach educating the public about 
contraception and encouraging population development or 
integration of government aid projects for the poor 
those who disagree say the central task is to reduce the number 
of births 
you cannot have development unless you have a more manageable 
population in terms of size growth and composition said 
corazon raymundo director of the university population institute 
a major factor in the population debate has been the roman 
catholic hierarchy including cardinal jaime sin archbishop of 
manila who has great influence in the aquino administration 
we believe government should create job opportunities develop 
natural resources harness all these things for the sake of the 
people who are living now not take measures to cut down 
population said monsignor cesar pagulayan spokesman of the 
family life apostolate of the catholic bishops conference of the 
philippines 
mercedes concepcion former dean of the population institute 
said the clergy had become aggressive in discouraging use of 
contraceptives 
she said some members of congress recognize the population 
problem but have been silenced by the fact that the cardinal has 
been very active in threatening them with hell fire and brimstone 
if they do something particularly in terms of legislation 
since there is no signal from the top meaning mrs aquino 
they know they will be by themselves only unprotected mrs 
concepcion told an interviewer 
the change in government in february 1986 created a new set of 
policy makers who have to be conditioned to the situation she 
said its a massive training again 
mrs pardo de tavera said the government program had been 
misunderstood 
we are a pluralistic society and we have to give people 
choices not only in the method but in the approaches she said 
we have to go beyond methods we have to go to the values 
education other factors besides fertility

the heightening drama over saving 
floridas dying everglades has cast new villains the farmers and 
dairymen who work the land around giant lake okeechobee 
environmentalists say agriculture causes too much pollution in 
the precious okeechobee which provides water for the vast wetlands 
of the everglades and the cities of the crowded coast some argue 
its time to return the land to the wilderness it was before the 
ranchers and farmers came about a century ago 
the first thing we have to do is get rid of the sugar cane 
south of lake okeechobee then we have to get rid of the dairy 
cattle on the north side said marjory stoneman douglas an 
environmental activist who has fought for much of her 100 years to 
preserve the everglades system 
us attorney dexter lehtinen whos filed suit seeking to force 
the state to increase protection of the everglades has said that 
if farmers cant reduce pollution its an easy choice save the 
glades and let agriculture move to wisconsin 
farmers feel theyre politically expedient scapegoats they say 
theyre threatened by environmental experimentation that has only 
one sure result a big bill for stateordered programs to cut 
pollution 
i dont think its fair said david beardsley a 
fourthgeneration farmer near clewiston its our land were 
interested in our home as much as anybody else but i think were 
an easy target 
the nutrientladen pollutants that run off the farms and dairies 
feed unnatural growth of some plants in the everglades choking 
waterways and disrupting the systems food chain 
at the same time the heavy development of south florida has 
disrupted rain patterns and the flow of water into the everglades 
drying up parts of the system 
residents of the region feel the environmental damage most are 
under some form of water rationing and may soon face stricter 
limits smoke from wildfires in the everglades last year closed 
highways and caused respiratory problems 
gov bob martinez says the environment ranks with crime and 
drugs as floridas top issues 
the environmental concerns of floridians coalesced in the 
adoption of a save our everglades plan in 1983 its aim is 
making the everglades look and function more as it did at the 
beginning of the century 
in 1900 there were no big farms which disrupt natural water 
flow use water then discharge pollutants back into the everglades 
system nor did 45 million people live on the condominiumdotted 
gold coast from palm beach to miami sucking huge quantities of 
water from the system 
sugar growers fare worse than the dairies in their public image 
of governmentsubsidized millionaires who exploit foreign cane 
cutters and the environment twothirds of the sugar cane land 
belongs to us sugar corp or companies owned by the cubanborn 
fanjul family invariably described as sugar barons 
more than 100 other farmers work land in the 700000acre 
everglades agricultural area south of the lake however some 
413000 acres are in sugar cane the rest in winter vegetables like 
lettuce celery cabbage and carrots 
beardsleys family started farming when his greatgrandfather 
came to okeechobee before world war i and saw the newly drained 
land rich in decomposed vegetation 
they just went wild when they saw the dark rich muck he 
said 
land was cleared by hand and boats were the only means of 
transport for years fires and floods from hurricanes made 
okeechobee farming highly risky until the army corps of engineers 
began building an extensive drainage and canal system five decades 
ago 
about 1960 decreased sugar production in other us growing 
areas resulted in higher domestic quotas florida farmers planted 
more cane the us economic embargo against cuba cut sugar 
imports and soon florida was the nations no 1 cane producer 
moving north along the lake the sweet smoke of the sugar mills 
and fields of tall cane give way to stretches of flat pasture 
dotted with grazing cattle 
at mcarthur farms manager kent bowen shows off the farms 4 
million experiment to cut pollution from 9000 head of cattle 
wastecollecting barns with concrete floors 
beef cattle have been in the area since the 19th century 
frederic remington sketched its cattle ranges in the 1890s but 
dairy operations didnt arrive until the 1960s when land prices 
skyrocketed along the coast 
dairy cattle are fed extra phosphorous to enrich their milk for 
humans but too much of it reaches their waste and taints waterways 
that feed okeechobee 
reducing the waste flow has proved too costly for some small 
operations at least 14 of the areas 47 dairy operations are 
accepting a state offer to move to lesssensitive land 602 a 
head to get out of town 
that will cost the water district and state more than 5 million 
to move 9500 cattle a 20 percent cut in the okeechobee dairy 
population that has produced about a fourth of floridas milk 
mcarthur farms plans to stay weve looked at north florida 
and georgia but this is a pretty good place to dairy its near 
the best milk market in florida bowen said 
bob butler whose dairy has 2200 adult cattle said pollution 
control will cost his farm about 564000 for fencing and catchment 
systems mandated by the state 
were realizing that we have a problem and were trying to 
come in and take care of our problems on our own he said 
environmentalists give the dairy farmers good marks for effort 
but say the sugar growers are flunking 
the everglades coalition an umbrella organization of 
conservation groups plans to lobby for an end to federal import 
quotas and other indirect subsidies that keep the sugar growers 
profitable 
george wedgworth president of the sugar cane growers 
cooperative for three decades says the environmental goals for 
okeechobee are unrealistic because of the vast artificial system 
built to support agriculture and protect residents from flooding 
its not a natural system anymore he said pointing to a 
map of the dikes and canals you cant turn the clock back 
sugar growers levied their own environmental tax last year 
assessing 5 an acre to finance environmental studies 
conservationists contend its just a delaying action 
many of us have been out here a lifetime wedgworth said 
were going to be sure we have the right technical answers to the 
problems were not going to be distracted by the hysterics of the 
time

a new attitude toward the soviet union has 
already prompted retooling at americas national laboratories the 
three topsecret centers of nuclear weaponry and star wars 
research and development as scientists search for new ways to use 
their knowhow researchers at sandia national laboratories are 
finding ways to help clean up the environment 
</TEXT>

the silver trough as long as a 
football field was developed to harness the sun and help wean the 
nation off imported oil for years it stood abandoned in the 
desert an obsolete relic of the 1970s 
now in another time and another growing national crisis 
researchers at sandia national laboratories have dusted off their 
sophisticated solar panels and put them back to work 
this time the panels are helping the environment sandia 
scientists believe theyve found an efficient way to use solar 
power to break down toxic waste help clean up polluted dumps and 
cleanse contaminated water tables 
were just helping nature thats all theres nothing 
artificial about this said virgil dugan sandias director of 
advanced energy technology 
solar research is just one area where scientists at sandia one 
of the nations three nuclear weapons laboratories are finding 
ways to help with growing environmental problems 
as the need for ever improved nuclear weapons lessens the 
laboratories are directing their technological might to greater 
peacetime use 
with expertise developed for weapons programs and army 
machinery smart robots are hurriedly being assembled to clean 
out highly radioactive and toxic chemical waste at department of 
energy weapons plants across the country 
its the same technology that goes into weapons programs 
even though it seems there are two different applications said 
pat eicker manager of robotic science and technology at sandia 
in the case of the abandoned solar collector scientists 
realized they might be able to run contaminated water such as 
polluted ground water through the sunlightfocusing machine and 
use its power to help break down organic toxic waste 
the contaminated water is mixed with a catalyst titanium 
dioxide and pumped through a clear tube in the center of the 
long parabolic solar trough 
the tube glows like darth vaders sword as sunlight activates 
the titanium dioxide which frees an electron the electron grabs 
onto organic material in this case the contaminates and breaks 
them down into water carbon dioxide and a mild harmless acid 
until a fullscale experiment last june scientists werent sure 
if the solar machine would cause complete destruction of the 
pollutants it did 
you can drink the water that comes out at the end said mike 
prairie a senior technical staff member on the solar project 
we never did this before because nobody thought of it 
before dugan said some might say its a breakthrough i think 
of it as an engineering advancement 
companies are lining up to learn more about sandias gadget 
dugan said the laboratory plans to have a trial system out in a 
year and dugan thinks the system is about four years away from 
commercial use 
sandia has been testing the system with water contaminated by 
trichloroethylene a common degreasing substance that contaminates 
ground water scientists believe the system will also work on pcbs 
dioxins pesticides dyes solvents and other organic or 
carbonbased materials 
the solar panels wont help with the problem of nuclear waste 
however because that is inorganic 
companies must now package their toxic waste and ship it to dump 
sites or incinerators the solar system might be economical enough 
to allow even small firms to have onsite waste systems and also 
may be portable dugan said it will likely be more efficient and 
cheaper than current ground water purification systems he said 
sandias robotics researchers began eight years ago to find ways 
to use machines for the sometimes dangerous work of building 
nuclear weapons and handling plutonium and other hazardous parts 
already the lab has created a smart manufacturing system 
that will help automate some production in weapons plants it has 
also designed wheeled robotic vehicles for the army 
now work is under way to create a system that can clean up toxic 
areas too dangerous for humans to venture into at department of 
energy weapons plants such as hanford wash savannah river ga 
oak ridge tenn fernald ohio and pantex texas 
scientists say a robotic backhoe will be used at highly 
radioactive and toxic pits along with a 40foot robotic arm with 
sight and radar capabilities that can scan a dump map pipes and 
other obstacles vacuum sand and dirt lift and remove drums and 
clean leaking underground storage tanks 
youve got to have some way to get in there and recover this 
stuff eicker said and its so dangerous people cant do it 
in one shed at sandia researchers hastily built a 
onetenthscale model of a waste dump along with a robotic arm 
because of a doe rush to begin the cleanups 
the use of models to simulate situations and the use of 
sensors to facilitate work on nuclear weapons production is what 
motivated this research eicker said 
but this has farreaching applications

early in the nbc drama fall from grace tv 
preacher jim bakker anguished and seeking comfort from an old 
minister friend confesses a moment of adultery with jessica hahn 
he then says this 
trying to build ptl into a worldwide ministry the government 
attacking me about taxes the newspapers writing stories about me 
my marriage falling apart a live television show six days a week 
the pressures never let up 
i i just wasnt thinking straight 
later in the show he snaps at an aide why does everyone want 
to nail jim bakker to the cross 
it may be that those to whom the tv preacher refers had no 
advance knowledge his sad story would become a bad tv movie this 
has come to pass so they can stop singing if i had a hammer 
nbc bought the tv rights from the bakkers for an undisclosed sum 
and got their help in making what has emerged as fall from 
grace it stars kevin spacey and bernadette peters who play the 
bakkers and lose 
airing sunday the movie dramatizes their descent from fiscal 
and evangelical heaven after the devil in the form of the justice 
department halts bakkers works and his multimilliondollar ptl 
empire 
itll probably get skyhigh ratings even though its opposite 
abcs the story of the beach boys a dramatization of the 
private woes of the lads who became a major cultural force just by 
singing surfin usa 
but nbcs twohour bakkerarama sure gives awful a bad name 
directed by karen arthur with a 10ton touch its written by ken 
trevey as if he sought divine guidance and got a busy signal 
although it tries to show the pain and frailty of the bakkers 
the show at times seems to be unconscious or semiconscious satire 
consider its opening moments a vague version of the hahnbakker 
coupling in florida 
barechested and abed he clutches her hand and advises ive 
been through hell whooo as they start to commune her hand 
knocks over a glass of wine spilling the grog onto a bible on a 
nightstand make that two whoos 
alas shes not heard from again save for furtive letters 
demanding alms shes given what the vulgar call hush money 
things end with the sex scandal out bakker awaiting federal 
indictments and the couple in palm springs calif bravely facing 
disgrace reporters and although this is not mentioned 
nightline 
in between well youve got peters busy chewing the scenery as 
her characters emotional stability steadily is shredded and her 
tammybrand mascara grows heavier with each crisis 
the crises such as buying sprees an overthecounter drug 
problem and pneumonia that almost kills her are depicted as 
stemming from her frustration as her husband increasingly shuns her 
for work work work 
spaceys bakker seems terminally vague a nowhere man of no 
fixed philosophical address an avaricious innocent harried by the 
internal revenue service and snoopy reporters from the charlotte 
observer 
at least he seems to notice that his wifes increasily erratic 
behavior may involve drugs of some sort he even asks tammy you 
been taking that medicine again 
he twice curls up on the floor in tears and shouts at his wife 
and aides as life gets worse but he shows real emotion only on two 
occasions the first when his wife is at deaths door 
the second occasion is when the rival rev jerry falwell to 
whom he has been forced to turn over control of ptl castigates 
him alludes to homosexual problems and does it all on tv 
bakker goes plumb bozo watching falwell richard paul plays him 
as a victim of extreme unction a sympathetic tammy says nobody 
will believe falwells charges 
yes they will bakker roars tearfully people will 
believe anything they see he slaps at the tv screen on 
that 
unkind things also are said in grace about rival tv 
evangelist jimmy swaggart who also scathingly denounced bakker but 
later tearfully confessed he too had sinned he didnt say if the 
sin was of the flesh or what 
although it is written let he who is without sin cast the 
first tv movie nbcs rehash of the bakkers woes does seem a 
little soon 
the real story ended only last october when bakker still 
protesting his innocence was sentenced to 45 years in prison and 
fined 500000 for using his tv show to defraud his flock 
oh well consider that a famous persons life sometimes can be 
measured in whether its made into a real movie or a tv movie 
george s patton got a real movie ollie north a tv movie glenn 
miller got a real movie liberace two tv movies moses got a real 
movie but jim and tammy bakker have gotten nbcs version of 
eternity

if you are one of those people whose own 
inflation rate is rising faster than the official consumer price 
index perhaps you might find the answer in the cost of services 
for reasons not entirely clear many people have a tendency to 
measure the prices they pay for tangible items for food cars 
houses and household goods and the like but are less aware of 
rises elsewhere 
elsewhere is the service as opposed to the goods sector and 
it makes up by far the larger category including health care food 
vending hair styling banking government education law and more 
not only is the service sector bigger but prices there are 
rising much faster than in the goods sector price rises in health 
care for example have exceeded the general inflation rate for 
many years including this one 
officially the consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 
05 percent in march but within that rate was a significant split 
goods inflation was but 02 percent service inflation 07 percent 
while the dichotomy could be temporary it also might be 
fundamental and difficult to contain 
how for example do you restrain healthcare prices when lives 
are at stake how do you offset mandated minimum wage increases in 
retailing do you really want to lower education costs while your 
children are in school 
some of those increases tend to sneak up on you while you might 
buy food each day you might avail yourself of a doctors services 
only a couple of times a year and a lawyers services even less 
and so lose a sense of price 
a report by the coalition of service industries gives a portrait 
of the service sector that might surprise many people to 
illustrate nine out of 10 workers added to the labor force since 
1982 have been employed in services 
last year nearly all the 25 million workers who entered the 
labor force found jobs in services goods producers added only 
30000 workers 
the service society also is growing relentlessly two decades 
ago it occupied twothirds of the labor force today there are 
three workers in services for every one in goods production 
meanwhile service productivity has been lagging and for an 
obvious reason whereas goods production can be automated the 
production of services is laborintensive consider your landlord 
barber teacher doctor waiter 
some of those trends will continue the bureau of labor 
statistics projects the formation of another 18 million jobs by the 
year 2000 an average of about 15 million a year and most of the 
jobs will be in services 
total employment is expected to rise from 118 million in 1988 to 
136 million by the turn of the century employment in services is 
projected to rise to 79 percent of all nonfarm wage and salary 
jobs from 759 percent in 1988 
it means obviously that jobs in the goods sector as a 
percentage of the whole will continue to decline and remember 
productivity increases which tend to restrain price increases are 
hardest to achieve in the service sector 
while these generalities are based on the workings of the 
economy in general the chances are high that your own personal 
economy is subject to the same pressures

pope john paul ii is making another trip to 
latin america where the roman catholic church has changed 
dramatically in the 11 years since he first outlined his vision of 
its role 
the nineday visit to mexico starting sunday will underline 
the changes since 1979 when john paul set the tone of his papacy 
toward church activism in the overwhelmingly roman catholic region 
maintain your commitment to the poor the pope told his bishops 
in puebla mexico but do not become partisan politicians 
in the ensuing years the church has assumed a greater role in 
social and economic affairs and gained broader prestige in latin 
america but divisions have emerged between liberal and 
conservative clergy 
from without the church is increasingly threatened by the 
aggressive proselytizing of evangelical protestant churches 
it is challenged by the dramatic growth of poverty in a region 
of vital concern to the vatican this is john pauls 10th trip to 
latin america and he also plans to visit cuba perhaps in december 
latin americans make up nearly half the worlds 850 million 
catholics the latin church has influenced catholicism worldwide 
with its bold efforts to adapt the gospel to third world societies 
liberation theology which links spiritual freedom to liberation 
from economic and social oppression was born in latin ameria john 
paul has sought to blunt the philosophys effect 
certainly what i feel in the last few years is what we feel a 
little in the universal church it is a moment of what some call 
conservatism said the rev irineu wilges a brazilian who is the 
franciscan orders counselor for latin america 
despite that conservatism the latin american church leadership 
has transformed itself 
cardinals and bishops once close to the ruling minority began 
condemning political repression in the 1970s when brutal 
dictatorships were common frequently the church was the only 
institution strong enough to stand up to the government 
catholic officials who specialize in latin america say the 
church leadership has extended its political role in three ways 
encouraging the establishment of democracy particularly in 
brazil and chile 
serving as a mediator between the government and guerrillas as 
in nicaragua and el salvador 
speaking out on problems facing new fragile democracies such 
as land reform foreign debt and the rights of native indians 
those actions reflect the churchs widespread credibility in 
latin america and its effort to grow closer to the poor 
the people have much more faith in the church than they did 10 
years ago said the rev jose luis castaneda a peruvian who is 
the jesuit orders regional assistant for south america i dont 
know if its the merit of the church or the disasters of the 
politicians 
john paul has supported the latin churchs option for the 
poor declared at a 1968 conference of bishops in medellin 
colombia 
on trips to the region the pope has assailed dictatorship 
highlighted the foreign debt problem and defended labor unions he 
also has condemned liberation theology that uses marxist analysis 
and warned clerics to stay out of politics 
action has accompanied his words particuarly in brazil whose 
bishops have encouraged liberation theology brazil has about 
100000 ecclesiastical base communities churchsponsored 
groups that press for political and social change 
the vatican promoted conservatives in brazil which has moved 
the bishops conference to a more centrist position 
in 1985 it ordered the rev leonardo boff brazils most 
prominent progressive theologian to maintain obedient silence 
for a year 
last year the vatican divided the paolo archdiocese of another 
progressive cardinal paulo evaristo arns into five smaller 
dioceses seriously diminishing his influence 
it isnt that some people are for helping the poor and some 
are against wilges said the church is divided over how to do 
it 
divisions between liberals and progressives have deepened 
because of the actions in brazil and similar ones in other 
countries 
last year the vatican ignored the choice of the organizations 
own leadership in choosing a new secretarygeneral of the latin 
american confederation of religious prompting an outcry from 
priests and nuns 
religious orders account for about 80 percent of the priests and 
nuns in latin america their members tend to be more liberal than 
diocesan clergy and bishops 
the vatican acted after the confederation introduced a 
biblestudy program for members that the congregation for the 
doctrine of the faith condemned as too ideological 
whatever the internal problems many church officials say latin 
american catholicisms greatest challenge is from conservative 
evangelical churches on the outside 
noncatholics in the region now number more than 30 million the 
latin american bishops conference says 
in mexico the number of protestants grew more than 500 percent 
in 19501980 to 22 million according to church figures in some 
mexican states up to 20 percent of the people are believed to be 
noncatholic 
some catholic officials contend the churchs approach to faith 
has been too political or intellectual others claim the 
evangelical churches receive money from the us government or 
businesses hoping to hinder church efforts for social change 
officials say greater poverty and evergrowing urban slums 
create serious problems for the church in spreading its message 
activism on behalf of the poor continues to exact a price as shown 
by the murder of six jesuits by salvadoran soldiers in november 
the standard of living is lamentably regressive bishop 
dario castrillon hoyos president of the bishops conference said 
in a recent report 
we must therefore ask ourselves what have been the results of 
the churchs effort to raise peoples consciences and of the 
political commitment of catholics

lifeanddeath questions once left to god and 
the family doctor may soon be answered in oregon by legislators 
poring over a computerized prioritized costanalyzed printout of 
ailments and treatments 
the printout ranking the relative benefits of 3000 medical 
procedures is due out this week after researchers spent months 
determining how oregonians get sick and injured 
the next step is for legislators to take the list search their 
souls and draw a line above the line will be illnesses covered 
under the states medicaid program for the poor below it will be 
ailments the poor must live with and sometimes die with 
welcome to medical rationing oregon style 
proponents say its a necessary evil in an age of limited 
budgets and 200000 liver transplants and oregons hightech 
approach is being watched closely by other states facing the same 
hightech question can we afford the miracles of modern medicine 
we can transplant hearts and lungs and livers and parts of the 
pancreas we can do far more with trauma victims than ever 
before said connie thomas of the intergovernmental health policy 
project a research group in washington dc 
but deciding how to use those technologies in a fair and 
costeffective way has eluded us all 
the glowing success of organ transplants for instance is 
tarnished by the fact that nearly all patients first undergo 
wallet biopsies to see if they can afford the costly surgery 
every wonder drug or surgical breakthrough raises uneasy 
questions of who will be excluded should society pay to transplant 
a chronic alcoholics damaged liver even though hell go through 
the new one in a couple years should a bedridden 90yearold get 
triplebypass heart surgery even though other ailments will likely 
kill her within a year what if shes 60 
once only the poor had to worry about being locked out of health 
care but as medical costs rise many middleclass americans are 
feeling poor when its time to pay the doctor 
us healthcare spending this year is expected to exceed 600 
billion or about 12 percent of the gross national product up from 
7 percent in 1970 federal health officials say 
some 315 million people or 13 percent of all americans have 
neither health insurance nor medicaid coverage the census bureau 
says 
even americans with company health plans are being asked to 
pay more and those plans may decrease in value as insurance 
companies ponder dropping costly procedures from standard coverage 
medical rationing looms as a dominant health care issue of the 
1990s as americans realize after decades of revolutionary medical 
advances that there are no miracles just hard choices 
health care is a world of limited resources and infinite 
demand said dr arthur feinberg regent of the american college 
of physicians it comes down to a question of who lives who dies 
and who decides 
indeed who should decide 
doctors avoid the debate saying their allegiance is to the 
individual patient regardless of societys cost 
congress may seem a logical place to tackle the issue but dont 
expect miracles there either national health care has long been 
batted around washington but the estimated annual price tag of 65 
billion dampens enthusiasm 
for now the issue of health care sits with the states nowhere 
more heavily than in oregon 
the story here began in 1987 when a cashstrapped legislature 
halted medicaid funding for most organ transplants saving the 
money for other health needs such as prenatal care only two other 
states virginia and arizona exclude transplants 
oregons decision drew little notice at first then coby howard 
a 7yearold leukemia victim died as his family tried to raise 
contributions for a bone marrow transplant 
suddenly healthcare allocation was an issue kept alive by a 
stream of publicized hardship cases advocates for transplant 
patients and the poor demanded a new way of distributing state 
medicaid dollars last june the legislature gave them one 
it was less and more than they expected 
legislators tackled a basic inequity of the statefederal 
medicaid program congress designed medicaid to provide health care 
to the poor but millions of poor americans dont qualify 
thats because states adjust eligibility standards each year to 
match their budgets the lowest standards are in alabama where a 
family of two qualifies only if it earns less than 88 a month or 
13 percent of the federal poverty level of 700 a month for one 
parent and child the national eligibility average is 50 percent of 
the poverty level 
oregon decided to expand its 60 percent coverage to 100 percent 
of the poverty level adding as many as 120000 people to medicaid 
rolls the legislature also passed a bill requiring employers to 
provide basic health insurance 
the idea was to stop rationing people out of health care and 
start rationing services instead the problem was finding a fair 
way to decide which services to cut 
the newly created oregon health services commission held 61 
public meetings more than 50 committees of medical specialists 
compiled thick reports listing ailments along with the cost and 
effectiveness of treatments a telephone survey asked oregonians to 
rate illnesses in terms of how they would impair their lives from 
death at 0 to perfect health at 100 
this mountain of data was crunched into a complex formula and 
an allnight computer run produced a list of costs and benefits for 
treating 3000 illnesses from appendicitis to herpes zoster 
the preliminary list will be released may 2 at a commission 
meeting in portland but the real test comes in january when the 
legislature must decide how far down the list funding will go 
a treatment such as polio vaccine will no doubt rank high on the 
list its cheap and extremely effective highcost bone marrow 
transplants may be near the bottom 
we dont have enough money to do everything said state 
senate president john kitzhaber an emergency room physician who 
masterminded the plan 
a child dying for want of a liver transplant is sad kitzhaber 
acknowledged but no sadder than a woman nine months pregnant 
seeing her first doctor in the emergency room or patients 
staggered by pneumonia because they couldnt afford a doctors care 
for flu 
most people dont have a need for the things that get most of 
the publicity he said the services most people are losing 
access to are things like treatment of minor trauma and respiratory 
infections common things that occur commonly 
oregon needs a congressional waiver of medicaid rules to 
implement its plan and that is not guaranteed critics in congress 
and elsewhere say oregon legislators are using technical 
hocuspocus to justify unneeded rationing 
asking the poor to fight among themselves over the crumbs of 
the medicaid program is not my idea of a courageous policy said 
arthur caplan director of the university of minnesotas center for 
biomedical ethics 
we have lots of reasons to believe that the healthcare system 
is bloated and inefficient before we ration anybody out of the 
healthcare lifeboat i think we ought to trim that bureaucracy 
even those who differ agree that oregons plan has raised 
awareness about setting priorities and that said researcher 
thomas is progress for a society once too proud to talk about it 
we were the country without limits she said now people 
are talking about rationing about death and dying that never 
would have happened a few years ago

seventeen years ago congress took a small 
step toward national health insurance when it decided to take on 
the costs of lifesaving treatment for nearly all americans whose 
kidneys had failed 
it was supposed to cost about 200 million a year 
today the cost is more than 33 billion 
if the kidney program were to come up today it would be 
completely dead in the water because of the obsession to bring 
costs down said arthur caplan head of the university of 
minnesotas center for biomedical ethics 
the reason we dont have national health insurance is the 
kidney program he said the costs associated with it scared 
legislators out of their gourds 
in the early 1970s government money was flowing more freely and 
only dollars stood in the way of lifesaving treatment for the many 
thousands of people whose kidneys failed 
the success rate of kidney transplants was up but this option 
was expensive and limited by the supply of donated organs 
the other effective option the artificial kidney machine that 
cleans the blood of toxins in a process called dialysis was also 
expensive however the number of patients who needed the 
relatively new procedure was far greater than the supply of 
machines could handle 
lifesaving treatment was being rationed by hospital committees 
that were deciding essentially who would live and who would die 
the technology to save lives was there as sen vance hartke 
dind posed the question on the senate floor in 1972 how do we 
explain that the difference between life and death is a matter of 
dollars 
that year congress extended medicare coverage to nearly all 
patients in the advanced stages of kidney disease regardless of 
age 
with this coverage patients pay about 20 percent of the cost of 
treatment whether transplant or dialysis and the federal 
government pays 80 percent 
the medical industry responded by building dialysis treatment 
centers across the country there are now about 1800 centers with 
80 to 90 added each year 
more than 80 percent of dialysis patients go to one of these 
centers three times a week for treatments that last four to six 
hours each at a cost of about 25000 to 30000 annually the 
remainder are treated in their homes at around 20000 a year 
caplan asserts that the kidney program has been a bonanza for 
forprofit medicine and says the programs price tag could be cut 
considerably if the government encouraged more home treatment in 
britain he said 66 percent of dialysis patients are treated in 
their homes 
but that issue aside even in the early years of the program it 
was apparent that congress had vastly underestimated the cost of 
dialysis and transplants which now run about 25000 per patient 
plus several thousand dollars a year for antirejection drugs 
and as the costs rose steadily the profile of kidney patients 
getting the lifesaving treatment changed 
before the program three of four dialysis patients were men 
most were welleducated almost 42 percent had jobs 91 percent 
were white and only 7 percent were over 55 by 1981 more than 45 
percent were over 55 half were women 35 percent were black and 
only 18 percent were working researchers reported at the time 
now the elderly are the fastest growing group on dialysis with 
about 30 percent of patients over 65 
physicians are under a great deal of pressure from family and 
patients to use dialysis even when the prognosis is poor said 
daniel callahan director of the hastings center in briarciff 
manor ny an independent nonprofit research organization that 
examines ethical issues in medicine 
the latest government figures available put the cost of the 
program in 1987 at 33 billion and rising by about 300 million a 
year some 147000 patients had coverage under the program at some 
time in that year 
we have chosen not to make difficult choices with this 
disease said paul rettig executive director of the american 
hospital association the money is in the medicare program 
and we made a financial choice to pay for it 
but government money does not flow so freely now and lawmakers 
are looking around every corner for places to cut the budget 
few suggest turning back the clock with repeal of the kidney 
program but some question use of transplants and dialysis in 
marginal patients those who have other medical problems and 
are not likely to live long in any event 
the fundamental question is how scarce resources should be 
spread among all who need them said richard a rettig who is 
directing an institute of medicine study on the kidney program 
this is one of those things we recognize as a source of 
anxiety we walk up to it and walk away from it and walk around it 
because we have no way to decently confront it directly he said 
the renal world did confront it in the 1960s they were 
relieved from doing so in the 70s and 80s he said but the 
question doesnt go away

lawton chiles compared himself to abraham 
lincoln when he told floridians he was being treated for 
depression but he may be more like tom eagleton and that bodes 
well for his gubernatorial prospects 
eagleton was forced off the democrats 1972 presidential ticket 
after disclosures that hed had shock treatment for depression but 
two years later missouri voters reelected him to the senate by a 
landslide 
like eagleton chiles is wellknown and wellliked in his state 
and that familiarity analysts say is key to how voters treat 
candidates who have acknowledged problems such as mental illness 
drug abuse and alcoholism 
tom kiley an adviser to democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis in 1988 and to eagleton in his 1974 senate race said such 
troubles are a legitimate campaign issue because they bear on 
questions of judgment but they can be blown out of proportion when 
voters dont know a candidate well he said 
when people are familiar with a politician its a lot easier 
for them to weigh the information put it in context and come to a 
conclusion about the role it should play in an election kiley 
said 
rumors of depression swirled briefly around dukakis shortly 
after he became the democratic presidential nominee he suffered 
considerable damage by failing to squelch them promptly largely 
because he was new on the national scene 
people had no longterm familiarity and personal information 
to fall back on kiley said 
that is not the case with chiles who served three senate terms 
before quitting in 1988 he blamed burnout and frustration 
but leaving the capital didnt cure his blue moods insomnia and 
lack of appetite only when chiles started taking prozac a common 
medication for depression did his spirits rise and his political 
drive return 
chiles entered the florida governors race this month and became 
the instant favorite over both rep bill nelson his chief rival in 
the democratic primary and incumbent gop gov bob martinez polls 
showed him the clear leader even after people were told he was 
taking medication for depression 
other candidates have been raising questions about chiles 
mental state both indirectly and headon if lawton is depressed 
sitting 18 years in committee meetings in washington if he spends 
about 13 minutes in the governors chair he may blow his brains 
out said former gov claude r kirk jr who is challenging 
martinez in the gop primary 
eagletons missouri constituents apparently were unperturbed 
that he had received shock treatment they sent him back to the 
senate with 60 percent of the vote only two years after he was 
forced off the national ticket headed by george mcgovern his 
stability was not an issue in the campaign 
it was obvious that voters didnt have any lingering concerns 
that needed to be addressed kiley said he was held in high 
regard 
rep jim mcdermott dwash the only psychiatrist in congress 
said any candidate who raises mental health questions about an 
opponent must be grasping for issues candidates should be judged 
by how well they perform under stress not by the medication 
theyre taking he said 
abraham lincoln probably would not have been qualified for the 
presidency if this were a disqualifying problem mcdermott said 
referring to lincolns wellknown bouts of melancholia 
frank mankiewicz who was mcgoverns campaign manager in 1972 
said voters find mental illness a lot less frightening and 
therefore less of a stigma now that it typically is treated with 
medication rather than shock therapy 
he and others say voters generally have become more sympathetic 
to candidates fighting alcoholism depression and other illnesses 
as the problems have become more widely acknowledged in society 
most families have had firsthand experience with such troubles 
kiley said 
and increasingly candidates are opening up to voters and 
counting on their understanding 
kiley cited texas treasurer ann richards a recovering alcoholic 
who won a hardfought democratic gubernatorial primary as a case 
in point voters seem to accept her explanation of her illness and 
treatment kiley said 
chiles is in a similar position he said he has great 
credibility hes widely respected he can talk with great candor 
about this aspect of his background and expect to get the fairest 
possible hearing from voters 
mankiewicz said voters might be less touchy about chiles mental 
health because he is running for state rather than national office 
after all he said the governor of florida doesnt have his 
finger on the button

alderman michael mcgee scares some people 
disgusts others he certainly has them talking 
mcgee began recruiting street gang members and others in march 
for a black panther community militia and threatened to send it 
on terrorist attacks if his demands for improvements in the inner 
city werent met by 1995 likely targets would be sporting events 
and busy freeways he said 
he claims the militia already has 500 members 
one anticrime activist predicts people are going to get hurt 
the mayor says mcgee should resign unless he renounces violence 
but also urges calm and asks people to look beyond mcgees rhetoric 
to examine the poverty and violence in the inner city 
mcgee says he has worked within the system most of his public 
career whether as a vietnam war medic political activist or 
alderman but he says hes fed up with the systems failure to 
improve the life of poor minorities in one of the nations most 
segregated cities 
ive been doing things the socalled right way mcgee said 
im opposed to violence but i think at some point it becomes 
cowardliness on the part of the black community to keep letting 
people abuse us 
mcgee wants the city to spend 100 million on training and jobs 
for innercity residents redraw aldermanic districts to improve 
minority representation on the common council and implement some of 
a task forces recommendations for improving unemployment crime 
teen pregnancy and other social ills among minorities 
he is one of three blacks on the 16member council 
in his five years as an alderman representing a mostly black 
poor crimeridden district on milwaukees north side mcgee has 
staged other protests to call attention to the inner city 
he once led a whistleblowing demonstration during a visit by 
jimmy carter claiming the former presidents effort to build homes 
in innercity areas was a facade that helped few if any 
another time he wore a paper bag over his head for the annual 
common council photograph saying he was embarrassed to be seen 
with the council after it approved a city budget that cut services 
to the inner city 
many people including some constituents were angered by 
mcgees threats some called for his removal from office 
this black panther thing has caught me completely off guard i 
think its going to get a lot of people hurt said queen hyler 
who heads the anticrime group stop the violence that recently was 
praised by president bush 
she asked mcgee to resign and has threatened to circulate 
petitions in his district seeking a recall election 
ms hyler first met mcgee in 1981 when they worked together in a 
movement that helped win a 600000 settlement for the family of a 
22yearold black man who died in police custody 
mcgee used to demonstrate and march like everyone else she 
said but in recent years hes been a little bolder once he got 
some political clout behind him 
others including mayor john norquist common council members 
and clergy denounced the threats of violence but they also urged 
people to consider the conditions that anger mcgee 
its easy for us to focus on michael mcgee and ignore the 
violence that already exists said jack murtaugh executive 
director of the interfaith conference of milwaukee a religious 
group of 11 denominations it appeared to us there had been an 
escalation of words and more attention focused on michael mcgee 
than on the issues 
murtaugh said mcgee wants only to rectify the violence of 
racism that has isolated blacks within an 8 by 5mile block on 
the citys north side that is plagued by crime poverty unsafe 
housing and unemployment 
common council president thomas p donegan said some of mcgees 
demands may be met in the meantime donegan said he senses mcgee 
may be toning down some threats 
i think what mike is saying to people who want to be in his 
militia now is a lot more positive i think he has without 
admitting it backed down from some of his earlier more violent 
statements donegan said 
mcgee who worked for the original black panthers group in the 
1970s counts among his heroes such black leaders as nat turner 
who led a slave revolt marcus garvey a jamaican activist in the 
1920s and malcolm x the assassinated black muslim leader 
he said his militia will be used for neighborhood patrols and 
economic boycotts while also undergoing military training were 
going to continue to do a lot of nonviolent things between now and 
1995 he said 
id worry more if i wasnt doing what im doing it would take 
a bigger toll he said i would suffer twice as much if youre 
not doing anything itll eat you alive 
mcgee said he would remain on the common council even though the 
mayor and others have said he should resign if he continues to 
advocate violence 
i have no plans of giving up my participation i think thats 
what a politician should be about leading the people he said 
in 1995 when i start kicking butt in milwaukee ill still be an 
alderman

if takeover strategist carl icahn gets his 
way the steel division of usx corp will stand alone in a leaner 
meaner industry 89 years after it became the first billiondollar 
company 
the move would be a sign of the times in a changing market where 
larger producers are slimming down to battle foreign competitors 
and specialized minimills that are claiming a growing piece of 
the pie 
once upon a time in dim history steel mills made things 
stuck them in a warehouse and said come and buy them said 
sheldon wesson spokesman for the american iron and steel 
institute a washington trade group 
that is no longer true he said the whole trend is to 
tailormake product quality and quantities that customers want and 
when they want it its an entirely different philosophy and an 
entirely different business orientation 
icahn usxs largest shareholder with a 133 percent stake 
wants usx to exit the steel business because he contends its a 
potential drag on the company if theres an economic downturn 
icahn wants usx to concentrate on its energy businesses 
shareholders will vote may 7 at the companys annual meeting in 
findlay ohio on icahns nonbinding proposal that usx spin off at 
least 80 percent of the steel business into a separate company 
called us steel corp the name used by usx until 1986 
icahn said his proposal is no indication he has lost faith in 
the profitability of the american steel industry 
i think the longterm future is good for steel he said 
the infrastructure of this country has been neglected for so long 
sooner or later were going to need steel to rebuild our roads and 
bridges 
american steel shipments increased steadily through most of the 
1980s last year 841 million tons of steel were shipped by 
american makers compared with 616 million in 1982 
but analysts said as the us economy moves away from 
manufacturing and toward more servicebased businesses demand for 
steel and the industrys strength could erode 
moreover because todays steel is lighter and stronger less 
will be needed in new cars bridges and skyscrapers 
its not so much a question of steel declining as it is a 
question of other segments of the economy growing more rapidly 
said donald f barnett an independent consultant in mclean va 
steel will continue to perform an essential service but its not 
going to be one of the most rapidly growing segments of the 
economy 
analysts said icahns proposal if carried out would be just 
another restructuring in a smokestack industry that has gone 
through wrenching upheavals for years 
the industry is continuing to fragment barnett said usx 
is a large company that could become smaller the restructuring 
process doesnt seem likely to end in our lifetime 
the nations steel industry blossomed in the 1870s when 
industrialist andrew carnegie and seven associates built the edgar 
thomson works near pittsburgh to make steel for industrial 
expansion 
carnegie increased his market share by expanding and acquiring 
competitors and finally sold his steel interests in 1901 to jp 
morgan to form the united states steel corp 
the companys focus remained on steel until march 1982 when 
us steel merged with marathon oil co in what then was the 
secondlargest corporate merger in american history 
usx has been a leader said charles a bradford an 
independent steel analyst it used to be a policeman of the 
industry on a pricing basis they could be brutal if they were 
undercut 
the company remains the nations largest steel producer but 
bradford estimates its capacity has decreased to less than 
onefifth of the industry from about twothirds in the 1920s 
everybody looks at usx as if its the big part of the 
industry he said its the shrinking part 
steel companies suffered loss after loss in the first half of 
the 1980s when hundreds of mills closed and more than 200000 
workers nationwide left the payrolls 
the industry was especially hurt by the 198182 recession and a 
flood of imports american steelmakers lost about 119 billion 
from 1980 to 1986 the american iron and steel institute estimates 
the picture is brighter now steelmakers made 1 billion in 
profits in 1987 and 23 billion in 1988 partly because they 
shuttered inefficient mills modernized others and won costsaving 
labor concessions import restraints and a cheaper dollar also 
helped 
the american steel industry takes an average of 5 manhours to 
make a ton of steel less time than any other producer in the world 
and nearly half the time it took in 1980 
the american steel industry is much more viable than it was 
before barnett said there certainly is still a need for the 
industry but the industry is going to continue to change 
the number of imports in the form of raw steel and products 
containing steel has grown about 264 million tons of steel were 
imported in 1984 the alltime high 
the weaker dollar and import quotas imposed in 1986 under 
voluntary restraint agreements negotiated by the reagan 
administration turned back some of the import tide in 1989 173 
million tons were imported 
the international competitiveness of the industry has much 
improved bradford said the weaker dollar was the biggest 
factor 
bradford said the relative value of international currencies 
more than anything else will determine the future of american 
steel this decade 
it looks very ominous because the dollar has been strong this 
is an industry that needs a weak dollar because it does compete in 
an international environment he said if that dollar keeps 
soaring these guys are in trouble 
steel consumers want more sophisticated products tailormade for 
them and steelmakers have responded by concentrating on narrower 
product lines 
up to 25 percent of 1988 shipments were made by socalled 
minimills which use electric furnaces to make more specialized 
products for specific regions or markets barnett said 
minimills have become more like large producers expanding and 
making products historically made by integrated makers at the same 
time larger makers have become more like minimills becoming more 
entrepreneurial and in some cases closing coal mines or coke ovens 
to focus on specific products at each plant 
the rev william hogan author and director of the industrial 
economics research institute at fordham university in new york 
said american steelmakers are primed for a profitable future 
theyve cut the capacity and theyve invested a lot of money 
something like 9 billion over the last five or six years and they 
plan to invest a very large amount in the next five years he 
said 
he predicted modernization will be the main trend in 
industrialized countries in the 1990s while capacity will increase 
in less developed nations

some people think the green revolution has not 
lived up to its promise and that the worlds pantry will never be 
able to keep up with growing populations others believe the race 
can be won 
the recent earth day festivities noted many of the ailments of 
the planet including pollution and depletion of natural resources 
but no widely accepted answers were forthcoming on how well the 
human race may be eating a few decades from now or whether in 
fact millions may not eat 
lester r brown head of worldwatch institute says starvation 
is a grim but effective natural solution to the fearful problem of 
not having enough food for growing populations 
in his annual book state of the world for 1990 brown said 
that if we succeed in building a sustainable society it will be 
done by 2030 only 40 years from now if not he said 
environmental deterioration and economic decline will cause social 
structures to disintegrate 
brown said world population should be no more than 8 billion if 
a sustainable society is to be achieved by 2030 that is a billion 
fewer than the united nations projects as the actual population by 
then 
according to brown current estimates foresee populations 
doubling or tripling in ethiopia india nigeria and scores of 
other countries where human numbers are already outpacing the 
system 
either these societies will move quickly toward smaller 
families or rising death rates from hunger and malnutrition will 
check population growth he said 
the humane path brown said requires a dramatic drop in birth 
rates he said more countries will do as china has done and 
thailand is doing reducing population growth rates in half in a 
matter of years 
at the other end of the equation is food production where the 
biggest development has been the green revolution the dramatic 
crop increases that began with highyielding wheat and rice 
varieties developed in mexico and asia starting in the 1950s 
new sources and techniques were also developed for many other 
crops including corn sorghum field beans peanuts cassava and 
potatoes use of fertilizer and other chemicals irrigation new 
tillage practices and improved management also have been important 
to the green revolution 
since the mid1960s according to a report in the current issue 
of usdas farmline magazine average world yields have risen 65 
percent for grains and 24 percent for root and tuber crops 
for countries swept up in the green revolution the benefits 
quickly moved beyond the farms to consumers in the form of 
lowpriced food but the benefits were far from universal says 
agriculture department economist mary knudson 
the green revolution has been criticized for encouraging 
inputintensive agriculture such as using more fertilizer and 
weedkillers neglecting locally important crops and bypassing 
severely impoverished regions knudson said 
in addition she said some critics argue that green 
revolutiontype technology is more accessible to successful large 
farmers who adopt these methods at a faster rate than smaller 
farmers 
some of the technology was not fitted for primitive areas where 
research facilities and irrigation systems were lacking knudson 
said but some of these problems are being addressed 
improved hybrids of millet and sorghum were developed for the 
semiarid areas of india during the 1960s and by the 1980s had 
spread widely she said some hybrids have recently been 
adopted in africa and have resulted in yield increases for those 
two important staple crops 
knudson said demand for us hybrid seed corn has been growing 
in south america while research by several private and public 
research centers has recently led to new highyielding rice suited 
for temperate areas of china 
overall she said the older advances of the green revolution 
and the emerging new biotechnologies hold out the promise of 
sustaining agricultural growth in the world 
in the philippines the international rice research institute 
says half a billion people mostly in asia are fed by new rice 
technology 
analysts robert e and eleanor huke reported that in a little 
over 20 years after the introduction of modern rice varieties the 
rice areas of 11 green revolution countries showed yield increases 
of 63 percent compared with only 17 percent for the rest of the 
world 
the hukes in a new book to be released by the institute said 
one may debate the relationship between food production and 
population growth but not the reality that a larger population was 
eating better in the later 1980s than in the mid1960s

a blues for buddha rca the silencers 
 
the silencers hail from scotland but their engaging eclectic 
sound spans the atlantic ocean mixing highland bagpipes with 
memphis guitars motown rhythms and anthemic choruses that recall 
the irish band u2s better efforts 
lyricistvocalist jimmie oneill puts an original spin on themes 
of love faith and social injustice but it is the musical 
arrangements that make a blues for buddha such a pleasure 
one cut sacred child sets a cajun fiddle against a bo 
diddley beat then blends in those bagpipes while oneill raves on 
in english french and spanish about the reckoning day acoming 
all to delightful effect 
this album was recorded in 1988 and released late last year

the silos rca the silos 
 
the silos prove on the first cut of their selftitled debut 
album that they can rock in the best tradition of southern 
headbanger bands 
but there is more than that to this gainesville fla quintet 
and not all of it is as appealing as that first tune caroline 
chief songwriter walter salashumara produces some pretty 
acoustic guitar tunes and intriguing lyrics rich in visual details 
that are sometimes soothing sometimes disturbing 
but fellow silo bob rupe exerts a rougher more backcountry 
influence that tends toward distortion guitars and repetitive 
raspy wailing 
their collaborations on four of the albums 12 songs are 
occasionally exhilarating as in caroline but frequently 
annoying 
meanwhile the bittersweet rocker im over you cowritten 
by salashumara and nonsilo robert ray is the most commercial 
number in the collection and also one of the best

whats this john waters the impresario of 
bad taste hooked up with the people who gave you parenthood 
whats more his new film cry baby is being released by a 
mainstream company universal pictures has the onetime king of 
underground sleaze succumbed to the establishment 
ive always tried to make commercial movies he explains 
unapologetically think about it pink flamingos 1972 cost 
10000 all the hideousness i put in that movie was commercial 
nobody heard of us before all the people who left that movie said 
oh my god you wouldnt believe what i just saw 
i always try to be commercial on my terms it worked too 
that movies still playing two generations have been offended by 
that movie im proud of that its hard to do 
talk about inflation cry baby cost 8 million minor by 
hollywood standards but not waters the film is backed by 
universal and imagine films entertainment operated by ron howard 
and brian grazer makers of splash and parenthood 
they have been a wonderful support said waters they 
never said to me you cant do that they gave me the money to do 
everything i wanted to do hire all the stars in heaven 
well not quite cry baby stars johnny depp the teen rage 
of tvs 21 jump street and amy locane as starcrossed lovers 
in the 1950s the cast ranges from polly bergen and susan tyrell to 
traci lords and iggy pop with cameos by willem dafoe patty hearst 
david ozzie and harriet nelson and troy donahue its all set 
to the beat of early rock n roll 
i wanted it to look like a 50s musical like the girl cant 
help it or early elvis waters said or like the spinoff 
lower versions of the wild one or rebel without a cause i 
liked those movies but better i liked the cheap imitations 
a movie nut all his life waters confessed his lifelong 
ambition i always wanted to be a villain in a disney movie 
with his thin pallid face razorthin mustache and black suit he 
could easily have done so growing up in baltimore he gave puppet 
shows from the age of 8 to 14 when he feared his playmates would 
consider it uncool 
his first movie was shot in 8mm in 1964 when he was 19 the 
title hag in a black leather jacket 
its in my closet where it will stay he said it was 
filmed on the roof of my parents house it was about a black man 
marrying a white woman with a ku klux klan member performing the 
ceremony the man took her away on the honeymoon in a garbage can 
it was very influenced by the 1960s theater of the absurd it 
played once in a beatnik coffee house and that was it 
waters continued making films with his baltimore buddies until 
the breakthrough with mondo trasho 
it was the story of a hitrun driver on one hideous day in her 
life he recounted it starred divine and in the end divine 
died in a pig pen and the virgin mary appeared to her 
in multiple maniacs divine was raped by a 15foot broiled 
lobster pink flamingos was about a battle between the filthiest 
people alive female trouble was about a criminal who wanted to 
be famous so badly that she got the electric chair that was like 
the oscar in her chosen profession desperate living was about 
the worst town you could live in when youre so embarrassed about 
your life you have to move there 
polyester was a comedy about the hell of suburban life where 
everything smells bad it was released in odorama hairspray 
was a musical comedy about a teen dance show cry baby is a 
juvenile delinquent comedy 
so you can see that my sense of humor has been the same from 
the very beginning 
despite the outrageousness of his themes waters claims the 
critics have been good to me since the very beginning you get bad 
press when you start believing the nice things that you all sign 
bad reviews rex reed gave us the best where do these people 
come from where do they go when the sun goes down isnt there a 
law or something that quote was our whole campaign in selling the 
picture 
although waters films are treasured at saturday midnight 
screenings he insists that he enjoys a wide audience after 
hairspray had been out we found that 8 and 9yearolds really 
loved the films thats an audience i had never tested never even 
thought of they liked it on one level they didnt see the parody 
of it 
when we tested cry baby there were a lot of kids who said 
they thought it was a really romantic movie they can like it on a 
another level thats ok it is romantic it is sexy all juvenile 
delinquents were sexy thats why they had em the word itself is 
sexy we dont have juvenile delinquents anymore we have 
13yearold mass murderers

singer john mellencamps art is populated 
with characters from americas heartland but these days those 
characters are more likely to be found in oil paintings than on the 
radio 
for mellencamp painting has provided a respite from the 
pressures of rock n roll and the recent collapse of his second 
marriage 
his second exhibit of oil paintings opened april 12 at the 
churchmanfehsenfeld gallery of the indianapolis art league 
mellencamp first displayed his work last year at an exhibit with 
jazz artist miles davis in los angeles 
the 29 portraits depict the singersongwriters family and 
friends the facial expressions created by his muted brush strokes 
are always sad and they convey the same disillusionment found in 
his musical anthems about the nations heartland and the farm 
crisis 
i think you can say much more in a painting than you can in a 
stupid song he said in an interview with rolling stone magazine 
last year 
some days i start at 7 oclock in the morning and i paint 
until 5 eat dinner and come back and paint till midnight i dont 
have to see anybody i dont have to talk to anybody its better 
than sex for me 
however mellencamps wealth hardly fits the stereotype of a 
struggling artist his albums have sold millions he records in his 
own studio and he could afford to spend much of the last year in an 
art studio he had built next to his home near bloomington 
he and his wife vicky are in the middle of a divorce they are 
the parents of teddi joe 8 and justice 4 who currently are 
living with their mother 
mellencamps manager harry sandler said the singer did not 
want to be interviewed about his venture into the art world john 
wants to let the paintings stand on their own sandler said he 
just chooses not to speak at this time 
mellencamp has not hinted that his music career is over but it 
has certainly taken an extended vacation his growing discontent 
with pop stardom surfaced in his last album big daddy 
never wanted to be no pop singer never wanted to write no pop 
songs goes the bitter refrain of the hit single pop singer 
which offers mellencamps cynical view of todays music scene 
he refused to tour in support of big daddy and his only 
stage appearance in recent months came at the farm aid iv concert 
in indianapolis april 7 the rousing ovation he received and his 
energetic threesong performance were far removed from the solitude 
of a blank canvas 
mellencamp organized the first farm aid back in 1984 with willie 
nelson as a benefit for struggling farmers 
i think people my age need to start taking their position in 
the community seriously and start dealing with local problems 
within the system he said in an interview with the associated 
press i dont mean standing in the back rows and throwing stuff 
any coward can do that we tried that in the 60s and it didnt 
work out too good i mean to take affirmative action and to make 
positive steps to change in a country that needs to go through that 
right now 
those who have worked with mellencamp say he is serious about 
painting and that it is not merely a hobby jan royce traveled to 
mellencamps studio several times last summer to help him learn oil 
techniques 
hes very bright very eager to learn very driven said 
royce a portrait painter from indianapolis he paints from the 
heart just as his music is from the heart 
royce said the immediacy of creating a painting appeals to 
mellencamps impatient nature 
he works very fast and tries to capture what hes feeling 
immediately said julia l muney exhibits curator at the art 
league 
by displaying his paintings to the public and critics muney 
said mellencamp wanted some validation for himself he wants the 
public to confirm am i going in the right direction 
at least some buyers think so three of his selfportraits 
ranging in price from 2000 to 6000 were sold before the show 
opened muney said 
reaction to the show was enthusiastic among 450 guests invited 
to a preopening party attended by mellencamp muney said 
they liked the work a lot they might have been skeptical but 
they are no longer muney said i was expecting things to look 
a little more folksy i was surprised at the expertness of the 
painthandling 
in yet another paradox mellencamp chose to personally oversee 
all aspects of the indianapolis showing 
muney said he helped set up the exhibit fussed over the titles 
of each painting and wired the frames himself in preparation for 
hanging 
hell deprecate his paintings its very strange because hes 
serious about painting but after a while he wont be satisfied with 
the results 
we were looking at some of these paintings and he told me 
this is crummy but you can hang it anyway muney said 
gesturing toward the exhibit 
mellencamp insisted on removing two paintings from the exhibit 
because he wasnt satisfied with them muney said 
he may not want to discuss his paintings but the prices on his 
works speak volumes 
his two least expensive works are a selfportrait of himself and 
another titled big j showing his daughter justice in a pink 
dress both sell for 2000 three paintings are priced at 15000 
they are among the largest works in the exhibit measuring roughly 
72 inches long by 48 inches wide 
his first wife priscilla is the subject of cil which 
shows her wearing 50sstyle glasses and large earrings 
in the beach or the bar said to be mellencamps favorite 
he portrays seven people gathered around an outdoor bar at his 
showing last fall in los angeles the painting carried a 25500 
price tag in indianapolis its practically a steal at 12000 
paintings cost more in la he adjusted his prices down for 
the midwestern market muney said 
muney said mellencamp asked her if his prices were too high 
given his name and what hes putting into them frankly i said 
no she said 
but muney admits few artists who have been painting for less 
than two years can tag such elaborate prices on their works 
yes theyre paying for the name she said of potential 
mellencamp collectors

john trudell can still remember the date jan 
14 1979 the place vancouver british columbia and what he was 
doing riding in a car when he wrote his first lyrics 
suddenly these lines came into my head gently the rains of 
purification wash my mind recalled the 44yearold trudell a 
longtime indian activist who has recorded several albums of his 
poetry something told me to write them down and ive been 
writing since then 
i wrote a set of 20 lines it was not something i expected 
then i started writing and i started writing a lot and i saw 
well theres some reason im doing this and ill see where the 
writing takes me 
his writing found its way on tape with friend and guitarist 
jesse ed davis composing backing tracks for two albums unable to 
sign with any record label trudell formed peace music and released 
the songs on mailorder cassettes in 1986 aka grafitti man 
wound up in the hands of bob dylan who called it the best record 
of the year 
i think he was doing the grateful dead tour that year and he 
played our tape at his concerts trudell recalled the effect 
wasnt monetary at that time what it was was more recognition from 
other artists 
so rock stars jackson browne george harrison and bono became 
fans too and midnight oil made trudell the opening act for their 
1988 tour trudell is a rock n roll fan himself paying tribute 
to elvis presley in baby boom che 
but while many of his costars are musicians who developed 
politically trudell is an activist now giving live recitals 
i knew how to handle the stage for myself but i had never 
worked it this way with four or five other people thats 
something that im not trained for trudell said 
im not familiar with the poets i never really listened to 
any poets their lines may have had great symbolic meanings but 
they were not real to my world what was real to my world was 
country music and rock n roll music and blues 
why he began writing is almost too painful to talk about a time 
he refers to as when things changed in my life in 1979 after 
trudell led a march in washington and spoke out against fbi policy 
toward indians a mysterious fire at his nevada home killed his 
wife his three children and his motherinlaw 
i realized i needed to survive but surviving isnt enough 
said trudell who soon developed a compulsion to write 
theres got to be something else that goes with it otherwise a 
lot of things lose their meaning and purpose i was trying to 
figure out how i was going to deal with that 
he was born in omaha neb in 1946 and lived on and off the 
santee reservation until joining the navy in 1963 
i knew the realities in my reservation and life of the 
reservations and i knew the reality of racism and a whole lot 
things but when i was in the military it showed me that there were 
a lot of indians around the world as far as america was 
concerned said trudell who served in vietnam 
i had the experiences of the military and then i went to 
college for a little while basically college taught me the same 
thing the navy taught me there are many realities here and what 
the controlling class taught me was youve got to submit to be 
successful 
he became a leader of the indian rights movement in the late 
1960s serving as chair of indians of all tribes during the 
occupation of alcatraz island in 1969 and heading the american 
indian movement in the 70s when protests took place at mount 
rushmore washington and wounded knee 
graffiti man includes political songs such as rich mans 
war and love songs such as stardreamer woman trudell speaks 
of his writing as the next new wave in music sounding like a true 
punk rocker whos tired of the state of the art 
because the music industry with all its high tech has 
basically gone as far as it could go its stagnant it needs a new 
infusion of human energy i think spoken word can be that infusion 
of human energy 
people are used to langauge being spoken used to being talked 
to he said in our generation all our poets got sucked up as 
musicians and are identified as musicians and that put it out of 
reach of your average person poets are within every persons 
reach

judged by the numbers only seward park high 
school in manhattans squalid lower east side could be viewed as 
just another monument to a nations failure to educate its urban 
poor especially its immigrants 
fully onefourth of seward parks incoming freshmen are already 
17 years old the school is so overcrowded that it is operating at 
150 percent capacity nine out of 10 pupils live with parents who 
dont speak english some threequarters of the upperclassmen read 
below grade level the average scholastic aptitude test score was 
288 on the verbal section on a scale of 200800 and dozens live 
in welfare hotels or homeless shelters less than 14 percent of the 
schools seniors read at grade level 
but theres another number that tells a more encouraging story 
about seward park a number that says there are students plenty of 
them that beat the odds 
a former new york times reporter samuel freedman spent a year 
at this old overcrowded moneystarved school and found 
remarkably that 92 percent of pupils who graduate go on to higher 
education 
are we thus wrongly stereotyping urban schools as unqualified 
failures freedman thinks we have overlooked the dedication of 
teachers like jessice siegel and students like see wai mui a 
chinese immigrant and carlos pimentals from a backwater town in 
the dominican republic whose success in school takes a kind of 
courage almost impossible to comprehend 
their stories are told in intricate and fascinating detail in 
freedmans important new book small victories the real world of 
a teacher her students amp their high school harper amp row 
2295 
this is a humane genuine and extraordinarily detailed portrait 
of a ghetto high school right down to the very bricks 
in common with the best recent books and movies of this growing 
genre the film stand and deliver and the tracy kidders 
book among schoolchildren small victories does not limit 
itself to portraits of adults such as teachers or principals 
refreshingly the children are treated as main players on the 
school stage no mean feat for an author because youngsters thi 
age especially immigrants are not the easiest interview subjects 
in an interview freedman said he wanted to develop true 
pictures of at least a few of the students in the school and 
traveled halfway around the globe to do so his research took him 
to the peoples republic of china and the dominican republic the 
homelands of the majority of seward parks immigrant students 
the picture that emerges is complicated a blend of optimism and 
despair on the one hand there is jessica siegel a teacher and 
dreamweaver who cares so much about her profession it finally 
consumes her 
we feel cheered as she jawbones youngsters who never thought 
they could go to college she cajoles college admissions officers 
into giving students with caverages a chance she drives her kids 
hundreds of miles to vouch for them at college interviews 
and we are inspired by the stories of many of her students see 
wai for example came to new york in 1980 an immigrant from rural 
china by the time he entered seward park his english was still 
halting and the chinatown that was his home left him prey to youth 
gangs 
jessica spotted his potential and became his support helping 
him with his selfassurance and his english see wai this kid who 
defied the odds of his background ends up at state university of 
new york at new paltz where he is now a sophomore 
yet such small victories are mingled with many daily defeats 
as freedman says what i would hope people will take away from 
this is that schools like seward park are designed to fail 
meaning neighborhood urban high schools those designed to take 
all comers are being systematically starved of funds by unfair 
formulas that send more money per pupil to the more selective city 
high schools not to mention state funding formulas that generally 
give suburban schools a big money edge over city schools 
the successes inspirational and noteworthy as they are remain 
exceptions 
small victories ends on the bittersweet note that siegel 
decides that shes had it with teaching after nine years of long 
days late evenings and too many bureaucratic hassles shes had it 
with the teachers union with students who refuse to be reached 
most of all with a life that doesnt leave room for finding a 
husband or even a steady boyfriend 
she decides to return to an earlier occupation journalism 
shed thought often of quitting her 29442 job shed thought 
about how you grind yourself to dust and all you hear about 
in return are lousy kids and lousy schools and lousy teachers you 
read an article in the new york times about single women in which 
somebody says its tough to get dates if youre a teacher because 
men are looking for professionals 
i understand im doing really good work she says finally 
through tears but im sacrificing my life

twenty years ago skip ewing saw glen 
campbell perform on television something clicked 
at the time ewing was about to start school today hes 26 and 
one of the youngest country music performers signed to a recording 
contract with a major label 
i was about 4 when i got my first guitar ewing recalled in 
an interview i cant remember a time when i didnt play 
i know i sang the theme to rawhide and i watched the glen 
campbell goodtime hour i wanted to play just like glen 
in the 1990s ewing is one of country musics fresh faces just 
as campbell was in the late 60s 
the handsome wellspoken singersongwriter is laying the 
foundation for a solid career doing something he genuinely enjoys 
his single its you again reached the top 10 of the 
country music popularity charts in february burnin a hole in my 
heart and the gospel according to luke were top 10 hits last 
year 
ewing has released two albums coast of colorado and the 
will to love the latter has many cuts with little more than a 
fingerpicked acoustic guitar 
he was born in redlands calif but lived throughout the 
country because his father spent 11 years moving from city to city 
in the navy ewing worked at the opryland usa theme park in 
nashville for 2 seasons as a singerdancer in a live production 
tracing the history of country music 
he also made a living as a songwriter and has written album cuts 
recorded by kenny rogers willie nelson george strait george 
jones conway twitty ricky van shelton and others 
since launching his solo career he has been the opening act at 
country concerts with such headline performers as the judds randy 
travis alabama and reba mcentire 
ewing who also plays the fivestring banjo and mandolin 
understands that hes fortunate to have a recording contract at a 
relatively youthful age but he quickly adds that he worked 
diligently for it 
i was in town three years before it happened he said it 
was a short time compared with some people but i had been doing it 
for a heck of a long time i had been singing and writing songs and 
traveling 
im not a very patient person sometimes i want things to 
happen thats one of the things i need to work on accept things 
as they are 
i set awful big goals i work hard at what i do he said 
i figured there are a lot of singers in town a lot of 
songwriters and a lot of guitar players and if i can do all of 
them well i have a chance 
his balladoriented music focuses on romance in the album the 
will to love the song its you again is about the pain of 
love the cut karen is about the disintegration of a 
relationship shes makin plans is about devotion please 
dont leave me now deals with family love 
it seems like my voice is suited to ballads ewing said i 
like to sing emotional things i feel like im sharing something 
when i do that i enjoy singing things that allow me to feel like 
im saying something that im expressing something its like 
being an actor sometimes 
he has written all the songs he has recorded 
songwriting is very much a craft and an art i dont just 
settle for things sometimes it takes hours to find one line a 
place where different emotions mix 
i feel like i have a lot to offer when i go and do a show 
its not a job its something i love to do the music i perform 
and write is all a part of me by sharing that with an audience i 
feel im sharing things important to me i feel that what i share 
with people is worthwhile and im not wasting somebodys time with 
my music 
the song the will to love used an instrument rarely used in 
country music a cello ewing who didnt want to use traditional 
country instruments such as fiddles and steel guitars said it 
allowed him to be more intimate 
on his next lp he plans to use another instrument rarely heard 
in country music a saxophone 
i dont mind taking chances ewing said 
campbell his old idol surprised him recently after hearing 
that ewing was a longtime fan of his he came by the studio

the peregrine falcon once reduced to fewer than 
100 pairs in the united states is making a comeback as hundreds 
swoop off cliffs ledges and in many cases skyscrapers 
after 15 years and millions of dollars conservationists say the 
birds soon wont need special care possibly by 1995 but they 
worry congress and others will decide that time is now 
its progressed marvelously its probably not true that the 
bird is widely endangered now said jim enderson a colorado 
college biologist who heads a federal peregrine recovery team 
its been a model program nationally said brad blodget 
massachusetts state ornithologist its a victory story 
within five years enderson said the government could probably 
downlist the bird from endangered to threatened or even take it 
off the lists altogether 
this is big news for the peregrine once totaling about 300 
pairs in the east and many more in the west the falcon population 
was hard hit in the 1950s by ddt and other insecticides by 1975 
there were no falcons known on the east coast and fewer than 100 
pairs were known to exist in the entire continental united states 
we were basically starting from zero said blodget 
groups such as the boise idahobased peregrine fund set about 
reintroducing the falcon importing hatchlings from canada 
scotland argentina and other countries 
the federal government which banned ddt for nearly all 
purposes earmarked about 300000 a year for captive falcon 
breeding some states even put checkoff options on tax forms to 
extend a portion of rebates to peregrine recovery 
nationally the efforts have cost many millions of dollars 
said bill burnham president of the peregrine fund which spends 
about 800000 a year on peregrine recovery 
its a lot cheaper to take care of the environment rather 
than trying to go in afterward and put them back after you lose 
them he said 
falcon recovery cost so much in part because it entails more 
than just releasing an argentinean bird in montana mortality rates 
are as high as 50 percent in the birds first year and remain at 
about 15 percent subsequently burnham said 
the peregrine fund will release or hack its 3000th falcon 
this year burnham said in california where more than 500 birds 
were released in the 1980s 90 pairs exist up from eight pairs in 
1975 
today there are more than 540 falcon pairs in the united 
states almost 100 pairs are in the grand canyon alone in the 
northeast at least 85 pairs have been counted while about 17 
pairs are known in the midwest 
as long as the pesticide situation does not change for the 
worse its unlikely that this bird is going to be in trouble in 
the foreseeable future enderson said 
other conservationists are more cautious 
were about twothirds of the way there burnham said as 
far as the release of the peregrines go theres probably a need 
for another six to seven years 
the birds remain scarce in some places such as idaho where 
only three pairs are known so they say they are keeping anxious 
eyes on washington hoping congress does not pull the plug too soon 
one of the worst things you can do is put a lot of energy into 
restoration and then stop it said tom french who heads the 
massachusetts endangered species program 
as they are reintroduced to modern society some peregrines are 
showing a taste for urban life where highrise buildings resemble 
high cliffs and rocky ledges 
nine pairs swoop and dive among the skyscrapers and sloping 
bridges of new york city while in springfield the peregrines 
nesting on a 23story building have become stars of a local cable 
television show 
but with the falcons new surroundings have come modern hazards 
such as high thin wires airplanes and plateglass windows 
conservationists say too many collisions with planes or 
decapitations by wires could cripple breeding efforts 
last year one of the adult males flew over the airport and was 
hit by an airplane and killed right in the middle of breeding 
season said pat redig who heads the midwestbased raptor 
center ive seen those happen with enough frequency to cause me 
to be concerned about the fragility of our population

ponder the plight of the piping plover 
this unassuming sandcolored bird already considered an 
endangered species is struggling to make its home in the urban 
jungle 
most humans who visit gateway national recreation area in the 
borough of queens dont even spot the plover which nests well 
camouflaged just an inlet away from brighton beach and coney 
island brooklyn 
but meryl golden a researcher and national park service ranger 
whos considered the pro among ploverwatchers perseveres for 
more than two years she has strived to prevent the plovers 
extinction 
on april 24 the us fish and wildlife service presented a 
northeast region conservation award to gateway for its efforts to 
protect the plover and other endangered birds the least tern the 
common tern and the black skimmer which recently returned to 
gateway after a sevenyear absence 
the average piping plover is 7 inches long with a black ring 
around its neck and a black mark above its eyes it makes a 
twotoned whistle that ornithologists call peep lull 
theyre precious and comical to watch said golden they 
know who i am because i make eye contact with them theyre not 
scared of me 
thirty pairs nest on 2 miles of beach owned partly by the 
national park service and partly by a private apartment complex 
we believe it is the largest concentration of piping plover 
anywhere said golden most beaches this size would have one or 
two pair 
perhaps 145 more pairs live on long island although no one has 
counted golden said its believed 875 pairs live on the atlantic 
coast from north carolina to newfoundland with a few more in the 
great lakes and great plains regions 
the birds enjoy flat shellcovered sparsely vegetated beaches 
when a plover lays its four eggs in a small depression in the sand 
the park service puts up symbolic fencing string flags and 
signs warning that an endangered species is nesting 
the young walk around a few hours after theyre hatched and can 
fly in about 25 days 
instead of placing food in the chicks mouths parents lead them 
to a feast of insects and marine worms unfortunately for the 
plovers one of their feeding areas is the water line where most 
of the human recreation is concentrated said golden 
a mother plover if disturbed tries to convince the predator 
that her wing is broken shell make a lot of noise and lead the 
intruder away from where the young are its quite a convincing 
display said paul nickerson chief of the endangered species 
division of the fish and wildlife services northeast division in 
boston 
last year gateway began banning most recreation on the plovers 
beach during nesting season march 15 through august in 1988 six 
chicks survived long enough to grow plumage and fly in 1989 there 
were 20 said golden 
but the plovers also face other dangers rangers and volunteers 
have removed 3000 pounds of oil from the beach after five spills 
in the past few months

frazier the fourhorned navajochurro 
ram and a flock of skinny turkeys look freaky but hans peter 
jorgensen is serious when he says they can help save a world being 
consumed by sameness 
risks of factory farming that produces cheap easytoraise 
clonelike animals ultimately outweigh the benefits said the 
manager of the cs foundation farm its a shortterm gain for a 
longterm serious serious loss 
there has been increasing interest in rare breeds but heidi 
johnson a university of californiadavis agricultural extension 
spokeswoman chalked it up to a fad 
others disagree 
when plants and animals are identical genetically they have 
the same strengths and weaknesses said a paper produced by the 
private new york citybased cs fund when one variety suffers 
destruction entire plant and animal populations can be 
irretrievably lost uniformity engenders vulnerability 
between 1600 and 1900 experts estimate that one plant or 
animal became extinct every four years the report said today 
it is estimated that at least one species is disappearing each 
day 
extinction is forever you dont get them back jorgensen 
said our position is dont throw the genes away your 
grandchildren might need them 
the foundation quoted recent studies that show less than 5 
percent of the vegetable seed varieties available in this country 
in 1903 are still around 
jorgensen compared the situation to the irish potato famine 
about 750000 people died from disease or starvation from 1845 to 
1847 when the potato crop failed because of a plant blight 
jorgensen said might have been avoided if the irish had relied on 
more varieties 
that was a crisis in genetic diversity he said 
the cs foundation is financed by maryanne mott a montana 
rancher nature photographer and general motors heiress the 
foundation has various causes its directors believe promote human 
and cultural survival 
about 15 acres of land in the sleepy town of freestone 
population 54 about 65 miles north of san francisco were bought 
by the fund in 1983 when it moved from nearby santa rosa 
jorgensen son of a dairy farmer and a former college art teacher 
cabinet maker and general contractor was hired to run a project to 
conserve rare or minor breeds 
rare breeds of cattle and horses are those with fewer than 200 
annual registrations rare sheep goat and pig breeds have fewer 
than 500 minor breeds of cattle sheep goats and horses are those 
with fewer than 1000 annual registrations 
cs hopes to carry its conservation message through education 
and support for genetic diversity preservation one goal is 
living history farms to keep rare breeds 
the funds first targets included the navajochurro sheep 
recently added to the list was the naturally mating bronze turkey 
the churro sheep has a 450year history in north america dating 
to when they were left behind by spanish conquistadors who had 
taken them on journeys as food but the navajos began using the 
churro with its long coarse doublecoated fleece for 
ceremonial rugs 
thats why the old navajo rugs would last 200 years 
jorgensen said 
the churro adapted to dramatic desert climate changes altitude 
limited water resources and forage conditions and navajo flocks 
soon numbered in the hundreds of thousands 
but a federal livestock reduction program that jorgensen charged 
was aimed at humbling the american indians and saving lake mead 
from sheepcaused erosion led to their decimation 
there are only about 500 churros today about 10 percent of 
their rare gene pool is in freestones flock 
at utah state university churro sheep project spokeswoman 
kristy selman cited the animals ability to resist internal 
parasites and contagious foot rot problems traditionally expensive 
for the sheep industry 
churro lambs sell for 250 to 1000 and are of great value for 
the navajos two gray hills carpets that use the soft but 
strong black brown and white yarns that require no dyeing selman 
said 
many older navajo weavers still cherish the churro which the 
project supplies to reservations 
its been a long time since theyve seen any of these she 
said when they do their whole faces light up when they see 
it they want it and they want it now 
the success of the foundations efforts on behalf of the turkey 
remains to be seen the turkey commonly raised by commercial 
growers today has been bred for white meat an absence of pin 
feathers and breast muscles so large the poultry cant mate 
naturally reproduction is handled by artificial insemination 
i think weve taken a little step too far said jorgensen 
while gazing at the gobbling flock at the turkey hilton

the governments science programs a source of 
technological breakthroughs and national pride are always

stories tracking the progress of one portion of this years federal 
budget science spending

physicist ellen williams is spending 
less time in her laboratory these days and more in her closetsized 
office shuffling forms and grant applications 
her work on the properties of atoms in solid surfaces could 
someday help advance computer technology it already has won the 
36yearold university of maryland researcher a 1990 award as the 
nations top young female physicist 
but instead she spends long hours at her desk under a 
photograph of nobel prizewinner madame curie tacked to an 
otherwise bare office wall she makes telephone calls writes 
letters and files applications in a search for government and 
corporate financing 
one of the two federal research grants that have kept her in 
business the last few years has expired and the other is being 
slashed nearly in half 
i spend huge amounts of time worrying about money and not 
about science which is unproductive said williams whose 
federal support is shrinking from 100000 to 37500 annually 
id say i have a year left of really good quality research and 
then a serious downward slope unless i find new funding 
williams is not the only scientist grumbling that the 
governments generosity is diminishing from coast to coast and 
from astronomy to zoology scientists performing basic research 
which seeks knowledge regardless of its immediate application are 
complaining that the government is leaving them and the country 
shortchanged 
of this years 12 trillion federal budget 64 billion will be 
spent on scientific research and development 
but only about one in six rampd dollars 114 billion will go 
to basic research which white house science adviser d allan 
bromley calls the heart of our science and technology 
enterprise twothirds of the money is aimed at development 
mainly of weapons while the rest is for applied research devoted 
to advances toward specific goals 
the figures disturb advocates of basic research who rely on 
federal coffers for two of every three dollars they receive the 
competing fields of development and applied research get most of 
their money from nongovernment sources such as corporations which 
tilt their scientific efforts heavily toward developing new 
products 
basic researchers argue that there never has been a time when 
breakthroughs were possible in a broader range of fields from 
robotics to human gene manipulation to global climate changes 
we live in the midst of an explosion of technological and 
theoretical opportunity said douglas e kelly vice president of 
the association of american medical colleges if we do not grasp 
this opportunity other nations stand ready to do so probably at 
our expense 
scientists who perform basic research often poke around in 
obscure areas such as williams study of the properties of atoms 
that even when productive can take decades to bear fruit 
but it is precisely that kind of work that has led to 
unanticipated breakthroughs basic research in the 1940s into the 
magnetic properties of atoms led to magnetic resonance imaging 
used today to examine human organs without surgery the emerging 
field of biotechnology owes its existence to scientists decades ago 
who with no practical goals in mind began tinkering with living 
cells 
the white house and congress aware of such longterm payoffs 
have treated basic research relatively kindly in recent budgets 
the governments annual 150 billion deficits have pinched all 
federal spending limiting many domestic programs to less than 5 
percent growth per year yet federal basic research spending will 
grow this year by 7 percent over 1989 levels in his proposed 1991 
budget president bush wants to boost basic research expenditures 
to 124 billion a 9 percent increase 
basic research advocates however say the dollars still fall 
short 
you really need to look at it not in terms of how weve done 
in the past but in terms of what the research opportunities are 
said david moore executive secretary of the ad hoc group fo 
medical research funding a coalition of about 140 universities 
science societies and voluntary health organizations 
when moore and others visit capitol hill they compete with 
lobbyists for housing veterans and other programs whose 
beneficiaries far outnumber the nations 218000 scientists and 
engineers 
science and technology in the budget are vulnerable and in 
direct competition with programs with very active and very vocal 
constituencies white house adviser bromley told a recent 
washington gathering of scientists 
once congress chooses an amount to be spent on science 
lawmakers then decide how to distribute the money basic research 
advocates cringe when they find themselves vying with projects such 
as the 30 billion space station which attract lots of political 
support and large amounts of money 
megaprojects like the space station have a political life of 
their own driven first by the goal of the project and second by a 
group of political actors who stand to benefit by the placement of 
that project said kenneth kay who lobbies congress for research 
universities and corporations 
there isnt that momentum for the 50000 grant or the 
microscope that some researcher needs he said 
scientists performing basic research even compete with each 
other 
the national science foundation and the national institutes of 
health the governments major agencies for financing 
nongovernment scientists provided money for less than 30 percent 
of the 47000 grant proposals they received in 1989 an alltime 
low percentage

like most doctors william isaacs wants to 
keep up with discoveries and refine his technique 
but he lives in canadian a panhandle town on the south bank of 
the canadian river 100 miles northeast of amarillo the regions 
dark red soil supports wheat farms and cattle ranches oil 
pumpjacks dot the landscape 
its not the kind of place where doctors gather at conventions 
to discuss the latest news in detecting breast cancer or treating 
hypothermia 
out here in canadian its such an obstacle to travel out and 
get continuing education isaacs a family practitioner said 
you have to leave your practice hand it over to another doctor 
and that kind of thing its almost too much trouble 
but a program sponsored by the texas tech health sciences center 
in lubbock is using satellite television to bring continuing 
education to doctors in canadian and nine other rural west texas 
towns 
doctors in the program called mednet talk before cameras in a 
studio at texas tech the televised talks are transmitted by 
satellite to rural hospitals at lunch time 
its a oneway video but a twoway audio so they can talk 
back make comments ask questions said ted hartman mednet 
director 
it works really well carl utterback a family practitioner 
in seminole said i can see patients in the morning and i can 
walk over to the hospital and have lunch and while im eating 
lunch i can absorb a few facts 
hartman is optimistic the network which began the educational 
programs in december will be expanded to the rest of the state 
the satellite tv programs are only one facet of mednet a 
threeyear pilot program funded by a 19 million grant from the 
us department of health and human services 400000 worth of 
equipment from texas tech and a donation of 170000 worth of 
communications equipment from atampt 
mednet also placed facsimile machines and computers in rural 
hospitals so they could receive documents quickly from medical 
school libraries but doctors found they could send printouts of 
ultrasound monitoring of fetuses to distant obstetricians two 
rural women were taken to city hospitals to deliver babies because 
of problems detected on the fetal printouts hartman said 
a mednet computer network among rural hospitals allows them to 
save money by buying supplies together in bulk the computers also 
allow rural hospitals to quickly send medical records to city 
hospitals when patients are transferred 
a twoway video service is planned to allow facetoface 
talks between rural doctors and specialists at techs medical 
school 
the doctor in alpine for example would present the patient 
to the consultant in odessa and they would reach a diagnosis and 
treatment hartman said 
one aim of mednet hartman said is to find out whether these 
programs are affordable 
this is necessary because if something isnt done to decrease 
the isolation of these hospitals and physicians theyll just close 
and the doctors will go someplace else to practice he said

particles called colloids apparently can 
attach themselves to or encase bits of toxic elements and allow 
them to flow for long distances in water researchers said 
a los alamos national laboratory study suggests colloids could 
confound conventional means of predicting how far pollutants travel 
through ground water 
that in turn means some hazards might have been underestimated 
colloids probably play a more important role than people 
expected in the past said wilfred polzer of the labs earth and 
environmental science division one of the studys coauthors 
the colloids which might be composed of silica or various 
minerals are so small that a powerful microscope is needed to see 
them and so light that they do not settle out of water 
the study published in the journal environmental science and 
technology concerned two radioactive elements plutonium and 
americium but william penrose the studys lead author said the 
phenomenon potentially could affect an array of hazardous and 
radioactive pollutants pesticides and heavy metals 
no one knows how widespread colloids are because nobody has 
routinely looked for them said penrose their existence in ground 
water was unknown until a few years ago and there still is little 
data penrose said 
the study underscores the importance of determining whether 
colloids are present at waste sites throughout the country penrose 
and polzer said

chuck henager came up with a way to make 
buildings more resistant to earthquakes 
ray moore invented a fluid that removes impurities from 
industrial smokestack gases 
doug elliott and eddie baker found a way to get more usable 
material from lowgrade crude oil which could help reduce the 
nations reliance on foreign sources 
they were among 344 people honored april 19 at an invention 
convention that was part of battelle pacific northwest 
laboratorys 25th anniversary celebration 
the scientists engineers and technicians are responsible for 
369 inventions from the laboratory that have received patents in 
the 25 years battelle has provided research for the us department 
of energys hanford nuclear reservation 
the whole basis is good people coming up with good ideas 
said don williams director of technology transfer for battelle 
were trying to honor some of those people 
henager created a concrete building joint that he said might 
have prevented the fatal highway collapse during last falls 
earthquake if it had been used on san francisco bay area highways 
but the joints are still being tested by the american concrete 
institute he said 
moore who is retired has 20 patents he said he is proudest of 
a molten salt system that is the fluid used in smokestack scrubbers 
to remove impurities before gases are released to the environment 
the invention convention includes a booklet with four pages of 
smalltype descriptions of patents 
there is not a better mousetrap among them but there are 
inventions to control the startup of nuclear reactors for more 
energyefficient methods of melting glass and for a method to 
detect plastic explosives in airline baggage

the international investment company buying saks 
fifth avenue plans to stick with the managers and the strategy that 
have made the highfashion retailer successful officials said 
investcorp a middle eastbased company is paying 15 billion 
to add the saks name to a rack of upscale retailing investments 
that include tiffany jewelers and gucci 
as the rich price indicated saks had been one of the most 
soughtafter retailers on the market after its british parent bat 
industries plc put it up for sale last september 
it does show that a profitable and prestigious us retailer 
can command top dollar despite all the retail properties on the 
market and a sluggish retail environment said janet mangano an 
analyst at josephthal amp co 
the transaction announced wednesday by investcorp and bat should 
be completed within 10 weeks investcorp will assume certain of 
saks liabilities under the agreement 
bat chairman patrick sheehy said investcorps proposal was 
financially sound and contained a substantial amount of equity to 
maintain saks reputation and support planned expansion of the 
45store chain 
saks will gain a new owner with a proven track record in 
building luxury businesses solid financial backing and a 
commitment to continuing the highly successful strategy established 
by bat for the company sheehy said 
arthur martinez senior vice president of batus inc bats us 
arm said the acquisition will have nothing in common with the 
heavily debtdependent deals that caused problems for others such 
as campeau corps us retailers 
this is not a traditional lbo leveraged buyout structure 
martinez said in an interview adequate capital is being put into 
the business to manage it the way that is has been managed 
store openings and renovations will be continued by the new 
owners martinez said excluding a store in texas that is being 
closed saks has 45 stores in 20 states the flagship store of the 
new yorkbased chain is located in manhattan on fifth avenue 
investcorp is widely believed to have immense financial clout 
it normally takes a laissezfaire approach to the companies in 
which it holds stakes for that reason it is anticipated that 
saks existing management including chairman and chief executive 
officer melvin jacobs will be retained 
jacobs has been credited with steering saks on a successful 
course the retailer rang up sales of 13 billion last year and 
earned 111 million before taxes and interest expenses 
paul leblang saks senior vice president and director of 
marketing said jacobs was unavailable to comment jacobs in 
partnership with a japanese retailer was one in a handful of 
losing bidders 
investcorp was established in 1982 and operates from bases in 
new york and london as well as well as cities in switzerland and 
bahrain 
it is incorporated in bahrain and publicly traded there a 
controlling interest is owned by investcorps management committee 
and it has about 11000 shareholders in total including wealthy 
middle eastern american british and other european investors 
investcorp previously has bought into a wide range of retailers 
it acquired the jewelry chain tiffany amp co from avon products inc 
and took it public in 1987 it owns 50 percent of the italian 
luxury leather goods and fashion company gucci and has an interest 
in chaumet frances largest retailer of prestige jewelry it also 
has stakes in ice cream chain carvel corp plus some retailing and 
nonretailing companies 
paul soldatos a member of investcorps management committee 
that led the effort to buy saks said the company intends to meet 
with saks management as soon as possible he said in an interview 
that no discussions had taken place to date because the jacobs

exxon corp claimed a welcome victory after 
shareholders rejected measures urging it to do more to protect the 
environment but at elast one of the companys big investors was 
dismayed by the vote 
shareholders at wednesdays 3hour 40minute annual meeting 
turned down six resolutions asking exxon to improve its 
environmental performance in the wake of last years valdez oil 
spill 
although the resolutions received more support than is usual for 
shareholders proposals none got as much as 10 percent of the vote 
chairman lawrence g rawl said the results indicated support 
of the management by large shareholders 
that support didnt include new york citys pension fund which 
own 6 million exxon shares or less than 1 percent of the total 
outstanding the fund voted in favor of five of the six 
environmental proposals and abstained from voting for the companys 
nominees to the board of directors 
the funds trustee elizabeth holtzman is still not persuaded 
that exxon understands that its image and potential liability as a 
polluter could seriously affect the value of its stock said ms 
holtzmans spokeswoman nancy young 
management had urged shareholders to vote against resolutions 
seeking pledges by exxon to reduce emissions of pollutants and 
toxic waste create a special environmental affairs committee on 
its board of directors and follow the socalled valdez principles 
for corporate environmental conduct 
liz is dismayed that a company in good conscience can oppose 
reducing air pollution and toxic emissions ms young said 
brion blackwelder vice president of friends of the earth who 
said he represented holders of 250000 shares also criticized 
managements opposition to the proposals 
youve chosen to take a hard line and miss each pitch 
totally blackwelder told rawl you are out of touch with 
reality youre running a ship that youre not able to control i 
see no reason for you not to step down 
rawl did not respond but later said exxons support of american 
petroleum institute environmental guidelines showed the companys 
commitment 
in addition to reaffirming our own commitment to safety and 
environmental protection exxon has been an active participant in 
the development of guiding principles for the petroleum and 
chemical industries rawl said 
were not taking a lackadaisical approach he said its 
damn important to us what happens to the environment 
rawl and president lee r raymond presented an upbeat report on 
exxons efforts to clean up prince william sound where the exxon 
valdez ran aground on march 24 1989 spewing 11 million gallons of 
crude in the nations worst oil spill 
the important point to make about the oil spill cleanup 
important to exxon and you as shareholders and important to 
alaskans is that very substantial progress has already been 
made raymond said 
first by the massive effort that we mounted last year and 
later by the continued impact of bioremediation applications which 
we made last year 
under bioremediation a oileating chemical is sprayed along the 
ground 
raymond told reporters only about 60 miles of alaskan shoreline 
will be cleaned this year when fullscale efforts get under way in 
a couple of weeks compared to 1100 last year 
we really think that well be in very good shape by the end of 
the summer rawl said 
jay hair president of the national wildlife federation 
interrupted managements review of 1989 to criticize an upbeat 
sixminute video showing exxons clean up efforts he was booed 
when he suggested the spill had harmed more than alaskas 
environment and even caused increases in child abuse and alcoholism 
listen to the people of alaska whose lives have been destroyed 
and youre putting the profits in your pockets hair said 
although the environmental proposals fell far short of adoption 
federation spokeswoman lisa sylvester said the votes should be a 
clear signal to exxon that its not going to get away with trying 
to cover up the truth and its going to have to change its policies 
in order to survive in a changing world 
about 1850 people attended wednesdays meeting with only about 
20 protesters standing outside last years meeting held about a 
month after the valdez ran aground drew about 1700 shareholders 
with about 250 raucous demonstrators outside

michael milken appeared to have it all the 
brains the power the money the achievements ivan boesky was 
made to seem he would have had nothing were it not for cheating 
both wound up in federal court admitting they were felons 
i regard both as criminals both as having engaged in conduct 
which cannot be described as anything but arrogant disregard of the 
law former sec chairman david ruder said i wouldnt be sorry 
for either of them 
some saw a difference though 
the fact is you can distinguish milken from boesky 
securities lawyer ira lee sorkin said milken did not hand over 
paper bags stuffed with cash at 4 am under the brooklyn bridge 
milken the financier and boesky the stock speculator have been 
lumped together for more than three years a 1987 forbes magazine 
drawing showed them with eartoear grins after fattening up on a 
pie of money 
but while boeskys wide legacy is that of swindler milken is 
regarded by many as a brilliant innovator who created a new form of 
financing that changed the way wall street and corporate america 
operate for better or worse 
during his tearful guilty plea in us district court on 
tuesday milken sought to distance himself from his longtime 
customer at drexel burnham lambert inc he said he and boesky had 
little in common 
afterward milkens lawyer arthur liman said milken hoped 
history would recount not just the lawbreaking in several stock and 
bond transactions but his junk bond innovations that helped dozens 
of small companies 
hes a genius but he broke the law said former stockbroker 
boyd jefferies who admitted to illegal dealings with boesky 
cooperated with investigators and was placed on probation 
he has to suffer the consequences just like myself 
jefferies said wednesday from his aspen colo home i 
contributed a lot to the securities industry but i stepped over 
the line and i had to pay 
tales abounded of boeskys shady business dealings such as 
swapping satchels of money with investment banker martin siegel for 
illegal inside information about takeover stocks he was trading 
boesky now 53 rode in limousines wore expensive black suits 
beat his own drum in newspaper interviews dined at the harvard 
club he never finished college but got a degree from detroit law 
school and was obsessed with money 
boesky once asked an interviewer to imagine a jacobs ladder 
made of 500 million in silver dollars imagine he was quoted 
as saying wouldnt that be an aphrodisiac experience climbing 
to the top of such a ladder 
milken 43 wears a sharply different public face he dresses in 
conservatively tailored blue suits and simple ties by the 
standards of a billionaire the encino calif home where he lives 
with his wife lori and three children is modest 
when milken talks to reporters always under carefully 
controlled conditions it is about helping others he focuses on 
the highyield bond markets capitalraising attributes and on his 
favorite charities asked about money he often says that wealth 
is a byproduct 
it was a byproduct he enjoyed far more than boesky milken 
earned 550 million in 1987 alone and his reputation as a 
sometimes ruthless controller who worked 18hour days is hardly 
flattering 
milkens detractors say junk bonds created a debt binge that has 
left many companies on the brink of failure they also say 
junkbondfinanced hostile takeovers realigned the corporate power 
structure against managers in favor of noveau riche raiders 
four of the six criminal counts to which milken pleaded guilty 
this week involved dealings with boesky the governments original 
98count indictment and the secs complaints against both men 
included allegations of more extensive illegal behavior 
as head of drexels powerful highyield bond department milken 
did business with boesky beginning in 1983 raising 100 million 
for a boeskycontrolled hotel group drexel raised about 750 
million for boeskys arbitrage partnerships in the next three years 
in many ways the boeskys of this world are milkens 
creation said playwright jerry sterner a onetime businessman 
who wrote the offbroadway hit other peoples money about a 
hostile takeover it seemed to me he was the master puppeteer 
boesky was one of many puppets he had on his string 
until pleading guilty to six criminal counts and agreeing to pay 
600 million milken asserted his innocence in court he broke 
down in tears while reading a statement about his ordeal his 
family and dozens of friends watched in shocked disbelief 
boesky made no such statement when he pleaded guilty three years 
ago to one felony and agreed to pay 100 million in penalties 
there was no horde of supporters no business associates ready to 
extol his virtues 
all of wall streets convicted professionals jefferies said 
come in somewhere above that low point on a scale of one to 100 
ivan was minus 100 on the scale 
michael definitely had many many pluses he said and he 
had some minuses

it started out as a hearing on penny stock 
reform legislation changed into a report on the michael milken 
settlement and then into a dressing down of the head of the 
securities and exchange commission 
when it was over wednesday officials said the chairman of the 
house energy and commerce committee may call the fallen financier 
milken and exspeculator ivan boesky to testify before congress 
milken who pleaded guilty to six felonies on tuesday might 
have things wed be interested in hearing said rep john 
dingell dmich whose committee oversees the sec 
a senior congressional aide who asked not to be identified said 
dingell also may seek testimony from boesky who led prosecutors to 
milken and was linked to the former junk bond king in a number of 
illegal deals 
the disclosures came after a hearing of the committees finance 
subcommittee which is considering legislation to give the sec more 
clout in fighting fraud in the lowcost highrisk penny stock 
market 
but sec chairman richard c breeden spent much of his time 
touting the settlement the sec and justice department reached with 
milken 
the former highyield wizard of drexel burnham lambert inc 
ended a threeyear struggle with the government by pleading guilty 
to six securities and tax violations and agreeing to pay 600 
million in penalties he faces up to 28 years in prison at 
sentencing oct 1 
boesky settled criminal and civil charges by pleading guilty to 
one felony count and paying 100 million he was freed earlier this 
month after completing two years of a threeyear prison term 
dingell said he may call milken to testify about purported 
violations involving junk bond offerings handled by drexel 
we think there may have been as many as 2500 violations and 
that may be on the low side by an order of 10 dingell told 
reporters after peppering breeden with questions about the milken 
settlement during a hearing on pennystock reform legislation 
at issue is the legality of trading accounts owned by limited 
partnerships controlled largely by drexel employees that bought 
significant percentages of hot junk bond issues before they were 
made available to the general public 
critics say the activity drove up the price of those issues at 
the expense of drexel customers but the transactions legality has 
never been resolved drexel halted the practice after it came to 
light 
the existence of the limited partnerships was disclosed two 
years ago in documents and testimony presented to the oversight 
subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee 
milken was called to testify at that time but invoked his fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination 
the documents and testimony were sent to the sec and justice 
department but there has regrettably been no satisfactory 
response dingell said 
dingell complained about sec inaction on the matter to breeden 
although he conceded the events occurred before breeden took office 
last october 
it is over a year since those matters were referred to the 
commission nothing was done dingell said can you tell us why 
nothing was done was it because of budgetary matters or 
indifference or what 
i cant even tell if nothing was done breeden said adding 
that he would look into it

securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard breeden told a house panel he supports efforts to curb 
penny stock fraud but fears legislation being considered may cause 
as many problems as it solves 
penny stocks are lowcost securities usually trading for less 
than 3 a share that are typically used to raise capital for new 
or small companies they are not listed on stock exchanges and thus 
reliable uptotheminute information about them is hard to obtain 
that makes penny stocks prone to fraud by unscrupulous traders 
and promoters 
the penny stock reform act of 1990 introduced earlier this 
month by rep edward markey dmass would implement several 
reforms they include beefing up the secs power to bar crooked 
promoters and consultants from pushing highly speculative stocks on 
unsophisticated investors and requiring that all penny stocks trade 
through an automated stock quote system 
the energy and commerce committees finance subcommittee which 
markey chairs heard testimony on the bill wednesday supporters of 
all or most of the bills provisions included us attorney dee 
benson of utah and susan e bryant administrator of the oklahoma 
securities department and president of the north american 
securities administrators association a statelevel regulators 
group 
but breeden said that while the sec supports the proposed 
legislations goals there are a number of specific areas where 
the bill as presently drafted create some problems we think it 
would be better to avoid 
unscrupulous penny stock brokers can evade sec banishment from 
the securities business by calling themselves promoters or 
consultants which the sec has no authority to regulate 
to close that loophole the bill would redefine who is a person 
associated with a broker or dealer breeden said the 
legislative language was too broad however and would force 
brokerdealers to register all their officers and other employees 
and maybe even their accountants and lawyers 
that point was supported by another witness john f guion 
president of the associated of publicly traded companies a group 
of 800 concerns whose stock is traded overthecounter 
breeden also criticized a provision to bar socalled blank 
check stock issues which seek investors money without a 
specific business plan or purpose and blind pool penny stocks 
which seek mergers and acquisitions in a specific industry or line 
of business 
what appears to be a simple solution could have costly and 
undesirable side effects breeden said noting that the provision 
could impose added responsibilities on the sec without additional 
resources 
he also said the provision could inhibit legitimate venture 
capital efforts in the real estate oil and gas exploration and 
equipment leasing industries 
rep matthew j rinaldo rnj the subcommittees ranking 
republican and a cosponsor of the bill expressed concerns about 
weakening the legislation 
we want a strong bill we want this practice to a halt said 
rinaldo adding and i dont think were going to be able to do 
it with a weakened piece of legislation 
breeden spent much of his testimony lobbying for passage of the 
securities law enforcement remedies act a market reform bill 
pending before the full house it would give the sec powers it 
never had before including the authority to impose civil fines of 
up to 500000 and halt alleged illegal activity without first 
obtaining a court order 
that bill would enhance the commissions enforcement power in 
all types of cases and they would prove especially valuable in 
combating penny stock fraud said breeden

in the spirit of 1776 a massachusetts 
company threatened with invasion by a british conglomerate has 
turned to the french for help 
norton co announced wednesday it had agreed to be bought by 
compagnie saintgobain one of the worlds leading glass makers 
for 18 billion or 90 a share 
the move averted a potentially debilitating siege by britains 
btr plc which earlier made a hostile takeover bid of 16 billion 
or 75 a share 
everybodys happy said eli lustgarten an analyst with the 
brokerage painewebber group inc an ongoing fight would be 
detrimental theyve put together an excellent deal 
norton had fought bitterly since btr launched its bid last month 
but in the end conceded it couldnt stand alone 
given the increasing risk of the worst alternative for all 
constituencies fighting a war of attrition only to be bought in 
the end by btr for an inadequate price with no protection for 
employees and the worcester community we have concluded that a 
negotiated merger is the best alternative chairman john s 
nelson said in a statement 
news of the agreement sent nortons stock sharply higher on the 
new york stock exchange the stock rose 1337 a share to 8862 
wednesday and was the most active issue on the exchange with more 
than 45 million shares traded 
under the deal norton will continue to operate under its name 
and keep its headquarters and principal manufacturing operations in 
worcester the companies said employee policies and benefits would 
continue at present levels and norton would retain a separate board 
of directors 
those were key factors for norton the company had claimed a btr 
takeover could have led to its dismemberment despite btrs denials 
saintgobain chairman jeanlouis beffa said he agreed to the 
deal to expand his companys us interests and because we did 
not want to see it norton dismembered or subjected to debt that 
would interfere with its strategic plans 
btr said it would withdraw its attempt to put three people on 
nortons board of directors but is extending its offer to may 3 
the extension is in case the deal with saintgobain merger goes 
sour said a btr spokesman in new york city who refused to give 
his name 
essentially were pleased by it the spokesman said of the 
higher bid were 49 percent shareholders of norton 
norton employees staged an impromptu rally in the company 
parking lot to celebrate their apparent escape from btr which they 
were convinced would have decimated the company 
the mood is great said tom morrison organizer of a group 
formed by employees to fight btrs bid employees had held rallies 
published a daily newsletter and lobbied for legislation to make a 
btr takeover more difficult 
were really proud of what we did things are really good 
hopefully btrs going away and this company were setting up with 
seems to be a very good move he said 
norton spokeswoman andrea priest said the merger appeared to be 
the best way out of the takeover battle 
saintgobain is a real strategic partner for norton aside 
from the fact that its offered a premium price for the company it 
understands nortons businesses it believes in research and 
development she said 
norton is a leading manufacturer of abrasives and engineering 
materials including advanced ceramics performance plastics and 
chemical process products it had 1989 sales of about 15 billion 
employs 16000 people and operates 113 plants in the us and 25 
other countries 
saintgobain produces a variety of flat glass fiber glass 
piping paper and wood products it has annual sales of more than 
11 billion employs 88000 people and operates 350 plants 
i think that its an ideal situation for norton and 
saintgobain said alvin donius an analyst with new yorkbased 
altman brenner wasserman there is great synergy technology 
research and development manufacturing the whole nine yards 
the merger requires the tender of at least twothirds of 
nortons common shares before april 30 
the announcement came a day after a federal judge ordered norton 
to reveal the amount of an offer the company said it received last 
week norton told the securities and exchange commission last 
friday that a third party was interested in buying norton for more 
money than btr

few people could have been more shocked than 
john oconnor when the st louis sun the morning tabloid that made 
its debut just seven months ago went out of business 
oconnor joined the suns staff a little over a week ago just 
long enough to rent an apartment and learn his way to work and 
was out on assignment when the newspapers editorinchief ralph 
ingersoll ii announced the papers closure in the newsroom 
wednesday 
i walked into a bar and i saw ralph ingersoll on tv 
oconnor said standing outside his newspapers downtown offices 
i said that looks like my boss im from the sun they said 
that is your boss youre out of a job 
oconnor who came to the sun from the bloomington ill 
pantagraph was one of 194 fulltime employees who were trying to 
recover from the shock that the sun is no more 
ingersoll who is chairman and chief executive officer of 
ingersoll publications co and has an interest in four other 
newspaper holding companies said his new tabloid couldnt generate 
enough singlecopy sales 
it had nothing to do with money it had to do and youll have 
to take me at my word for it with singlecopy sales said 
ingersoll who had moved to st louis to personally direct the rise 
of the new paper 
ingersoll said the sun had to sell most of its 100000 
newspapers via vending boxes or from racks in convenience stores 
and on street corners in order to survive 
instead it ended up with homedelivery sales outnumbering 
singlecopy sales twotoone that cost the paper which spent in 
excess of 25 million to start up an unexpected 5 million 
home delivery costs are higher because of the expenses of 
billing customers and hiring delivery people 
ingersoll decided sunday night to stop the presses and make 
wednesdays newspaper with the large frontpage headline 
deathly quiet the suns final edition 
after seven months and 213 editions the newspapers sudden 
death surprised everyone 
they read the handwriting on the wall the weather was 
good the cardinals were playing the blues were playing and people 
still werent buying the paper you dont have to be a brain 
surgeon to figure it out said kevin horrigan a popular 
columnist who jumped ship from the st louis postdispatch to join 
the sun 
in horrigans old newsroom postdispatch editor william woo 
said he was sorry about the demise of the sun 
the sun undertook a difficult mission and made a valiant 
effort which fell short woo said 
with a circulation of about 100000 the sun never threatened 
the postdispatchs huge circulation of 375000 daily and 565000 
on sunday 
but it did manage to generate a fair share of controversy in 
this conservative midwestern city 
the sun was criticized by some as sensationalizing stories for 
its coverage of a politician involved in a sexual assault and of 
the fiveyear anniversary of an accident in which a man was nearly 
sawed in two 
the newspaper also was chided for running photos of new womens 
swimsuits and lingerie 
but the sun was praised for its coverage of the effort to build 
a new domed stadium downtown and of the troubles facing st louis 
major air carrier trans world airlines 
ingersoll said he didnt know how much money he had lost on the 
sun he said the decision to close had nothing to do with longterm 
debt problems at another of his newspaper companies 
they have nothing to do with each other they are different 
companies he said 
on friday an offer by ingersoll to buy back much of the 240 
million of junk bonds issued by his community newspapers inc 
failed to attract a single bondholder if he cant arrange a 
buyback the interest rate on some of the bonds might have to be 
reset at an exorbitant level of more than 26 percent in june 
ingersoll extended the offer until may 4 and wednesday said he 
was considering raising his offer 
the st louis sun was owned by ingersoll newspapers inc which 
also owns 77 other newspapers in seven states ingersoll also has a 
stake in new haven newspapers inc which owns the new haven 
register ingersoll publications ltd which owns 29 newspapers in 
great britain and ingersoll publications co which is a newspaper 
management group

general motors corps announcement that it will 
move production of two sports cars to canada from california is 
antagonizing labor relations as contract negotiations draw near a 
union official says 
gm of canada announced wednesday that production of the new 
generation of the chevrolet camaro and the pontiac firebird or 
fcars would begin in ste therese quebec in 1992 for the 1993 
model year the cars now are made at gms van nuys calif plant 
since general motors clearly has sufficient capacity to build 
the fcar replacement in the united states we see no reason why it 
should not be built here said stephen yokich vice president of 
the united auto workers in charge of the unions gm department 
these annoncements are doing nothing to create a favorable 
environment for the difficult negotiating task we face later this 
year he said 
the uaw and the nations big three automakers begin bargaining 
in july on contracts to succeed agreements that expire sept 14 
workers at the ste therese plant are represented by the 
canadian auto workers union caw president bob white said the 
announcement was hopefully a measure of security for the future 
the ste therese plant now makes the chevrolet celebrity station 
wagon and the oldsmobile ciera both acars gm of canada spokesan 
d stewart low said wednesday the new camaro and firebird would be 
the only cars produced at the plant 
theres no question that the acar will leave ste therese 
he said in addition to ste therese gm now makes celebrity wagons 
and cieras at its plant in oklahoma city 
sales of camaros and firebirds first introduced in 1967 have 
been suffering this year like those of other gm cars through april 
20 camaro sales were down 35 percent compared with last year and 
firebird sales were off 396 percent 
the precise timing of the production move hasnt been set low 
said but it looks like were on target for a 93 model year 
launch 
he also said it was too early to tell if the change would alter 
the work force at the plant outside montreal 
there are about 3500 workers at the ste therese plant and 
about 3800 at the van nuys factory 
gm plans to change the van nuys plant to a flex plant or 
one that can make a variety of vehicles on the same assembly line 
such plants are used by japanese automakers but the move would be 
a significant break from gms past manufacturing practices 
it would be a facility capable of assembling a number of 
various models that would allow us to respond more quickly to the 
western market gm spokeswoman kathy tanner said in detroit she 
declined to say what kind of vehicles may be built there or how 
long it would take to convert the plant 
it would be flexible from the standpoint of being able to 
build a new van they are bringing out as well as some cars henry 
gonzalez united auto workers union region 6 assistant director 
said from southern california 
it wasnt known what kind of cars would be made at the flex 
plant sports cars and convertibles are extremely popular in the 
west along with sportutility vehicles and vans 
tanner said final approval for the flex plant hasnt been 
granted but said backers of the proposal were encouraged

the absence of a subcompact in chrysler corps 
lineup and a retreat from largescale fleet business are damaging 
the companys car sales and relief wont arrive before 1992 
analysts say 
sales at the nations no 3 automaker have fallen more than 
those for general motors corp and ford motor co the top two 
makers 
chairman lee iacocca acknowledged wednesday that chryslers 
absence in the subcompact market is hurting 
chrysler stopped making its dodge omni and plymouth horizon 
subcompacts feb 2 when it closed a plant in detroit it said sales 
of the socalled lcars were too slow they will be replaced by 
strippeddown versions of the plymouth sundance and dodge shadow 
codenamed pcars 
were taking a beating iacocca said in chicago the fifth 
stop of a sixcity road show to promote the companys vehicles 
we dropped the lcar we dont have the lowerpriced pcar 
ready for mass production for lots of reasons we got out of the 
rental car business there wasnt any money in it 
auto analyst david healy of barclaysbzw in new york agreed the 
absence of a subcompact is hurting sales but suggested less of an 
impact on the bottom line 
part of it is theyve discontinued omnihorizon so that takes 
units out but doesnt take profits out he said inexpensive cars 
carry a smaller profit margin than expensive vehicles 
auto analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc in 
new york said sales are depressed even without subcompacts 
there are two things operating in chrysler car sales she 
said they dropped the omnihorizon the other is that iacocca 
has said that with the fleet business having gotten so ferocious 
that chrysler has pulled back from that 
healy estimated that 15 percent to 20 percent of the industrys 
sales volume so far this year has been in fleet sales to rental car 
companies police agencies taxi companies and large corporations 
all of that has dented the companys car sales figures but 
sales of light trucks which comprise about 55 percent of 
chryslers us sales remain at fairly strong levels given the 
current general sales slump 
through april 20 of this year chryslers north americanmade 
trucks were selling at a rate 5 percent slower than during the same 
time last year sales of trucks made by ford were down 45 percent 
while gms truck sales were up 29 percent 
sales of chryslers north americanmade cars were down 167 
percent while sale of ford cars were off 114 percent and gm cars 
were down 57 percent 
sales of usmade cars carrying japanese companies nameplates 
were up 202 percent 
in his road show and on television advertisements iacocca has 
said chrysler deserves a break he contends chryslers quality is 
at least as good as that of the japanese cars and that americans 
should head to dealerships to find out 
but dealers arent seeing big increases in customers in their 
showrooms 
we had a good month last month but its a little slow now 
john johnson sales manager and coowner of dodge of kingfisher in 
kingfisher okla said wednesday for four or five years its 
been hard to put two good months together

frank lorenzo one union member was injured 
scuffles broke out when eastern workers crossed the machinists 
picket lines during a 3 pm shift change wednesday hundreds of 
union members were marching outside eastern corporate headquarters

dozens of metrodade county and miami springs police officers 
waded into the crowd one union member his head bleeding after 
apparently being hit by a nightstick was taken away for treatment 
in a metro rescue vehicle 
all he did was call a scab what he is a scab said charles

officers on horseback clubbed the unidentified union member 
thats unconscionable bryan said 
metrodade police spokeswoman lizette williams said two union

how will newspapers survive in a world where 
fewer and fewer people read them 
will there be enough literate people to care 
a fittingly upbeat walt disney co chairman michael eisner said 
everything was going to be just fine alvin toffler author of 
future shock said the answers lie in fusing education with the 
media 
but for those assembled wednesday at the american newspaper 
publishers associations 104th annual meeting one of the most 
compelling statements during a panel discussion titled a look at 
the future came from lew allen director of nasas jet propulsion 
lab 
there is a very large segment of our country that is not 
influenced by the la times or television news because by 
anyones definition they are functionally illiterate 
the panel discussion with tv newswoman diane sawyer as 
moderator also included john malone director of denverbased 
telecommunications inc the nations largest cable systems 
operator and john seely brown a vice president of the xerox 
research center 
the 90minute discussion touched on myriad issues confronting 
the future of print journalism from dwindling readership to the 
proliferation of giantcorporation mergers 
are we talking about a limited number of huge corporations 
controlling everything in this country and are you going to buy cbs 
or what sawyer asked eisner the disney chairman did not answer 
the second part of the question despite widespread speculation that 
his studio was interested in purchasing the bottomranked tv 
network 
it takes huge corporations to compete in a world market 
eisner replied but do i think it was necessary for time to buy 
warners to compete no i think that was a fabrication of the 
moment 
asked by sawyer to give a headline for the upcoming decade 
malone joked murdoch stripped of us citizenship and 
president turner cites first amendment abuses 
futurist toffler was more political and slightly more ambitious 
speculating that japan and the us form an integrated economic 
and political system 
and on the subject of whether computer networks will someday 
provide news at the touch of a key and thereby replace newspapers 
allen said the interest of people in reading in our society is 
declining the great difficulty is how do we get people to be 
interested in information getting the technology there is easy

consumers apparently have generally accepted a 
new federal label for lean beef since the agriculture department 
carved it out more than two years ago 
the new labeling took effect in november 1987 after consumer and 
industry people petitioned usda for a name change in official 
federal beef grading said jimmy wise of the departments 
agricultural marketing service 
consumers told us they wanted a more positive description of 
leaner meat available in grocery stores and they got it wise 
said wednesday 
the change involved scrapping the 60yearold usda good 
label and substituting a new lean label on supermarket cuts 
many nutritionconscious consumers wanted the name change 
because they felt the good label misled buyers into thinking 
the beef was mediocre when the label was established in the 1920s 
it described the amount of fat or marbling in a cut of beef 
the consumer view was that less fat was more healthful and that 
the good label wasnt descriptive 
a consumer organization public voice for food and health 
policy petitioned usda in june 1986 to change the name from 
good to select the change also endorsed by a dozen other 
consumer and health groups went into effect in november 1987 
the push to a select beef grade also was supported by the 
cattle and meat packing industries including the american meat 
institute national cattlemens association and the american farm 
bureau federation 
wise said the select grade was adopted as the result of a 
welcome coalition between industry and consumers moreover he 
saidselect beef is selling well 
that wouldnt be happening if people werent happy with it 
wise said industry is responding by providing more leaner beef 
for grading and more retailers are beginning to carry the 
product 
in the three months prior to the official name change only 
49714 pounds or 17 percent of all graded beef qualified as 
good by the fourth quarter of 1989 the select label 
accounted for 433413 pounds or 143 percent of all graded beef 
according to agency records 
since the 1920s usda has provided eight grades and standards to 
beef quality those are prime choice good now select 
standard commercial utility cutter and canner 
federal grading by usda is a voluntary service that is requested 
by packers and paid for by user fees 
it is designed to help assure the industry and consumers of 
uniform standards for a variety of commodities other than beef and 
cattle including cotton dairy products fruit other livestock 
mohair poultry rabbits shell eggs tobacco vegetables and wool

a house agriculture subcommittee has approved 
a foreign trade section of the 1990 farm bill that would allow food 
giveaways to needy countries 
the legislation is similar to the senate measure on foreign 
trade approved in committee earlier this month the farm bill will 
set agriculture policy for the next five years 
an aide to the house committee said the major difference between 
the two bills is the way the food aid programs would be managed 
within the government 
both bills would allow the president to give food to countries 
whose governments he wants to encourage like those of eastern 
europe currently such assistance must be in the form of a sale 
the bills also allow the united states to forgive the debts of 
financially strapped countries trying to restructure their economic 
programs 
both the house and the senate followed bush administration 
recommendations in writing their bills 
ann veneman the agriculture departments deputy undersecretary 
for international affairs and commodity programs said the chief 
difference the administration has with either bill is in the 
language dealing with the export enhancement program 
under the program exporters collect bonuses or subsidies for 
sales of certain products to designated countries the program is 
used to reduce the prices of us commodities in order to meet 
foreign competition 
the senate bill says usda must spend at least 900 million in 
fiscal 1991 on the program the house versions requires that 500 
million be spent but the administration does not want any specific 
dollar amount named 
its a trade policy tool said veneman she said the amount 
spent should be the prerogative of the administration

the agriculture department says a record 
492000 acres of national forest land were replanted to trees last 
year 
forest service chief f dale robertson said wednesday the 
acreage was the most since the national forest system was created 
in 1905 
robertson said last years effort was due in part to 
rehabilitation work in areas burned by the major wildfires of 1987 
in california oregon and washington and to high levels of 
reforestation in areas of 198688 timber harvests in the national 
forests 
of the total area reforested in the fiscal year that ended last 
sept 30 about 307000 acres were directly seeded or planted to 
trees the remaining 185000 acres were reforested through natural 
regeneration by seed falling from nearby trees onto areas prepared 
by the forest service or through sprouting 
robertson said the previous record was 434000 acres reforested 
in 1980 an estimated 460000 acres will be reforested this fiscal 
year he said

harcourt brace jovanovich inc has 
confirmed that discussions are underway for the possible sale of 
part of its business 
the announcement wednesday followed months of denials from the 
giant publisher that its assets were for sale in an effort to 
reduce the companys 15 billion debt 
but peter jovanovich president and chief executive officer 
said in a statement that the orlandobased corporation is not for 
sale 
instead he said the company has begun preliminary talks 
involving the sale of some or all of its existing debt at a 
discount or the purchase of certain assets of the company by a 
third party 
it is simply premature to speculate as to whether a 
transaction will occur and if one does occur as to its eventual 
form or terms he said 
the statement was released hours after a report that former us 
sen eugene mccarthy who has served for a decade on hbjs board 
said the company had held talks for a month with thomson corp of 
canada 
hbj is saddled with debt and its textbook business does not 
generate enough income to meet its future obligations within three 
years the publisher is to start paying hundreds of millions of 
dollars annually in dividends and interest to bondholders 
hbj incurred the debts through a recapitalization that fought 
off a hostile takeover in 1987 
thomson in turn has been seeking publishing assets last year 
the company had sales of 51 billion from operations involving 
educational medical and scientific books as well as newspapers 
mccarthy said he didnt know when a sale might occur 
theres no conclusion in sight he said its a question 
of what kind of pressure were under 
in the past week hbj stock has risen 25 percent on speculation 
that the company was discussing a sale to thomson 
hbj common stock closed wednesday at 4 unchanged from tuesday 
the stock was one of the most actively traded issues on the new 
york stock exchange with more than 3 million shares changing hands 
analysts were not surprised to hear that hbjs debt might force 
the sale of additional assets in the last three years hbj has 
sold its theme parks its magazines and its book clubs 
sometimes the generator just cant generate said ivan 
obolensky who follows hbj for the josephthal amp co brokerage in 
new york its a shame but they have to make some adjustments 
hbj has said it wanted to refinance its debt possibly extending 
it so interest payments on the bonds are less onerous but the 
company may have found that it cannot refinance any debt until it 
presents creditors with cash 
the company is under a lot of pressure the stock and bonds 
are way down and it has been blasted in the media recently said 
bert boksen who follows hbj for the raymond james amp associates 
brokerage in st petersburg fla

the costs of the exxon valdez oil spill 
should be measured not only in dead otters and oiled birds but in 
neglected children broken families and shaken communities 
environmentalists said in a report 
the report timed for release on the day of the annual exxon 
shareholder meeting in houston includes comments by more than 120 
alaskans from hearings held by a citizens commission in november at 
cordova kodiak old harbor homer and anchorage 
the human impacts of the oil spill have largely been ignored 
but theyre continuing doug miller director of the national 
wildlife federations alaska office said wednesday 
the federation was one of the sponsors of the report which 
criticizes exxon for ignoring the human costs of the march 24 
1989 spill and calls on it to help pay for social services 
exxon spokesman jim robertson in anchorage said company 
officials had not had time to read the report to respond to it 
members of the citizens commission said residents around the 
sound reported increased alcoholism domestic violence child abuse 
and neglect 
it certainly wasnt just a wildlife disaster said 
conservationist celia hunter people were totally torn out of 
their whole way of life its a catastrophe like a hurricane 
many in the affected communities made money from the cleanup 
boom receiving high wages from exxon to scrub beaches but 
such spillionaires created envy and anger in the communities 
the commission visited hunter said 
native communities living off the land were hit particularly 
hard the report said 
commission member ralph eluska president of the akhiokkaguyak 
native corporation said akhiok villagers still were afraid of 
catching and eating seafood activities at the center of their 
communal life and cleaning up beaches he said has been a 
frustrating substitute for fishing 
the state reported wednesday that 80 percent of the shoreline 
sites inspected by a team preparing this seasons cleanup of the 
exxon valdez spill still have oil on them 
most of the 481 sites surveyed in prince william sound and the 
gulf of alaska were lightly or very lightly oiled while 12 percent 
were moderately oiled and 6 percent heavily oiled the alaska 
department of environmental conservation reported 
the survey was conducted this month by state and federal 
agencies exxon and alaska native landowners the groups 
conclusions will be used to help determine what kind of treatment 
should be applied to the beaches this summer 
there is still a lot of oil present either on the surface or 
beneath it and we need to choose the right tools and stick with 
them until the job is done said department commissioner dennis 
kelso 
exxon is preparing its final cleanup plan to be released 
friday but spokesman fred davis said exxon was not terribly 
surprised by the states figures because the sites that we went 
to are the ones that all parties agreed had the highest probability 
of having oil 
the interagency group expects to survey a total 617 sites before 
its project is completed at the end of the month 
the state has said it cant approve bioremediation the use of 
fertilizer to boost naturally occurring oileating bacteria at 
cleanup sites until it receives reports from the environmental 
protection agency on the fertilizers toxicity 
davis said bioremediation will be a major part of the 
companys work program

xerox corp on thursday reported a 
firstquarter loss of 254 million or 293 per share stemming 
from its interest in a struggling chicagobased real estate 
investment firm 
otherwise the company reported good growth in its document 
processing business and a slump in earnings from its financial 
services division that it attributed to the weak market for 
property and casualty insurance 
the stamfordbased business products and financial services 
company announced earlier this year that it had taken a 400 
million pretax writeoff due to its investment in vms realty 
partners a chicago real estate investment firm after taxes the 
writeoff totaled 375 million xerox said 
even without the writeoff xerox earnings from continuing 
operations in the first three months of the year slumped to 121 
million or 106 per share from 158 million or 147 a share 
in the same period of 1989 
the company said its document processing division which 
includes its copier business earned 110 million on revenue of 
31 billion up from 91 million on 28 billion in revenue in the

billion down from 67 on revenue of 13 billion in the same 
period a year ago 
david t kearns xeroxs chairman and chief executive officer 
said the growth in document processing earnings and revenues were 
particularly encouraging in light of the soft market for business 
products 
but he said those gains were more than offset within our 
continuing operations by substantial weakness in the property and 
casualty insurance business and lower capital gains

ual corp chairman stephen m wolf pledged 
today to manage united airlines parent company as aggressively as 
he can while its employees try to accomplish their 438 billion 
buyout 
wolf the companys chairman since late 1987 is likely to be 
replaced by uniteds three labor unions if they succeed in getting 
the financing for their 201pershare bid which uals board has 
accepted 
separately ual reported a first quarter loss of 364 million 
on revenue of 219 billion compared with a profit of 6544 
million on sales of 204 billion in the yearago period 
i want you to know that i will continue to manage the company 
in as aggressive a fashion as possible wolf said in remarks 
prepared for todays annual shareholders meeting 
wolf said uals board and management are committed to using 
these next few months to deliver the strongest possible united 
airlines to its new owners 
he said he was opposed in principle to any group borrowing 
money to buy an airline given the cyclical nature of the business 
and the enormous capital investments required in the industry 
but he said that if leveraging is inevitable as it was in 
this case i believe the preferable course to be employee 
ownership 
wolf reportedly fought the employee buyout plan behind the 
scenes but ultimately relented the board had to choose between 
selling the nations secondlargest airline to its 71000 employees 
or facing a proxy fight with uals largest shareholder coniston 
partners that could have ousted the companys directors

the labor department will expedite new safety 
requirements for the petrochemical industry in an effort to prevent 
disasters such as last years phillips explosion that killed 23 
workers in texas the agency said today in a report to president 
bush 
the occupational safety and health administration said its 
investigation of last octobers blast which injured another 130 
workers demonstrated the need for mandatory safety procedures at 
plants that store and use highly flammable liquids and chemicals 
the investigation of the phillips catastrophe has caused osha 
to take stock and consider a strong course of action to prevent 
such disasters the report to bush said 
osha said that by the end of the summer it would propose 
requirements that employers implement socalled chemical process 
safety management plans 
those plans would include analyzing hazards to employees 
training workers on safety and developing emergency response 
procedures said assistant labor secretary gerard scannell who 
heads osha 
scannell said that most firms in the petrochemical industry 
already use such fundamental safety procedures but oshas new 
rules would make them mandatory 
osha also will consider revising the way it sets priorities for 
inspections and devoting more attention to the petrochemical 
industry scannell said 
last week osha proposed a 57 million fine against phillips 66 
co for alleged safety violations at the plant oshas 
investigation showed that four highly flammable gases escaped from 
an open valve forming a huge vapor cloud that traveled through the 
pasadena texas plant within seconds because of high pressure 
a series of explosions occurred after the cloud came in contact 
with an unidentified ignition source 
contrary to phillips own procedures as well as standard 
industry practice there was no backup protection such as a double 
valve to protect against valve failure or protect against an 
untimely valve opening scannell said

motorists are losing more than 150 million a 
year at gas stations that sell lowoctane gas at highoctane 
prices and the federal government is doing little to stop it a 
congressional report said today 
the general accounting office said a twoyear study which 
included random testing of retail gasoline in four states showed 
widespread mislabeling of gasoline octane levels 
the gao estimated that about 9 percent of gasoline sold 
nationwide is mislabeled it said that more than half the samples 
taken in two large cities last year detroit and st louis were 
found to have octane ratings an average of 22 or more points below 
what was posted on the pump 
what this adds up to is a quiet but dangerous shellgame for 
consumers said rep charles e schumer dny who asked for 
the study along with rep phillip sharp dind 
higher octane gas can prevent damaging engine knock and affect 
the performance of some cars 
in some instances gas stations were pumping all their gas out 
of the same tank but selling it as having different octane ratings 
said sharp chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
on energy and power sharp said he would introduce legislation to 
give states more enforcement powers over octane cheats 
a consumer could be paying several cents a gallon extra for 
quality that is not delivered sharp told a news conference 
releasing the report 
david morehead spokesman for the petroleum marketers 
association of america said there have been scattered reports of 
octane cheating but it is absolutely deplored in the industry 
we say go after the cheaters and get them morehead said 
noting that the vast majority of retailers who follow the law are 
hurt by operators who take extra profits by charging premium prices 
for regular gas 
a 1978 law requires the federal trade commission and the 
environmental protection agency to enforce compliance with federal 
petroleum marketing practices but the gao study said the agencies 
citing lack of funds have not carried out testing since 1981 
the federal law requires uniform yellow and black octane labels 
on all gasoline pumps violators may be fined up to 10000 for 
each instance 
mislabeling has been minimal in states that conduct their own 
tests said the report by congresss investigative arm 
but in nontesting states visited by gao investigators problems 
were found mainly at the distribution and retail levels the 
report said onetime testing was conducted in michigan missouri 
oregon and tennessee gao said and investigators also looked at 
indiana montana and washington 
federal standards say regular unleaded gas must have an octane 
rating of 87 while midgrade gasolines have ratings of from 89 to 
91 and super or premium grades have ratings of 92 to 94 the 
difference in retail price between the lowest and highest grade 
ranges up to 20 cents

share on sales of 284 billion compared with 317 million or 95

the parent companies of usair and united airlines reported 
firstquarter losses thursday while delta air lines said its 
profit for the latest quarter dropped 63 percent 
ual corp parent of united said it lost 364 million or 
168 a share in the three months ended march 31 primarily due to 
the settlement of several lawsuits involving its computer 
reservation system 
without a charge against earnings of 775 million due to the 
settlement earnings would have been 102 million or 47 cents a 
share the chicagobased company said ual reported earnings of 
654 million or 303 a share for the first quarter of 1989 
ual reported firstquarter operating revenue of 25 billion 
compared with 23 billion for the same period last year 
although we achieved a slight profit for the quarter after 
excluding the onetime charge for settlement of lawsuits we are 
nevertheless disappointed by these results said ual chairman 
stephen m wolf 
he said higher fuel costs contributed to the companys poor 
showing 
ual in march settled a lawsuit filed by continental airlines and 
several other carriers accusing united of unfair competition in the 
computerized reservations business the lawsuits filed in 1985 
contended united illegally monopolized or attempted to monopolize 
the computer reservations business or the air transportation 
business in various markets 
continental owned by texas air corp had sought 336 million 
in damages arguing that united programmed its computer 
reservations system to unfairly favor united flights over its 
competitors 
on april 10 uals board approved a 438 billion buyout bid for 
the airline by its unions 
usair group the parent of usair reported a firstquarter loss 
of 38 million or 105 a share blaming it on higher fuel prices 
and the fact that the peak easter travel period fell in this years 
second quarter 
usair group based in arlington va earned 16 million or 35 
cents a share in 1989s first quarter 
firstquarter 1990 revenue totaled 154 billion up from 148 
billion for the same period a year earlier 
traffic levels through the first quarter were up 85 percent 
slightly ahead of our projections usair chairman and president 
edwin i colodny said despite relatively strong passenger 
traffic revenue continues to be on the weak side 
colodny said several factors boosted last years first quarter 
hurting the comparison with the first quarter of this year a 
strike against eastern airlines that began in early march 1989 and 
the peak easter travel period falling in march last year and april 
this year 
atlantabased delta air lines inc blamed sharply increased fuel 
costs for its lower earnings in its third fiscal quarter on sharply 
increased fuel costs 
profit totaled 3131 million or 48 cents a share for the 
three months ended march 31 down from 8502 million or 173 a 
share in the same period last year operating revenue rose 4 
percent to 212 billion from 204 billion 
higher fuel prices outweighed strong business traffic fare 
increases and increased cargo revenue said thomas j roeck senior 
vice president for finance 
roeck also cited the timing of easter and the start of the 
eastern strike in last years first quarter as factors that made it 
difficult to match the results of a year earlier eastern is a 
major competitor of delta at atlanta where both airlines have 
their main hubs 
for the nine months ended march 31 delta said its net income 
was 22869 million or 415 a share down 15 percent from 27014 
million or 549 a share during the same period a year earlier 
revenue rose 10 percent to 634 billion from 578 billion

stockholders of food and tobacco giant 
philip morris cos inc overwhelmingly rejected two resolutions 
thursday aimed against the companys core cigarette products but 
supporters of the proposals claimed a symbolic victory 
we feel we accomplished a great deal getting that kind of a 
vote the rev michael crosby said after his proposal calling for 
philip morris to get out of tobacco by the end of the century got 
22 percent of the vote at the companys annual shareholders 
meeting 
another resolution calling on philip morris to study the impact 
of its promotions and advertising on teenage smoking failed with 
only 35 percent support 
the point is we got our issue across said crosby who 
fought a twoyear legal battle to get his resolution on the agenda 
for the meeting at philip morris huge cigarette manufacturing 
plant here 
hamish maxwell chairman and chief executive officer of the new 
yorkbased company said he could not envision philip morris 
without tobacco despite growing concerns about the effects of 
smoking on health and the companys extensive forays into other 
consumer products 
philip morris has operations that include kraft foods and miller 
beer but tobacco is our core business maxwell said 
the dissident shareholders said their resolutions addressed 
profits as well as social concerns 
this company is going sooner or later to be liable for its 
actions said crosby a catholic priest who works for the 
interfaith center on corporate responsibility in new york we are 
going to lose in the long run 
maxwell acknowledged that cigarettes are our most 
controversial product but said the company has acted responsibly 
to health concerns in its development of reduced tar and nicotine 
cigarettes he also said warnings about the dangers of smoking are 
widely publicized 
crosby pressed maxwell to admit that smoking and sickness have a 
direct link but maxwell said medical research has not gone that 
far 
you weasel out of it every time crosby said 
im not weaseling out of anything maxwell said 
according to company figures philip morris sold 580 billion 
cigarettes in 1989 including 78 billion cigarettes for export its 
marlboro brand is the us leader with 26 percent of the market and 
has 55 percent of the companys overseas tobacco sales 
dr alan blum founder of the augusta gabased doc news and 
views a publication that bills itself as a journal of medical 
activism said marlboro and other philip morris brands are 
responsible for most of the 13 million people who take up smoking 
each year many of them teenagers 
maxwell however said overall cigarette consumption dropped 
about 3 percent in the united states last year and was stable 
abroad the companys increased profits from tobacco resulted from 
taking away business from competitors among adults who already 
smoke he said 
we do not aim our marketing efforts to minors he said in 
fact we take active steps to discourage youths from smoking 
one shareholder who did not identify himself drew applause from 
the approximately 300 shareholders at the meeting when he said i 
think these proposals are utter bunk people can freely choose to 
smoke or not smoke he said 
we arent free when were addicted like me to cigarettes 
said crosby

notebooks were tossed in the trash and job 
postings were tacked on the bulletin board thursday at the st 
louis sun the new metropolitan newspaper that abruptly stopped 
publishing after only seven months of business 
the newspaper didnt publish a farewell edition its last 
newspaper the 213th edition appeared wednesday morning 
the sudden demise came as a shock to employees readers 
newspaper analysts and others and it also underscored the nagging 
slowdown that has hit the newspaper industry 
local and national newspaper advertising around the country grew 
just 4 percent last year its smallest increase in more than five 
years according to figures provided by the american newspaper 
publishers association daily newspaper circulation has been 
stagnant at about 62 million for a decade and its been declining 
the past two years 
about the only thing going well for newspaper publishers is that 
the price of newsprint is about 23 percent lower than last year 
the newspaper market is in turmoil said ralph ingersoll ii 
chairman and chief executive officer of ingersoll publications co 
and editorinchief of the sun this is at least the third such 
crisis i have personally lived through 
but ingersoll who personally directed the creation of the sun 
which debuted sept 25 1989 said he didnt know what role the 
industrywide troubles played in determining the suns fate 
i think it had a direct impact said kenneth berents a 
stock analyst in baltimore with alex brown amp sons inc its tough 
enough to do a startup but its almost impossible to do in a bad 
climate like this 
when he first set out to bring a second daily newspaper to st 
louis to compete with the 111yearold st louis postdispatch 
ingersoll said he hoped his effort would help invigorate the 
newspaper industry 
and even though the sun didnt make it he hasnt ruled out the 
possibility of trying it again somewhere else no one else is going 
to try it thats for sure why 
first of all ingersoll was a maverick and there arent many 
mavericks around second of all this is a very unfriendly 
environment for newspapers right now said lisa donneson a stock 
analyst in new york for county natwest usa 
at a wednesday news conference ingersoll said the reason the 
sun didnt last longer was its failure to sell enough newspapers 
out of vending boxes and newspaper racks in stores 
ingersoll expected to sell most of the newspapers on a 
singlecopy basis but soon after the paper started homedelivery 
sales outnumbered singlecopy sales by a twotoone margin 
that cost the sun 5 million more than planned ingersoll said 
the newspaper had spent more than 25 million to start up but he 
said he didnt know how much of that would be recoverable 
thursday in the sun newsroom where windows overlook the gateway 
arch and clocks tell what time it is in tokyo some of the 
newspapers 194 fulltime employees cleaned out their desks and 
pondered the future 
some showed up in white shirts and ties and talked about job 
interviews they had just returned from some still peppered their 
sentences with words like shocked and stunned and some 
talked about thursdays softball game the first of the season 
were going to play as far as i know said the suns 
business editor dan kadlec who was in the office with his wife and 
fivemonthold daughter he left a job at usa today and moved to 
st louis from new york to work for the sun i havent even 
unpacked he said 
some reporters said they were upset that ingersoll didnt give 
the sun more time to prove itself and more notice of the 
newspapers collapse they said the consensus in the office was 
that they had two years to try to make it 
i knew that this newspaper might not be around after 
twoandahalf years but i didnt think he would pull the plug so 
soon said ellen whitford a general assignment reporter who came 
to the sun from virginia 
im going to start applying for jobs but the markets pretty 
bad so i guess you could say i feel pretty grim at the moment 
she said 
ingersoll said all employees would be given at least 12 weeks 
severance pay and efforts would be made to find them jobs at other 
newspapers in the ingersoll chain more than a dozen job listings 
are already on the office bulletin boards 
meetings were scheduled for monday and tuesday to discuss 
parting benefits

activity was moderate on wall street where some traders marked 
time ahead of potentially marketmoving economic data due friday 
anxiety about possible interest rate hikes ahead also kept 
investors on the sidelines 
the market got off to a promising start but by late morning the 
broadly based advance bogged down as prices of longterm government

value in afternoon trading bringing their yields back above 9

worried about heavy volatility on the tokyo 
stock exchange japanese market officials have been pressing to 
limit us sales of securities pegged to tokyos bellwether nikkei 
stock index 
they have made their concerns aware to us said bob 
shabazian a spokesman for the american stock exchange where eight 
nikkei put and call warrants trade 
the warrants which some have been blamed for adding to the 
tokyo exchanges volatility are used as a hedge against movements 
in the 225share nikkei index 
the warrants give their holders the right to purchase or sell 
the cash equivalent of the nikkei index at a certain price on a 
certain date put warrants give the right to sell and call warrants 
the right to buy 
speculators also use the warrants to bet on the direction of the 
market for example buying put warrants if they believe the nikkei 
will decline as a result the value of put warrants rises as the 
nikkei falls 
since january the nikkei has plunged nearly 30 percent in 
value raising the demand among investors in the united states and 
elsewhere for the warrants 
in january the kingdom of denmark became the first issuer to 
list nikkei put warrants on the amex since then a number of us 
investment houses have followed suit including goldman sachs amp 
co painewebber group inc and salomon inc 
but american investment houses have agreed to voluntarily halt 
issuing further warrants at the request of japanese officials 
a spokesperson for salomon said the firm is not going to issue 
any additional warrants without the approval of japanese 
authorities 
shabazian said discussions between amex and japanese stock 
exchange officials over the warrants have been ongoing even before 
denmark launched the first 
we have an informationsharing agreement with the 
japanese shabazian said but he added weve had no formal 
request from them to limit trading in the options 
in what some market watchers believe could be the last issue for 
some time the financing and export credit institute of the 
norwegian commercial banks ltd issued 75 million warrants and 
raised about 28 million on thursday the transaction was managed 
by goldman sachs 
a spokesman goldman sachs noted that having just completed a 
deal were not currently considering another but he added the 
firm always would respect the direction of the american stock 
exchange and by extension the tokyo stock exchange 
existing warrants would continue to trade until their 
expiration the norwegian warrants for example expire in 1993

some service stations pass off regular 
gasoline as higherpriced super premium according to a 
congressional study thursday that said octane cheating may be 
costing motorists 150 million a year 
the report by the general accounting office estimated that 9 
percent of gasoline sold nationwide is mislabeled by half an octane 
number or more and in several states where pump testing has 
actually proven mislabeling the federal government has done little 
to stop the deception the report said 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said motorists who 
think they are buying premium grades may be losing 150 million a 
year 
but rep philip r sharp dind who along with rep charles 
schumer dny released the report said the study was 
conservative and losses could reach as high as 600 million through 
growing mislabeling of octane ratings at the pump 
sharps estimate is based partly on the fact that the gao said 
that more than half the samples taken in two large cities last year 
detroit and st louis were found to have octane ratings an 
average of 22 or more points below what was posted on the pump 
unfortunately consumers cannot determine octane ratings 
visually or in other ways that allow them to know if they are 
getting what they are paying for the gao said 
federal law requires that uniform yellow and black labels on gas 
pumps show the octane rating of gas and some higherpowered 
vehicles recommend various levels of octane to avoid that unhealthy 
ping or knocking sound in engines 
a low octane gas can reduce engine efficiency mileage and 
emissions in highpowered engines the gao said 
regular unleaded gas is rated at 87 with midgrade unleaded at 
89 and premium grades from 91 to 94 regular leaded gas is rated at 
89 
the difference in retail price between the lowest and highest 
grade can range up to 20 cents a gallon 
a consumer could be paying several cents a gallon extra for 
quality that is not delivered said sharp who is chairman of the 
house energy and commerce subcommittee on energy and power 
sharp said he would introduce legislation to give states more 
enforcement power over octane cheaters 
the report said inspectors found in several states that some 
retail stations were selling gasoline from the same storage tank 
that was rated at different octane levels 
at other stations 87octane unleaded regular gasoline was being 
sold as leaded regular which should have an 89 rating because the 
wholesale price for unleaded was lower the report said 
what this adds up to is a quiet but dangerous shellgame for 
consumers schumer said 
a 1978 law requires the federal trade commission and the 
environmental protection agency to enforce compliance with federal 
petroleum marketing practices but the gao study said the agencies 
have not carried out testing since 1981 
the report said both agencies generally support the gaos 
conclusions and cite lack of funding and staff for their failure to 
enforce the labeling rules violators may be fined up to 10000 
for each instance 
joe koach executive director of the 60000member service 
station dealers of america said he was deeply chagrined because 
this broadbrushes the integrity of americas gasoline marketers 
legitimate dealers would not risk their franchises with major 
oil companies by cheating and the organization supports stringent 
enforcement against octane cheaters koach said 
david morehead spokesman for the petroleum marketers 
association of america said there have been scattered reports of 
cheating but it is absolutely deplored in the industry 
nearly half of the states conduct their own octane tests and 
mislabeling has been minimal where testing acts as a deterrent the 
gao study said 
but in seven nontesting states visited by gao investigators 
problems were found mainly at the distribution and retail levels 
the report said frequent octane mislabeling was found in onetime 
tests conducted in michigan missouri oregon and tennessee gao 
said and investigators also found concern about octane cheating 
from officials interviewed in indiana montana and washington 
in 1989 michigan tests conducted primarily in detroit 519 
percent of stations had inflated ratings averaging 23 octane 
points and in st louis 526 percent had mislabeled an average of 
22 points the report said 
in 1988 tests conducted by oregon officials 218 percent of 
samples were mislabeled and in tennessee 222 percent the gao said 
states that test generally consider any mislabeling of onehalf 
point or more in the octane rating as a significant violation the 
gao said 
states which conduct their own tests and enforcement are 
alabama arkansas california colorado delaware florida 
georgia illinois iowa louisinaa maryland massachusetts 
missouri new york north carolina north dakota oklahoma south 
carolina south dakota tennessee virginia and wisconsin 
missouri and tennessee began testing after the gao inspections 
were conducted michigan new york and washington plan to begin 
octane testing according to sharp

country will not have a lot of soybeans to export 
the concern of europeans over delays in south american 
shipments may step up their interest in the us market he said 
karlin also said concerns about the possibility of 
hotterthannormal temperatures through the summer also fueled 
speculation in soybeans that concern was sparked by the 10day 
national weather service forecast released wednesday that calls for 
hotter and drierthannormal weather

those prices higher

commodity exchange

silver said jerry rothman an analyst with elders futures inc

a housing developer on thursday announced plans 
to build an americanstyle suburban residential complex in moscow 
to meet the needs of foreign businessmen frustrated by the soviet 
unions scarce and lowquality housing 
the 130million project will bring a taste of western comfort 
to 80 acres of rolling land near two villages of log cabins on the 
northwest outskirts of moscow according to chris senie secretary 
of senie kerschner international housing ltd 
the project is a joint venture with a collective farm adjacent 
to the site the land is being leased from the collective farm 
the first of the 528 townhouse units are to be completed in 
1991 the development will include amenities such as an indoor 
swimming pool a medical clinic a gymnasium and stores senie said 
the units will rent for about 50000 a year on sixyear leases 
which is comparable to the costs foreign companies pay for 
comparable housing if they can find any available senie said 
although the complex will have guard patrols and its stores will 
accept only hard currency the developers dont want it to be a 
foreign ghetto twenty percent of the units are to be occupied 
by soviet employees of foreign companies 
senie said residents of the adjacent villages will be allowed to 
use the athletic facilities at times and they will have free access 
to a lake that borders the project 
theres no question the project is going to impact their lives 
greatly he said 
the developers also are assisting the collective farm in 
completing a 60acre greenhouse complex senie said 
companies that have reserved units at the complex include 
british airways nichimen of japan and philips of the netherlands 
senie said eighty percent of the units will be rented for hard 
currency and the units for soviets will be rented in rubles 
the construction is to be managed by finnstroi of finland 
using soviet materials where possible and 70 percent soviet 
workers senie said construction costs work out to about 90 a 
square foot building such a development in the united states costs 
about 72 a square foot he said 
zane yost the projects architect said he hopes the 
threestory clapboardstyle buildings will demonstrate the latest 
housing techniques to the soviets 
that he said could be a reparation for unfortunate housing 
ideas that the soviets once learned from the united states he said 
he asked a soviet official one time why so much of the countrys 
postwar housing was in concrete highrise buildings the official 
replied because americans told us to do it that way

proposals to cut pentagon aircraft programs would 
hurt boeing co and some of its suppliers although its too early 
to tell how badly officials of the aircraft company said thursday 
defense secretary dick cheney on thursday outlined to congress 
proposed cuts aimed at saving 348 billion through 1997 partly by 
purchasing fewer b2 stealth bombers and delaying the start of 
production of advanced tactical fighters 
boeing already has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in 
the two programs 
the company is a major subcontractor to northrop corp on the 
b2 with 10000 employees in the seattle area working on the 
project its the largest program for boeing military airplanes and 
one of the most significant for the entire aerospace company said 
military airplanes spokesman john kvasnosky 
boeing also has 850 seattle employees working on an atf 
prototype it is developing with lockheed corp and general dynamics 
i cant speculate in any detail as to what the longer term 
effects would be if cheneys plans for the b2 are adopted 
kvasnosky said however it would mean that we would not 
recognize the buildup and growth we had anticipated when we set out 
to do this he said 
obviously it will have a financial impact on all the 
suppliers 
boeing corporate spokesman russ young said the company was 
examining what effects cheneys proposals might have on boeing 
employment but had no immediate estimate 
cheneys proposals would start with fiscal year 1991 
boeing lost 479 million in its defense and space segments last 
year and blamed the poor performance on technical cost and 
scheduling problems overall boeing had record profits of 423 
billion on sales of 2028 billion mainly due to its booming 
commercial airplane business the company reorganized its defense 
operations and predicted it should do better this year 
planned purchases of b2s were slowed in 1989 as congress and 
the defense department studied the need for the radarevading 
bomber in light of the changes in the soviet union and eastern 
europe 
boeing cited that delay as a reason for reducing its 
164000person workforce by about 5000 for 1990 
work is under way up through the eighth b2 kvasnosky said 
with another seven planes in the preproduction stage 
boeing makes the outboard sections of the wing and the aft 
section of the fuselage for the tailless bomber it also makes the 
fuel system weapons delivery system and the landing gear 
to date the b2 has been worth about 4 billion to boeing 
kvasnosky said adding that the company has invested about 400 
million on its share of the program 
boeing and the other contractors virtually have completed the 
first two prototype yf22a atfs with the first plane to fly by the 
end of june the plane is competing with the yf23a being built by 
northrop and mcdonnell douglas corp 
the air force plans to pick a winning contractor for fullscale 
development by may 1991 with a contract award scheduled two months 
later 
cheney has suggested atf purchases be delayed from 1994 to 1996 
the number to be bought would remain at 750 
the atf prototypes have been kept under strict security 
although the plane is expected to be a heavily computerized highly 
maneuverable successor to the air forces f15 
the lockheed team has spent about 600 million on the 
prototypes kvasnosky said with boeings share a couple hundred 
million dollars 
boeing is building the wings and the aft section of the atf 
fuselage and is installing the engines he said it also is 
producing much of the avionics including the software 
costs and the number of employees working on atf have been 
declining because the production work essentially is done 
kvasnosky said but if the lockheed team wins the contract and 
production is pushed back two years there would be costs 
associated with keeping the program at the simmer level

chrysler corp will build a new sport 
utility vehicle in toledo if it can resolve with city state and 
union officials a number of issues that could cut production costs 
a company official said thursday

and state it also wants to renegotiate a new contract with united 
auto workers local 12 chryslers current contract with local 12 
expires in 1992 
frankly this is the home of the jeep nothing would be more 
appropriate than to have a new jeep vehicle located in toledo 
said michael glusac chryslers executive director of governmental 
affairs we hope the discussions will eventually make that a 
reality 
if agreements are reached chrysler also will transfer 
production of the jeep wrangler model to toledo from brampton

chryslers moves could mean up to 1600 new jobs at toledos two 
jeep plants 
under the companys plans chrysler would begin producing its 
new jj line in july 1993 creating 700 jobs the jj is a 500 
million joint venture with renault a french automaker 
chrysler also would shift vehicle production of the jeep yj 
model to toledo from brampton beginning in july 1992 a move that 
could create 900 new jobs

firstquarter earnings for the nations big three 
automakers will be more than twothirds below last years profits 
analysts said thursday 
the companies are expected to report next week that the drop in 
earnings was caused mainly by drastic production cuts in the united 
states and economic troubles in brazil 
a spot check of analysts thursday showed forecasts that general 
motors corps quarterly earnings would be down about 70 percent 
from the 155 billion the company earned during the first three 
months of 1989 which was the best quarter gm had since the second 
quarter of 1984 
ford motor cos earnings should be down about 75 percent from 
the 164 billion the company earned during the period last year 
according to the analysts chrysler corp may show a marginal 
increase from the 351 million in profits it posted during the 
first quarter of 1989 the analysts said 
the earnings are going to be almost a yawn said john kirnan 
of kidder peabody amp co in new york people have been bracing 
for the weakened earnings report the bigger question is when are 
we going to get the turn 
auto company executives and industry analysts have predicted 
that the first half of the year would be tough and that things 
would pick up in the second half 
theyll make more money in the second quarter than they did in 
the first quarter said analyst david healy of barclaysbzw in 
new york in the second quarter earnings will still be below 
last year but the comparisons wont be as bad as the first 
quarter 
a rebound in the second half may be delayed kirnan said 
the car and truck sales numbers have certainly gotten back 
into a sluggish territory and with interest rates continuing to 
escalate it may choke off a major turn in secondquarter and 
secondhalf earnings of these companies he said 
in january all of the big three shut down assembly lines 
temporarily laying off thousands of employees and pushed 
incentives for purchasers both drastic moves to shrink bloated 
newcar inventories 
the inventories were brought back to more manageable levels 
which was good for the companies but the moves apparently 
clobbered firstquarter earnings 
a lot of people are saying it will be the toughest quarter of 
the year said auto analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors 
service inc 
chrysler which has relied heavily on incentives to sell its 
cars and trucks had an aggressive incentive program for its 
popular minivans during january that pumped up sales but 
incentive costs come directly out of profits and the no 3 
automaker doesnt have overseas operations to prop up any sag in 
north american operations 
during the past year or so gm and ford have relied on their 
overseas businesses especially in europe and south america to 
help maintain profit levels for the entire company that reliance 
soon may end 
a lot of people got surprised by the extent of the damage in 
brazil ms sudol said everything is at a standstill in 
brazil 
in march brazils government froze all accounts inflation was 
4583 percent annually at the time on march 26 ford and west 
german automaker volkswagen ag shut down production at their 
autolatina joint venture in brazil and put 2800 employees on paid 
leave 
ford spokesman rex greenslade said thursday those workers would 
be recalled next wednesday 
ford in a filing with the us securities and exchange 
commission before the brazilian government took economic action 
said if current conditions continued there was potential for a 
substantial negative effect on the companys earnings 
greenslade declined to comment on whether the employee recall 
meant that ford now has more confidence in the brazilian economic 
situation

for the threemonth period ending march 31 harcourt reported it 
lost 783 million or 107 per share compared with a loss of

takeover by british publisher robert maxwell 
peter jovanovich president and chief executive officer said 
late wednesday that the company has begun preliminary discussions 
involving the sale of some or all of its existing debt at a 
discount or the purchase of certain assets of the company by a 
third party 
hbj is not for sale jovanovich said in a statement it is 
simply premature to speculate as to whether a transaction will 
occur and if one does occur as to its eventual form or terms

us sen eugene mccarthy who has served for a decade on hbjs 
board said discussions had been under way with tomson corp of 
canada for a month 
harcourt sold its four sea world parks and two other theme parks

a federal judge dismissed one count of a lawsuit 
thursday accusing the chicago board of trade of illegally 
manipulating soybean prices prompting the exchange and its 
farmgroup adversary to claim victory 
the ruling by us district judge george marovich means the 
american agriculture movement inc cannot sue the board of trade 
based on alleged violations of the commodity exchange act 
but it allows the washingtonbased farmers group to proceed with 
three other counts in the lawsuit alleging antitrust violations 
breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence 
the lawsuit stems from the board of trades unusual july 11 
order last year requiring traders to reduce their holdings in 
contracts for july delivery of soybeans the result was a steep 
drop in soybean prices on the cash and futures markets 
the board of trade the worlds largest soybean futures market 
issued the order to force the italian company ferruzzi finanziaria 
spa to reduce its soybean holdings the exchange said the large 
holdings threatened to cause a sharp artificial increase in prices 
ferruzzi has denied it was attempting to corner the soybean 
market 
the american agriculture movement filed its classaction lawsuit 
against the board of trade and its officers in november it 
contended the emergency order was illegal and caused us farmers 
to lose more than 100 million on the value of their soybeans 
the count dismissed by marovich the first of four counts in 
the lawsuit declared that farmers like futures brokers and their 
clients have legal standing to sue the exchange based on alleged 
violations of the commodity exchange act marovich disagreed 
the board of trade which had sought to have the entire lawsuit 
dismissed said in a statement that marovich had dismissed the 
major count of the complaint 
we believe that the courts action is further vindication of 
the propriety of our action said exchange chairman karsten 
mahlmann 
mahlmann noted that inquiries by the federal commodity futures 
trading commission and the general accounting office had found no 
wrongdoing by the board of trade 
but john arens a lawyer for the american agriculture movement 
in fayetteville ark said the first count was a throwaway 
arens said the meat of the lawsuit is in the second count which 
accuses the exchange its officers and their trading firms of 
conspiring to restrain soybean trading and fix prices 
the third count alleges exchange officers breached their 
fiduciary duties and the fourth count alleges they acted with gross 
negligence and wanton disregard for market users 
marovich said in his ruling he would entertain a motion from the 
exchange for a summary judgement which is similar to a dismissal 
but which cannot be made until the case is ready to go to trial

the two retailing arms of canadas campeau corp also received 
approval to sell a corporate jet for 32 million and to provide 
data processing for macys the new yorkbased retailer 
shearson will charge 250000 a month in fees plus expenses to 
act as financial adviser for an indefinite period said cory

debt much of it acquired when torontobased campeau bought allied 
in 1986 and federated in 1988 
us trustee conrad morgenstern who is helping the court 
administer the reorganization has complained to aug that strict 
oversight procedures are needed to ensure that financial advisers

services morgenstern said such charges could drain money from the 
retailers estates and reduce their worth for creditors 
aug has said he would scrutinize fees to ensure that they are 
reasonable lipoff said the advisers have promised to submit 
documentation to explain their fee charges and what services were 
rendered 
aug also approved the sale of a federated corporate jet a

like the entire newspaper industry 
gannett co is mired in a recession that began in the second half 
of 1989 the chairman of the communications company told 
shareholders thursday 
gannett whose profits grew along with its increasing size for 
22 consecutive years since it became publicly traded company 
managed to report an up quarter but barely in its first 
quarter earnings report last week chairman john j curley said 
curleys comments were made against the backdrop of this weeks 
american newspaper publishers association meeting at which news 
executives bemoaned a precipitous drop in advertising revenues and 
an accompanying decline in readership 
most publishers at the los angeles meeting attributed the 
advertising crisis to regional economic troubles particularly in 
the northeast they said declining auto sales along with a 
softening in real estate and helpwanted ads contributed to the 
general downturn 
gannett also has suffered from the downturn in advertising that 
started in the northeast spread to the south and has not yet 
reached the west coast company officials said they were cautious 
about prospects for their papers including usa today 
still they said they expect usa today to turn profitable for 
the first time in 1990 they also said usa weekend is approaching 
profitability and now carries more ads than its main competitor 
parade magazine 
but curley cautioned we wont really know about the retail 
climate until we find out what happens in may and june 
he noted that gannetts stock price rose along with the fortunes 
of the company in the first half of 1989 then fell when the 
newspaper business turned down in mid1989 still he said gannett 
remains a good investment for longterm shareholders with a 17 
percent average annual return on a stock purchase since gannett 
went public in 1969 
trustees of the gannett foundation whose sole asset is 10 
percent of the companys stock said wednesday they would put the 
block up for sale because internal revenue service rules forced 
them to consider diversifying their holdings the charitable trust 
is headed by former gannett chairman allen h neuharth 
through a spokesman neuharth declined to comment on a 
washington post story that said the proposed sale may indicate a 
rift between neuharth and executives who have run the company since 
he left as chairman in march 1989 
curley gave up using limousines and the corporate suites 
neuharth had rented in new york and washington and the post said 
neuharth was upset by comments of gannett executives criticizing 
his lifestyle while chairman as excessive and wasteful 
curley also declined to comment through his spokeswoman sheila 
gibbons although she said of the post story i think thats 
overreaching 
much of the shareholders meeting was devoted to descriptions of 
how gannett is trying to develop new products as americans find 
less time to read and show less inclination to do so 
such strategies include buying the city magazine in rockford 
ill where gannett publishes the register star newspaper to 
increase our already strong information and ad picture said gary 
l watson president of gannetts community newspaper division 
he said gannett might buy other such magazines 
watson and other gannett officials also described how the 
company had 
published a talking phone book in florida with access to 
news weather sports and other information at a tollfree number 
put out advertising guides to luxury real estate also in 
florida 
started upscale lifestyle supplements to attract advertisers in 
new jersey and florida 
published a guide with pacific northwest tourist information to 
be distributed on ferries that sail from washington state to alaska 
run specials on its television stations built around special 
sections in usa today

mcdonnell douglas corp will cut 3000 jobs 
this summer mainly administrators and nonproduction workers to 
stem losses at its douglas aircraft unit the company said thursday 
in its first quarter report last week the st louisbased 
aerospace company said it had an operating loss of 84 million at 
douglas aircraft twice as big a deficit as in firstquarter 1989 
long beachbased douglas is home to the md80 jetliner and where 
the md11 jetliner and c17 cargo plane are being developed 
employment rose from about 15000 people in 1984 to 50000 today as 
orders for the twinengine md80 surged and the other planes were 
developed 
the bottom line is weve got to reduce costs because the 
performance has not been up to expectations said spokesman john 
thom 
the layoffs will come primarily from staff and support 
functions as opposed to the production side of things thom said 
an examination will get under way soon to see where people are 
needed what kind of shifting will take place 
thom said the cuts had been under discussion for some time and 
were not a reaction to thursdays proposal by defense secretary 
dick cheney to buy only 120 of the c17 longrange transport planes 
instead of the 210 originally planned the move is designed to save 
119 billion over the life of the program 
the md11 and c17 are nearing the end of their development 
phases and some staff reassignments would have been expected in 
any case the md11 is undergoing flight tests and certifications 
the third of the threeengine jumbo jets flew for the first time 
thursday the c17 will fly in 1991 
the company said it would try to transfer some workers who lose 
their jobs into production slots but said an undetermined number 
of people would lose their jobs workers not only in long beach but 
in the companys other operations in the united states and canada 
will be affected 
mcdonnell douglas officials discussed the poor performance at 
douglas aircraft at the companys annual meeting monday but made 
no mention of upcoming layoffs 
fourteen months after a sweeping reorganization in long beach 
mcdonnell officials said theyre still waiting for results 
we are at bottom said john mcdonnell chairman and chief 
executive officer but we really see it as a longterm 
investment we did not expect to see results in 1989 i would 
expect we are not going to see 1990 as bad as 1989 
lawrence m harris an aerospace analyst at bateman eichler 
hill richards in los angeles said that even though the md11 and 
c17 programs are nearing completion hes not expecting the 
problems at douglas to disappear quickly along with the 3000 jobs 
turnarounds in the aerospace industry rarely occur in just one 
quarter he said the work in process on a new complex program 
like the md11 or c17 is measured in terms of years

the governments plan to cut production of 
the northrop b2 stealth bomber nearly in half would hurt suppliers 
first but eventually would stunt northrops workforce the company 
said thursday 
defense secretary dick cheney on thursday outlined to congress 
proposed cuts aimed at saving 348 billion through 1997 partly by 
purchasing 75 b2 bombers instead of the 132 originally planned and 
delaying the start of production of advanced tactical fighters 
cheneys proposal predicated on a view of a diminishing soviet 
military threat helps trim the pentagon budget by targeting a 
program in which each aircraft would cost taxpayers 530 million 
northrop employs 12000 people on the b2 project including 
about 1700 who work on assembling the radarevading bomber in 
palmdale calif 
stealth bomber subcontractors and suppliers across the nation 
employ 30000 to 40000 workers said tony cantafio a northrop 
spokesman 
production of five b2s was proposed in the fiscal 1991 budget 
at a cost of 55 billion under the new plan only two jets would 
be built that year 
the immediate effect may be felt by suppliers and 
subcontractors around the country said cantafio 
from an employment standpoint at northrop there wont be an 
immediate effect 
northrop still will need to hire several hundred more workers 
for the palmdale plant because of prior orders cantafio said 
however cheneys proposal would halve production in peak years to 
12 from 24 aircraft 
obviously in the long run we wont build up our employment to 
the original schedule cantafio said 
just last sunday the company ran fullpage newspaper 
advertisements for a b2 job fair using a photograph of the 
ominouslooking flying wing and an appeal to many types of 
aerospace workers to help make history 
northrop also has been running television ads focusing on 
employees talking about their work and featuring famed test pilot 
chuck yeager 
building fewer stealth bombers would reduce the programs 
projected cost from 754 billion to 611 billion but would raise 
the cost of individual planes to more than 800 million according 
to cheney 
northrop also is competing for a role in a new generation 
aircraft known as the advanced tactical fighter which will replace 
the air forces f15 
cheney still wants 750 planes built but would push back 
purchases two years from 1994 to 1996 
the northrop spokesman said the impact of that change is minimal 
because the aircraft is not in fullscale development
