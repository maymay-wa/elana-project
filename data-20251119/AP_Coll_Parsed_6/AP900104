social democratic prime minister anibal 
cavaco silva reshuffled his government further thursday following 
his partys stinging defeat in local elections last month 
he said fernando real rector of the northern university of 
trasasmontes will take over the newly created environment and 
natural resources ministry 
government officials said thursday that secretary of state for 
culture teresa gouveia will be replaced by pedro santana lopes a 
leading figure in the lisbon section of the centerright governing 
party 
later thursday three more secretaries of state for tourism 
the budget and the treasury announced they would leave the 
government 
on tuesday five leading ministers were replaced including 
deputy prime minister and defense minister eurico de melo 
opposition sources said the shakeup showed deep divisions in 
the social democrats after the socialist party defeated them in 
local elections dec 17 
it was the first major government shuffle since the social 
democrats won general elections in 1987 
a period of political stability followed unprecedented since 
the 1974 revolution the past three years also saw a consumer boom 
and sustained economic growth however the government was accused 
of having a highhanded style inability to control inflation and 
not coping with continuing serious social problems 
it also faced allegations of highlevel corruption

argentinas national currency 
regained some of its lost value against the us dollar thursday 
when banks and exchange houses reopened for the first time since 
last week 
the austral traded at about 1400 per dollar sharply higher 
than the 19501 rate last thursday the final business day of the 
year and before the government ordered two national holidays and 
two bank holidays to try to stabilize the battered argentine 
economy 
nevertheless it appears premature to say whether the australs 
recovery was signaling success for the fourth stabilization plan by 
the economic team of president carlos menem who took office last 
july under a mandate to cut the foreign debt lower inflation and 
sell of moneylosing state industries 
the heart of the plan announced monday and prompted by last 
weeks abrupt devaluation calls for restricting the printing of 
further currency so that fewer new bills would flood the market 
thus bidding up the value of the austral 
the effect has been immediate stores report fewer customers 
bus and taxi drivers have little change and ranchers and farmers 
delivered only small quantities of beef and grain to distributors 
this week 
people who bought dollars last week for 2200 australs apiece 
sold them thursday for much less or waited in lines under a hot 
sun in this southern hemisphere summer to withdraw bank funds from 
savings accounts 
the stabilization plan has been defended by government 
officials but criticized heavily by its political opponents 
restricting the circulation of australs may bring on recession 
the social democratic party said in a communique aggravating the 
suffering of the population

combat troops flew home from battletorn 
panama on wednesday to a welcome made more joyous by news that 
their missions last objective had been accomplished with manuel 
antonio noriegas arrest 
im a young guy whos never been in anything like that said 
sgt george newsome 27 of jackson miss who was with his wife 
sharon and their three children i was worrying and hoping id 
come back home 
the newsomes joined some 30 fatigueclad soldiers who met 
reporters wednesday outside the champlain family life center at 
ford ord the soldiers were among 141 troops belonging to two 
artillery batteries from fort ord who were pulled out monday the 
first troops returning home since the panama invasion began dec 20 
more troops returned wednesday evening when an airplane carrying 
about 75 army rangers landed at hunter army airfield in savannah 
ga they were the first of about 500 savannahbased rangers 
scheduled to return wednesday and early thursday 
one of the rangers sgt donnie jones said the first night in 
panama was the worst and said he would remember the experience the 
rest of his life 
we were shot at the first night he said adding that the 
panamanians were extremely glad to see the us soldiers in the 
country 
there were real nice toward us he said during christmas 
they were very hospitable bringing us plates of food it was very 
worthwhile going down there for them 
later wednesday in washington president bush announced that 
noriega panamas former dictator had turned himself in after nine 
days inside the vatican embassy in panama city and was arrested by 
drug enforcement administration agents 
the president said noriegas arrest on drug trafficking charges 
meant the united states had achieved all of its objectives in the 
military invasion he ordered two weeks ago 
that news was greeted thankfully by families of the 23 us 
servicemen who were killed in action in panama 
it doesnt lessen the pain but at least nobody else will be 
killed hopefully said sharon roth the 17yearold sister of 
army pfc scott lee roth said from her home in milan ill 
thats the most reassuring thing that can come out of all of 
this hes noriegas going to pay for what he did 
in fort ord gunman specialist mackson hedgemond 26 of new 
york city who was stationed on the outskirts of panama city said 
the operation was warranted by noriegas alleged involvement in 
drug trade 
i think it was something that needed to be done hedgemond 
said im against drugs and i think thats bigger than anything 
else right now 
sgt newsome said he spent most of his panama tour in secure 
areas but still faced constant sniper fire 
ive never been shot at a day in my life seeing dead 
bodies all around ive never seen anything like that he 
recalled 
sharon newsome told their children that their father was at work 
and that he had a job to do 
it was kind of rough but i at least knew he was down there and 
he was safe she said 
gunnery sgt scott bell 24 of los angeles spent 14 days in 
panama and said he was surprised to learn he would return tuesday 
night because his unit had just been told to expect to stay in 
panama another 3 months 
bell said that when his unit which mostly provided 
firesupport for infantry troops arrived at trios airport in 
panama at the beginning of the operation they found the whole 
airport was just torn up bulletridden 
he said that after two days his unit was flown out to the city 
of rio hodo where he spent christmas which he described as 
raining hot miserable rather depressing 
bell who has a wife and a daughter said most panamanians 
seemed glad to see us troops and waved and cheered at them 
asked if the invasion was a success he said i dont know to 
be perfectly honest i like to think of using military force as a 
last resort bullets dont discriminate ive got a family like 
everybody else

three major suspects in the 
shooting death of francisco chico mendes the amazon 
environmental activist and union leader broke out of prison but 
were captured an hour later police say 
cattle rancher darli alves da silva and his sons darcy pereira 
da silva and oloci alves da silva escaped from prison in the amazon 
city of rio branco on saturday officer manuel de brito ramos said 
news of the escape from francisco de oliveira conde penitentiary 
was made public only wednesday he said 
ramos said two guards were sent to da silvas cell after 
authorities learned the three men had obtained revolvers and 
planned a breakout 
the da silvas overpowered the guards dashed about 125 feet 
across a courtyard and scaled the 11foot prison wall ramos said 
by telephone from rio branco 2650 miles northwest of rio de 
janeiro 
with just two wall sentries on duty during the new years 
holiday weekend the alarm was not sounded 
however darli alves da silva injured himself in jumping off the 
wall into thick brush the da silvas fled into the wilderness but 
police quickly mounted a search and captured them about an hour 
later he said 
darlis older and very thin and couldnt take the fall said 
ramos otherwise they might have made it 
da silva indicted in august on a charge of ordering mendes 
death and his sons have been held at the 150inmate penetentiary 
for a year awaiting trial 
darcy pereira 21 was indicted for carrying out the shooting 
police said he confessed oloci alves 22 was arrested as an 
accomplice 
mendes 44 was shot on dec 22 1988 at his house in the 
backwoods amazon town of xapuri 105 miles northwest of rio branco 
near the bolivian border 
mendes was head of a local rubber tappers union that blocked 
ranchers efforts to clear the rain forest for grazing he had led 
protests in which family and community members stood in front of 
bulldozers 
in 1987 mendes received the united nations global 500 award for 
his work to protect the amazon he was an environmental watchdog 
for the world bank and other international lending institutions in 
england and west germany 
mendes successfully campaigned in may 1988 to stop da silva from 
cutting down a stand of virgin rain forest on his property mendes 
often said the rancher threatened to kill him da silva denied it 
the issue of developing the amazon jungle has often erupted into 
bloody clashes between large landowners on one side and ecologists 
and peasant farmers on the other 
the government estimates that more than 800 people have died in 
land conflicts since 1980 many rural leaders and the church 
activists who advise them were victims

water conservation projects have displaced more 
than 10 million people in china over the past three decades and up 
to 40 percent of those resettled are living in poverty an official 
daily reported today 
the uprooting of communities for the projects has caused 
unstable social problems the china daily said quoting zhao 
renxiang of the water resources ministry 
zhao said 30 percent to 40 percent of displaced people lack 
adequate food and clothing 
china has completed 86000 dams and other waterworks since the 
late 1950s but the legacy of resettlement has hurt plans for 
further projects zhao said 
last year the government decided to delay for at least five 
years a decision on whether to proceed with the nations biggest 
dam project the three gorges hydroelectric project on the yangtze 
river 
the dam would generate 17000 megawatts of electricity for 
energystarved central china it has long been controversial 
because it would cost tens of billions of dollars to build cause 
serious environmental damage and require the displacement of about 
1 million people 
zhao said the government plans to issue new regulations to 
improve resettlement programs by extending state aid for rebuilding 
villages and allowing farmers to find nonagricultural work

gen manuel antonio noriega who 
defied two us presidents until he was toppled by a dec 20 
invasion walked out of his vatican embassy sanctuary wednesday 
night and surrendered to us troops 
word of the former dictators departure triggered spontaneous 
celebrations across the capital people banged pots and pans and 
kissed us soldiers fireworks lighted the sky around the vatican 
mission groups of youngsters raced up and down the streets waving 
panamanian and us flags 
its over its over shouted residents of the country ruled 
for six years by noriega 
in washington president bush said noriega who had taken refuge 
in the embassy on christmas eve turned himself over to american 
authorities voluntarily and with the full knowlege of the 
panamanian government 
in a nationwide address bush said noriega would be flown on a 
c130 transport plane from howard air force base in panama to 
homestead air force base in south florida to face arraignment at 
the us district court in miami where he is wanted on federal 
drug trafficking charges 
if convicted noriega faces up to 145 years in prison and up to 
11 million in fines he faces similar federal charges in a tampa 
court 
it seems that the vatican officials basically stressed to 
noriega that his only viable strategy was to give himself up 
said a us official in washington he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the united states agreed to three conditions set by noriega 
that he be allowed to make a few phone calls that his decision be 
kept secret until the actual time of his arrest and that he be 
permitted to wear his uniform administration officials said 
the administration earlier had given assurances to noriega that 
we would receive a fair trial and that he wouldnt be tried on a 
federal drug kingpin statute that carries the death penalty they 
said 
the assurances were relayed to noriega through vatican 
officials the united states did not directly deal with noriega 
the sources said 
we are relieved to be rid of this criminal said president 
guillermo endara in a statement broadcast on national television 
the people feel a sense of peace knowing that the monster is 
leaving our land 
thank god panama can now feel like a free country said 
moises rios 20 who was outside the nunciature minutes after 
noriega left 
hundreds of cars jammed 50th street near the center of what was 
once a thriving international financial center people stopped 
reporters and asked is it official is he really gone 
i feel a very deep emotion said reyna luz sandoval 21 
the criminal is finally gone 
gen maxwell thurman head of us southern command told 
reporters in panama city that no deals had been made with the 
vatican 
he thanked a delegation led by deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger for helping settle the 10day impasse but did 
not elaborate 
thurman said noriega looked vigorous looked confident he 
looked fine he said the former dictator was due to arrive in 
florida at 346 am est thursday after a sixhour flight 
thurman said noriegas surrender completes the fourth of our 
four objectives in invading panama the other three he said 
were to protect american lives safeguard the integrity of the 
panama canal treaties and restore democracy to panama 
according to authorities about 290 panamanian soldiers 300 
civilians 23 us troops and three american civilians died in the 
invasion 
i want to express the special thanks of our nation to those 
servicemen who were wounded and to the families of those who gave 
their lives their sacrifice has been a noble cause that will never 
be forgotten a free and prosperous panama will be an enduring 
tribute bush said in conclusion 
it doesnt lessen the pain but at least nobody else will be 
killed hopefully said sharon roth the 17yearold sister of 
army pfc scott lee roth from her home in milan ill 
scott lee roth 19 was killed on the first day of the invasion 
he had been in panama since august 
noriega left the compound at 850 pm accompanied by papal 
nuncio monsignor sebastian laboa he was wearing his generals 
uniform 
archbishop marcos mcgrath asked why noriega suddenly gave up 
told abctv that the former chief of the defense forces was 
undoubtedly a lonely man a broken man 
noriega was taken to a waiting us army blackhawk helicopter 
and flown to howard the us air base just west of the capital 
thurman said

15 others

against noriega i did my job i think its great whats 
happening here 
merkle predicted that the quick movement of noriega to miami 
would not pose legal problems 
there is no formal extradition involved here and the case law 
is that the court will not look to the circumstances by which the 
person was brought to the united states he said 
noriega was taken into custody by us authorities in panama 
late wednesday and put on a plane for homestead air force base 
south of miami where he was expected to arrive at 346 am est 
said gen maxwell thurman head of the us southern command in 
panama 
his arraignment was tentatively scheduled for thursday afternoon 
in the federal courthouse in downtown miami about 24 miles north 
of the base said diane cossin a spokeswoman for us attorney 
dexter lehtinen in miami 
theres going to be a plea entered tomorrow of not guilty 
said noriega defense attorney steven kollin were going to 
request certain pretrial discovery requests including certain 
sensitive documents and these sensitive documents will get to the 
truth of the matter i believe he will be found not guilty if we 
can find a jury of 12 people after this unparalleled pretrial 
publicity 
a roadblock to prosecuting noriega is his right to demand 
classified information stemming from his past cooperation with the 
central intelligence agency legal experts have said 
noriega stands accused of drug trafficking in indictments handed 
down in miami and tampa in february 1988 they marked the first 
time federal charges were filed against a foreign leader who was 
not in the united states 
in my opinion gen noriega is entitled under the law to head 
of state immunity said neal sonnett who withdrew only last 
week as one of noriegas attorneys that was one of the main 
arguments advanced in my motion for dismissal of the indictment 
against him 
the dismissal motion was denied by the trial judge in the 
federal case last january but sonnett said the legality of his 
extradition was sure to be a factor at noriegas trial 
i would think that any good lawyer representing gen noriega 
would raise that issue again particulary in light of the fact that 
gen noriega was elected chief of state by the panamian congress 
shortly before the invasion 
but ms cossin said a head of state immunity claim would 
have little effect on their case 
we anticipate numerous allegations and claims in gen 
noriegas defense cossin said however we have a great deal 
of confidence in our prosecution team and the laws of the united 
states 
noriega reportedly worked closely with the cia and the pentagon 
while he served as the head of panamas military intelligence 
service and after he became commander in chief in 1983 
the justice department acknowledged last week that it was in 
such a rush to indict noriega on drug charges that it may not have 
followed its own rules for making sure state secrets would not be 
disclosed in court 
but department spokesman david runkel said we believe there 
is a strong case against general noriega and that case can be 
successfully brought to trial 
at a press briefing last week runkel said the department may 
not have followed its usual policies of reviewing while drawing up 
an indictment any classified documents that might be used in a 
trial 
he said the departments decision to review the national 
security issues was an outgrowth of a dec 14 meeting of 
prosecutors in the case with representatives of the drug 
enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation and 
cia in which it was decided that the miami case would have 
priority 
in atlanta a former white house counsel said wednesday night 
that attorneys handling noriegas case should be able to select an 
unbiased jury to hear the deposed dictators trial 
its more of a problem than the routine case but its not an 
insurmountable problem said robert lipshutz former counsel to 
the president during the administration of jimmy carter 
there are thousands of people in every community who really 
dont follow these things with great attention and therefore 
would be qualified for jury duty lipshutz said ni a telephone 
interview

at howard he was arrested by drug enforcement administration 
agents and left on a flight to florida thurman said the flight 
left at 931 pm 41 minutes after noriega left the embassy 
thurman said us officials had only a few minutes warning that 
noriega would leave the embassy he said maj gen marc cisneros 
commander of us army south received a telephone call at his 
command post in the school across the street asking him to report 
to the gate 
thurman declined to say who received noriega but emphasized that 
he left on his own free will 
he said no panamanian officials were present but that the 
panamanian government was aware of what was going on 
noriega ruled this west virginiasized nation of 22 million 
people since 1983 
in his remarks bush thanked the vatican and the papal nuncio in 
panama for its help and promised noriega would receive a fair trial 
nevertheless he said his apprehension and return to the 
united states will send a clear signal that the united states is 
serious in its determination that those charged with promoting the 
distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of justice 
the trial is expected to be complicated us legal authorities 
have been studying secret documents this past month concerning 
noriegas long tenure as a cia and dea informant they expect he 
might try to derail his prosecution by seeking disclosure of 
information that would be embarrassing to bush a former cia 
director and the united states 
the impasse ended hours after 20000 people shouting no 
more and assassin marched to the vatican embassy to demand 
noriegas surrender 
noriega was said to be in strict isolation after laboa told 
his staff not to speak to the ousted dictator an embassy spokesman 
said the television set in the room was broken 
panamanian sources said the us southern command had tried to 
convince noriegas longtime mistress to try to lure noriega out the 
embassy 
but the sources who asked not to be further identified said 
vicky amado talked to noriega for 10 minutes after her release from 
a us military facility and told him the decision is in your 
hands 
there was no immediate word on the whereabouts of ms amado or 
noriegas wife and three children his family had been holed up in 
the cuban embassy 
throughout the standoff at the vatican mission the vatican has 
said it would not deliver noriega directly to the united states and 
would deal with panama 
panamas foreign minister julio linares said panamas 
constitution did not permit the generals extradition to the united 
states 
former president reagan the first of two presidents that 
noriega defied during his reign in power said he was pleased 
that gen noriega will be brought to justice reagan made the 
comments in los angeles through his spokesman mark weinberg 
noriega reveled in thumbing his nose at the united states which 
he called the colossus of the north 
washington imposed sanctions against panama in its effort to 
dislodge the general from power but noriega wouldnt budge 
when elections apparently were going against him in may 1989 he 
abruptly had them annulled for a time he had his own handpicked 
man as provisional president 
later his controlled legislature gave noriega himself full 
civilian powers to go with the military clout he had long 
possessed and which made him the most powerful man in panama 
on dec 20 shortly after incidents in which a us marine 
lieutenant was killed and in which according to president bush a 
us navy couple was abused us troops invaded panama and noriega 
fled into hiding

the fossil remains of a rare meateating 
dinosaur that predated the more famous tyrannosaurus rex but 
rivaled it in size and ferocity have been discovered in colorado a 
scientist said wednesday 
the dinosaur named epanterias amplexus weighed about four tons 
and measured about 50 feet long and had a long powerful tail that 
probably allowed it to bounce along like a kangaroo said 
university of colorado paleontologist robert bakker 
the epanterias could eat about 40 tons of meat a year and its 
claws seem to be the longest and the strongest of any meateating 
dinosaur that ever lived he said 
because of its jaw structure epanterias could have swallowed 
a 1400pound hereford cow with no trouble bakker said 
the first bones of the latest epanterias site were found west of 
fort collins in northern colorado by a team headed by bakker 
epanterias walked on its hind legs like tyrannosaurus rex but 
was built lower or slinkier to the ground bakker said adding 
that t rex came along some 66 million years after epanterias 
so far the dig has recovered a jawbone neck and tail vertebrae 
and chest bones he said 
theres more still in the ground but its the hardest dig ive 
ever made like digging porcelain imbedded in concrete he said 
the site is mountainous and a transitional zone between sage and 
pine when epantarias roamed the region 135 million years ago at 
the end of the jurassic period it was a vast flat floodplain 
stretching east and west from nevada to south dakota and north and 
south from alberta candad to new mexico bakker said 
the only other two known epantarias sites were discovered in 
1877 near canon city colo and in 1934 in the oklahoma panhandle 
bakker hopes that by assembling bones from all three sites a 
nearly complete composite epanterias can be assembled 
since these discoveries only seem to come along about every 50 
years we still have a lot to learn about epanterias even though 
this animal was as long as tyrannosaurus rex and heavier than the 
average circus elephant its rarely mentioned in standard dinosaur 
textbooks bakker said

this years grammy awards ceremonies will 
include lifetime achievement honors to dick clark paul mccartney 
miles davis and the late vladimir horowitz and nat king cole 
the five will be honored at the feb 21 event said michael 
greene president of the national academy of recording artists 
mccartneys impact on music as a songwriter and member of the 
beatles as well as his continuing growth as a solo performer were 
cited as reasons for his achievement award 
jazz legend davis played a crucial role in the development of 
jazz since the 1940s the academy said 
horowitz was included because many consider him the 20th 
centurys greatest classical pianist and cole was cited as a 
leading singer of the 1940s and 1950s 
the inclusion of clark was a surprise because he produces the 
american music awards which competes with the grammys 
we dont view these shows as competitive and when you look at 
the big contribution clark has made to the recording industry 
especially in exposing new talent there is no question he is 
deserving greene said

attorney general dick thornburgh is remodeling 
the governments vaunted organized crime strike forces along the 
lines of its oftcriticized drug task forces 
thornburgh has expended large chunks of his political capital on 
a merger that has mystified democrats and republicans on capitol 
hill he implemented the plan monday during a congressional recess 
spurning a lastminute appeal for delay from senate judiciary 
committee chairman joseph r biden 
since thornburgh announced the plan last february 33 strike 
force lawyers nearly a fourth of the governments top organized 
crime prosecutors have quit more plan to follow 
this is the first time i can remember where government 
officials seem determined to reform a program that everyone agrees 
has been a tremendous success said sen sam nunn dga when 
the attorney general appeared before senate committees to promote 
his plan 
thornburgh responded that his motive was simply to assure that 
the best management model is in place 
the strike forces based in 25 cities followed crime families and 
alliances across state lines they worked directly for the 
organized crime and racketeering section of the criminal division 
in washington that formulated a national strategy 
in the last decade they have imprisoned the leadership of 
organized crime families in boston brooklyn chicago cleveland 
denver kansas city los angeles new haven new orleans 
philadelphia and rochester 
thornburgh however has never been enamored of their 
independence he is merging them this week into the existing us 
attorneys offices in 23 cities 
thornburgh says his new model for fighting organized crime is 
the highly productive effort by 13 drug task forces each 
headed by a us attorney who coordinates federal state and local 
agencies 
not everyone even in thornburghs own party or department 
agrees that would be an improvement 
one senate republican source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said flatly that the drug task forces dont work 
evidence of problems with the drug task forces comes from the 
administration itself charles blau the deputy associate attorney 
general who watched over them from their startup in 1983 until last 
year described them as weak and decentralized he said he spent 50 
to 60 percent of his time trying to referee turf battles between 
us attorneys 
thornburgh however contends that modeling organized crime 
efforts after the drug task forces actually will decrease turf 
battles he also says the change will prod the strike forces to 
look more closely at newer forms of organized crime such as 
international drug cartels street gangs and asian and jamaican 
criminal organizations 
in a november report to congress drug czar william bennett 
backed thornburghs merger plan and he also praised the drug task 
forces but he added that the drug task forces have two important 
deficiencies lack of direction from washington to resolve 
disputes and to ensure that resources are not wasted on less 
important cases 
bennett said the government needs to take decisive action to 
overcome the single district focus of some us attorneys 
one source close to bennett who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the drug control director caved in on the organized crime 
question because he was more concerned with other fights we have 
with thornburgh like getting the us attorneys to work together 
on major drug cases 
thornburgh has advocated making the strike forces subordinate to 
us attorneys since 1974 when he was a us attorney in 
pittsburgh who clashed with the strike force chief there 
veterans of the strike forces are certain the move will 
ultimately allow us attorneys to divert the lawyers to shortterm 
cases that might provide quicker publicity and political gain 
jeremiah osullivan who headed the boston strike force for 10 
years until early 1989 said that prospect is driving his former 
colleagues out 
they dont want to work in an office where the person they 
work for knows little or nothing about the subject matter and 
where turnover is so rapid that theres nobody there long enough to 
work the longrange cases they dont want to work bank robberies 
and shortrange modest drug cases osullivan said 
although the attorney general cannot fire us attorneys they 
are presidential appointees thornburgh spokesman dave runkel said 
this attorney general can prevent the us attorneys from 
cannibalizing their new organized crime units 
they know him and respect him and appreciate what he has 
done runkel said noting that thornburgh is one of only two 
attorneys general to have worked previously as us attorneys 
runkel also said thornburgh plans to pursue a unified organized 
crime strategy developed by a council of federal agency heads 
convinced that isnt happening with the drug task forces biden 
and other democrats have proposed combining justices organized 
crime and narcotics operations into a separate division with its 
own field offices reporting to one manager in washington 
on dec 6 biden wrote thornburgh asking him to delay the strike 
force merger until congress considered that proposal in february 
thornburghs response was to implement the merger this week 
while congress was away in addition the associated press has 
learned he mailed bidens letter to us attorneys telling them 
he may be calling upon you for assistance with your home state 
senators to defeat bidens proposal 
one democratic senate source said everyone is flabbergasted 
no one can understand why hes burning up so many political bridges 
on this one 
an equally surprised republican source said thornburgh put a 
lot of time and prestige into this 
there was more vigorous lobbying on this than anything else 
they did this year the gop source said they had squads of 
people going up to line up votes

most of the 1980s were boom years for the 
economy as a whole but they were a bust for banks and savings 
institutions which failed in numbers not seen in half a century 
capping a decade of failure for financial institutions savings 
and loans in 1989 collapsed at the highest rate ever and bank 
closings fell only slightly short of a postdepression high 
regulators said wednesday 
government seizure of thrifts in texas and new mexico on dec 21 
boosted the tally of failed sampls to 328 far above the previous 
high of 277 in 1938 
the resolution trust corp the agency created aug 9 to carry 
out president bushs sampl bailout took control of 318 failed 
thrifts disposing of 37 of them by years end the old federal 
savings and loan insurance corp dealt with 10 sampls 
meanwhile a commercial bank failure in california and another 
in new york on dec 20 pushed the total to 207 for the year down 
from a postdepression record of 221 in 1988 according to the 
federal deposit insurance corp 
the decline although small was the first since 1977 when six 
banks failed a drop from 17 the previous year 
academic experts and analysts point to a number of factors 
behind the soaring failure rate in the 1980s some of which are 
still present as the financial system begins a new decade 
i dont see 1989 as being the end of this said catherine 
england a scholar at the cato institute a conservative research 
group in washington i think failures are going to continue to 
increase into the 1990s 
rapidly advancing technology is making it more difficult for 
financial institutions to compete companies that once borrowed 
from banks are now able to issue junk bonds or commercial paper 
consumers can bank by telephone or computer bypassing local banks 
and sampls in favor of better deals offered by big institutions and 
money market mutual funds 
that means we just dont need as many banks and sampls as we 
once did and this overcapacity is one of the reasons were 
seeing these failures she said 
also the expansion of federal deposit insurance in 1980 from 
40000 per account to 100000 encouraged bank and sampl owners to 
take more risks knowing the government would pick up the tab if 
their investments soured 
a farm crisis as the decade began followed by an oil crisis in 
the mid1980s helped guarantee that many risky investments would 
go bad 
high interest rates used in the early 1980s by the federal 
reserve system to fight inflation depressed commodity prices and 
drove the value of the dollar sky high squelching farm export 
sales farmings crisis became rural banks crisis 
then with the 1986 collapse of oil prices concern shifted to 
texas and other oilproducing states whose gogo economies were 
fueled by the expectation of endlessly increasing oil prices the 
fallout of the oil bust was still being felt as late as 1989 when 
134 bank failures and 90 sampl insolvencies occurred in texas 
now shaky real estate markets in arizona and in some states of 
the northeast are prompting concerns that as texas recovers 
institutions in other states will start to topple 
savings institutions suffered from some of the same regional 
problems but added at least three other causes weak regulation 
the effect of volatile interest rates on home mortgage portfolios 
and the inability of the government to close bankrupt institutions 
because the sampl deposit insurance fund had run out of money 
a few private analysts fear the true analogy for the 1980s is 
not the 1930s but the 1920s when hundreds of banks failed each 
year despite general prosperity that was followed by even more 
collapses and general economic ruin in the 1930s 
fdic chairman l william seidman agrees the historically high 
failure rate wont disappear overnight but he is predicting that 
1990 will bring another drop in the bank closing total 
last years failures brought the decade total to 1894 
institutions 1059 banks and 835 sampls

theft and fraud in some foreign aid programs 
results in federal funds intended for food and health care being 
used instead to buy things like mink coats and a tennis court a 
federal audit says 
the report by the us agency for international developments 
inspector general said that from april through september 1989 it 
recovered 182946 in misused funds and saved aid 24 million in 
unnecessary expenses 
the aid watchdog monitors more than 2000 projects in 70 
countries with a budget of about 72 billion most of the programs 
provide american money for health education rural development and 
agriculture in third world nations 
the inspector generals report said it received 133 complaints 
during the sixmonth reporting period of that total 102 concerned 
allegations of fraud bribery embezzlement false claims or 
conflicts of interest 25 were linked to allegations of criminal 
violations and six involved administrative irregularities 
according to the report an aid bookkeeper pleaded guilty to the 
theft of 340228 and used the stolen funds to maintain a lavish 
lifestyle without identifying the woman it said she gave 
111000 to friends purchased several mink coats toy dolls with 
mink coats eight original paintings and a sculpture 
in rwanda investigators found that a director from a volunteer 
agency sold donated food to pay the labor costs for the 
construction of his new home and a tennis court several of his 
employees also sold food provided by aid and in one instance 
built a restaurant 
in chad a local aid employee was found selling customs duty 
exemptions to local merchants in indonesia an aid worker was 
jailed for forging stolen checks 
the inspector generals office questioned the viability of a 
multimilliondollar irrigation program in the bakel region of 
senegal saying there was no evidence from the projects that 
irrigated farming was commercially viable 
the report said the project should be terminated if an 
evaluation does not result in a positive assessment 
the investigation also said aid continued to have problems with 
cash advances with an audit showing 11 million in outstanding 
advances attempts to correct the problems had been restricted to 
a casebycase basis without addressing the underlying systemic 
causes it said 
the inspector generals office found several cases of countries 
failing to meet established guidelines for dealing with programs 
in the food for peace programs for example host nations are to 
use the money received from the sale of the food for approved aid 
projects 
problems were found in el salvador uruguay and liberia 
aids contraceptive program also ran into problems because of 
lack of controls the agency provides more than 80 percent of the 
worlds donated contraceptives which cost about 244 million from 
1982 to 1988 
a lack of effective controls has made it more difficult for 
aid to efficiently deliver contraceptives and some products 
deteriorated due to poor storage the report said 
the inspector generals report concluded aid managers must 
deal with many countries that lack adequate systems of financial 
accountability and program management 
it said investigations showed inadequate controls and 
accountability over local currencies insufficient financial 
contributions by host governments weak aid accounting systems and 
failure to put into place systems to identify and correct problems 
found in projects

a key member of congress praises the bush 
administrations emphasis on speedily selling real estate from 
failed savings institutions but others worry about the effect on 
shaky real estate markets 
the administrations strategic plan for conducting the savings 
and loan bailout released wednesday instructs regulators to begin 
selling real estate and other assets from insolvent sampls even 
before the government officially closes the institutions 
rep bruce vento dminn chairman of a house task force which 
is monitoring the sampl bailout praised the approach 
procrastinating is much more of a risk because you have to pay 
to manage it the real estate the stuff doesnt get better with 
age its not like red wine vento said 
kenneth a guenther executive vice president of the independent 
bankers association of america cautioned the policy could wind 
up being a major political problem on the front door of the 
president by putting downward pressure on real estate prices 
he noted however the administration faces problems no matter 
which approach it emphasized speed or caution 
theres a real question of whether the market can stabilize if 
they dont get rid of the overhang of unsold properties he said 
the plan was written by an oversight board chaired by treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady the board sets policy for the 
resolution trust corp which is run by the federal deposit 
insurance corp an independent regulatory agency 
the rtc was created aug 9 by sampl bailout legislation so far 
its taken over 318 sampls disposing of 37 of them the 281 sampls 
remaining in its control have assets of 104 billion it expects to 
take over an addition 200 institutions with assets of about 150 
billion roughly half of the total assets are real estate 
oversight board president daniel p kearney in an attempt to 
quiet fears the real estate will be dumped noted much of it is 
entangled in legal problems and said it could take several years 
for the rtc to get clear title required to sell 
the plan released wednesday was little changed from a draft 
obtained by the associated press three weeks ago one difference 
was that the oversight board originally gave the rtc a june 30 
deadline for reviewing bailout deals put together by its 
predecessor the federal savings and loan insurance corp the final 
plan extended the deadline to aug 31 
the plan leaves an important financing issue unresolved the 
bailout bill passed by congress provides 50 billion to close 
insolvent sampls but administration officials estimate they need to 
borrow another 50 billion to 100 billion in working capital 
to finance sampl deals repaying it as assets from the institutions 
are sold 
the administration emphasizes that borrowing working capital 
does not mean the taxpayer cost of the bailout will go up but 
vento said congress is reluctant to permit the administration to 
borrow that much 
bert ely a thrift analyst in alexandria va said he estimates 
the administration needs at least 72 billion in working capital 
thats an enormous amount of money and the question is how are 
they going to come up with it ely said one of the things we 
may be seeing here is the beginning stage of a big punt that would 
leave hundreds of failed sampls sitting out there corrupting the 
marketplace

a study showing that global warming could speed 
the destruction of forests by fire and windstorms suggests 
noticeable change could occur in the earths forests by early in 
the next century a researcher said 
the rate of change will be faster than we thought before 
said jonathan overpeck the studys principal author 
the change will be marked by the appearance of fastgrowing 
species of trees in areas where mature trees have been destroyed 
said overpeck a staff scientist at the lamontdoherty geological 
observatory in palisades 
previous computer projections have shown that changes in 
temperature and rainfall could affect the growth of forests this 
is the first to show that physical destruction of trees will play a 
significant role in changing forests as the earth warms overpeck 
said 
george woodwell an ecologist and the director of the woods hole 
research center in massachusetts said overpecks findings agree 
with decades of research by ecologists showing that similar forest 
disturbance has occurred when climate changed in the past 
margaret davis an ecologist at the university of minnesota 
said this is important because the effects of disturbance are 
much quicker than the effects of climate change it gives us 
less time to respond to the change 
overpecks collaborators were david rind of the national 
aeronautics and space administrations goddard institute for space 
studies and richard goldberg of the institute for global 
habitability at columbia university 
their study appears today in nature a british scientific 
journal 
global warming is occuring as socalled greenhouse effect gases 
build up in the atmosphere the gases include carbon dioxide and 
the chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigerators and air conditioners 
the earth is expected to warm gradually during the next century 
as the gases enable the atmosphere to trap more and more of the 
suns heat mimicking the action of a greenhouse 
experts disagree over how much the earth will warm and when the 
effects will begin to be felt but few disagree with the premise 
that the earth will warm 
overpeck cautioned that his findings should not be taken as a 
prediction he cannot say precisely how soon changes in forests 
will begin to be noticed or how great the change will be 
but the research demonstrates that computer forecasts should 
take into account the physical destruction of forests as well as 
the effects of changing temperature and rainfall he said 
overpeck and his colleagues used a computer climate program 
developed by nasa to show that thunderstorms hurricanes and 
tornadoes will occur more frequently as the climate warms 
they then used a second computer program to assess the effect of 
these changes on forests lightning associated with the 
increasingly frequent thunderstorms will increase the likelihood of 
forest fires they said and the windstorms will uproot trees

for the second time in four years a 
coin toss decided a deadlocked election for a trustee seat 
the coin toss tuesday at the mahoning county board of elections 
was a repeat of the election four years ago involving the same men 
the results were the same both times for robert spencer who lost 
to bruce behner when he picked tails in a coin flip that came up 
heads 
behner will serve another fouryear term as a trustee of rural 
goshen township in northeastern ohio 
this is unbelievable twice in four years said spencer 
40 a bus salesman at myers equipment corp son of a gun what 
can i say 
the coin toss was needed after behner 53 a hog farmer paid 
50 for a recount after close balloting in november he was a 
writein candidate for one of two trustee seats open after he 
failed to correctly file petitions for reelection 
the recount showed behner had 261 votes to spencers 271 john 
heffner was the top votegetter with 307 votes 
there were 10 disputed ballots where behners name was written 
in but the oval next to it was not blackened as required by law a 
ruling by ohio secretary of state sherrod brown gave the ballots to 
behner ending the election in a tie 
behner said he was glad to keep the job which pays a maximum of 
5600 per year

the last time dick thornburgh was in the 
federal government he mounted an attack on the justice departments 
organized crime strike forces with mixed success 
the outcome of that effort has provided ammunition for both 
sides of the argument over his current decision to put the strike 
forces under the control of local us attorneys 
in 1976 thornburgh was assistant attorney general in charge of 
the criminal division and was given responsibility for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the strike forces on a casebycase basis 
the review was an outgrowth of thornburghs own 1974 
recommendation as us attorney in pittsburgh and chairman of a 
committee of us attorneys that the strike forces which worked 
for the organized crime section in washington be merged into the 
us attorneys offices 
thornburgh closed the new orleans and st louis offices and 
merged the strike forces in pittsburgh and the southern district of 
new york manhattan with us attorneys offices there 
there still is no st louis strike force but a local outcry led 
by the new orleans metropolitan crime commission which also 
opposes the current move persuaded the justice department to 
reopen the new orleans strike force two years later it went on to 
convict new orleans mob boss carlos marcello 
thornburgh himself regularly points to the successes achieved by 
the southern district in new york during the 1980s as proof that 
his plan will provide continued strong pursuit of organized crime 
several cases culminated in the 1985 indictment under the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of the bosses of 
the genovese gambino luchese bonnano and colombo families who 
made up the mobs governing commission four were convicted one 
was murdered 
thornburgh told senators this fall that four separate us 
attorneys served in manhattan during the time that case was 
investigated 
thornburghs opponents however said those successes were 
primarily the product of an unusual us attorney rudolph 
giuliani who came to the post in 1983 from the no 3 job at the 
justice department 
giulianis predecessors also had outstanding records of 
achievement but not in the area of organized crime said edward 
a mcdonald who quit this summer after seven years as brooklyn 
strike force chief he told congress that giuliani assigned more 
than 20 assistants to work on organized crime 
but after the mob governing commission case mcdonald said 
giuliani shifted his focus to public corruption and insider 
trading and reduced the offices organized crime unit by more 
than half 
mcdonald and others argued that the strike forces provided 
sustained longterm enforcement but that the new york experience 
showed that even the best us attorneys are easily distracted by 
the latest highprofile cases 
jeremiah osullivan who headed the boston strike force for 10 
years also said that the rico statute used by the strike forces 
to bring down whole crime hierarchies had never been used by a 
us attorney in pittsburgh against the organized crime family 
there 
asked about organized crime in pittsburgh thornburghs 
spokesman dave runkel paused then joked my first answer would 
be that thornburgh wiped it out 
although promising to check for a further explanation of the 
lack of rico prosecutions runkel provided none

the nations aids epidemic may be growing more 
slowly than expected according to an unofficial assessment that 
found an apparent dropoff in the number of cases among homosexual 
and bisexual men 
official estimates of the potential number of aids cases 
ranging from 1 million to 15 million people may be too high said 
statisticians attending a closed meeting sponsored by the 
atlantabased federal centers for disease control 
officials said the number of infected people or eventual aids 
cases actually ranges from 700000 to 13 million a number that 
could lower direct health costs of the epidemic by as much as 12 
billion according to an article published in thursdays editions 
of the atlanta journalconstitution 
the new estimates are the outgrowth of a november meeting of 
public health officials and mathematicians in atlanta called to 
find new ways of assessing the impact of the aids epidemic on the 
health care system 
the meeting summarized in the journal science also examined 
estimates of the total numbers of infections the number of people 
receiving therapy at different stages of the disease and the 
implications for the provision of health services the newspaper 
said 
if the projections are correct the united states could have 
between 5000 and 12000 fewer aids cases this year than predicted 
in 1986 by the us public health service next years toll could 
be 20000 lower 
were figuring out what the size of the problem is said dr 
timothy dondero head of the agencys aids surveillance program 
blood tests of military applicants trauma patients blood 
donors childbearing women job corps entrants and federal 
prisoners continue to suggest that between 800000 and 13 million 
people are now infected with the virus that estimate is very close 
to the new projections derived at the cdc meeting 
but the unofficial projections are based on mathematical models 
that attempt to gauge the extent of the epidemic in the general 
population rather than unrepresentative groups who have been 
tested for the virus 
in 1988 a former cdc expert dr alex langmuir predicted there 
would be fewer than 200000 cases of aids in the united states by 
1991 others suggested the number could be as high as 3 million 
researchers said the slowdown could be a result of increased 
caution among homosexuals who in 1983 began using more condoms 
limiting the numbers of sexual partners and avoiding highrisk 
sexual activity in bathhouses and group settings 
others believe that drugs such as azt and aerosol pentamidine 
available for use beginning in 1986 and 1987 may have slowed the 
onset of aids in people who began taking it before they developed 
symptoms of the disease

the aflcio which is hosting a visit by nine 
soviet miners trying to form independent unions is still pressing 
the soviet government to let us labor leaders visit there the 
federations president says 
the soviet government refused about a month ago to let an 
aflcio delegation visit workers in the soviet union interested in 
setting up independent trade unions 
the nine soviet miners met wednesday with aflcio president lane 
kirkland and united mine workers president richard trumka as part 
of their monthlong study of us labor unions and mining and 
safety practices 
kirkland referring to the tentative settlement reached this 
week to end a bitter ninemonth umw strike against the pittston 
co told the soviet miners that workers trying to gain a better 
life for their families must face and deal with powerful and 
entrenched forces in every society 
that is certainly true here he said 
also wednesday the aflcio called on the soviet government to 
reverse last weeks decision to revoke the passport and exit visa 
of a miner who had been scheduled to make the tour sergei 
masalovich 
the aflcio says the soviet government inaccurately claimed the 
strike leader was relieved of his duties by the vorkuta strike 
committee 
the miners are the guests of the aflcio but the trip is being 
paid for through a us information agency exchange program 
the soviets are scheduled to visit mines in virginia or west 
virginia the colorado school of mines meet labor leaders in 
pittsburgh and atlanta and attend a texas state aflcio convention 
on political activity 
when kirkland announced the soviets visit last month he 
compared their struggle to that of solidarity organizers in poland 
in the early 1980s and pledged to offer the federations support 
even if it meant defying the soviet government 
the aflcios support of solidarity included the smuggling of 
printing and other communications equipment into poland when 
solidarity was outlawed in all the federation gave about 5 
million worth of equipment and other assistance to solidarity

president bush is considering a proposal that 
would bolster environmental protection by taxing industries that 
dont use recycled materials 
the unspecified fee on raw materials which would be imposed on 
substances such as glass paper and aluminum is likely to be 
included in bushs fiscal 1991 budget when it is submitted to 
congress jan 29 said officials who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
the proposal might appear to violate bushs commitment against 
higher taxes but administration officials suggested the levy would 
be classified more as a user fee and thus escape the 
nonewtaxes edict 
meanwhile white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday 
that the administration has dropped a budget proposal for a new tax 
on recreational vehicles to pay for conservation measures 
the administration decided there probably was a better way to 
do that fitzwater said the rv fee was included in an early 
draft budget 
details were still sketchy because administration officials 
would not discuss details of the emerging 1991 budget but the 
rawmaterials proposal is designed to provide an economic incentive 
for industries to use recycled goods rather than virgin materials 
the tax would not be applied to recycled substances 
we want to encourage recycling for obvious reasons said 
deputy white house press secretary stephen hart on wednesday he 
said promotion of recycling is part of the major emphasis bush 
intends to put on environmental issues this year 
bush on wednesday signed a proclamation designating next april 
22 as the 20th annual earth day he said the day will be a chance 
to reflect on the progress made over the past 20 years and set 
the environmental agenda for the next decade 
earth day should inspire us to save the land we love to 
realize that global problems do have local solutions and to make 
preservation of the planet a personal commitment 
the president also called on congress to work quickly 
carefully and responsibly to approve strengthening amendments to 
the clean air act congress recessed for the year without 
completing work on a legislative package to rework air quality 
standards 
fitzwater asserted anew that bushs new budget for the fiscal 
year that begins oct 1 will contain no new taxes but he said it 
would feature some very interesting programs 
administration officials frequently seek to draw a distinction 
between a widely applied tax and a more narrowly targeted user 
fee even though the distinction may be lost on those who pay the 
levy

barbara bush will get nine more radiation 
treatments for a troublesome eye ailment after sailing through her 
first one and then jumping in the white house pool for a mile swim 
mrs bush who aides said felt fine after the wednesday 
treatment is undergoing the radiation to try and cure double 
vision and tearing eyes that drugs have failed to correct the eye 
ailment results from graves disease an immune system ailment that 
earlier attacked her thyroid 
the thyroid condition has been remedied through drugs and 
radioactive treatment that rendered her thyroid inactive but the 
eye symptoms have persisted despite treatment with prednisone a 
powerful steroid 
if the 10 doses of radiation dont work she may have to 
consider surgery to relieve pressure in the eye socket or to 
reattach malfunctioning muscles experts say 
mrs bush was at walter reed army medical center for more than 
three hours on wednesday for the 10minute radiation treatment plus 
examinations said her press secretary anna perez 
she said it was like a trip to the dentist only better 
perez said she went swimming right after she came back doing 
her customary mile of laps in the heated outdoor pool at the white 
house she later was seen walking about the white house grounds in 
a sweatsuit 
the lowlevel radiation treatment is intended to halt swelling 
in the small muscles that control movements of the eyes 
medical experts not associated with the case said such treatment 
is routine for graves disease eye patients who have not responded 
to other therapy the radiation treatment is not considered 
dangerous 
the published studies report 60 to 90 percent of patients have 
a favorable response to this treatment said dr joshua cohen an 
endocrinology specialist at george washington university medical 
center 
the treatment does not cause side effects said the experts

a federal task force is recommending a wide 
array of options for oil development at three controversial 
offshore sites near florida and california and none of the choices 
would ban drilling altogether according to administration sources 
the task force report was to go to the white house today 
according to interior department officials who said it would not be 
made public 
sources familiar with the recommendations said wednesday the 
options for the leases off the california coast would envision oil 
and gas development but in some cases include specific conditions 
restrictions and various timetables 
the task force adopted more restrictive options for the lease 
off the florida coast according to one source including one that 
could delay development for several years because of environmental 
concerns 
the possible damage to sensitive coral reefs was cited by the 
task force in the florida lease according to one source 
the sources spoke only on the condition that they not be 
identified further 
as only scant information about the task force findings could be 
obtained several congressmen called for the report to be released 
by the bush administration 
i see no reason for keeping this report a secret said rep 
dante fascell dfla failure to release this latest study can 
only add to the suspicion mistrust and confusion that has 
surrounded the entire oil lease program 
rep frank pallone dnj said the secrecy creates the 
perception that the administration does not want to allow this 
report to be circulated that the public is being shut out of 
this decisionmaking process 
the task force was headed by interior secretary manuel lujan and 
included representatives of the energy department environmental 
protection agency commerce department and office of management and 
budget 
interior spokesman steve goldstein said wednesday the report 
outlines nine options three for each of the three leases and 
covers the gamut of approaches president bush could take in 
deciding whether to proceed with the sale of the three leases 
the recommendations are designed to give the president the 
greatest amount of latitude in decision making said goldstein 
he declined to provide further details only characterizing the 
options as not black and white but shades of gray 
the task force completed late editing changes in the report this 
week its not known when bush would make a decision on whether to 
proceed with any of the lease sales which he had put on hold a 
year ago pending the task force review 
environmentalists have strongly opposed oil and gas drilling at 
the three lease sites the leases involved potential oil and gas 
drilling on 11 million acres of ocean off southern california 67 
million acres off northern california and 14 million acres off the 
florida everglades in the gulf of mexico 
two months ago a panel of the national academy of sciences 
questioned whether enough information was available to make a 
prudent decision on drilling at the sites that study said 
technical and scientific data was insufficient to warrant 
leases being issued at this time 
at the time robert kallman task force director said the 
scientific panels findings clarified some of the issues involved 
and would be taken into account but did not necessarily rule out 
an option that leases be issued

myth no 2 men would spend their time protecting the women 
instead of fighting the enemy 
sex doesnt come into play you dont really think about it 
mcgowan said i wasnt going to put a female squad leader over in

thinking about firepower 
i felt like we fought side by side i felt equality she

sen john warner rva ranking minority member of senate armed 
service committee said wednesday in panama that it is time to take 
another look at the ban 
the women warriors in panama discharged themselves in a very 
credible military professional manner he told a news conference 
he said what happened in panama will require the congress once 
again to reexamine the present laws surrounding the training and 
the use of women in situations such as this 
both law and military policy bar women from being assigned to 
units like the infantry whose main job is to fight the enemy but 
women who make up 11 percent of the military serve in the 
military police and in support roles ranging from intelligence to 
infantry 
in this case the mp unit got what turned out to be a combat 
assignment 
another woman us army special agent julie torres was on a 
threeperson team assigned to gen marc cisneros commander of us 
army troops in panama at one point when bullets started flying 
she threw herself on him and shoved his head behind an armored 
truck according the st louis postdispatch 
thats our mission you take the round not him she said 
the pentagon says that 600 of the 26000 us troops who took 
part in the invasion were women none were among the 23 killed 
the 988th has about 120 soldiers at least a dozen of them 
women about half of them will win combat patches for the kennel 
attack and other firefights around town something few soldiers in 
todays peacetime army can boast 
army spokeswoman paige eversole said that battle lines blur in 
modern warfare 
even people in support units where many women are are going 
to be vulnerable to modern weapons where they are aimed at troops 
beyond the front line she said in washington 
thompson and cabido are proud they have proved themselves under 
fire and think the ban on women in combat should be lifted 
if they do it its going to be a long hard battle cabido 
said theres a lot of men in the army who wont like it

crime fighters in this citys tougher 
neighborhoods who have pledged to win their war in the 1990s can 
claim a victory as the decade dawns 
they beat back gang hats 
when word went out wednesday that northside family sports had 
started selling baseballstyle caps inscribed with the names of two 
local gangs community activists moved in swiftly 
within hours the shops owner promised to stop selling them 
if we let this store go then the one on the next block is 
going to start selling the same kind of stuff said georgette 
watson a recent target of gang threats 
weve got to stop this kind of thing before it turns around 
everything weve been working for added watson who has been 
under 24hour police protection since a gang allegedly placed a 
5000 bounty on her last month 
watson founder of the dropadime antidrug tip hot line was 
among a contingent of community leaders who went to jack malones 
sporting goods store to let him know what they thought of his new 
merchandise 
malone said he was unaware the hats which were ordered at the 
request of customers bore gangrelated insignias and assured the 
activists no more special orders would be taken the caps selling 
for 1299 each were inscribed with the gang names castlegate 
and ivp intervale 
id rather nip this thing in the bud malone said the 
last thing i want to see is gangs being promoted 
his decision was probably made easier by the appearance at his 
doorstep of the mayor police commissioner district police 
superintendent and about a dozen community leaders from the 
roxbury dorchester and mattapan neighborhoods 
mayor raymond l flynn police commissioner francis roache and 
police deputy superintendent william celester met with watson and 
other community leaders wednesday at a doughnut shop adjacent to 
the sporting goods store 
its a free country but that doesnt mean you have to do this 
kind of thing in this community celester said these leaders 
know what to do 
the activists stressed they didnt want to come on like 
vigilantes 
we didnt come here to close anybody down said joan almeida 
of the neighborhood justice network we came to talk 
still some merchants and residents said the activists had gone 
too far 
are we going to stop selling gang members food to eat or 
clothes to wear asked one police officer who did not want to be 
identified it sounds like hitlers germany to me 
yvonne waith and her daughter who work next door at a beauty 
parlor said the activists efforts were misplaced 
what about the guns never mind the hats mrs waith said 
there are much more important battles than this 
the innercity battle against gang and drugrelated crime has 
been fierce residents say they want to reclaim the turf lost to 
guntoting adolescents not cater to them by producing status 
merchandise 
grassroots organizer ben haith said the community reacted to 
the logoinscribed caps strongly and with outrage because they 
go against so much of what parents kids and local merchants have 
been working for 
there are a lot of people in the community that have 
businesses and who feel the pains of the violence here he said

of money to dickerson who then detonated a fragmentation bomb made 
of match heads stuffed inside a small fire extinguisher police

a judge said she wants more information 
before deciding whether to hear a petition from the mother of gary 
coleman claiming that the diminutive actor is incompetent to handle 
his financial affairs 
edmonia sue coleman of zion ill filed a conservatorship 
petition in superior court on dec 4 contending that her 
21yearold sons deteriorating physical and mental condition puts 
him at significant risk of financial exploitation 
colemans lawyer charles wake denied the allegations 
wednesday filing papers saying that the actor is in good health 
and mentally competent to handle his own business affairs he 
alleged that mrs coleman is merely trying to wrest control of her 
sons fortune 
superior court judge martha goldin appointed attorney arne 
lindgren to represent coleman temporarily and determine whether his 
own lawyers have a conflict of interest she also told lindgren to 
interview coleman and his doctors and submit a report on the 
actors health 
coleman was born with an atrophied right kidney and has 
undergone two transplants during a childhood requiring frequent 
dialysis treatments and use of various prescribed drugs the court 
documents said 
the 4foot5inch actor who gained fame in the tv series 
diffrent strokes appeared cheerful and alert in court and 
told reporters he hoped for a resolution of the case soon 
mrs coleman absent from the hearing has asked that a 
conservator be appointed for her son and that her bank us trust 
co of california be placed in control of assets that include 46 
million in property and an annual income of 750000 
it appears that the prolonged use of prescribed drugs fluid 
exchanges machine dependency and failure to follow the medically 
recommended diet and regimen has had a cumulative debilitating 
effect on gary her petition said 
she claimed her son was puffyfaced and disoriented and unable 
to understand or respond to simple questions 
in response wake said the actor follows a regular dialysis 
program and is in good health is competent and is able to manage 
his personal professional and business affairs 
edmonia sue colemans petition is no more than an attempt by 
mrs coleman to wrest control of gary colemans personal and 
financial affairs away from him as a defense tactic in connection 
with a civil lawsuit by coleman against his parents wake 
maintained 
in that lawsuit coleman alleges that his parents and a former 
business adviser anita de thomas mismanaged his funds and 
misappropriated assets for their own benefit 
the judge postponed proceedings to jan 31 over objections by 
wake who said colemans career is suffering from publicity about 
his mothers allegations

redoubt volcano slipped into slumber 
after gushing ash and steam eight miles high but air traffic 
remained disrupted because of concerns about engineclogging 
fallout 
seismically the volcano is fairly quiet right now 
geologist robert mcgimsey of the alaska volcano observatory said 
wednesday afternoon we have no reports of eruptions 
scientists said it was too early to predict what the reduced 
seismic activity might mean they said they would not be surprised 
if seismic energy rebuilds again at the mountain 115 miles 
southwest of anchorage 
the alaska volcano observatory recorded the last explosive 
eruption at 244 am wednesday the volcanos first violent 
eruption in days came at 548 pm tuesday it was the largest 
since redoubt thundered awake in middecember after a 25year sleep 
pilots on tuesday reported a plume of ash and steam to 40000 
feet and what appeared to be lava flowing down the volcanos 
northwest flank observatory scientists said 
the federal aviation administration said there were no pilots 
reports of ash on wednesday and the alaska division of emergency 
services reported no significant ash accumulations on the ground 
nevertheless delta and united airlines canceled flights until 
at least today and international airlines some of which use 
anchorage as a refueling stop diverted planes to other airports 
alaska airlines said it offered all but two of its scheduled 
flights markair an intrastate carrier resumed daylight flying 
wednesday after a threehour delay 
the failure of all four engines on a klm royal dutch airlines 
passenger jet last month was blamed on ash from redoubt the plane 
made a safe emergency landing in anchorage after the engines were 
restarted 
scientists tried to check on the reported lava flow wednesday 
but clouds frustrated an attempted aerial observation 
they didnt get any kind of visual on the volcano at all 
mcgimsey said it was a real disappointing flight 
the observers found at least one large mudflow was generated by 
the eruption tuesday mud filled the 1milewide flood plain of 
the drift river and extended about 20 miles the volcano 
observatory said in a news release boulders up to about 13 feet in 
diameter were observed 
some flooding was evident at the drift river oil storage 
facility 20 miles from the volcano the observatory said water 
flowed around a levee but did not penetrate dikes protecting 
individual tanks flood waters also crossed an airstrip 
cook inlet pipe line co operator of the drift river facility 
on tuesday evacuated the 11 people who were there the company said 
weather and ash on wednesday prevented it from determining when 
operations might resume power at the facility was interrupted the 
company said 
after a quarter century of silence the peak erupted dec 13 and 
spewed ash 33000 feet into the air the next day varying levels of 
seismic activity continued through the month

so the ordinary everyday earsplitting boom 
box has been made into a weapon of war and theres no knowing 
where that may lead 
those radiocassette players with stereo speakers are menace 
enough in peacetime clearing streets and public parks as platoons 
of youthful rock fanciers blare their music at migraine volume 
and that was before panama where the united states decided to 
go after manuel antonio noriega no decibels barred he could run 
to the vatican embassy but he couldnt hide not when us 
soldiers brought in the stereo speakers set them up in a parking 
lot across the street turned up the volume and tuned in armed 
forces radio rock 
there went the neighborhood 
troops and everybody else in the area had to converse in shouts 
as numbers like youre no good voodoo chile welcome to 
the jungle and nowhere to run nowhere to hide boomed day 
and night from olive drab governmentissue speakers 
noriega who surrendered wednesday night and was put on a plane 
to the united states fancies opera making a high decibel diet of 
rock plus country and western numbers seem a sort of musical 
torture but the noise spared no one and the roman catholic 
diplomats stationed at the embassy presumably were more comfortable 
with plainsong than disco music 
baby youre no good the speakers blared and i fought 
the law and the law won 
after a day and a half a vatican spokesman said the musical 
assault was unacceptable another day of it and word came from the 
mission that the din was keeping diplomats and clerics awake while 
noriega slept and the vatican was contemplating unspecified 
further steps if it continued the rock barrage was turned down 
last friday 
i think it aggravated the people inside president bush said 
saturday it has stopped it would have aggravated me ill tell 
you im not into rock country music maybe thats different 
not at that volume 
the military didnt explain the rock tactic bushs spokesman 
said it was a communications technique 
there was an attempt to disrupt communications so that we 
could have some guarantees of the security of our conversations 
said press secretary marlin fitzwater fairly standard practice 
he said music was played to disrupt microwaves and interfere 
with electronic eavesdropping when white house staff members 
conferred at the us embassy in moscow during president reagans 
1988 summit meeting with mikhail s gorbachev not around the 
clock though 
who was eavesdropping in panama city 
id let your imagination deal with that one fitzwater said 
sidestepping the question of whether the racket was supposed to 
prevent reporters with electronic gear from tuning in on military 
conversations and street corner talks with the papal envoy 
when the popes man in panama city can come under rock music 
assault nobodys safe 
arms negotiations stalled let them hear about it turn up big 
planet scary planet in a while if theres still no deal 
escalate to armageddon it 
bush has been telling people to read his lips for so long that 
its become trite next time congress talks about raising taxes he 
can break out the boom box and let it shout can u read my 
lips and i wont back down 
vice presidential problems get dan quayle a stereo and let him 
advertise giving you the best that ive got bush has already 
assured his no 2 man of renomination now when necessary he can 
play its you again loudly enough to drown out the doubters 
my prerogative the presidential boom box can blare

health officials hope to reduce the states high 
rate of underweight newborns with a program that extends prenatal 
care to expectant mothers outside the health care mainstream 
the program better beginnings will furnish medical care 
financial assistance nutrition counseling followup counselors to 
encourage pregnant women to see doctors regularly and a 
combination outreacheducation effort to increase public awareness 
officials said 
it will give these babies at least a fighting chance at 
starting out healthy john fairman the head of the denver 
department of health and hospitals said wednesday 
a recent study showed only the district of columbia and six 
southern states had higher rates of newborn babies weighing less 
than 5 pounds than colorado the program will be coordinated 
through denver general hospital where the rate of low birthweight 
babies 123 percent is nearly twice the national average of 68 
percent officials said 
the problem is most severe among newborn babies whose mothers 
either received no prenatal care or who first saw a doctor late in 
their pregnancies denver general officials said 22 percent of the 
deliveries at the hospital are to women in those categories 
such babies are at much higher risk of incurring serious health 
problems requiring extended hospitalization at birth have a higher 
chance for lifelong physical handicaps and have a higher death 
rate 
we still have many pregnant women whose first contact with a 
physician is on the day they show up at a delivery room said 
terri bailey director of the perinatal project at denver general 
a lack of prenatal care correlates strongly with babies who are 
born too early or born weighing less than 55 pounds such babies 
are 40 times more likely to die during their first year or to 
experience serious longterm physician and developmental problems 
in 1988 denver general delivered 183 babies to women who had 
not been seen by a doctor during their pregnancies 
better beginnings will attempt to contact expectant mothers who 
normally would not seek out prenatal care and put them in touch 
with doctors at denverarea clinics brochures printed in spanish 
and english will be circulated counselors also will provide health 
advice to the mothers 
fairman said a large part of the problem is just getting the 
word out about routine prenatal care 
this problem is not unlike the issue of seat belts we know 
seat belts save lives he said

a czech who has spent the past decade in exile 
is launching a conservative party to contest czechoslovakias first 
postcommunist election on a platform of scrapping military ties 
with moscow in favor of neutrality or alliance with the west 
the warsaw pact has no place in our future we feel that 
the question of active neutrality or adherence to western 
collective security must be decided by a nationwide referendum 
after the free elections promised for june said dr jiri kotas 
the economic program of his party of constitutional democracy 
will be allout conservative stressing gradual but vigorous 
privatization of the statemanaged economy and the most favorable 
conditions for western capital investment kotas 37 said in 
remarks prepared for appearances thursday in washington 
a critic of the communist regime who fled czechoslovakia in 
1979 kotas has been living in ottawa canada he said he plans to 
return to prague jan 13 to organize the new party bringing 
together conservatives in the homeland with those in exile 
an early move will be to propose that the federal assembly order 
redistribution among all parties of part of the money amassed by 
the communist party in decades of misrule kotas said 
campaign financing will be crucial to fair elections he said 
along with equal radio and television time 
election observers from classically democratic countries 
should be invited kotas said their presence might be a technical 
infringement of sovereignty but it is justified after 40 years of 
dictatorship kotas said 
czechoslovakia managed to break free of communist rule 
peacefully in late november because at the crucial moment the 
kremlin messaged the faltering leadership that it would not help 
them kotas said triggering resignation of the entire politburo 
he termed the current coalition transition government led by 
anticommunist exdissident president vaclav havel and communist 
prime minister marian calfa his homelands best government since 
the 1948 communist takeover and the best possible at the moment 
kotas said he opted for allout conservativism feeling that the 
best antidote to communist misrule was to completely embrace its 
absolute opposite to adopt the western concept of freedom both 
political and economic he credited the heritage foundation and 
similar conservative groups as playing a major role in my 
intellectual and political maturing 
some czechoslovak experts question how far the country will 
abandon socialist economics precommunist presidents tomas g 
masaryk and eduard benes were social democrats they recalled 
ohio state university history and journalism professor jiri 
hochman said in his opinion the czechoslovaks want democracy but 
at the same time dont want to give up social security or job 
security 
hochman noted that havel has upheld full employment social 
security and national health service in terms similar to those used 
by the communist reformer assembly chairman alexander dubcek

it went through my walls it went through my bedsprings it went 
through my kitchen it went through my furniture said roddy who 
was watching television in her bedroom when the assault occurred 
it makes me angry it makes me so angry i am so full of rage

the dollar finished the first trading day of the 
year stronger against the japanese yen and its rise thursday sent 
share prices on the tokyo stock exchange moderately lower 
after opening higher at 14555 yen the dollar closed the day of 
trading at 14520 yen 180 yen above its previous close of 14340 
yen on friday financial markets were closed monday through 
wednesday for the holidays 
the official bank of japan sold hundreds of millions of dollars 
in an attempt to drive down the value of the us currency 
despite the initial intervention the dollar rose to the days 
high of 14572 yen during the morning session repeated infusions 
of dollars by the central bank turned the currency around to a low 
of 14490 yen shortly before the morning close 
in the afternoon the dollar recrossed the 145yen line and then 
traded in a fairly narrow range 
mitsuhiko kinugasa a dealer at daiwa bank said the central 
bank sold about 500 million during the morning session and an 
equal amount in currency markets overseas during the previous two 
days 
kinugasa termed the intervention successful the dollar was 
not as strong as it might have been 
the central bank does not comment on its monetary policies 
in a halfday session of trading on the tokyo stock exchange 
share prices fell on news of the dollars strength the leading 
market barometer finished the session down 20299 points to 
3871288 a drop of 052 percent on a first section volume of 400 
million shares 
the stock markets decline reversed four days of gains in the 
last few trading sessions of 1989 and stood in contrast to other 
major exchanges 
masahiro umemori of nomura securities investment research 
division said the market was discouraged by the dollars rise 
umemori said the tokyo market went against the global current 
today falling despite rises on the major markets overseas 
a weak bond market also contributed to the slide he said

a federal judge has ruled an injured 
political protester was not legally responsible for traumatizing 
those who injured him 
crewmen of a navy weapons train that ran over and maimed s 
brian willson in 1987 cannot sue the activist and his fellow 
demonstrators for causing them emotional distress us district 
judge robert peckham said in a pretrial ruling released wednesday 
im sure its a great relief to brian willson and his wife to 
no longer be facing claims that theyre required to compensate the 
crew for emotional distress caused by running over them said 
their chief lawyer thomas steel 
peckham also threw out willsons suit against the commander of 
the concord naval weapons station saying the commander did not 
cause the incident but the judge ruled evidence that the train was 
intended to scare demonstrators off the tracks may be enough to 
show a violation of their constitutional rights 
trial is scheduled april 24 in a suit by willson his wife 
holley rauen and three others against the government the train 
crewmen and two supervisors at the naval station east of san 
francisco 
willson lost his legs as a result of the incident 
the crewmens lawyer william kolin did not return a telephone 
call wednesday 
willson and others opposing us arms shipments to central 
america held a demonstration sept 1 1987 at the concord naval 
weapons station where they said the weapons shipments were 
originating a train from the station hit him as he sat on the 
tracks severing both legs at the knee others on the tracks were 
able to jump away though one man had to leap onto the locomotive 
the suit contends the navy and individual supervisors were given 
ample warning of the plan to stay on the tracks and that the crew 
had plenty of time to stop 
the three civilian crewmen engineer david humiston conductor 
ralph dawson and brakeman robert mayfield denied wrongdoing and 
said in their countersuit that the demonstrators had acted 
deliberately or recklessly to cause the crew emotional distress 
peckham ruled that the demonstrators did not violate the 
crewmens rights even if as the crew argued willson and his 
colleagues were prepared to risk being run over by the train to 
advance their political views 
the munitions train could have stopped short of the protesters 
and the ensuing mutilation of mr willson and emotional distress of 
the crew members would have been avoided peckham said 
he said a reasonable jury could not conclude that the 
protesters acts made it inevitable that the train would run them 
over

some employers are confused about how much 
social security tax they are supposed to withhold this year because 
of a late change made by congress 
the social security administration announced in october that 
consistent with the law at that time earnings up to 50400 would 
be subject to the payroll tax in 1990 
in november however congress increased the figure to 51300 
as part of a deficitreduction bill 
steve pyrek a spokesman for the internal revenue service said 
the annual tax guide sent to employers late last year said the 
wage base would be 50400 a notice that the figure has been 
increased to 51300 will go out in a mailing later this month 
listing tax law changes he said 
earnings above the wage base are exempt from social security 
taxes 
theres been confusion because people are getting publications 
and various irs documents that have what was correct 
information thats now incorrect pyrek said 
social security administration spokesman frank battistelli said 
his agency plans a special mailing this month to 400 business and 
trade groups publicizing the change in the 1990 figure 
the wage base has gone up every year since 1971 with the latest 
increase affecting about 104 million workers and selfemployed 
individuals who have annual earnings over last years maximum of

president bush declaring a complete victory 
in panama now that manuel antonio noriega has surrendered to face 
us drug charges now confronts a legal and political thicket 
noriega formerly associated with the cia might seek to use 
classified government materials in his defense against 
drugtrafficking charges in florida 
that seemed far from the presidents mind as he hastened into 
the white house press briefing room wednesday night to declare 
victory and tell reporters that the deposed panamanian dictator was 
finally in us custody 
bush admittedly frustrated over months of inability to remove 
noriega from panama called the surrender a significant 
milestone showing the success of the us military invasion that 
put noriega on the run and forced him into the sanctuary arms of 
the roman catholic church 
now looms noriegas trial on drugtrafficking charges and the 
possibility that his defense will seek to introduce classified 
documents from his years of working with us intelligence 
officials 
such material could be particularly sensitive regarding the 
period in 1976 when bush was director of the cia and noriega was 
cooperating with the agency as an informant in addition bush was 
vice president during the early 1980s while noriega was still in 
the good graces of the us government 
a defense bid to use classified material the administration may 
want kept secret could mirror the strategy used by oliver north and 
others in the irancontra affair some irancontra charges were 
dropped but justice department officials have said they do not 
expect any secrecy problems to scuttle the charges that noriega 
received 10 million for protecting drugtrafficking operations 
bush said last week he did not fear noriega might disclose any 
cia information that could embarrass him or the government 
i think thats history and i think that the main thing is 
that he should be tried and brought to justice and we are pursuing 
that course with no fear of that the president said 
prosecutors anticipate that noriega will claim that his alleged 
drug activities were sanctioned by the us government because he 
was a cia informant but the government is expected to argue that 
having been an informant does not make noriega immune from 
prosecution 
bush and his aides insist noriega will get a fair trial 
in fact one of the conditions under which noriega agreed to 
surrender white house officials said was a fair trial that would 
not lead to the death penalty which is allowed for some drug 
kingpins 
noriegas surrender came at the end of a day when bush kept a 
low profile making few public appearances as rumors of a possible 
surrender flew and tension mounted around the white house 
it wasnt until he returned from playing racquetball at 630 
pm est that bush learned his nemesis had agreed to leave the 
vaticans panama city embassy and surrender aides said word came 
from defense secretary dick cheney at about 9 pm that noriega was 
in us military custody 
bush drafted a statement and rushed to the briefing room to 
deliver the news less than an hour later 
it was a moment he has long wanted to savor 
bush inherited the noriega problem from president reagan whose 
administration turned against noriega following years of nurturing 
the us relationship with him because of his value as an 
intelligence source 
bush continued reagans economic sanctions against panama and 
urged the panamanian people to rise up and throw him out 
yet when a group of panamanian defense forces officers mounted a 
coup attempt against noriega in october the united states did not 
provide backup help that might have helped them succeed a lapse 
for which bush was widely criticized 
perhaps still smarting from that missed opportunity he sent in 
the military on dec 20 driving noriega into hiding and eventually 
to the vatican embassy in panama city 
the bush penchant for secrecy came into play in negotiations to 
get noriega out of the vatican sanctuary his aides denied that a 
team led by deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to 
panama on tuesday was involved in negotiations for noriegas 
release instead they said the group was focusing on economic 
relief for the invasionravaged nation 
however at days end gen maxwell thurman commander of the 
us southern command said in panama city that the eagleburger 
team was instrumental in arranging noriegas surrender

backers of a proposal to allow casino 
gambling in ohio have begun a sixcity promotional tour intended to 
muster public support for the creation of special gambling resort 
districts 
the tour kicked off wednesday in lorain where promoter alan 
spitzer wants to build a 400 million casino a pilot project he 
says could create 3500 to 4000 jobs at the resort and 5000 to 
6000 spinoff jobs related to the complex in northeast ohio 
in toledo wednesday afternoon the promoters said the proposed 
resort districts could create thousands of new jobs and attract 
tourists from all over the midwest 
there has been a tremendous amount of support across the 
state spitzer said at a news conference in toledo 
toledo mayor john mchugh said wednesday that while he opposes 
gambling some people have suggested that a casino complex could 
revitalize the citys ailing riverfront district 
i want to look at the proposal how its going to be set up 
the mayor said you always hear when you have gambling or a 
casino that theres always crime and corruption and the mafia 
certainly i dont want to see that in toledo 
spitzer a prime backer of the lorain proposal said his group 
known as luv ohio committee luv stands for let us vote has 
enough signatures on petitions to give voters the chance to vote on 
the issue 
the tour was geared toward cities that also would be allowed to 
conduct local option votes on casinos if voters support the 
referendum which would amend a section of the state constitution 
that prohibits casino gambling 
spitzer also planned stops in cincinnati and dayton today and 
steubenville and youngstown on friday 
the group plans to travel to columbus next tuesday to submit 
petitions to the secretary of state who will determine whether 
there are enough valid signatures to allow a referendum on the 
casino issue the committee needs 306661 signatures of registered 
voters spitzer says it has more than 500000 
the amendment would establish a pilot casino project in lorain 
that would run for five years said anthony giardini a lawyer and 
secretary of the committee 
after three years the legislature could review the lorain 
project and authorize similar resort projects in seven areas of 
ohio 
in a resort district only one hotel would be allowed and 
developers would have to bid for the project giardini said no 
state or federal money could be used to help a developer build a 
casino and no tax abatments would be given 
in addition 10 percent of a casinos gross revenues would be 
taxed of that 2 percent would help rebuild innercity 
neighborhoods

the magellan spacecraft speeding toward 
cloudshrouded venus on a 550 million mapping expedition will 
need frequent commands from earth until nasa fixes a computer 
problem 
despite the failure of a computer chip on the spaceship 
theres no threat to the mission said edwin sherry a 
technical assistant at the space agencys jet propulsion laboratory 
until engineers locate the faulty chip they must send magellan 
new commands every other day to make sure it is pointing in the 
proper direction sherry said wednesday 
he said a similar computer chip failure happened before magellan 
was launched and that such a failure is expected about once 
annually 
youd hope for zero faults like this sherry said but 
theyre typical of working with stateoftheart equipment its 
remarkable we have so few 
magellan was launched from space shuttle atlantis on may 4 it 
will go into a polar orbit around venus on aug 10 
about 18 days later it will start using its radar to peer 
through the planets thick clouds spending at least 243 days 
making maps that will reveal the landscape of at least 70 percent 
of the planet 
magellan was nearly 112 million miles from earth and 107 million 
miles from venus on wednesday since its launch it has traveled a 
curving path of 424 million miles and still has 369 million miles 
to go before reaching the second planet from the sun sherry said 
the problem developed sunday as the spacecraft got ready to take 
a fix on two distant stars to make sure it was pointing the right 
way an error was detected in a tiny part of magellans computer 
memory 
the error prompted magellan to shift to a backup computer and 
point its solar panels toward the sun to increase the power supply 
the failure was apparently the result of electrical corrosion at 
a junction between two types of material on a single memory chip 
leaving the chip unable to remember anything sherry said 
he said however engineers havent yet ruled out the 
possibility that the chip was damaged by an electrically charged 
particle spewed out by the sun which is near the peak of its 
11year cycle of activity 
magellan uses gyroscopes to sense when pressure from solar wind 
makes the spacecraft drift slightly or point in the wrong 
direction the gyroscopes normally issue automatic commands to 
three spinning wheels which correct the spacecrafts alignment 
magellans main computer is programmed to take a fix on the two 
stars each day to determine the spacecrafts actual alignment if 
this star calibration shows the gyroscopes failed to align 
magellan correctly they again command the wheels to adjust the 
crafts position 
magellan continued to operate on its backup computer once the 
faulty chip is located scientists hope within a few days a new 
computer program will be sent to the spacecraft so the main 
computer can be used while the faulty chip is bypassed sherry said 
engineers working on the problem are at jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena and martin marietta in denver the company 
built magellan and is responsible for its daily operations under 
national aeronautics and space administration supervision

the dollar rose sharply against the yen despite 
central bank intervention today the first day of 1990 trading in

bank sold about 500 million in the morning session after selling 
an equal amount in currency markets overseas on the previous two 
days to check the dollars rise 
because of the bank of japan intervention the dollar was not 
as strong as it might have been he said 
another dealer speaking on condition of anonymity estimated 
the central banks total dollar sales today at 600 million to 700 
million 
this was not as much as expected he said but added that 
concentrated selling in the morning had the intended effect 
the central bank does not comment on its money market activities 
masafumi koyama chief customer dealer at the bank of tokyo 
said new york dealers sold dollars on the tokyo market in the 
morning to square their positions helping to push the dollar 
down from its opening level

below the 145yen line

scores of panamanian 
exiles and others converged outside this base in a spontaneous 
party early today with hopes of seeing fallen dictator manuel 
antonio noriega in custody 
while dozens of reporters photographers and camera operators 
stood by waiting for noriega to arrive from panama city the crowd 
banged pots and pans waved panamanian flags and chanted down 
with noriega and pineapple face 
a c130 carrying noriega landed at the base at 245 am and he 
was whisked away none of the celebrants apparently saw him 
bernardo matos 27 was one of a group of people waving a 
panamanian flag outside the gates of the base about 25 miles south 
of miami he said he quickly made his way to homestead once he 
heard late wednesday that noriega had surrendered to us officials 
in panama ending a stay at the vatican embassy 
i want to see noriega in handcuffs said matos thats the 
way he treated the people of panama 
us sen connie mack also turned up to wait for noriegas 
arrival 
the florida republican was an observer at panamas general 
elections last may 7 those elections were later nullified by 
noriega 
my heart really goes out to the panamanian people mack 
said to have been there and to have seen the hope for a free and 
fair election stolen from them was a tragedy the panamanians are 
the real winners here 
anticastro cubanamericans also turned up one holding a sign 
reading noriega today castro tomorrow 
damaris dominguez 25 left her native panama three years ago 
it means freedom i just want to see she said i want to 
make sure noriega gets a trial 
she said panamanians had expected last months us invasion to 
remove noriega from power but hadnt expected it to come so soon 
we are celebrating she said adding the wait was no 
inconvenience we are having kind of a party so we dont mind 
vilma san miguel 40 who left panama 1 years ago to settle in 
miami was holding a spoon and pan chanting 
this is like a symbol of the opposition she said i hope 
noriega hears me

chemotherapy drugs that were used to treat ovarian 
cancer may have sharply increased the risk of leukemia a study has 
found 
researchers found that among women treated between 1960 and 
1985 the risk of leukemia was 12 times higher in those who 
received chemotherapy rather than surgery alone according to the 
study published in todays new england journal of medicine 
although the study did not measure the benefits of treatment 
chemotherapy drugs given during that time frequently failed to stop 
ovarian cancer but doctors say that newer drugs now in use against 
this form of cancer are more effective and their benefits probably 
outweigh their risks 
the research directed by dr john m kaldor of the 
international agency for research on cancer in lyon france was 
based on 114 women with leukemia who were among 99113 survivors of 
ovarian cancer in seven european countries and canada 
doctors have long known that the powerful medicines used to 
attack cancer may also cause the disease the latest research 
demonstrates the magnitude of this risk 
in a second study the same researchers found that the risk of 
leukemia is also substantially increased in people given 
chemotherapy for hodgkins disease another form of cancer but 
since hodgkins disease is often curable with drugs the benefits 
of treatment clearly outweigh the risks 
in this work the doctors reviewed 163 cases of leukemia among 
29552 hodgkins disease patients they found that the risk of 
leukemia was nine times higher among those who got chemotherapy 
instead of radiation treatment 
the risk in hodgkins disease is well worth it because the 
treatment does extend life in ovarian cancer its not necessarily 
worth it commented dr charles a coltman jr of the university 
of texas health science center at san antonio 
several of the cancer drugs taken by the european women for 
ovarian cancer are no longer used 
management of ovarian cancer is moving ahead very rapidly 
said coltman some of the more recent studies suggest an impact 
on survival that outweighs the increased risk of leukemia

families of the victims of pan am flight 103 
which was blown up over scotland a year ago have no right to sue 
for millions of dollars in punitive damages a judge has ruled 
us district thomas c platt ruled wednesday that the warsaw 
convention governing international flights bars such claims 
whether or not willful misconduct exists 
more than 150 lawsuits each seeking 5 million to 25 million 
in compensatory damages and 5 million to 25 million in punitive 
damages have been filed in the crash 
were disappointed with the result but this is not going to 
be the last word on the matter said steven pounian a lawyer for 
the victims 
he said he would likely file an immediate appeal of the ruling 
by platt 
under the terms of the warsaw convention compensatory damages 
due survivors is generally limited to 75000 
in his ruling platt criticized the treatys monetary limits 
saying the limit adds insult to injury 
james m shaughnessy a lawyer for pan american world airways 
said platt was eminently correct with his ruling and we are very 
pleased with it 
lawyers for the victims families had argued that even if 
punitive claims are generally barred a provision of the treaty 
article 24 provides that when willful misconduct exists the 
liability limits of the warsaw convention are inapplicable and thus 
punitive damage claims should be determined by referring to 
local law according to court papers 
in his 16page ruling platt agreed with pan am lawyers 
interpretation that article 24 actually seems to be persuasive 
evidence that the warsaw convention intended to bar punitive damage 
claims 
the pan am flight originated in frankfurt west germany and 
changed in london to a larger boeing 747 the jetliner was en route 
from london to new york when it exploded over lockerbie scotland 
on dec 21 1988 killing 259 passengers and crew members and 11 
people on the ground 
the lawsuits allege that pan am and its security service alert 
management systems inc did not adequately protect flight 103 and 
its passengers from a terrorist bomb attack and were negligent in 
not alerting passengers to telephone threats against the airline 
investigators in europe have found evidence linking a radical 
palestinian faction to the bombing government officials have said 
according to news reports investigators believe a bomb was 
hidden in a bag checked on a flight that originated in malta and 
connected with the pan am jetliner in frankfurt 
the luggage was reportedly allowed on the plane even though it 
was apparently not checked in by any passenger aboard the plane

general motors corp unveiled a prototype 
electric car it says outpaces some gasburning sports cars and runs 
twice as far between charges than previous electric models 
the twoseater impact which tapers at the rear like a citroen 
can travel 120 miles at 55 mph before recharging and zooms from 0 
to 60 mph in eight seconds gm chairman roger smith said at a news 
conference wednesday 
the public perceives electric vehicles as golf carts smith 
said the impact absolutely shatters that perception 
gm showed a film in which the impact outpaced a mazda miata and 
a nissan 300 zx on a levelground acceleration test 
john zwerner gms executive director of advanced product 
engineering said the prototype has never been crashtested or 
passed other government tests and would go into production only if 
extensive tests find a market for it 
boasting a top speed of 75 mph the impact can be charged 
halfway in as little as half an hour and almost fully recharged in 
six hours gm said most electric vehicles need up to 12 hours for 
a full recharging 
electric cars are virtually nonpolluting and are under close 
scrutiny in los angeles by environmental officials who are enacting 
stringent air quality rules 
he declined to reveal how much gm had spent developing the 
vehicle or to estimate a price although he said it would have to 
be competitive in price with existing internal combustionpowered 
cars 
a person driving a gaspowered car in los angeles 10000 miles a 
year might now spend about 30 a month on fuel and another 10 on 
maintenance smith said 
the impact would use a maximum of 12 per month in electricity 
under the same conditions but would still cost about twice as much 
to operate because the batteries must be replaced every 20000 
miles adding another 70 a month to operating costs smith said 
zwerner said that within three years improvements in batteries 
may make it possible for the impact to double its battery life to 
40000 miles which would make operating costs nearly equal to 
those of gaspowered cars 
the 120mile range is not expected to be improved much 
officials said 
youve got to keep in mind that this is not a car for driving 
to new york he said but as a second car running around la 
i think its great 
smith said gm might need to produce as many as 100000 of the 
vehicles a year for them to compete with cars powered by 
internalcombustion engines 
each of the big three automakers has aggressive programs to 
research cars powered by fuels other than gasoline but smith said 
the impact was far more advanced than any other electric car

the government today rejected what it 
called immoral demands by more than 4000 railworkers who have shut 
down the nations largest port in the first major strike during 15 
years of independence 
the strike at the main railway and port complex in maputo the 
capital began tuesday when employees of mozambique railways 
stopped work to demand a yearend bonus and payment of wage arrears 
dating back to 1987 
the national news agency aim said 4000 of the 6500 railway 
employees at the complex joined the strike tuesday and the entire 
workforce there including dockworkers stopped work wednesday 
amid reports of coercion 
aim said some dockworkers began returning to their jobs today 
but the railway workers remained on strike 
the transport ministry announced today that wage arrears would 
be paid to three of seven categories of workers and promised full 
implementation of wages scales approved in 1987 but the ministry 
rejected demands for a bonus saying a moneylosing company like 
the railroad could not afford such a step 
in the extremely serious economic situation facing mozambique 
railways the demand for an endofyear bonus has no rationale and 
is immoral a ministry statement said 
the ministry noted that mozambiques railways have been a prime 
target of antigovernment rebels during a 13yearold insurgency 
major rail lines linking maputo to zimbabwe and south africa 
have been shut down frequently by sabotage during the war causing 
hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for the railway 
the minium wage for industrial workers in mozambique is 22500 
meticais a month equivalent to only 27 because of recent 
devaluations no information was available as to the average wage 
of the railway workers 
aim said the strike was the first of major significance since 
mozambique became independent of portugal in 1975 the leftist 
government which last year dropped marxism as its official 
ideology has allowed trade union activities but up until now has 
not faced serious confrontations 
the transport ministry accused strikers of trying to coerce 
other workers at the port complex into joining the strike saying 
such actions were extremely incorrect and dangerous 
it said the strikers resorted to physical threats against 
their colleagues and blocked the entrance to their workplace 
the ministry urged the railway management to take immediate 
disciplinary steps against elements who contine to seriously 
disturb the normal activity of the company

legalized public rallies following the creation of an executive 
committee that will have final say on how the country is run until

take all the necessary measures so that they should proceed 
peacefully and they also must notify police 48 hours in advance 
rompres said 
under ousted dictator nicolae ceausescu demonstrations were 
banned unless they were staged in support of his leadership 
ceausescu and his wife elena the countrys secondincommand 
were toppled in a popular revolution and tried and executed 
christmas day on charges of genocide and other grave crimes during 
24 years of despotic rule

bucharest during the revolution will move into spacious apartments 
ceausescu built for his security forces in the city media said 
today 
the 110 apartments were intended for security police who were to

that was not completed and have been vacant for four years 
thousands of old homes and landmarks were razed to make way for the 
palace 
on wednesday the military chief of staff denied foreign news 
reports that the revolution was planned several months in advance 
but he acknowledged that tensions had been rising 
the revolution was spontaneous but the discontent had been 
piling up for years col gen vasile ionel told reporters 
civilians and the military alike had felt the hardships the 
army was dissatisfied by the way it was treated as a labor force on 
huge projects without any use for romania he said

killed during the uprising in fierce street fighting with ceausescu 
loyalists he did not give a figure for enlisted men or civilians

of ceausescu was named first deputy 
mazilu blasted the old regime in a report smuggled out of

dead all over the country just how many died in the revolution 
will be found out later on

the army and fired upon the people the dead there are not victims 
of bullets fired by soldiers of the romanian army ionel said 
at least six political parties have been formed to compete in 
the april elections 
a spokesman for one of them nicolae costel of the romanian 
democratic party said wednesday that he believed the elections

the american red cross has issued emergency 
appeals for blood donations in several parts of the nation but 
other regions have enough to ensure an adequate supply in case of 
disaster 
critical shortages were reported in parts of arizona florida 
georgia michigan new jersey pennsylvania and virginia while 
most of the nation was simply experiencing a normal postholiday 
tightening of supplies 
but the blood supply was at its strongest level in 11 years in 
los angeles and orange counties in california red cross 
spokeswoman cheryle babbit said 
the pennjersey region of american red cross blood services said 
its shortage was threatening patient care at hospitals in 
southeastern pennsylvania and southern new jersey 
the region which provides 94 percent of the blood used in 93 
hospitals needs about 1750 donors a day and was down to about 
1000 donors daily 
supplies are so low that over new years weekend we curtailed 
distribution of red cells and platelets sharply and worked with 
physicians and hospitals on a casebycase basis regional 
director dr william c sherwood said 
a heart bypass operation was postponed for two hours tuesday at 
albert einstein medical center in philadelphia because of the 
shortage said dr ierachmiel daskal chairman of the hospitals 
department of pathology 
if you have a limited amount of product you must use it the 
best way you can daskal said we have not had to cancel 
surgery yet but we have had to postpone and reshuffle the 
schedule 
the red cross collects about 62 million units of blood per 
year or more than half the nations blood supply a unit is 450 
milliliters or slightly less than a pint 
blood and blood products are used to replace blood lost by 
patients to stop bleeding by forming blood clots to fight severe 
infection and to increase the oxygencarrying ability of the blood 
during surgery 
severe cold weather and flu outbreaks combined with the usual 
drop in donations at holiday time to create the scattered 
shortages red cross officials said 
im not having any indication that were having a general 
shortage across the country said pat davis a national red cross 
spokeswoman in washington if a major emergency occurred blood 
supplies from around the country could be released to areas in 
need she said 
in atlanta daily donations had dropped to half the 900 units 
collected normally and an emergency appeal was issued for type o 
blood we need 800 donors over the next few days to get supplies 
back to a safe level said ann wilcox spokeswoman for the red 
cross blood bank serving more than 100 hospitals in 82 georgia 
counties 
similar emergency appeals were under way in the south florida 
great lakes southern arizona and tidewater va blood regions 
ms davis said 
blood supplies generally tighten every year during the holiday 
season and during the summer because donors are busy with other 
activities in arizona a flu outbreak contributed to the drop in 
donations while two severe ice storms kept donors home in 
virginia red cross officials said 
our shelves are bare said red cross spokeswoman chris 
chidley in miami where the organization usually has at least a 
threeday supply of blood about 1500 pints tuesdays inventory 
was down to 300 pints for 66 hospitals from key west to palm beach 
janet connor administrator for the central illinois community 
blood bank in springfield ill said the seasonal shortage there 
was being met by aggressive phone calls to potential donors we 
dont end our day unless we get enough she said 
mary joe smith manager of the parkland blood donor center in 
dallas said an increased number of accidents over the holiday 
season helped create a shortage there it wasnt critical enough to 
curtail elective surgery but a liver transplant was delayed by a 
short supply of one blood type

exultant panamanians danced in the 
streets and embraced american soldiers when they heard that gen 
manuel antonio noriega who intimidated them for years had left 
the vatican embassy and surrendered to us troops 
the people feel a sense of peace knowing that the monster is 
leaving our land said president guillermo endara who was a 
frequent target of noriegas thugs 
the ousted strongman decided to give up wednesday night after 
realizing that he was cornered that even his longtime supporters 
had turned against him the archbishop of panama marcos mcgrath 
said today 
once the vatican had made it quite clear that he was not a 
diplomatic nor political refugee but rather a refugee with 
criminal charges against him it was quite clear he could not go 
to a third country therefore his choice was simply panama or the 
states mcgrath told abcs good morning america 
after hundreds of angry panamanians staged an antinoriega 
protest outside the vatican embassy on wednesday afternoon noriega 
began to realize how much feeling there is against him in panama 
that its much safer going to the states mcgrath said 
jubilation gripped the capital of 1 million residents seconds 
after radio and television announced that noriega who ruled panama 
six years with no popular mandate had given up after evading 
american troops sent in to capture him dec 20 
its over its over people shouted as leaning out of 
their cars and blaring their horns some people screamed themselves 
hoarse 
people ran up to the us military roadblocks and hugged and 
kissed us soldiers they banged pots and pans and fireworks 
exploded in the sky around the vatican mission 
youngsters raced around waving panamanian and us flags 
thank god panama can now feel like a free country said 
moises rios 20 one of hundreds outside the vatican embassy 
minutes after noriega left 
a vatican embassy spokesman said noriega left of his own 
will in his generals uniform shortly before 9 pm wednesday 
as soon as he walked out he was arrested by us soldiers who 
had surrounded the building since he sought refuge there christmas 
eve 
noriega was whisked by helicopter to howard air base west of the 
capital and flown by military transport to florida where he faces 
drug trafficking charges 
the surrender took place just hours after about 20000 people 
shouting no more and assassin marched to the vatican 
embassy to demand noriegas surrender 
noriega was said to have been under strict isolation at the 
mission on orders of the papal nuncio or ambassador 
mcgrath said he saw little of noriega in the embassy but from 
what i hear while he was there he kept pretty much to himself and 
was downcast and a bit moody 
the television in the room noriega used was broken but noriega 
must have heard the protesters and knew from radio reports 
broadcast by us loudspeakers that his supporters had abandoned 
him 
less than an hour after noriega surrendered president bush 
announced victory in washington his apprehension and return to 
the united states should send a clear signal that the united states 
is serious in its determination that those charged with promoting 
the distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of justice 
bush also paid tribute to servicemen who were killed and wounded 
in the invasion saying their sacrifice has been a noble cause 
by official count 23 american soldiers and three american 
civilians were killed in the fighting more than 300 american 
troops were wounded at least 290 panamanian soldiers and about 300 
civilians were killed 
gen maxwell thurman of the us southern command said american 
forces had only a few minutes notice before noriega surrendered 
noriegas surrender ended days of bargaining in the end he got 
three concessions to be allowed to make a few phone calls and wear 
his uniform and that his decision to give himself up be kept 
secret until his arrest 
sources in washington also said vatican officials relayed to 
noriega assurances he wouldnt be tried on a federal drug kingpin 
statute that carries the death penalty 
the surrender came after a visit by deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger and vatican diplomat monsignor giacinto 
berloco and thurman thanked eagleburger for his efforts 
administration sources said the united states did not deal 
directly with noriega at any time and that all negotiations were 
through church officials 
the vatican embassy said in a statement after noriegas 
departure that he considered the situation serious and took the 
responsible decision to leave of his own will the residence of the 
popes representative 
noriega made no public statements during his stay in the vatican 
compound 
thurman said noriega didnt say anything when he was spirited 
out but added that the former strongman looked vigorous looked 
confident he looked fine 
vice president guillermo ford familiar to us television 
viewers as the bloodyshirted victim of a beating by noriega 
loyalists in may said noriega would be returned to panama for 
trial on a long list of charges after his trial in the united 
states 
no revenge due process he said on abcs nightline 
officials of panamas new government have said they plan to 
charge noriega with murder in the deaths of officers who led a 
failed oct 3 coup and were allegedly slain after their capture

the vatican declared today that gen manuel 
antonio noriega voluntarily left its embassy in panama and was 
given no special guarantees before turning himself over to us 
authorities 
in giving the vaticans first official comment on noriegas 
leaving the embassy spokesman joaquin navarro insisted that the 
holy see did not give in to us demands that church officials hand 
over the deposed dictator 
it did not consist of a handover but a free decision by 
noriega to leave the embassy where he sought refuge on dec 24 
four days after us troops invaded panama navarro told reporters 
at an earlyafternoon briefing 
navarro said he did not know what prompted noriegas decision to 
surrender wednesday night to us forces who had been surrounding 
the vatican mission noriega was flown to florida where he faces 
federal drugtrafficking charges 
noriega gave the papal nuncio or representative a letter for 
pope john paul ii navarro said adding he did not know its 
contents he said the nuncio monsignor jose sebastian laboa 
accompanied noriega out of the embassy into a catholic school 
across the street where the general was seized by us troops 
in panama city marcos mcgrath the archbishop of panama said 
today that noriega gave up after realizing that he was cornered 
that even his longtime supporters had turned against him 
once the vatican had made it quite clear that he was not a 
diplomatic nor political refugee but rather a refugee with 
criminal charges against him it was quite clear he could not go 
to a third country therefore his choice was simply panama or the 
states mcgrath told abcs good morning america 
navarro said of noriegas surrender international law has 
been respected this is a solution that was taken voluntarily by 
noriega himself 
throughout the negotiations between us and vatican officials 
to try to end the stalemate the holy see had stressed that its 
nunciature like any other accredited embassy was empowered to 
deal directly only with the host country and thus it would have 
been impossible under international law to hand over noriega 
directly to us authorities 
navarro said that while noriegas surrender to us authorities 
might appear as if the vatican had given in to us demands from 
the point of view of international law the situation was 
completely different 
he said the vatican had provided noriega with no guarantees but 
that the nuncio had explained how the us justice system works 
with its provisions for fair trials 
asked if the united states got want it wanted navarro replied 
if this is all viewed like a game of soccer its ridiculous i 
said from the beginning of the negotiations that this is not a 
matter of who wins who loses 
navarro said he did not know exactly what element prompted 
noriega to leave his refuge at the nunciature but that the general 
probably had reflected on such issues as the future of panama 
and his responsibilities to the nation 
while officials of the roman catholic church and the us 
administration debated noriegas fate he was described as being 
kept isolated in a small room with a broken television unable to 
receive visitors or phone calls 
navarro the popes chief spokesman said he had not spoken to 
the pontiff about the resolution of the case but added i suspose 
the holy father has been pleased with the outcome 
he said that before leaving the nunciature noriega asked for a 
memento of his stay but didnt know what the souvenir was 
four colleagues of noriega remained in the vatican embassy 
navarro said a captain a colonel the former panamanian director 
of immigration and the wife of one of them navarro said he did not 
immediately have their identification 
negotiations were expected to continue over their fate 
throughout the negotiations the vatican stressed that noriega 
was being sheltered but that no granting of political asylum had 
been made 
it also stressed that the papal nuncio agreed to let noreiga 
into the mission only after he pledged to use his influence to get 
his supporters to quit resisting the united states forces and the 
vatican portrayed the whole affair as a means to stop bloodshed 
before noriega showed up at the embassy the pope had decried 
the loss of life caused by the us invasion of the strategic 
central american nation

toughtalking and heavyhanded while 
in power gen manuel antonio noriega spent his last days in panama 
as a refugee in the vatican embassy mostly keeping to himself in a 
state of nervous isolation 
while little information has been released on his 10day stay 
details gleaned through telephone calls to the papal mission 
indicate the toppled ruler found himself with little to do 
in the end vatican embassy workers shunned noriega who was 
confined largely to a simple room with a crucifix and a broken 
television set 
outside people howled for his expulsion from the vatican 
mission and trial in panama or in the united states 
the defense forces that had kept him in power for six years were 
crushed quickly by invading us troops on dec 20 and reduced to a 
handful of holdouts who surrendered or were captured 
noriega sought refuge at the vatican embassy on christmas eve 
officials there urged him to leave and although it was said they 
would not throw him out it was no secret he was hardly welcome 
panamas top churchman archbishop marcos mcgrath said publicly 
that noriega would stand a better chance of a fair trial and decent 
treatment in the united states than in panama 
panama said it had no jail to hold him and third countries that 
might have been acceptable destinations to people calling the shots 
werent interested in granting the ousted strongman asylum 
the man who was cheered by thousands weeks earlier was wanted 
only by the united states and there only for his hide 
he saw himself as something of an emperor in this part of the 
world and i think that dream has been shattered mcgrath said on 
abcs nightline wednesday night 
his detractors who called him pineapple face because of his 
acnescarred countenance hung pineapples over the streets and used 
sticks to smash them to yellow sticky pulp 
thousands of people wore noriegabuster tshirts depicting 
pineapples with a red circle and slash 
how much of this noriega knew is uncertain but radio reports of 
his bank accounts being frozen his military support wilting and 
his cronies being captured were blared over loudspeakers by 
american troops around the vatican embassy 
hours before he gave up tens of thousands of panamanians 
gathered near the compound demanding he leave 
no doubt much of this came as a shock to the stocky 
upfromtheslums city kid whose early military career by most 
accounts was brilliant and promising 
he was cornered mcgrath said today of noriegas decision to 
give up he had come to the vatican embassy looking for 
refuge because he was cornered physically militarily and as 
the days went by it became more obvious he would not be able to get 
to a third country the archbishop told nbcs today show 
the protest outside the embassy wednesday night further 
convinced noriega there was no way out mcgrath said 
i have often wondered if he really knew what people thought 
about him luis martinz an aide to president guillermo endara 
said earlier this week 
i have known him for a long time and i have to admit that at 
one time i liked him he was sort of shy and selfeffacing he knew 
i was in the opposition but he never tried to change my mind 
but he wasnt like that at all in the more recent years 
martinz was jailed by noriega for two months earlier this year 
for his activities with the opposition 
as the heir to omar torrijos the strongman who signed the 1977 
treaties by which the united states cedes control of the panama 
canal noriega did have support among the poor and the black and 
chinese minorities 
even when the united states attacked in overwhelming force 
there were panamanians willing to die for noriega 
but in the end there was no massive pool of support or faith of 
the kind that allowed hungarian cardinal josef mindszenty to 
survive 15 years in the us embassy in budapest 
the only time noriega is known to have socialized at the vatican 
embassy was on new years eve when the papal envoy sebastian 
laboa served a pasta dinner for all those at the mission 
noriega reportedly spoke little except to recall that his cook 
also made excellent pasta

six prodemocracy groups banded together 
today to challenge the communist party in national elections set 
for may creating a force likely to pose a serious threat to the 
once omnipotent communists 
steffen reiche a leader of the social democratic party of east 
germany announced that his group was entering a coalition with new 
forum the largest of the prodemocracy forces with 200000 members 
nationwide as well as with democracy now democratic awakening 
the initiative for peace and human rights and the united left 
the coalition is calling itself election alliance 90 reiche 
said 
he accused the communists of trying to stir up public fears of a 
resurgence of ultrarightist activity and use it against opposition 
groups 
communist party leaders marched wednesday night in the 
southeastern neighborhood of treptow to protest vandalism committed 
by neonazis over the past two weeks 
the official adn news agency said the march drew 250000 people 
but witnesses said that figure was inflated 
this country was born from antifascists communist party 
leader gregor gysi told the gathering at the site where rightist 
vandals last week defaced a soviet war memorial dont let it 
become the homeland for neofascists 
gysi said the rightists cannot be allowed to ruin the chances 
for a democratic socialism in east germany 
leaders of the opposition groups fear the communists are using 
the neonazi issue as a springboard to gain support for the may 
elections while at the same time discouraging calls in east 
germany for reunification of the two german states 
despite losing their constitutional mandate to rule during the 
fall prodemocracy movement the communists remain the strongest 
single political force in the country according to recent public 
opinion surveys 
but the new coalition pools the resources and voter support of 
the largest reform groups into a force likely to pose a serious 
challenge to the communists 
the may 6 elections will be the first free secret and 
competitive balloting in east germanys 40year history they will 
choose a new 500member parliament which will then select a new 
cabinet 
communist premier hans modrow is viewed as an interim government 
leader by the opposition forces who have pressed him to take the 
views of the rival political factions into consideration during 
weekly talks 
opposition leaders contend modrows cabinet has limited powers 
to govern because it was named by a parliament under the control of 
unelected communist party figures 
modrow enjoys relatively broad support as a transitional figure 
but there have been increasing opposition complaints that control 
of the government apparatus gives the communists an unfair 
advantage in elections

rival shiite moslem militias armed with 
artillery and machine guns clashed in south lebanon today despite 
the intervention of a palestinian guerrilla peacekeeping force 
three people were reported killed 
in beirut gen michel aoun the christian leader was entangled 
in a growing financial scandal caused by foreign news reports that 
he had 15 million stashed away in french banks 
the iranianbacked fundamentalist hezbollah of party of god 
and the secular syrianbacked amal militia have been battling for 
13 days in the latest campaign of their 2yearold war for control 
of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest sect 
including todays toll of three killed and 11 wounded police 
say 73 people have been killed and 263 wounded since fighting broke 
out dec 23 
police said 300 guerrillas from the fatah movement headed by 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat deployed 
wednesday across the strategic hamade hill that hezbollah captured 
tuesday after a fierce battle 
hezbollah needs to hold the hill to protect the supply lines to 
its southern bases from the bekaa valley in east lebanon a shiite 
stronghold where an estimated 2000 iranian revolutionary guards 
are based 
zeid wehbi fatahs political chief in the southern port city of 
sidon said the palestinian deployment was aimed at ending the 
fighting he said the guerrillas also sought to keep the fighting 
away from the palestinian refugee camps of ein elhilweh and mieh 
mmieh a few miles to the north 
palestinian sources said arafat fears that hezbollah which has 
gained the upper hand and captured five villages would provide 
support for dissident plo factions in the camps 
amal chief nabih berri appealed again today to iran to stop 
sending military supplies to hezbollah saying syria had 
discontinued the supply of arms and ammunititons to amal after 
fighting erupted in the southern province 
in moslem west beirut newspapers gave prominent coverage to 
reports that aoun has bank accounts in paris 
on wednesday the satirical paris weekly le canard enchaine 
published a bank statement showing two accounts in aouns name at 
the banque nationale de paris one with a balance of 50000 the 
other with 147 million 
moslemcontrolled radio stations said the reports have created a 
corruption scandal that could seriously damage aouns standing in 
the christian community 
the reports came amid efforts by the syrianbacked government to 
force aoun to end his defiance of president elias hrawi who 
dismissed aoun as army commander and interim prime minister in 
november aoun refuses to stand down or accept a peace treaty 
approved by the lebanese parliament 
aoun acknowledged having millions of dollars in foreign bank 
accounts 
its not a secret for anyone its an open secret aoun said 
in an interview wednesady on frances staterun radio station 
franceinter he said he had accounts in other french banks as 
well as in the united states and lebanon the general said the 
funds in the accounts came from donations and were not for his 
private use 
if necessary i can withdraw the money needed to resolve 
financial crises he said for the last year and three months 
i have received no money from the central bank as concerns the 
army

rescue teams resumed their search today 
for 11 americans and three mexicans missing since their yacht sank 
but officials held out little hope of finding them in the cold gulf 
of california waters 
unfortunately we are not expecting very much said port 
capt joaquin dorantes a lot of time has gone by and the water 
is cold 
the chartered yacht sank new years day and the captain said 
few people could survive for more than 40 hours in water as cold as 
61 degrees 
the boat was carrying 16 people 12 american scuba divers and 
four mexican crew members two people were rescued the us coast 
guard said a 17th person an american crew man also may have been 
aboard but it provided no details 
no bodies from the santa barbara a 68foot refitted shrimp 
boat had been found by nightfall wednesday eight of the missing 
americans were from arizona and three from california according to 
a spokesman for silent experience scubacenter a tucson ariz 
company that helped arrange the charter 
the two survivors opha watson 62 of tucson and mexican 
crewman vicente gonzalez mancilla were picked up separately 
tuesday afternoon and brought to san carlos the mexican navy and 
the us coast guard said 
watson said that shortly after the yacht sank probably after 
being struck by a large wave four people clung to a door of the 
boat then disappeared 
he told the arizona daily star that two of those four people 
wore flotation devices and that rescue workers may find them 
they should be in the same drift pattern that i was in which 
would carry them toward guaymas he said 
all four disappeared in the night apparently losing their grip 
on the door before watson was rescued around 5 pm tuesday 38 
hours after boat sank watson identified them only as nora jenny 
joe and jerry 
guaymas is 270 miles south of tucson and 875 miles northwest of 
mexico city the boat sank about 40 miles west of guaymas 
judging from what the captain said we hit heavy seas 
watson said then she keeled over watson said 
he managed to put on a wet suit after he found his dive bag 
floating 
he told coast guard officials he thought about seven people went 
down with the boat he said he saw small groups of people clinging 
to debris 
the santa barbara was being sold by guaymas businessman amado 
navarro to lane and wanda larson of silent experience scubacenter 
the arizona daily star said a woman who identified herself as 
wanda larsons mother said the yacht had been fully inspected 
less than a month ago 
dorantes said eight mexican navy boats and two private planes 
searched a 40mile strip between san carlos on the coast northwest 
of guaymas and isla tortugas where the group had been diving on 
sunday they had sailed from the island about two hours before the 
boat sank 
the coast guard sent two planes from california to help with the 
search

the international community today generally 
welcomed the decision by gen manuel noriega to accept us justice 
and expressed hope that it would lead to peace in panama 
in scattered initial reaction countries across the globe also 
expressed relief that the standoff over noriega had ended 
that was not the case in the soviet union however 
gennady i gerasimov spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry 
questioned whether the united states has the right to put noriega 
on trial and said that even a conviction on drug trafficking 
charges would not justify the us invasion of panama no state 
has the right to take the law into its own hands he told 
reporters in moscow thats basically lynch law 
news that noriega had left his sanctuary in the vatican embassy 
in panama city and surrendered to us troops led radio and 
television news bulletins and captured headlines of late newspaper 
editions in europe he was flown to miami to face federal drug 
charges 
bahrains information minister tariq almoayyed said that is 
the best possible end to the situation in panama 
the british foreign office said we are glad that this problem 
between the us and the vatican has been resolved 
prime minister margaret thatcher was one of the only world 
leaders to give full backing to president bush when the united 
states invaded panama on dec 20 
noriega faces criminal charges and we are naturally pleased 
that he should be brought to justice said a foreign office 
spokesman who spoke anonymously in accordance with british 
practice 
foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez of spain told 
spanish national radio noriega accepted the only option he had 
left since his remaining in the vatican mission was not in the 
least easy while surrounded by us military troops and under 
growing pressure by demonstrators outside 
this appears to be a voluntary decision by noriega and thats 
how i suppose the vatican will underscore it he said 
spain was the sole member of the 12nation european economic 
community to vote along with latin american nations to condemn the 
us invasion in the un general assembly 
we want panama to recover its moral conscience which has been 
left enormously perturbed as a result of all these events 
ordonez said 
we also want it to recover its hope for the future rebuild 
its economy and that the government can advance in the paths of 
peace freedom and prosperity thats whats most important he 
said 
thailands government spokesman suvit yodmani said we think 
it is important that a person who has been accused and indicted for 
a crime especially a crime such as narcotics which is damaging 
internationally will be brought to fair trial 
it is none of our business however as drug trafficking 
affects countries internationally we are happy that the accused 
will be tried fairly in us court 
i think this will lead to more permanent peace in panama 
yodmani said 
the japanese foreign ministry said it had no comment because the 
matter is strictly among the three nations the united states 
panama and the vatican 
japan has not yet officially recognized panamas new government 
although japan has an impression that the new government has made 
a remarkable improvement in the country said a foreign ministry 
official speaking on condition of anonymity

president mikhail s gorbachev met today with 
lithuanian communists in hopes of persuading them to reverse a 
decision to break with the federal communist party but the talks 
reportedly ended in a deadlock 
meanwhile party leaders in estonia were meeting to consider a 
draft policy statement that favors independence for the republic 
and its communist party 
a local journalist tarmu tammerk said the statement was 
expected to win approval during the central committee meeting today 
in estonias capital tallinn 
the lithuanian party voted 855160 two weeks ago to split from 
the communist party of the soviet union leading gorbachev to 
summon party leaders for a meeting in moscow 
lithuanian journalist eduardas potashinskas said a party member 
who was at the meeting described the mood as respectful but said 
the talks broke up after 5 hours without a compromise 
gorbachev strongly opposes the lithuanian decision to split from 
the national party but he also has ruled out the use of force 
against the baltic republic 
in a speech on christmas day gorbachev noted that extraordinary 
measures such as deployment of troops and tanks have been used 
against hooligans in rioting in the republic of uzbekistan and 
the disputed region of nagornokarabakh 
but in these conditions when we have the participation of 
wide strata of the population we have tried and are trying to use 
political means he said referring to the wide public support 
for lithuanias independence movement 
after that speech the national partys central committee 
directed gorbachev to visit lithuania to try to heal the break he 
is expected to go next week 
vida laumenskaite a secretary of lithuanias proindependent 
sajudis group said there were rumors gorbachev would ask 
lithuanians to suspend their action until a national communist 
party congress can be held in october 
the congress is expected to redefine the partys role in soviet 
society to fall in line with gorbachevs calls for the party to 
get out of daytoday affairs and play more of an ideological role 
faced with the lithuanian break some dissenting communists in 
the republic formed an alternate central committee that proclaims 
loyalty to moscow and the soviet communist party that gorbachev 
heads

a newspaper said today that pablo 
escobar a reputed leader of the medellin cocaine cartel has 
kidnapped the son of president virgilio barcos closest adviser 
el tiempo said it was the latest in a series of abductions aimed 
at pressuring the government to ends its crackdown on drug lords 
and raising money from ransom payments to make up for losses caused 
by the crackdown 
a group of men contracted by escobar abducted alvaro diego 
montoya the president of a financial services firm as he left his 
office in bogota on dec 20 el tiempo reported 
el tiempo colombias largest newspaper said it obtained the 
information from sources at the presidential palace and at 
montoyas company probolsa 
a presidential press spokesman reached by telephone today said 
he had no information about the report 
montoya is the son of german montoya barcos secretary general 
and considered the presidents righthand man last year montoya 
carried several messages to barco from a lawyer representing the 
drug chiefs 
in the messages escobar and other cartel leaders promised to 
abandon their multibilliondollar business in exchange for a 
government amnesty montoya has said the barco administration said 
the offers were rejected 
montoyas son is one of 18 people many of them belonging to 
colombias richest families abducted by the cartel in the past 
three weeks according to el tiempo a source quoted by the paper 
said the government had information tying the cartel to the 
kidnappings the source said the abductions were in retaliation for 
barcos war against drug traffickers 
as part of the antidrug campaign police shot and killed 
escobars close associate gonzalo rodriguez gacha in a dec 15 
gunfight on colombias northern coast a special police force is 
said to be hounding escobar and has come close to catching him at 
least once 
authorities occupy several of the drug suspects properties 
which were raided shortly after the government began its crackdown 
aug 18 the crackdown began after traffickers assassinated a 
leading presidential candidate 
traffickers have responded to the government offensive with a 
terror campaign that has killed scores of people 
the source quoted by el tiempo said the medellin cartel is using 
the kidnappings not only to pressure the government to call off its 
campaign but also to earn money the newspaper did not say how much 
money the cartel had demanded in exchange for release of kidnap 
victims 
the source reportedly said the cartel needs ransom money to 
solve a cashflow problem caused by police raids on its facilities 
although it may seem hard to believe the cartel is 
confronting a liquidity problem the source was quoted as saying

authorities from three states investigating a 
series of mail bombs have been shown the hightech tools the 
federal government is using in the case 
a special computer network reserved for major cases and 
sophisticated laboratory tests including procedures for dna 
identification were demonstrated wednesday during a meeting of 
authorities from atlanta savannah birmingham ala and 
jacksonville fla said fbi spokesman diader rosario 
it was the first meeting involving federal state and local law 
enforcement representatives from all four cities in which mail 
bombs were received during a series of attacks in december that 
killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer 
those attending the meeting also were briefed on evidence gained 
from a public hotline set up to receive tips in the case rosario 
said 
rosario said today there will be further such meetings but no 
date has been set for the next one he said the fbi which is 
coordinating the investigation does not want to have the meetings 
too often 
every time you meet you pull people out of the field where 
they can do more good he said 
rosario said the investigation has not narrowed to any 
particular area and still is in full swing in georgia alabama and 
florida 
robert vance a judge on the atlantabased 11th us circuit 
court of appeals was killed dec 16 when a mail bomb exploded at 
his home near birmingham ala two days later savannah alderman 
robert robinson an attorney who did work with the naacp was 
killed by a similar bomb authorities intercepted bombs sent to the 
11th circuit courthouse in atlanta and an naacp office in 
jacksonville before they could explode 
a letter to atlanta television station wagatv last week claimed 
a group calling itself americans for a competent federal judicial 
system was responsible for the bombs and threatened more violence 
the letter writer expressed anger over crimes committed by 
blacks against whites and also made an apparent reference to a 
school desegregation case in dekalb county 
fbi agents searched dekalb county schools during the christmas 
holidays looking for clues to the bomber and for bombs according 
to news reports the fbi and the school system have refused to 
comment on the reports 
georgia gov joe frank harris said at a news conference 
wednesday that he would be willing to post a reward for information 
in the case if police ask him to do so he said he has received no 
such requests

protesters in the republic of azerbaijan began 
retreating from the sovietiran border today after four days of 
violent attempts to reunite with with their iranian brethren a 
protest organizer said 
the situation is stabilizing people are gradually going 
home said yusif samedoglu a writer and leader of the 
azerbaijani peoples front which organized the protest he spoke 
by telephone from baku the capital of azerbaijan 
the azerbaijanis who are largely shiite moslems began 
demonstrating sunday for unification with a region peopled by their 
ethnic kin in iran the protesters demanded an open border and the 
freedom to trade and cross the frontier practices that were 
suspended by dictator josef stalin 
savili a perets deputy director of the official news agency 
azerinform said in a telephone interview from baku that the border 
area was calming down he said azerbaijan party chief abdulrakhman 
vezirov and other officials traveled to the protest area today to 
investigate 
the kgb rushed border troop reinforcements to the area wednesday 
to stop protesters from demolishing guard towers and security 
alarms 
the disturbances along azerbaijans nearly 500milelong border 
with iran were the latest flareup in two years of ethnic unrest 
among azerbaijanis armenians georgians abkhazians and other 
ethnic groups in the soviet caucasus region more than 300 people 
have died nationwide in ethnic unrest in the past two years 
lt gen nikolai britvin head of the political department of 
the kgbs special border guard units told the official tass news 
agency wednesday that one person was killed in a clash on the 
sovietiran frontier but he did not say when he also did not say 
whether others were injured 
britvin said one soviet citizen crossed the border into iran and 
there were probably other crossings but that there was no 
largescale flight 
the government daily izvestia said some protesters were armed 
with pistols and hunting rifles and it estimated damage from the 
rioting at more than 82 million 
tass said about 7500 protesters destroyed guard observation 
towers electronic alarm equipment and communications lines along 
the border when rioting broke out on sunday 
izvestia said the turmoil stretched from the azerbaijani enclave 
of nakhichevan sandwiched between armenia and iran to the regions 
of zangelansk and pushkinsk and the caspian sea port of lenkoran in 
azerbaijan itself it said unrest continued through wednesday 
britvin told tass however that the incidents lasted only 
through tuesday and that the situation was gradually returning to 
normal 
nonetheless he said border guard reinforcements were sent in 
with armored personnel carriers neither he nor izvestia said how 
many guards were normally stationed along the frontier or how many 
reinforcements were dispatched 
a kgb spokesman refused to comment today on the latest 
developments 
the border disturbances threatened to complicate sovietiranian 
relations the workers tribune newspaper said noting the iranians 
had lodged a protest of the unrest but soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady i gerasimov said today its not a big 
international issue 
the unrest began dec 4 when a crowd of soviet azerbaijanis 
gathered at the border with loudspeakers and called on their 
iranian neighbors both members of the same ethnic group and 
predominantly shiite moslems to unify their regions izvestia 
reported 
about 4 million ethnic azerbaijanis live in the adjoining 
iranian province of azerbaijan where stalin briefly set up a 
puppet state during world war ii before being forced by western 
powers to withdraw in 1946 
the azerbaijanis are the only soviet ethnic group who like 
iranians are largely shiite moslems since the 1979 islamic 
revolution in iran soviet officials have expressed concern about 
islamic fundamentalism creeping across the border

moroccos coastline is no longer in danger 
of being spoiled by a huge oil spill and nearly all the 19 million 
gallons of oil that gushed into the sea have dissolved pollution 
experts said today 
the iranian tanker khark 5 which began leaking oil after an 
explosion dec 19 had been towed 300 miles off the moroccan coast 
by wednesday night said the dutch salvage firm smit tak 
the edge of the slick held its position today 20 miles off the 
oysterfarming community of oualidyia the official maghreb arab 
presse agency said 
sailors laid floating barriers wednesday while helicopters 
sprayed chemicals on the greenish 100squaremile oil slick 
the real danger to the moroccan coast is over jeanclaude 
sainnos director of mediterranean marine antipollution center in 
valletta malta said today if the vessel had come ashore that 
would have been a major catastrophe 
sainnos said more than 90 percent of the spill had dissolved in 
the relatively warm 60 degree water had been broken up by waves 
or dissolved by chemicals 
darko domovic a technical expert at the antipollution center 
said there was practically no danger of massive spoiling of 
moroccos coast although bits of oil could wash ashore over the 
next couple of months 
there is very very little oil left on the sea surface said 
domovic whats left is an extremely thin sheen with patches of 
emulsified oil 
morocco threatened to sue irans national oil company and 
accused smit tak of reacting too slowly to the explosion that tore 
through the khark 5s hull 
smit tak however said its salvage operation was hampered 
because morocco and spain refused to let the tanker be towed near 
their coasts for emergency repairs instead three tugboats were 
towing the 283632ton ship toward calmer waters near the cape 
verde islands a 1100mile journey expected to take eight days 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said today that reports 
of environmental damage caused by the spill were exaggerated and 
he said the ship met all safety specifications 
the vessel built in 1975 was damaged at least three times in 
iraqi air strikes in the persian gulf during the iraniraq war the 
normal lifepsan of a supertanker is 1520 years 
speaking on tehran radio aqazadeh said a storm ripped a hole in 
one of the tankers storage tanks causing the explosion that 
started the leak he said some oil from the damaged storage tank 
burned in the fire while a limited amount leaked out 
the khark 5 was loaded with 72 million gallons of light iranian 
crude when the explosion occurred 400 miles north of las palmas in 
the canary islands 
as the oil crept toward the coast the moroccan government said 
it endangered fisheries tourist beaches a migratory bird reserve 
and in important breeding ground of pink flamingoes 
coast guard lt cmdr glenn wiltshire head of an oil spill 
strike force in mobile ala left wednesday for rabat to see what 
the united states could do to help said cmdr john mcelwain a 
coast guard spokesman 
wiltshire will look into equipment needs response tactics and 
possible cleanup operations mcelwain said in washington he said 
strike force teams in alabama and san francisco could be used in 
helping to deal with the spill 
dutch television said authorities in the netherlands had seized 
five iranianowned tankers over the past 14 months and prevented 
them from leaving rotterdam until they underwent repairs 
they included three sister ships of the khark 5 according to 
the report but none of the vessels was identified the report said 
the vessels failed to meet international safety and environmental 
standards it did not elaborate

subway shooter bernhard goetz says hell agree 
to give a deposition in a 50 million lawsuit against him only if 
he can interview the plaintiff one of the four young men he shot 
in 1984 
the suit was filed on behalf of darrell cabey who was paralyzed 
from the waist down by the shooting in a subway car cabeys 
lawyers say he also suffered brain damage and is mentally 
incompetent 
i think all this mental vegetable business is to prevent 
darrell cabey from having any legal exposure goetz said ill 
be deposed after cabey meets his legal obligations 
one of cabeys lawyers william kunstler said goetz is 
obligated under state law to give his deposition first since he is 
the defendant 
in a legal notice filed wednesday goetz said he wanted to 
interview cabey jan 18 
kunstler said a hearing is scheduled jan 12 to determine if 
goetz should be declared the loser in the lawsuit for failing to 
show up for his own deposition last month 
goetz has said in court papers that he has been unable to appear 
in court because he had major cancer surgery last month and was 
undergoing radiation treatments he would not specify what type of 
cancer he has 
cabey and three companions all teenagers at the time were 
shot by goetz when they approached him in a subway car on dec 22 
1984 goetz said they intended to rob him they said they were 
panhandling goetz 42 was acquitted of attempted murder but 
convicted of violating weapons laws for which he served eight 
months in prison 
goetz told the associated press he will not be deposed until he 
is allowed to interview cabey 
im taking the position that i have some rights under this 
legal system goetz said 
kunstler dismissed goetz action as a lastditch attempt at 
avoiding coming to the bronx to be interrogated by hostile 
lawyers 
goetz is aware that cabey is mentally incompetent kunstler said 
he should know he paralyzed him kunstler said he brain 
damaged him

operators of crack houses in king county must run 
their businesses in accordance with public health rules or face 
huge fines in an unusual legal move that officials hope will close 
down the drug dens 
the ruling approved wednesday by the king county board of 
health requires crack house operators to submit a plan of 
operation for reducing health and safety hazards or face a 
10000aday fine 
the hazards listed in the ruling include drug use and associated 
health effects exposure to toxic chemical fumes the spread of 
sexually transmitted diseases through prostitution violence and 
neighborhood blight 
it is just another tool we can use to get at crack houses 
said ron sims king county councilman and a board of health member 
under the ruling police would identify a crack house and inform 
the seattleking county health department the department would 
then notify the owner or operator by registered mail that a plan to 
reduce health risks must be submitted within 10 days and be 
accompanied by a 100 fee the board must approve of the plan or 
the penalty applies 
king county police and the county prosecutors office supported 
the ruling although they had urged delaying passage so it could be 
studied for flaws robert stier senior deputy king county 
prosecutor in the civil division said he had never seen similar 
legislation 
although king county encompasses seattle the regulation does 
not apply in seattle city limits because the city council not the 
county council acts as the governing body for the seattle portion 
of the health department

city hospitals have become so crowded that they 
have suspended elective admissions and the state has provided them 
with lists of where the few available beds are 
this is the first time weve used the system to effect a 
transfer of patients from an overcrowded hospital to one with open 
beds frances tarlton a health department spokeswoman said 
wednesday 
the state acted after a computer analysis showed that more than 
900 patients could not be placed in city hospitals wednesday 
because of lack of beds she said 
we have identified 230 open beds and sent that information to 
hospitals tarlton said 
the citys health and hospitals corp reacted to the influx by 
canceling elective admissions said hhc spokeswoman suzanne halpin 
early january is traditionally a crowded time in hospitals 
because it is flu season and because many people put off elective 
surgery until after the holidays tarlton said 
the problem is particularly acute in the boroughs of queens and 
the bronx she said lincoln hospital in the bronx for example 
had 50 people waiting for admission 
tarlton emphasized that the state has not ordered the transfer 
of any patients 
monitoring of available hospital beds and patients waiting in 
the emergency room began last year wednesday was the first time 
since the system was put into effect it became actually necessary 
to identify hospitals able to accept transfers she said today 
were going to continue to monitor the system and continue to 
try to help the hospitals redistribute the patient load as long as 
its necessary tarlton said 
dr donald c meyer executive director of the doctors council 
praised the action by state health commissioner dr david axelrod 
but called it long overdue 
weve had a crisis for quite some time but like anything else 
in new york we have a crisis for a while and we get used to it 
meyer said 
on any given day there are about 600 people awaiting admission 
to new york city hospitals but on wednesday the number was closer 
to 900 said tarlton 
meyer said private hospitals are being asked to take some of the 
patients but he acknowledged that some of those hospitals are also 
overcrowded many of the patients being transferred are poor or 
have no health insurance making it less likely that a private 
hospital would accept the patients meyer said 
transferring patients is only a shortterm solution meyer said 
one of our major problems is that we have the beds available but 
we cant get enough nurses he said

state regulators are said to be 
investigating a doctor who speeded up delivery of a baby plopped 
the infant into a christmas stocking and dashed to a tv studio next 
door to display her as the countys first newborn of the 90s 
the board of medical quality assurance opened a formal 
investigation wednesday the los angeles times reported thursday 
citing unidentified sources 
myra kristine palmer was officially delivered 15 seconds after 
midnight by dr charles wesley turner jr and presented a short 
time later on a nationally televised religious service led by the 
rev ralph wilkerson 
turner 64 insisted neither the mother brigitte palmer nor 
her 6pound 12ounce baby girl was harmed by his hastening of the 
delivery at turners covenant birthing center in orange county the 
doctor said the mother went into labor naturally 
turner said wilkerson pastor of the nextdoor melodyland 
christian center had asked months ago if he could provide a 
newborn for the new years eve service 
we had the mother push at 1159 turner said i put the 
forceps on and pulled the infant out we had her at 15 seconds 
after midnight i used the forceps because i wanted to have the 
first baby in the new year 
i was highly jubilant he said the congregation yelled 
and screamed and applauded and everybody wanted to see the baby 
mrs palmer 25 said she felt felt a little funny because he 
took her and ran off with her but he wanted to have her on tv it 
was a special feeling for everyone to see the baby 
dr roger schlesinger president of the orange county obstetrics 
and gynecological society said he believes turner took a risk in 
taking the newborn outside 
i dont think id take my newborn out of a hospital 
schlesinger said any newborn baby requires some degree of 
observation some have low blood sugars some convulse 
babies are pretty hardy he said most do well but some 
dont so i guess he was playing the odds a bit 
turner who said he has delivered more than 18000 babies in his 
40year career said i dont think theres anything wrong with 
having the first baby of the new year and the baby was delivered 
safely and i see nothing wrong with taking the baby and showing it 
to the 4000 people at melodyland 
in 1984 the state medical board accused turner of illegally 
prescribing dangerous drugs and placed his license on five years 
probation turner pleaded no contest to a related misdemeanor and 
was placed on three years criminal probation and fined 15000 
in 1988 he was named in a 1988 wrongful death lawsuit after a 
child he delivered at santa ana hospital medical center died 
immediately after birth the times reported the suit alleges 
turner caused the death by failing to perform a timely caesarean 
section 
turner denied any wrongdoing in the case wednesday he remains 
on the staff at santa ana but lost the privilege to practice 
obstetrics there the times said

the emerging political parties may be 
split on platforms and ideologies but they are united on one 
point the proposed april 17 election date is too soon for a nation 
awakening from decades of despotic communist rule 
the task of reviving democratic traditions stifled since 1947 is 
complicated by the fact that none of the halfdozen parties 
planning to contest the elections has the basic tools for a 
successful campaign 
until three weeks ago typewriters had to be registered so that 
any dissenting texts could be traced back to their authors who in 
turn could be punished by dictator nicolae ceausescus feared 
security police the machines are a rarity 
the few telephones available are always busy 
westerners asking about the availability of photocopiers 
computers and teletypes draw laughter 
the christian peasants party one of romanias most dominant 
political forces before being forced to disband after the 1947 
communist takeover is typical of how the emerging democratic 
parties stand a little more than three months before the planned 
polls 
were lucky we have four typewriters said anca dobrota a 
volunteer secretary at the partys headquarters unfortunately 
only three are working 
ms dobrota said that her party which set up operations 
wednesday at what was a district communist party building had two 
telephones and they are busy all the time 
she had to shout to make herself heard above the voices 
emanating from hundreds of people crowding rooms halls and 
stairways of the threestory building and discussing politics with 
the explosive vehemence born of 41 years of repression 
the social democrats are as bad as the communists shouted 
one octogenarian 
his aged friend nodded theres no point in all of this he 
shouted back the national salvation front is going to win 
anyway 
others agreed that the front the interim body running the 
country since ceausescus overthrow dec 22 and his execution three 
days later likely would win early elections because of its high 
profile and control of the mass media 
we dont have access to television or to the newspapers and 
so we do not have contact with the people said niculaie costel 
a spokesman for the democratic party of romania in this way the 
front can control the opposition and a large part of the communist 
hierarchy will be reelected and that will be a catastrophe 
others disagree that the front poses a communist threat 
pointing to the de facto dissolution of the communist party in the 
wake of ceausescus downfall 
but members and officials of several different parties all 
agreed the front has unfair advantage and that its high profile 
coupled with the lack of resources available to other parties 
threatens the concept of free and fair elections 
if the front truly wants to promote democracy they have to 
understand that april is too soon for elections said ion puiu 
the 72yearold vice president of the peasants party some of his 
aged counselors nodded in agreement 
party official vicente zagun shared that view outside puius 
office referring to the poor communications in a country where 
road and rail travel are near impossible in winter 
it is very difficult to organize by april zagun said we 
have no way of communicating with our sister organizations across 
the country and have little access to newspapers radio and 
television 
as a matter of fact the fronts national council is sure to 
win unless the elections are postponed at least until august 
said zagun 73 seated near a table crowded with people nearly 
all of them in their 70s or 80s filling out membership forms 
zagun acknowledged concerns that many supporters of his party 
are elderly people who were members before 1947 and he suggested 
that also could hurt its chances at the polls 
we want to be a party for the young but the young people 
dont know what democracy means because they grew up in a 
dictatorship he said alluding to the 24year ceausescu era and 
the 17 years under his communist predecessor gheorghe 
gheorghiudej 
youths disagree that they know little of democracy noting that 
university students were a main force behind the december 
revolution that toppled ceausescu 
but political movements representing almost exclusively young 
people also appear illprepared for april elections 
at a bucharest night school thursday several dozen people were 
crammed into a room that is the temporary headquarters of the 
romanian ecological movement discussing whether or not to field 
candidates outside workers replaced glass doors shattered by 
fighting just 12 days ago 
it is so stupid to be wasting time on this debate shouted 
organizer dorina enescu we dont even have time to organize we 
have no funds we have no telephone we have nothing

an aldermans onewoman campaign for a 
genderneutral political label has been defeated for the third 
time forcing her to rethink her title fight 
it didnt have a chance said evelyn g chesky i think 
the board name has to be labeled sexist even though thats 
strong its a definite gender 
cheskys measure to change the name of government to city 
council instead of the board of aldermen was defeated 96 tuesday 
two years ago the proposal lost 123 and a year ago it failed 95 
after four years on the 15member board chesky said her cause 
has drawn mostly ridicule in a nice way its like they get a 
kick out of putting me on for something like this 
alderman francis e rogers said he doesnt see any reason to 
switch names 
theres no gender gap per se in the fact that its by charter 
aldermen and so be it he said he said female members can be 
called alderwoman if they want but the board should keep the 
name it has had since 1873 
three women serve on the board one voted against the name 
change which needed 10 votes to pass saying she wanted to keep 
the traditional name 
but chesky said the old name hampers the image of the board 
which saw its first female member in 1926 
chesky said she had hoped the issue would pass this time i 
even went for the symbolism of the last decade and going in the 
next century and all that she said 
on thursday chesky said she does not know whether shell pursue

an independent medical team has been asked to 
determine if ousted communist leader erich honecker is fit to be 
jailed while he awaits possible charges of corruption in office it 
was reported thursday 
honecker 77 underwent gall bladder surgery in august and he 
has been described as incapacitated by the illness 
a decision is expected soon as to whether he could sustain 
imprisonment the official adn news agency said 
it also disclosed that the security cordon imposed around the 
opulent wandlitz residential compound where honecker lives was 
removed several weeks ago because no legal grounds were 
established on which to detain him 
an earlier and very brief report from adn had said simply that 
the house arrest of honecker had been lifted but did not specify 
when 
the wandlitz complex is being converted to a care center for 
handicapped adults and honecker will have to be moved to some 
other location before the facility opens in february government 
spokesman wolfgang meyer has said 
a parliamentary commission overseeing the corruption 
investigation of honecker and other top officials of his disgraced 
regime named a group of independent doctors to determine his 
physical condition adn said 
he has been living in seclusion since being forced to step down 
from the communist party leadership oct 18 under pressure from 
massive prodemocracy demonstrations and an exodus of skilled young 
workers to the west 
east german officials announced in december that because of his 
illness honecker had been placed under house arrest amid 
allegations of massive corruption in the former government 
the house arrest came at the same time seven former communist 
party politburo members were jailed pending corruption 
investigations against them the investigations are continuing 
opposition groups have accused the former leaders of 
extravagance while the economy declined and east germans were 
forced to make do with bare essentials 
on wednesday a west german newspaper reported that lutheran and 
catholic church leaders had offered to house honecker in church 
facilities for the elderly or at a monastery to protect him from 
enraged citizens

president bush dispatched the nations top 
military officer to panama today to plan further us troop 
withdrawals and called pope john paul ii to thank the vatican for 
its help in persuading manuel antonio noriega to surrender to 
american authorities 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush was 
gratified this operation was completed in such a successful 
fashion 
fitzwater said bush had called the pope to thank him for the 
distinguished efforts of the vatican and the papal nuncio in 
panama 
the pope expressed his humanitarian concerns for the people of 
panama bush assured the pope that general noriega will be treated 
to all the protections of us law and would receive a fair 
trial the spokesman said 
noriega turned himself in to us authorities wednesday night 
after leaving the protection of the vatican embassy where he had 
holed up for 10 days he was flown to homestead air force base near 
miami and held for arraignment late today on drugtrafficking 
charges 
fitzwater said gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff was heading for panama to work with gen maxwell thurman 
commander of us troops in panama to help speed up further 
withdrawal of forces 
the spokesman said that some 2000 troops have now been brought 
home of the 26000 that were in panama on dec 20 the day of the 
invasion that toppled noriegas government about half already were 
stationed there 
however pentagon spokesman pete williams said the total number 
of troops in panama was little changed because military police and 
civil affairs specialists have replaced some combat units 
fitzwater said noriega was handcuffed briefly after he was taken 
into custody read his constitutional rights in spanish and 
examined by two us military doctors on the c130 cargo plane that 
took him to florida 
the doctors found no discernible abnormalities and reported 
that noriega appeared to be in good health fitzwater said 
the spokesman said that four panamanians remain sheltered in the 
vatican embassy in panama city he said us troops will continue 
to maintain a vigil outside the building while they remain inside 
we would expect to question them and ascertain their situation 
just as we have others who have left the nunciatura embassy in 
the past fitzwater said 
he said bushs discussion with the pope was brief the president 
also called canadian prime minister brian mulroney to discuss the 
noreiga apprehension and to thank canada for supporting the united 
states at the united nations which voted 7520 last week to 
condemn the us invasion 
fitzwater said bush who announced noriegas arrest on 
nationwide television wednesday night feels very pleased 
hes fairly upbeat about the entire situation 
but the president was staying out of the public eye today and 
fitzwater said bush and other white house officials would be 
careful about what they say lest they prejudice noriegas trial 
attorney general dick thornburgh appearing earlier on cbs said 
the united states did not strike a deal with noriega he explained 
noriegas surrender this way i think he saw the handwriting on 
the wall 
he said noriegas decision to leave the vatican embassy clears 
up a host of legal questions that could have complicated his 
prosecution 
we have a good case thornburgh said on nbc if we can 
make it better we wont hesitate to do so 
defense secretary dick cheney also appearing on cbs said gens 
powell and thurman would work to develop a plan for withdrawing 
those troops sent to panama over the next several weeks 
cheney called noriegas surrender the icing on the cake for 
operation just cause the military invasion the united states 
mountedon dec 20 to drive noriega from power bush said wednesday 
night that all his objectives in ordering the troops to panama 
have now been acheived 
bush said the remaining us troops in panama will be withdrawn 
as quickly as the local situation will permit 
although thurman stressed wednesday night that no deals had been 
made administration officials said the united states promised 
noriega that he would receive a fair trial and would not be 
prosecuted under a new federal law allowing the death penalty for 
drug kingpins 
the united states also agreed to meet three lastminute 
conditions by noriega the officials said that he be allowed to 
make a few phone calls that his decision be held secret until his 
arrest and that he be allowed to wear his uniform 
bush said in a nationally televised announcement that the united 
states is committed to provide noriega a fair trial 
nevertheless bush added his apprehension and return to 
the united states should send a clear signal that the united states 
is serious in its determination that those charged with promoting 
the distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of justice 
bush said he had four objectives in ordering the invasion 
safeguarding the lives of americans helping to restore democracy 
protecting the integrity of the panama canal and bringing noriega 
to justice 
all of these objectives have now been achieved he declared 
he left the briefing room without answering questions 
noriegas return to the united states ended a twoyear effort by 
the united states to bring him to justice and eliminated the source 
of what bush called the major frustration of his first 11 months in 
office but it opened the book on a whole new set of legal problems 
us legal authorities have been studying secret documents this 
past month on noriegas long tenure as a cia and drug enforcement 
administration informant they expect he might try to derail his 
prosecution by seeking disclosure of information that would be 
embarrassing to bush a former cia director and the united 
states 
bush several days ago said he was concerned that noriega might 
try to blindside the legal process with such demands but he 
said he wanted him brought to justice in a us court anyway 
if convicted on all charges noriega could face up to 145 years 
in prison and more than 11 million in fines 
bush praised vatican officials for their evenhanded 
statesmanlike assistance in recent days 
administration sources said the united states did not deal 
directly with noriega at any time and that all negotiations were 
conducted between the former military leader and church officials 
presidential spokesman fitzwater said bush was notified at about 
6 pm est by national security adviser brent scowcroft that 
noriega was willing to give himself up 
even then fitzwater said we could not be sure it would 
actually occur he said bush was notified by defense secretary 
cheney at about 9 pm that noriega had strolled out of the vatican 
embassy and was in custody 
at 930 pm the plane carrying noriega back to the united 
states took off 
bush paid a special tribute to those servicemen who were 
wounded and to the families of those who gave their lives their 
sacrifice has been a noble cause and will never be forgotten 
twentythree us servicemen were killed and more than 300 injured 
in the invasion

a human rights group thursday accused the bush 
administration of widespread disregard for human rights saying 
it was soft in its response to the crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators in china and an apologist for military abuses in el 
salvador guatemala and the philippines 
the twovolume report by human rights watch did say there were 
bright spots in president bushs rights policies toward eastern 
europe south africa and burma but criticizied the 
administrations dealings in most of the 50 nations covered 
unfortunately our review of the public positions taken by the 
bush administration during its first year reveals a widespread 
disregard for human rights the report said 
its insistance on seeing the world in geopolitical terms and 
other priorties gave rise to a striking silence on abuses in many 
countries and a frequent refusal to adjust us policy in light of 
those abuses 
however the report said it would be premature to make a final 
judgment on the administrations policy because its so early in 
the presidents term 
the state department said it had no immediate comment 
the administration imposed the minimum sanctions on china 
after hundreds of people were killed to crush a prodemocracy 
movement the report said it criticized a secret meeting between 
chinese officials and national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
lawrence eagleburger deputy secretary of state 
the administration thus made clear that the killing and 
imprisonment of prodemocracy demonstrators would have no material 
impact on its dealings with the chinese leadership the report 
said 
human rights watch said the us policy toward el salvador also 
showed a disregard for human rights 
despite reduced fears that leftist advances in central america 
would provide a beachhead for soviet expansionism the 
administration persisted in acting as apologist for abuses 
committed by the salvadoran military in its war with leftist 
rebels the report said 
us officials the report said badgered a witness who 
implicated the salvadoran military in the november killing of six 
jesuit priests and two of their employees the administration 
earlier denied similar allegations 
the united states provides el salvador with millions of dollars 
in economic and military aid in its 10yearold war with leftist 
rebels 
human rights watch said the administration strengthened ties to 
the guatemalan military although political killings increased 
dramatically and refrained from criticizing widespread 
killings in the philippines 
in addition the group said the administration has all but 
stopped public comment on human rights issues in the soviet union 
the silence seems to be based in large part on new political 
considerations the fear that pressing for human rights might 
weaken mikhail gorbachev it said 
in what the group called bright spots it said the bush 
administration has begun a welcome break from the policies of its 
predecessor regarding south africa by calling for an end to the 
state of emergency the freeing of political prisoners and the 
abolition of various legislative pillars of apartheid 
in burma the administration was credited with playing a 
constructive role after the 1988 crackdown on a prodemocracy 
movement 
the rights group said it was a positive development that the 
administration did not seek to renew military aid for the contra 
rebels fighting the leftist nicaragua government 
however it said the administration continued past policy of 
refusing to condemn contra abuses 
the administration also was criticized for largely ignoring 
abuses in areas that dont attract much us public attention 
such as executions by government forces in sudan mass expulsions 
in mauritania and the purge of government opponents in malawi 
human rights watch is a new yorkbased group that monitors and 
promotes human rights worldwide

at last newspaper consumers who 
wont complain about the ink rubbing off on them 
officials demonstrated a new use for old newspaper wednesday by 
showing it off as barnyard bedding for animals in the states 
prison agriculture program 
cheaper than straw and hay shredded newsprint is less dusty and 
far more absorbent than traditional barnyard materials department 
of corrections officials said during a demonstration at jones farm 
when mixed with manure newspapers decompose quickly 
surplus newspaper is available at little or no cost and 
eliminates the need for the state prison farm system to grow its 
own straw and hay the land for other crops the officials said 
the officials also plan to use newspaper shredders at skillman 
fram and bayside farm 
in all the state farms about 10000 acres through its prison 
agriculture program the change will mean the three farms can 
reduce their waste by about 15 tons a day

a northwest airlines jetliner dropped one of 
its three engines while in flight over northern florida before 
landing safely today officials said 
there were no injuries reported aboard the boeing 727 said 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons at the airlines headquarters in 
eagan minn 
the plane turned around landed at tampa without any problem 
at all 139 customers and were working now to book them on other 
airlines to move them along gibbons said 
flight 5 took off from miami shortly after 8 am est bound 
nonstop for minneapolisst paul gibbons said the plane lost its 
no 3 engine at about 935 am said arlene salac of the federal 
aviation administrations regional office in atlanta 
gibbons said the engine on the right side of the fuselage 
dropped off over the cross city fla area a sparsely populated 
section that includes forests and marshlands west of gainesville 
and southeast of tallahassee 
national transportation safety board officials said they asked 
the crew for information that could help pinpoint where the engine 
landed 
boeing officials in seattle said they would send someone from 
their miami office to assist with the investigation if northwest 
asks for help 
tom cole spokesman for boeing commercial airplanes said 727s 
are designed so an engine will break away if necessary 
they are designed to fall off in cases of extreme vibration in 
order to protect the airplane so the plane wont be damaged if the 
engine breaks apart or so engine wont shake the airplane so hard 
it causes a loss of control 
all three engines are mounted in the rear of the plane one in 
the tail section and the other two on either side of the fuselage 
gibbons said 
the engine separation caused no other structural damage to the 
plane gibbons said 
there were no problems with control pressurization or 
anything he said it was a routine twoengine landing the 
kind of thing pilots are trained for all the time 
the plane landed at the nearest airport in tampa at 958 am 
est officials said 
passengers said they felt something but didnt know an engine 
was missing until after they got on the ground 
there was a little rock and roll but not that much said 
alfred cortina of miami as he awaited another flight at tampa 
it was extremely smooth i was surprised when i got off the plane 
and saw that we didnt have a engine 
i felt a lurch and then a big bump added sandy altner of 
winnipeg canada it was almost like we ran into something in a 
car the pilot came on about 10 minutes later and said we had lost 
the right engine he didnt say it fell off 
gibbons said the plane is 14 years old he said he did not know 
when it had last been inspected but said he was not aware of any 
problems with it 
ntsb investigator jorge prellezo said in miami that the agency 
has not yet considered offering a reward for the return of engine 
parts as it did after last years crash of a jetliner in sioux 
city iowa we hope we can find it for free right now he said 
we have to look at what happened and the value of the engine 
to our investigation it doesnt appear this was due to any 
catastrophic engine failure he said 
boeing delivered the plane to northwest in december 1975 the 
727 model designed as a shortrun carrier but which airlines have 
used more for mediumrange flights was put into service in 1964 
and discontinued in 1984 after 1831 had been delivered cole said 
in april 1985 an american airlines flight from dallas to san 
diego lost its rightside engine but landed normally and without 
any injuries in san diego 
a boeing 737 flown by piedmont lost an engine on takeoff from 
chicago in january 1989 but turned around and made an uneventful 
landing cole said

the good news for travelers is that airlines are 
cutting fares to lure passengers but theres bad news for the 
first time since the 1970s oil crisis some are imposing a 
surcharge to cover a jump in fuel prices 
trans world airlines said wednesday it is adding a surcharge 
ranging from 5 to 20 per ticket twa spokesman don morrison in 
st louis said the charge represents about 4 percent of an average 
ticket price 
meanwhile twa pan am american airlines united airlines 
midway airlines and usair said they were matching steep fare cuts 
announced tuesday by eastern airlines but were keeping the usual 
cancellation penalties that eastern eliminated 
the prospect of weak passenger traffic this year and a slowing 
economy may mean more fare discounting but in many cases the 
savings are reduced by fuel surcharges which also were announced 
by northwest airlines 
for flights of at least 500 miles the new twa fuel surcharge 
will cost 10 on a oneway ticket and 20 round trip for less than 
500 miles passengers will pay an extra 5 one way and 10 round 
trip 
pan am said it is raising most domestic fares 4 percent to cover 
fuel costs its northeast shuttle service which hiked fares last 
week is excluded united the nations secondlargest airline 
also said it is boosting domestic fares 4 percent because of the 
fuel price rise 
other big carriers including eastern said they were 
considering fuelrelated increases 
on tuesday easterns sister carrier continental airlines led 
the move by raising fares 4 percent to cover fuel costs northwest 
quickly followed with a oneway surcharge of 6 the changes are 
effective jan 10 
some industry analysts suggested the highly visible fuel 
surcharges could be a way of bringing public pressure on the oil 
industry to lower prices 
it may be a way of putting some of the heat on oil 
refiners said louis marckesano an airline analyst at the 
philadelphia brokerage janney montgomery scott inc 
oil prices have surged in recent weeks amid the cold wave and 
refinery problems in texas and louisiana jet fuel which 
represents around 35 percent of an airlines operating budget has 
jumped to nearly 1 a gallon from 64 cents at the end of october 
the fuel surcharges do not require government approval for 
domestic flights and most of the airlines imposing them said they 
have sought permission from foreign governments to apply them to 
international flights 
whats happened here its a matter of supply and demand 
said earl ross a spokesman for the american petroleum institute 
an industry association in washington he would not comment on the 
recent demand by several northeast governors and members of 
congress that federal authorities investigate the possibility of 
price fixing 
eastern spokesman robin matell in a statement friday on the 
possibility of a fuel surcharge cited a precipitous and 
unprecedented increase in fuel prices considering there hasnt 
been a disruption in supplies 
easterns fare cuts are designed to lure passengers as the 
airline attempts to rebuild after a hobbling strike and bankruptcy 
proceeding but they also show concern shared by all the airlines 
about the economy this year said raymond neidl an analyst at 
dillon read amp co inc 
bookings are soft thats why youre seeing discounts he 
said 
neidl and other analysts estimate that the airline industrys 
total seat capacity will increase 6 percent this year as new jets 
are put into service while passenger traffic will rise only 2 
percent to 3 percent

book and magazine publisher enrico 
vallecchi died thursday in his castle on the outskirts of florence 
at age 87 
vallecchi took charge of the family publishing company after 
world war ii from his father attilio who had founded it 
the firm published some of the most prominent italian writers of 
the 1930s and 1940s such as curzio malaparte aldo palazzeschi and 
vasco pratolini in the postwar years however it faced increased 
economic difficulties due to growing competition and the lack of a 
sales network 
vallecchi was forced to sell the company in the early 1960s and 
went on to found a new one and successfully publish magazines on 
hunting fishing horseback riding and other outdoor activities 
which he loved 
he never lost interest in his fathers venture and in 1983 
bought back a controlling interest in vallecchi becoming chairman 
of its board of directors 
the company has made a slow but steady recovery and still prints 
novels and nonfiction

us marshals are throwing mattresses on 
the floor for federal prisoners and driving hundreds of miles a day 
in a hunt for empty jail beds as authorities grapple with the 
northeasts inmate glut 
the overcrowding problems were being discussed today at a 
northeast jail crisis meeting that was to continue friday at 
the us marshals service headquarters in alexandria va said 
fran wermuth a marshals service spokeswoman 
this problem is not just in the northeast area this group is 
meeting but this problem with jail crowding is fairly typical 
across the nation she said 
the federal prison population has not just expanded it has 
exploded said us marshal pasquale a mangini of connecticut 
the bureau of prisons said wednesday a projected doubling of 
population in federal prisons during the next five years wont 
provide relief 
flip lorenzoni chief deputy marshal of new yorks southern 
district said the two pretrial detention centers near new york 
city are full women prisoners sometimes have to be driven 500 
miles to alderson wva 
we make that trip about weekly he said 
greg bogdan of the bureau of prisons in washington estimated the 
federal prison population nationwide at 54000 a 66 percent 
overcrowding rate and said that figure was expected to grow to 
about 90000 by 1995 
he said the problem is especially acute in the east but a 
growing concern elsewhere 
the east and west coasts and the southeast portion of the 
country are the areas where we anticipate the biggest growth 
bogdan said 
chronic overcrowding in rhode islands only prison forced the 
state department of corrections to cancel a contract with federal 
officials to keep suspects there rhode island and massachusetts 
have no federal detention center 
us marshal donald wyatt said rhode island marshals at minimum 
take a twohour trip to the federal detention center in hartford 
conn the nearest federal prison is a 3hour drive to danbury 
conn a prison with a 514inmate capacity that has 868 prisoners 
he said 
sometimes deputies are driving to otisville ny from 
philadelphia rhode island vermont maine and massachusetts 
the ultimate solution is to build federal detention centers 
close to courthouses said wyatt adding that his office has 
spent about 175000 in overtime and hiring new guards 
the defense department meanwhile is reviewing a list of 18 
military bases in the northeast proposed for housing temporary 
cells 
the pretrial population has ballooned because new laws lock up 
more prisoners until trial and other laws eliminate parole and 
lengthen sentences for chronic armed and drug offenders 
providence attorney john f cicilline who represents many 
federal defendants said the distances that defense lawyers must 
drive to see their clients creates a serious constitutional 
violation 
rhode island us attorney lincoln c almond said the problem of 
where to put the prisoners is so acute that occasionally arrests 
and indictments have been delayed 
in boston last month six or seven prisoners including three 
reputed mafia capos had to sleep on the floor in a holding cell 
which usually houses prisoners only during the day 
if you have a multiple defendant arrest its a mindboggling 
experience to find a place to put them mangini said 
bogdan said 10 prison construction projects are in various 
stages across the country and plans to build four more detention 
centers and expand some existing facilities were on the drawing 
board 
nixon said there were a multitude of solutions to the 
overcrowding problem including building more local jails building 
a federal facility in massachusetts or erecting metropolitan 
correctional centers he said 
such jailhouses already in use in new york and florida are 
easytobuild temporary housing for prisoners located close to the 
courts

a man who told police his pregnant wife was 
fatally wounded by a robber as they left a hospital childbirth 
class killed himself this morning hours after becoming a suspect in 
the slaying police said 
the body of charles stuart of suburban reading was pulled from 
the harbor shortly before 1 pm and positively identified said 
trooper barbara bennett a state police spokeswoman 
stuarts wife carol was fatally wounded oct 23 and their son 
christopher delivered prematurely by caesarean section as his 
mother lay dying survived just 17 days after the widely publicized 
shootings 
basically its fair to say he could not handle the 
allegations or statements made about him suffolk county 
prosecutor newman flanagan said describing a handwritten suicide 
note found in stuarts car 
stuart who spent more than a month in the hospital after being 
wounded in the shootings died after he jumped off tobin bridge 
into boston harbor it took police divers several hours to find the 
body after it was originally spotted in the water by a police 
officer and a worker 
flanagan said stuart became a suspect wednesday after boston 
police and investigators from his office interrogated several 
people late into the night the prosecutor said the dramatic story 
stuart initially told about being attacked by an unknown robber 
while leaving the hospital is not true he would not elaborate 
or say whether stuart was one of those who was interrogated 
stuart the 29yearold manager of a fur store had told police 
that he and his wife 30 a laywer were leaving brigham and 
womens hospital in boston after attending a birthing class when an 
assailant commandeered their car and forced them to drive into an 
adjacent neighborhood where he robbed and shot them mrs stuart 
seven months pregnant was shot in the head stuart in the abdomen 
though critically wounded stuart summoned help on the car 
telephone his frantic 10minute call to police and the 
dispatchers efforts to determine where the car was were broadcast 
nationally and prompted an outpouring of sympathy for stuart 
no arrest warrant had been issued prior to stuarts 
disappearance but flanagan said i would assume he could very 
well have been aware of having become a suspect 
flanagan would not comment on a report by wnevtv that stuart 
became the prime suspect after his brother matthew went to police 
and offered information 
a man who answered the telephone at matthew stuarts suburban 
home this morning said the brother was not there and no one in the 
family would comment 
after the news of stuarts death came out mrs stuarts father 
giusto dimaiti was rushed to massachusetts general hospital with 
an undisclosed ailment the hospital would not discuss his 
condition 
edward marchand chief of police in charles stuarts hometown of 
reading said stuarts house had been watched by police overnight 
after boston police informed the suburban police that stuart was a 
suspect but stuart never returned home 
marchand said he believed stuart was aware his house was being 
watched 
the shootings shocked the city and caused some racial tension 
stuart had described the attacker as a black man 
in a note read at mrs stuarts funeral that stuart had written 
in his hospital bed he said my life will be empty without you 
now youre taken away from me i will never know the feeling of 
your hand in mine among the mourners were gov michael dukakis 
and mayor raymond flynn 
marchand would not say why stuart had become a suspect but he 
said theres a lot more to the story 
steve aitkins of the coast guard said a wallet and a note were 
found in stuarts car which was discovered parked on a lower level 
of the 300foothigh doubledecked bridge over boston harbor 
shortly before christmas stuart viewed a lineup containing an 
alleged suspect but officials and lawyers refused to say whether 
an identification was made 
asked if a man named in news reports as the alleged suspect 
william bennett could still be suspected of being involved in the 
shootings flanagan said he was no longer a suspect

life on the river and the law of the land 
were at odds thursday as lawyers for illinois and kentucky argued 
about the border between their two states and control of the ohio 
river 
illinois lawyer told retired new york court of appeals judge 
matthew j jasen appointed a special maser in the case that an 
unbroken line of us supreme court precedents supports his states 
claim to a strip of the ohio river about 100 feet wide 
but a kentucky assistant attorney general said illinois by 
refusing to police the river or exercise any control over it has 
tacitly acknowledged for years that kentucky owns the entire river 
up to the illinois shore 
illinois fishermen complain that kentucky authorities have 
demanded they buy kentucky licenses to fish from the illinois shore 
after attempts to resolve the fishermens complaints failed 
illinois attorney general neil hartigan took the case to the us 
supreme court in 1986 the high court appointed jasen who retired 
that year after 18 years on new york states highest court to hear 
evidence and make a recommendation 
when kentucky was admitted to the union in 1792 its border was 
declared to be the lowwater mark on the northern shore of the ohio 
river 
that was fine until 1909 when dams raised the water level 
kentucky claimed it should control the river up to the new 
lowwater mark while illinois indiana and ohio said the 1792 
boundary should still hold even though the shoreline had moved 
beyond it 
john j brunsman an illinois assistant attorney general said 
the us supreme court had settled that argument in favor of ohio 
and indiana and should do the same for illinois 
rickie l pearson brunsmans counterpart from kentucky 
conceded that the precedents were against him but said the high 
court in the ohio and indiana cases had not considered the facts 
of life on the river 
kentucky has patrolled the river there have been no law 
enforcement officers from illinois on the river to do anything 
pearson said 
he cited three incidents that he said bolster his case 
illinois state police once said they doubted they had 
crowdcontrol jurisdiction over a strike at a waterfront business 
in joppa ill because its pier extended into the river 
firefighters in golconda ill refused to put out a fire on a 
boat grounded 5 to 10 feet from shore because the boat was in 
kentucky and it was their problem 
illinois state police told a man whose boat had been moored on 
the illinois side of the river to call kentucky to report it stolen 
brunsman responded with examples of his own including 73 
building permits issued by the illinois department of 
transportation for structures extending into the river 
pearson said the fact that illinois coroners call their kentucky 
counterparts before issuing death certificates for drowning victims 
showed the illinois coroners knew the river was in kentucky 
brunsman said the kentucky coroners acknowledged illinois 
jurisdiction by releasing the bodies to that state 
jasen asked both lawyers for more detail ordered a status 
report by march 1 he said the high court wants a report in time 
for its october session

navigation resumed along the entire 
monongahela river on thursday three days after at least 61 barges 
broke free and crashed downstream one of them spilling 10000 
gallons of gasoline 
the coast guard reopened the river near the maxwell locks and 
dam after searching 11 hours with sonar equipment for sunken 
barges the 20mile section south of pittsburgh had been closed to 
traffic since the new years day accident and all but five miles 
was reopened wednesday 
six vessels were waiting to clear the maxwell locks near 
brownsville 61 miles upstream from pittsburgh when clearance came 
before dawn the coast guard gave the ok after the sonar failed to 
turn up any barges it didnt know about 
were about normal lockmaster todd rankin said at midday 
there was a little bit of a mad dash when we first opened some 
boats had been waiting in the landing for us to open up as soon as 
we opened up they cleared out pretty quickly 
the coast guard warned operators dec 26 that a thaw was 
expected by weekend and advised them to make certain their barges 
were tied strongly to shore so rushing chunks of ice and high water 
would not knock the vessels free offenders could be fined up to 
1000 for each runaway craft 
the barge that spilled 10000 gallons of gasoline had been 
moored at at speers 44 miles upstream from pittsburgh the vessel 
went over the locks and dam at charleroi then hit the monongahela 
bridge 
state officials said environmental damage was slight 
one of the sunken barges remained jammed thursday beneath one of 
the gates at the maxwell dam the vessel was among 37 that were 
ripped from their moorings there thirty of them sank and piled up 
against the dam 
the army corps of engineers said it would try removing the barge 
from the gate this weekend then try to salvage the other vessels

one of manuel antonio noriegas bodyguards 
overheard us servicemen discussing the invasion of panama hours 
before it occurred a pentagon spokesman said thursday but it was 
unclear whether the incident enabled the ousted panamanian leader 
to evade the americans 
there is some evidence that some officials may have had some 
advance thought that this operation was about to happen but there 
isnt a lot of evidence that actions were taken as a result of 
that defense department spokesman pete williams told reporters 
a bodyguard during a debriefing interview said that two us 
soldiers had been overheard discussing their positions for hhour 
and that supposedly happened at 10 pm three hours before the 
attack was to begin said williams i have no other details 
noriega is believed to have escaped from one of his residences 
minutes before a us commando unit arrived just after midnight 
dec 20 and fled from house to house in panama city in the days 
thereafter according to military officals noriega found refuge in 
the vatican embassy on dec 24 and turned himself over to us 
officials wednesday 
fighting has all but ceased in panama said williams and 
pentagon officials were withdrawing some troops and sending new 
ones in their place 
the number of us servicemen in panama stood at about 25000 
the same as it was shortly after the invasion as combat troops 
were withdrawn and replaced by military police and civil affairs 
specialists said williams 
the spokesman was unable to give a breakdown of the remaining 
troops by unit and function or to say whether or when the number 
of troops in panama would be reduced to the preinvasion level of 
about 12000 
the troops are stationed there to guard the panama canal under 
the terms of bilateral treaty under which the united states is to 
turn the waterway over to panama in the year 2000 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff flew 
to panama today to assess the withdrawal schedule 
williams said that four noriega associates remain inside the 
vatican embassy despite noriegas decision to surrender 
he identified the four as lt col nivaldo madrinan director 
of the panamanian equivalent of the fbi and cia capt asuncion 
gaitan an escort to noriega carlos castillo leader of a 
pronoreiga political party and castillos wife belgica castillo 
director of immigration 
in other developments two us servicemen had been killed and 
three others injured in noncombat incidents said williams but he 
did not have details 
the number of american troops killed in action stood at 23 and 
the nunmber wounded at 323 all of the combat casualties were men 
he said three us civilians were killed and one was injured 
among noreigas panama defense forces said williams 314 were 
killed and 124 were wounded in the fighting 
williams also said that us forces had collected 76553 weapons 
in panama including 7743 under a cashforguns program that has 
cost the us government 691000 
additionally said williams us forces had captured 39 armored 
vehicles 36 aircraft and seven vessels he was unable to specify

a soninlaw in charge of buying and selling 
land in phoenix millionaire charles h keatings nowcollapsed real 
estate and savings and loan empire said thursday he was advised by 
attorneys he did not need appraisals on the deals 
testifying in keatings suit to overturn a federal takeover last 
april of lincoln savings and loan association robert m 
wurzelbacher jr also said he did not investigate the ability of 
some buyers of the land to repay loans from the thrift financing 
the deals 
but he added as far as i know the thrift complied with all 
state and federal regulations in using lincoln and its federally 
insured deposits to carry out an estimated 1 billion in land 
stock and other transactions between 1984 and 1988 
keating and his son charles h keating iii were scheduled to 
testify later thursday in us district court here as subpoenaed 
government witnesses 
citing fifth amendment protections against selfincrimination 
the elder keating refused to answer questions the last time he was 
subpoenaed a november appearance before the house banking 
committee 
as a large political benefactor keating is now the centerpiece 
of a congressional ethics scandal involving 13 million he gave to 
five senators who interceded with the regulators on lincolns 
behalf in 1987 
in seizing the irvine calif based lincoln sampl federal 
regulators have contended that keating was operating it in an 
unsafe and unsound manner citing as examples the lack of 
appraisals and inadequate reviews of borrowers financial status 
the regulators now claim that lincolns losses of depositors 
federally insured savings in what they call sham land deals 
eventually could cost taxpayers up to 2 billion making it the 
most expensive of nearly 600 sampl failures in the past two years 
wurzelbacher the chief executive officer of lincolns real 
estate subsidiary and a vice president of its holding company 
american continental corp is married to one of keatings 
daughters 
he acknowledged in testimony that keating purchased lincoln in 
1984 to provide a source of cash for large planned residential 
developments that he wanted to build in the phoenix area 
the bank provided a source of funds to acquire and develop the 
properties he said we were able to capitalize subsidiaries 
with funds from lincoln 
wurzelbacher said lincoln did not review the ability of 
borrowers to repay the loans because the thrift would get the land 
back through foreclosures if the payments were not made 
he said he was told in 1985 or 1986 by the thrifts 15lawyer 
legal department that the appraisals were not needed 
we were delighted wurzelbacher said i knew that it would 
elimninate a usually lengthy and cumbersome step in selling real 
estate 
government attorneys on wednesday revealed documents showing 
that a real estate attorney hired by lincoln to review its loan 
portfolio in 1987 labeled as ridiculous a 50 million loan to a 
business associates partnership that listed only 110 in assets 
documents show 
the attorney lois gordon called the loan to phoenix developer 
ernest c garcia a suspicious transaction and warned lincolns 
executives in a letter in early 1988 that its linkage to other 
deals with garcia may cause investigators to seek to uncover 
other linked transactions 
miss gordon testified wednesday that she was hired by lincoln 
and its owners to review its loan portfolio for weaknesses that 
might be objectionable to state and federal regulators 
she said she found fault with several lincoln loans she 
reviewed including the absence of property appraisals financial 
statements from borrowers and other normal underwriting 
requirements

shoppers have virtually emptied state 
store 122 of its goods because the switch to a market economy is 
driving prices up and poles figure everything will cost more next 
week 
i had heaps of sugar and flour enough to last three months 
but when the year came to an end people bought everything out 
within a week said teresa sasin who manages the food store 
the day after new years i had a delivery of 500 kilos 1100 
pounds of sugar and it was sold out within an hour she said 
gesturing toward the empty shelves same with eggs ten crates 
were sold out in an hour 
similar scenes have been reported in staterun grocery and meat 
stores around the nation thursday as customers stock up before 
prices are raised again some stores closed because they had 
nothing more to sell 
prices have been freed as part of a radical economic plan 
designed by the solidarityled government to end central economic 
control and subsidies and after an initial spurt in prices halt 
the inflation that has plagued the moribund economy 
electricity went up 600 percent and the price of gasoline 
doubled this week alone 
food prices are supposed to rise more gradually from 25 to 50 
percent a month to cushion the shock prices increased this week 
in stores that received deliveries based on new prices for january 
but others still were selling goods at last years prices 
private and cooperative groceries which charge higher prices 
than state stores also were crowded 
were still operating on old prices so people are buying 
everything they can get their hands on said jadwiga dzierecka 
director of agricoop no 1 in warsaw 
the agricoop chain is a cooperative soon to be become a stock 
company under economic legislation passed by parliament last week 
its stores sell an array of cheeses fresh produce and imported 
foods including canned shrimp and italian pasta and olive oil 
our products are so attractive that people still buy ms 
dzierzecka told a reporter between telephone conversations with 
suppliers 
halina samsel coowner of a vegetable stand in warsaws busy 
hala mirowska market said she had raised prices but was confident 
people would continue to buy 
she was charging 190 a kilo 22 pounds for tomatoes 17 
cents a head for lettuce and 84 cents a kilo for fresh mushrooms 
average monthly pay in poland is about 37 or 350000 zlotys 
ms samsel said with a smile the prices are shocking 
customers get upset they are not used to them but they buy there 
is no other way out 
jan kubajek sales director of a wholesale supply house run by 
the state said thursday this unrestrained way of introducing 
new prices is unacceptable retail firms dont have enough money 
so they are delaying payment and well have to limit deliveries 
kubajek said his warehouse supplies sugar and flour to more than 
half the city he said enough stocks are on hand for current needs 
but he expects problems later 
prices for many social groups will be unacceptable he said 
which means sales will decline and many stores may have to close 
agriculture minister czeslaw janicki told the newspaper zycie 
warszawy in an interview published thursday there would be no 
interruption of food supplies 
there are no rational reasons to fear this he said there 
are no disturbances in food production 
janicki acknowledged however that poland had to import 300000 
tons of grain in january and that meat reserves had fallen to 
65000 tons half the nations monthly consumption 
farmers have complained about the rising costs of fuel and 
electricity 
the avalanche of price hikes has already started and this is 
only the beginning tadeusz zablocki a farmer from the baltic 
coast told the newspaper dziennik ludowy production costs in 
agriculture will increase enormously 
butcher shops often are empty by early afternoon 
there is a real problem with meat ms sasin said it was 
the worst holiday season i can remember in years as far as meat and 
sausage go 
janicki said he hoped farmers would begin selling their reserves 
soon many farmers have held products off the market waiting for 
price increases

against libya under national emergency procedures saying the north 
african nation continues to use and support international 
terrorism 
bush in a letter to house speaker thomas s foley and senate 
majority leader george mitchell said he was continuing the 
economic sanctions imposed jan 7 1986 by president reagan the 
sanctions would have expired jan 7 without the executive order to 
extend them 
bush said the government was utilizing the national emergencies 
act to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the united states by 
the actions and policies of the government of libya 
the sanctions include freezing of libyan assets in us banks a 
ban on sales of weapons to libya a ban on trade curtailment of 
travel by americans there a ban on credits or loans to the libyan 
government by us interests and suspension of contracts relating

minimum standards of human behavior bush said in his letter to 
foley and mitchell 
i have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force 
the broad authorities necessary to apply economic pressure to the 
government of libya to reduce its ability to support international 
terrorism

the new finance minister said 
thursday there is no reason for the continued existence of comecon 
the east bloc economic alliance and he said czechoslovakia would 
quit the organization unless it is overhauled 
finance minister vaclav klaus an outspoken advocate of 
freemarket reforms also announced the devaluation of the 
czechoslovak crown by 186 percent against western currencies 
a polish newspaper quoted klaus as saying czechoslovakia would 
propose the dissolution of comecon when the alliance meets in sofia 
on tuesday 
asked at a news conference whether czechoslovakia would propose 
the alliance be disbanded klaus replied comecon cannot 
function the way it is now and there is no reason for its 
existence anymore 
i dont have to call it dissolution but if all our proposals 
are accepted it will not be the same organization he said 
klaus 49 who was appointed finance minister in 
czechoslovakias reformist government last month is a nonparty 
economist who was forced to serve as a lowly bank clerk for his 
beliefs through the 1970s 
czechoslovakia will propose the abolition of a whole range of 
agreements concluded earlier between comecon members klaus said 
those agreements are so far binding our hands he said 
adding that if the czechoslovak proposals are not accepted we 
are ready to get out of such commitments unilaterally 
andrej barcak the foreign trade minister said czechosolvakia 
was not able to function within the organization on the economic 
rules which exist 
it is quite obvious that from a multilateral point of view we 
are not able to form any kind of fundamentally deep integration 
and not many countries are going to even attempt that klaus said 
he said most of the blocs activities would be transformed into 
bilateral relations between countries 
comecon which stands for the council of mutual economic 
assistance was formed under the guidance of the soviet union in 
1949 and has since controlled trade among sovietallied countries 
the member nations are the soviet union bulgaria cuba 
czechoslovakia east germany hungary mongolia poland romania 
and vietnam 
dramatic political changes recently in eastern europe have 
radically decreased the power of communist rulers and many comecon 
members have begun moving away from centrally planned economies 
east bloc countries say comecons payments framework doesnt 
work because it is based on barter fixed prices and a 
nonconvertible currency the soviet ruble 
more reformoriented countries like czechoslovakia say they need 
hard currency to breathe new life into stagnating economies 
the devaluation of the crown against major currencies means 
that as of jan 8 one dollar will buy 17 czechoslovak crowns 
compared to the current rate of just over 14 
a new tourist rate will be introduced on jan 8 giving the 
tourist 38 crowns up from 9 crowns for one us dollar in a bid 
to match the current black market rate in hard currencies 
at the same time klaus said the crown would be revalued by 10 
percent against the transfer ruble to encourage exports to western 
countries 
referring to the new crown rate for tourists klaus said we 
know this is not going to destroy the black market completely but 
it should be a serious obstacle 
klaus also said that a currency and rate committee of the 
comecon is to meet in prague on jan 1618 all the things we 
cannot settle in sofia we can take care of then he said

associated press writerequals 
east berlin ap six fledgling opposition groups put aside 
their political differences thursday and joined forces to compete 
in national elections against the dominant communist party 
its certainly clear that if we dont work together we will 
fail together said detlef poge of new forum the largest of the 
opposition groups new forum has about 200000 members 
the coalition to be called election alliance 90 joins new 
forum with the social democratic party democratic awakening 
democracy now the initiative for peace and human rights and the 
united left 
the groups have espoused varying policies since they were formed 
after the fall prodemocracy movement which ended the communist 
partys monopoly on power and led to the scheduling of elections 
may 6 
the communist party has been portraying itself as the defender 
of democracy against greedy capitalists and a resurgence of 
neofascism polls show it would attract more voter support than 
any single party if elections were held today 
an antifascist rally sponsored by the communists on wednesday 
drew up to 250000 people according to some estimates 
steffen reiche of the social democrats said leaflets distributed 
at the rally seemed to suggest his party sympathized with the aims 
of rightwing radicals 
reiche rejected any association of his party with the right and 
said the opposition groups have grown to realize their only chance 
of overcoming the communists is as a bloc 
in order to ensure a democratic restructuring of east germany 
we need an alliance of the opposition he said on west berlin 
television 
reunification of east and west germany is one area where the 
opposition parties have differed 
leaders of democracy now have advocated a gradual reunification 
with west germany while new forum and the social democrats contend 
east german sovereignty must be protected 
the degree that western investment should be encouraged to ease 
east germanys economic crisis has also been a matter of dispute 
among the opposition forces as have environmental policies such as 
whether nuclear energy should replace brown coal a heavy pollutant 
that fires much of the nations industry 
in a late december survey of 800 east german voters conducted by 
the academy of social sciences and confirmed by west german 
researchers 34 percent said they would vote for the communists if 
elections were held now 
the newly independent christian democratic union drew the 
secondstrongest support with a distant 79 percent the christian 
democrats had for decades been aligned with and dominated by the 
communists but they broke away and reorganized last month 
five of the six groups in election alliance 90 polled support in 
the latest survey but together they got only 143 percent support 
reformist premier hans modrow is a communist party member and 
enjoys more public trust than any other figure on the national 
scene the opposition forces contend his government is transitional 
and has limited authority to decide how the nation should proceed 
with reforms 
lech walesa leader of polands solidarity movement met with 
some east german opposition leaders thursday and told them they 
need to use more common sense to achieve their goals 
i dont have to remind you that we are taking part in a great 
game that only just started i would not like you to be too 
euphoric this is a serious game walesa said during the 
meeting in gdansk 
the east germans at the meeting included barbel bohley and jens 
reich of new forum michael bartoszek of dmocracy now and wolfgang 
templin of peace and human rights 
meanwhile east germany said the compulsory term for military 
service has been cut from 18 months to 12 months 
about 25000 of the armys 170000 soldiers who have already 
served a year or more will be released national peoples army 
spokesman uwe hempel told reporters 
the age range for compulsory service has also been shortened 
from 18 to 23 instead of 18 to 26

directors of the national association of black journalists had 
scheduled their quarterly meeting for jan 1214 in phoenix the 
king holiday was to have been celebrated jan 15

federal marshals guarding the biggest catch of 
their careers gen manuel antonio noriega secured a courthouse 
thursday with twoway radios metal detectors binoculars and 
weapons 
officers were stationed throughout the 10story federal 
courthouse at all doors and in the streets outside while the 
ousted panamanian leader occupied a basement cell before his 
arraignment in a 1988 drug indictment 
obviously theyve increased security said a receptionist 
who worked for daniel horgan chief us marshal in miami but he 
wont make any comment the receptionist would not give her name 
jose cepero a cubanamerican who was picketing outside court 
with a sign saying us hands off panama was attacked by a 
member of a panamanian exile group 
his sign was torn to pieces and he was hit on the head and 
shoulders before police and marshals moved in cepero who was led 
away for his own protection was shaken up but had no visible 
injuries 
about 20 marshals about double the usual number guarded 
barricades at the prisoner entrance to the courthouse and 
pedestrians were forced to walk on the other side of the street 
plainclothes marshals equipped with binoculars scanned the 
surrounding neighborhood from the roof throughout the day instead 
of the normal twicedaily practice when prisoners are being moved 
in and out of the building 
hours before noriega was to reach a ninthfloor courtroom two 
airplanes flew overhead with banners saying bye bye tony and 
rent this ad when fidel falls showing cubanamerican 
solidarity with panamanians 
private security officers supplemented the radioequipped 
marshals in the courthouse and a halfdozen miami police officers 
kept an eye on a growing array of news crews with satellite dishes 
and towers sprouting from their vans 
two miami officers patrolled the front courthouse plaza where a 
few panamanian exiles expressed support for the prosecution of 
noriega one woman wore a tshirt with the words noriega enemy 
no 1 of panama and a mans shirt read democracy for panama 
in spanish 
the us marshals service has a selfcontained system for moving 
defendants in the courthouse outside the public eye holding cells 
in the basement lead to a private elevator that connects by rear 
hallways to courtrooms 
each courtroom has an adjoining holding cell so prisoners can 
make a court appearance without having any contact with the public 
the courtroom reserved for the hearing before us district 
judge william hoeveler has 40 seats and 30 were reserved for news 
media 
visitors must pass through a metal detector to enter the 
courthouse and submit to a search of bags no cameras or tape 
recorders are allowed in the building routine in federal courts 
marshals routinely carry sidearms outside the courthouse but 
store them before coming in contact with prisoners court security 
officers carry handguns in courtrooms the marshals service has a 
small arsenal of automatic weapons rifles and shotguns in the 
courthouse in case of emergency 
there was no indication from federal officials where noriega 
would be placed after his court appearance 
federal prisoners awaiting trial in miami are routinely held at 
the federal metropolitan correctional center south of miami but 
some highprofile drug defendants facing trial in florida notably 
colombian cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas were transported out 
of state for detention 
lehders attorneys became frustrated with federal marshals for 
moving their client at irregular intervals without notice from one 
maximumsecurity prison to another but federal judges did not 
restrain the transfers until shortly before trial

defense minister florian siwicki 
attempting to reform the armed services and cut costs announced 
thursday that the length of compulsory military service will be 
reduced beginning next fall from 24 to 18 months 
siwicki one of four communists serving in the new 
solidarityled government said in a television interview that the 
armed forces had been reduced by 33000 soldiers in 1989 
according to the latest figures from the londonbased institute 
for strategic studies the size of the polish army last year was 
394000 
military officials say costcutting is one of the reasons for 
reducing the armed forces 
siwicki who said the cost of maintaining the army last year was 
16 percent lower than in 1988 told viewers poland was seeking a 
smaller more efficient armed forces and that 50 more army units 
would be dissolved shortly

the discovery of the fossilized bones of a giant 
meateating dinosaur predating the fearsome tyrannosaurus rex 
strengthens the theory that dinosaurs evolved rapidly before 
becoming extinct a scientist said thursday 
the bones of an epanterias were found at the top of the morrison 
formation deposit an ancient saline lakebed near fort collins by 
a paleontology team from the university of colorado museum in 
boulder 
the discovery a year and a half ago was only the third of an 
epanterias according to robert bakker a research associate at the 
museum who announced the find wednesday 
bakker identified the giant member of the allosaur family from a 
jawbone and parts of the neck and tail vertebrate 
bakker said the discover strengthens the theory that dinosaurs 
entombed in the morrison formation which dates to 130 million 
years ago and elsewhere in north america evolved rapidly 
on average the rule is that big animals tend to get bigger 
until they go extinct the incredible size of epanterias indicates 
there was some sort of an evolutionary arms race going on bakker 
said in a telephone interview from boulder 
the epanterias which weighed about four tons and was 50 feet 
long could have eaten about 40 tons of meat annually and its 
ability to expand its enormous jaws much like modernday snakes 
would have allowed epanterias to gulp huge bites of prey easily 
the morrison formation about 50 miles north of denver contains 
up to six distinct dinosaur fauna from successive time periods 
bakker said 
the formation is only about 300 feet deep he said but every 
50 feet or so you have a different species this one was only in 
the last 20 feet and the earlier ones also were shortlived things 
were really moving at that time 
the other two discoveries of epanterias fossils were in 1877 
near canon city 80 miles south of denver and in 1934 in the 
oklahoma panhandle 
epanterias apparently was the last and largest species in the 
evolutionary line of allosaurs carnivorous dinosaurs that walked 
on their hind legs bakker said 
epanterias great size confused early paleontologists he said 
the bones of the canon city specimen were so large they were 
initially misidentified as brontosaur bones 
bakker speculated the size increase of many dinosaur species 
over time may have been due to sexual selection predation success 
or disease resistance 
he subscribes to the theory that dinosaurs were warmblooded 
like modern birds and that dinosaur mass extinctions about 66 
million years ago may have been brought on by extensive migrations 
and outbreaks of disease 
bakker said he and other researchers will study all three 
epanterias specimens and they hope to assemble a complete model 
pieced together from portions of each dinosaur

recommendations for establishing a privately financed national 
volunteerism program 
were recommending setting up a privatepublic foundation 
said new jersey gov thomas h kean the chairman of the 
fivemember presidents advisory committee on the points of light 
initiative 
although bush has discussed a 50 million annual budget to get 
the initiative moving 25 million from the private sector and 
another 25 million in public money kean said the foundation 
should begin immediately without tax dollars 
lets get it up first as a private foundation so we can get it 
going right away he said 
the points of light initiative foundation which would be 
composed of 19 to 25 board members would seek to instill a desire 
for community service in the 50 percent of all americans who never 
have volunteered kean said 
i dont think theres a problem out there that cant be helped 
by volunteers kean said thats not to replace what government 
should be doing no matter what government does it can never be 
enough 
the program takes its name from the presidents inaugural speech

civil rights activists suspended a classroom 
boycott by black students thursday and announced plans to sue the 
majority white board that ousted the citys first black school 
superintendent 
one picket was arrested thursday the second day of the boycott 
and the number of students taking part in the protest dropped 
the 6000student systems absentee rate dropped to 15 percent 
from 25 percent wednesday but protest leader hank sanders called 
the demonstration very successful district enrollment is about 
70 percent black 
sanders a state senator said the boycott was being suspended 
until jan 16 because final exams begin monday 
he dismissed critics charges that keeping students out of 
school was only hurting them saying the boycott is for the 
future we sometimes have to make a sacrifice in the present for 
gains in the future 
sanders said he would file suit challenging the 1977 act 
creating selmas majoritywhite school board contending it did not 
meet the requirements of federal voting rights law 
last month the board refused to renew superintendent norward 
roussells contract which expires june 30 
the vote followed an evaluation by board members that accused 
the superintendent who has held the post since 1987 of being 
dictatorial and intimidating teachers 
roussell has described the evaluation as unfair but opposes the 
boycott saying it had less to do with him or the schools than with 
selmas history of racial unrest including the violence used on 
civil rights marchers in 1965 
a protester was arrested thursday after roussell signed a 
warrant for his arrest 
ernest j swift was arrested while picketing outside an 
elementary school attended by his two children he was charged with 
disorderly conduct and harassment and released on 1000 bail

lithuanian communist leaders met thursday with 
mikhail s gorbachev and said the kremlin leader failed to sway 
them from their decision to split from the soviet communist party 
and pursue local independence 
the no 2 party official in the baltic republic reported that 
gorbachev vowed not to interfere 
we determined our positions from which we will not be 
moved romualdas ozolas a member of the lithuanian partys 
19member ruling bureau told staterun tv in vilnius lithuanias 
capital after he and the rest of the delegation flew home from 
moscow 
there was no immediate report from the tass news agency or other 
moscowbased official media on the closeddoor talks which the 
lithuanians said lasted more than five hours 
gorbachev has vigorously opposed the lithuanians decision two 
weeks ago to create an independent party and the national partys 
policymaking central committee has directed him to travel to the 
republic soon to try to mend the schism 
the dec 21 vote by a congress of lithuanian communists to break 
with moscow ran counter to more than seven decades of recognized 
local party subservience to the kremlin in an atmosphere of 
growing restiveness among the soviet unions patchwork of ethnic 
groups it could trigger a stampede from central party control 
elsewhere in the country 
after the talks with gorbachev party second secretary vladimir 
beriozov told radio and tv in his republic that no attempt will 
be made to try to stop the process in lithuania communists want 
independence i think we were understood 
beriozovs comments like those of ozolas were reported to the 
associated press by tv journalist eduardas potashinskas in vilnius 
however beriozov also noted that the opinion of gorbachev is 
not the opinion of the central committee 
the soviet partys 250member central committee which sets 
policy and can change the partys leader reportedly includes 
members who advocated taking strong measures against the 
separatists 
the central committee held a twoday emergency meeting on the 
split on dec 26 it instructed gorbachev to go to lithuania to 
try to heal the break beriozov said gorbachev will meet with a 
variety of people during the visit which he said was scheduled 
jan 1012 
as gorbachev and the lithuanian leaders conferred the estonian 
partys central committee convened to consider following the 
example set by their baltic neighbors by adopting a draft policy 
statement favoring independence for estonia and its communist 
party said local journalist tarmu tammerk 
the draft reportedly opposed by ethnic russians is somewhat 
vague on whether the party would separate or try to be 
independent within the soviet party tammerk said he said 
estonian media announced a statement had been adopted thursday 
night but gave no details so it was not clear whether the draft 
had been approved as written 
in remarks reported by tass however estonian party leader 
vaino vyalyas pointedly told his central committee that the 
lithuanian communist partys path to autonomy cannot serve as a 
direct example for reforming the estonian communist party 
the estonians scheduled a special party conference feb 9 and a 
more formal congress march 23 where a vote could be taken on 
creating a separate party said tammerk speaking from tallinn 
estonias capital 
gorbachev had summoned the entire bureau of the lithuanian party 
to a meeting in moscow apparently in hopes of winning a reversal of 
the decision to break away potashinskas said they were received by 
three of the 12 members of the ruling soviet politburo gorbachev 
party ideology secretary vadim a medvedev and international 
affairs specialist alexander n yakovlev medvedev and yakovlev are 
regarded as key gorbachev advisers 
the politburos strongest conservatives such as yegor k 
ligachev were absent potashinskas said 
previously gorbachev opposed the lithuanian decision to split 
from the national party but he and other officials have also 
indicated the kremlin would not use force to keep the secessionist 
baltic republics in line 
we are not talking about using force but we are talking about 
clearing the matter up foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov said sunday on tuesday he told the bbc the kremlin has 
only one tool for preventing a breakup of the union it is 
dialogue dialogue and dialogue the only way is political means 
we have no other choice 
in a speech to the partys central committee on dec 25 
gorbachev noted that extraordinary measures such as troops and 
tanks have been used against hooligans in rioting in 
uzbekistan and the disputed region of nagornokarabakh in 
azerbaijan 
but in these conditions when we have the participation of 
wide strata of the population we have tried and are trying to use 
political means he said 
the movement in lithuania for the independence of both the local 
party and the republic is supported by hundreds of thousands of 
people 
gorbachev went on to denounce party members calling for 
traditional strongarm methods terror he said is an 
ineffective and hopeless means of regulating social life and in 
the final account a measure of weakness 
some dissenting communists in lithuania have formed an alternate 
central committee that proclaims continuing fealty to moscow and 
the soviet communist party that gorbachev heads

members of congress hailing the surrender of 
manuel antonio noriega said thursday that the united states must 
quickly reduce its military presence in panama and provide 
largescale economic aid 
the us should now devote its energies to assisting president 
endara and the panamanian people in establishing an effective new 
democratic government said senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
mitchell also said american troops should return home as soon 
as possible 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed forces 
committee who spent 36 hours in panama on an inspection tour 
agreed 
we need the us military presence not only to become less 
visible but less present nunn said thursday on his return to 
washington adding that hundreds of millions of dollars in 
international aid will be needed to speed panamas economic 
recovery 
early thursday a 32member congressional delegation led by 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo left on a previously 
planned twoday trip to panama 
gephardt said issues to be addressed include how long the 
military occupation will last how much public and private aid is 
needed to rebuild the economy how democratic and social 
institutions can be strengthened and the status of the panama 
canal 
noriega who surrendered to us officials in panama city on 
wednesday night after taking refuge in the vatican embassy faces 
drug trafficking charges in the united states 
if convicted of charges cited in the major of two federal 
indictments noriega could be sentenced to 145 years in prison and 
fined more than 11 million 
i predict noriega is going to spend the rest of his life 
behind bars said sen alphonse damato rny 
noriega will receive justice in this country which is more 
than he gave the panamanian people said senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan 
noriega said rep ike skelton dmo is an international 
snake that has finally been put in his cage 
several house and senate members said the panamanian army used 
by noriega as an instrument of dictatorial control should either 
be eliminated or sharply scaled back 
nunn said he was told by panama canal co officials that 
noriegas forces had increased harassment of panamanaian workers 
causing key employees to leave he said he was told that the 
continued operation of the canal would have been jeopardized had 
the harassment continued 
nunn said that while a new panamanian army will be needed to 
help defend the canal it should not be allowed to become an 
allpervasive instrument of control as it was under noriega 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the senate foreign 
relations subcommittee on latin america said the panamanian 
defense force should be abolished and that elections be called as 
soon as possible to legitimize the endara government 
the foreign relations committee will begin extensive hearings 
soon on a substantial aid authorization for panama to repair war 
damage rejuvenate the economy and build democratic institutions 
he said 
many members of congress said noriegas arrest represented a 
major victory in the war on drugs and the elimination of panama as 
a moneylaundering center 
all americans rejoice that the united states armed forces have 
brought this indicted drugrunning thug to justice said sen 
carl levin dmich 
sen john f kerry dmass who has conducted a series of 
hearings on international drug traffic said the action against 
noriega has very significant impact but warned that noriegas 
arrest could wind up being mere fluff in the drug war unless 
there is emphasis on reducing us demand for drugs 
a spokesman for former president reagan said reagan believes 
that the arrest of the former us ally will send a clear message 
to drug dealers around the world that their behavior will not be 
tolerated

a new holding center for vietnamese boat people 
is being built in a restricted area newspapers reported thursday 
and they suggested the new site was selected in part to prevent 
eyewitness accounts of further forced repatriations 
the newspapers identified the new holding center as san uk ling 
which is in an area of the rural new territories that requires 
special permission to enter 
on dec 12 51 vietnamese were forcibly repatriated from the 
british colony by security forces who entered the phoenix house 
detention center before dawn 
reporters outside phoenix house could hear vietnamese scream for 
help and could see a handwritten sign that read where is your 
humanity 
photographs of the vietnamese pleading for help through the 
barred windows of the detention center were printed in newspapers 
around the world embarrassing the hong kong government 
a government spokesman refused to comment directly on the news 
reports about the new holding center which appeared in the hong 
kong standard and the south china morning post but referred 
reporters to an official statement wednesday that said the 
government continues to look for additional sites which could be 
used for vietnamese boat people san uk ling is being considered 
for this purpose and minor works are being carried out there 
about 44000 vietnamese who sailed into this british colony 
after midjune 1988 are in squalid detention centers and face 
repatriation unless they can prove they face persecution in their 
communist homeland 
the government considers the vast majority of the boat people to 
be illegal immigrants who fled to hong kong to seek a better 
economic life 
hong kong media have speculated that the next forced 
repatriation will take place later this month

park rangers thursday 
searched for a coyote that mauled a crosscountry skier in the 
worst such attack in at least a decade 
brian dean 27 of oak lawn ill was listed in good condition 
at bozeman deaconess hospital in montana where he treated for cuts 
and puncture wounds to his head neck and arms doctors were 
deciding whether to treat him for rabies 
the attack was the boldest in a series of aggressive acts by 
coyotes in recent weeks said yellowstone spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
we have not had anything this severe in a very long time 
there have been no severe attacks during the 1980s anzelmo said 
each year we have beggar coyotes that have been fed and 
approach people occasionally and attack them to a lesser degree 
than this attack 
dean who works for a park concessionaire was skiing wednesday 
when he saw the coyote lying on the trail in front of him the 
spokeswoman said anzelmo said the animal attacked dean before he 
had a chance to stop or go around it 
dean beat the animal with a ski and was able to ski to a nearby 
road where a snowmobiler gave him a ride to the old faithful 
geyser complex 
if it is found it will be destroyed and taken to the fish and 
wildlife lab in bozeman for analysis and tests said anzelmo 
late wednesday night rangers came across two coyotes near old 
faithful that had been seen repeatedly approaching people for food 
because the animals had lost their fear of man the rangers shot 
and killed them said anzelmo

a federal judge entered an innocent plea for manuel 
noriega after the fallen dictator refused at his arraignment on 
drug trafficking charges to acknowledge the united states has a 
right to try him 
general noriega refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of this 
court because he is a political prisoner brought to this 
country illegally noriega attorney frank rubino told us 
district judge william hoeveler the judge then entered the plea 
noriega who defied two us presidents until he was toppled by 
the dec 20 american invasion was flown to homestead air force 
base 25 miles south of miami after surrendering to us troops 
outside his vatican embassy refuge in panama city 
rubino had indicated the defense might begin with the theory 
argued earlier that noriega is immune from prosecution in the 
united states as a former head of state 
noriegas attorney steven kollin earlier had discussed plans for 
an innocent plea and the initial stages of a defense 
were going to request certain pretrial discovery requests 
including certain sensitive documents and these sensitive 
documents will get to the truth of the matter kollin said i 
believe he will be found not guilty if we can find a jury of 12 
people after this unparalleled pretrial publicity 
the archbishop of panama marcos mcgrath said today that 
noriega decided to give up after realizing that even his longtime 
supporters had turned against him and he was cornered 
attorney general dick thornburgh in television interviews from 
washington explained the surrender by saying on cbs i think he 
saw the handwriting on the wall he said prosecutors have a 
strong case against noriega adding on nbc if we can make it 
better we wont hesitate to do so 
security officials speaking on condition of anonymity told the 
associated press that noriega had been detained at the courthouse 
noriega who left panama in his generals uniform was wearing a 
khaki openneck shirt and dark trousers as he awaited the 
proceedings a federal worker said 
the us marshals service has holding cells in the courthouse 
basement and a private elevator each courtroom in the 10story 
building has an adjoining holding cell so prisoners can make a 
court appearance without being seen or having any contact with the 
public en route 
noriega was greeted at the florida base by panamanian exiles 
cubanamericans and others cheering his downfall some of the 
celebrants moved their party before dawn to the courthouse where 
authorities briefly sealed off adjacent streets 
streets were reopened as the demonstration broke up but about 
150 to 200 people many from the news media remained outside this 
morning 
panamanians celebrated in the streets as he left the country he 
has dominated since 1983 as military leader and panamanian exiles 
cheered in the cool night air outside the air base where a c130 
carrying him landed at 245 am 
i wanted my children to see the reason people in panama have 
been suffering said 33yearold manuel arana who brought his 
two young daughters to homestead to me this is as important as 
the berlin wall coming down 
maj bob barca of the air force said noriega departed the base 
at 251 am but he would not disclose where noriega was taken 
word of noriegas departure from panama late wednesday triggered 
celebrations across panama city people banged pots and pans and 
kissed us soldiers fireworks lighted the sky around the vatican 
mission youngsters raced up and down streets waving panamanian and 
us flags 
we are relieved to be rid of this criminal panamanian 
president guillermo endara said in a statement broadcast on 
national television the people feel a sense of peace knowing 
that the monster is leaving our land 
in washington president bush said noriega who had taken refuge 
in the embassy on christmas eve turned himself over to us 
authorities voluntarily and with the full knowledge of the 
panamanian government 
it seems that the vatican officials basically stressed to 
noriega that his only viable strategy was to give himself up 
said a us official in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
bush said in his nationwide address that he is committed to 
giving noriega a fair trial 
the united states agreed to three conditions set by noriega 
that he be allowed to make some phone calls that his decision be 
kept secret until the actual time of his arrest and that he be 
permitted to wear his uniform administration officials said 
although gen maxwell thurman the commanding general of us 
forces in panama said there were no deals here administration 
officials said the united states had also promised noriega he would 
not be prosecuted under a new federal law allowing the death 
penalty for drug kingpins 
the assurances were relayed to noriega through vatican 
officials the united states did not directly deal with noriega 
the sources said 
thurman said noriega looked vigorous looked confident as he 
walked out of the compound with the papal nuncio monsignor 
sebastian laboa 
thurman said noriegas surrender completes the fourth of our 
four objectives in invading panama the others he said were to 
protect american lives safeguard the integrity of the panama canal 
treaties and restore democracy to panama 
according to authorities about 290 panamanian soldiers 300 
civilians 23 us troops and three american civilians died in the 
invasion 
if convicted noriega faces up to 145 years in prison and fined 
11 million he faces similar federal charges in tampa 
a roadblock to prosecuting noriega is his right to demand 
classified information stemming from his past cooperation with the 
central intelligence agency legal experts have said 
noriega reportedly worked closely with the cia and the pentagon 
while he served as the head of panamas military intelligence 
service and after he became commander in chief 
but the fact he was on us soil brought hope to panamanians who 
had lived under noriegas regime 
among those waiting outside homesteads main gates early today 
was adela giroldi whose husband moises was executed after 
leading a failed coup against noriega last october 
this is a great day said mrs giroldi i never thought 
id see noriega being brought to justice in this way this is a 
day all panamanians celebrate

the soviet union has promised romania 
extensive aid a senior leader said thursday including fuel to 
provide the winter warmth nicolae ceausescu allowed only himself 
and his acolytes 
foreign policy official silviu brucan said romania expects much 
from talks with eduard a shevardnadze the soviet foreign 
minister who arrives saturday on the first visit by a ranking 
kremlin official since ceausescu was overthrown dec 22 and 
executed three days later 
eastern europes democratic tide has pulled other former 
satellites away from the soviet union but the romanian revolt 
appears to have improved relations with moscow ceausescu often 
went his own way on trade and foreign policy and had resisted the 
reform promoted by mikhail s gorbachev 
brucan told a news conference the communist party had collapsed 
and that the national salvation front now running the country hopes 
to publish a new law in late january providing for free elections 
he denied reports of an advance plan to oust ceausescu and said 
the fronts current leaders first met on dec 22 after an 
uprising of students and workers supported by the army had forced 
ceausescu out 
the front will enter candidates in the elections expected in 
april and take part with all its might said brucan a 
73yearold former diplomat dismissed by ceausescu in 1966 
a halfdozen independent parties formed since the downfall of 
ceausescu who ruled romania for 24 years argue for a delay in 
elections they say holding them so soon will give candidates of 
the front an unfair advantage 
brucan said the front originally wanted elections in july or 
august but chose april at the request of students who led the 
uprising against ceausescu 
from the soviet union we expect massive assistance said 
brucan who told british television wednesday he had received 
reluctant backing for a revolt against ceausescu when he discussed 
the possibility with soviet policymakers on a visit to moscow in 
late 1988 
we have been promised from the top in moscow that we will 
receive aid in oil and natural gas to help us overcome this 
difficult winter he said 
the soviet union traditionally been a major energy supplier to 
romania in recent years ceausescu paid for the fuel with food and 
used it for industrial projects while ordering severe energy 
rationing in frigid dark homes and offices 
his restrictions on heat and light have been lifted enabling 
romanians to enjoy those basic comforts for the first time in eight 
winters the new leaders also have said all romanians will be able 
to travel freely 
brucan said the communist party which had nearly 4 million 
members in a nation of 23 million would not be a contender in the 
elections 
the communist party is finished terminated because it never 
dissocated itself from ceausescu said the former ambassador to 
the united states and united nations he had spoken out against 
ceausescu the past two years and now oversees foreign policy for 
the national salvation front 
moscow is interested in knowing what is going on in romania 
because the revolution here was unique and because the communist 
party vanished from the scene brucan said 
he did not say whether shevardnadzes visit would include 
discussion of soviet moldavia which consists largely of territory 
annexed by the soviets from romania in 1940 under a secret protocol 
to the hitlerstalin pact soviet embassy sources said the issue 
probably would be raised 
moldavians speak the same language as romanians and want more 
independence from the kremlin which has caused speculation they 
may seek eventual reunification with romania 
gorbachev telephoned romanias interim president ion iliesci 
an acquaintance of many years to express good wishes the call was 
prominently reported in romanias new free press which is 
controlled by the national salvation front 
public rallies were legalized thursday and the leadership said 
the schools would drop compulsory social and political sciences 
intended to inculcate admiration of ceausescu replacing them with 
lessons in democracy 
only rallies in support of ceausescu were allowed while he ran 
the country the new decree signed by iliescu requires 48 hours 
notice of a demonstration

the medellin cocaine cartel kidnapped 
the son of president virgilio barcos closest adviser in 
retaliation for the government crackdown on drug lords a police 
spokeswoman said thursday 
an official of the secret police maj alberto gomez said a 
group of men abducted alvaro diego montoya as he was leaving the 
northern bogota offices of his financial company on dec 20 
montoya is the son of german montoya barcos secretarygeneral 
and his closest adviser 
evidence indicates the medellin cartel is behind the 
kidnapping gomez said in an interview he refused to give 
details of the case 
the bogota newspaper el tiempo citing sources at the 
presidential palace said medellin cartel leader pablo escobar 
ordered the abduction in retaliation for the governments antidrug 
offensive which began after traffickers assassinated a leading 
presidential candidate on aug 18 
a spokeswoman for the investigative unit of the national police 
said by telephone that escobar ordered the kidnapping she gave no 
details and spoke on condition she not be identified 
neither the woman nor gomez could confirm a report in el tiempo 
that the medellin group has kidnapped 18 people the last three 
weeks many of them members of colombias richest families 
el tiempo did not say how authorities established that 
traffickers instead of leftist guerrillas were responsible for 
the kidnappings 
leftist rebels have abducted scores of political leaders 
wealthy farmers and other colombians in recent years the 
guerrillas often either exchange the victims for hefty ransoms or 
use the victims to carry messages to the government 
another bogota paper la prensa also citing presidential palace 
versions said as montoya was leaving the offices of his financial 
services company probolsa an undetermined number of men forced 
him into a car and drove away 
montoyas family kept the kidnapping secret in an effort to gain 
his release la prensa said 
the newspaper said traffickers were apparently holding montoya 
in an effort to force the government to negotiate with them 
the extraditables a shadowy terrorist group linked to the 
medellin cartel has repeatedly demanded negotiations the group 
has said traffickers are willing to lay down their arms and abandon 
the cocaine business in exchange for a government amnesty for past 
crimes 
barco has rejected such proposals 
since august the government has seized millions of dollars in 
property allegedly belonging to escobar and other drug chiefs and 
it has extradited 11 drug suspects to the united states to face 
charges 
authorities blame the drug barons for 261 terrorist attacks that 
have killed 209 people since the crackdown began 
el tiempo said escobar may have ordered montoyas kidnapping 
with the intention of demanding a huge ransom it quoted a 
presidential source as saying the crackdown has disrupted escobars 
cocaine business and hurt his cash flow 
although it is hard to believe the cartel is confronting a 
liquidity problem el tiempo quoted the unidentified source as 
saying 
police have concentrated on finding escobar since his close 
associate gonzalo rodriguez gacha was slain in a gunbattle with 
police on dec 15

turner broadcasting system said thursday it 
had won its battle with the bush administration over providing 
cable news network and a satellite receiving station to vietnam 
the atlantabased turner said the commerce and treasury 
departments which had refused turners request on grounds the deal 
would violate a strict us trade embargo against vietnam finally 
agreed thursday to allow the company to deliver its 24hour cable 
tv news channel to vietnamese television 
in return turner will drop a lawsuit it filed last week in us 
district court against the treasury commerce and state departments 
seeking an injunction to overturn the governments refusal said 
bert carp turners vice president for government relations 
turner had said it would provide the earth receiving station at 
no charge and the cnn signal for the price of 50 vietnamese dong a 
year which is less than one us penny 
but the administration in agreeing to the deal said turner 
will not be allowed to collect any payment according to an 
administration official who spoke only on the condition of 
anonymity 
the administration official said that in making its decision 
the government considered the importance of having us news 
programs in vietnam at the same time the administration stuck 
to its guns over strictly prohibiting any money changing hands 
the official said 
treasury department spokesman larry batdorf said he would have 
no immediate comment 
congress had amended the trade embargo in 1988 to exempt 
information materials from trade sanctions the administration had 
interpreted that to mean physical materials such as books and 
videocassettes could be exchanged with vietnam but not 
immaterial commodities including tv signals 
vietnam already provides videocassettes to turner for cnn 
world report carp said 
carp in a prepared statement said the company was pleased 
the departments of treasury and commerce today approved our 
requests for licenses to provide cnn along with a satellite dish 
to vietnamese television 
he said vietnam will become the 86th country to receive cnn

the government of communist premier hans 
modrow said thursday it wants to reconstitute an intelligence 
service to combat a reported rise in ultrarightist activity 
the proreform movement has insisted that no state security 
force be authorized until a new government is seated after may 6 
elections 
government spokesman wolfgang meyer told a news conference the 
cabinet reviewed recent incidents of vandalism and violence and 
determined that a dangerous situation was taking shape 
meyer said failure to move swiftly to investigate the rightist 
tendencies would cause an irrecoverable delay he said modrow 
plans to provide a very important clarification to parliament 
next week on the need for a state security service 
on wednesday a mass march was held in east berlins treptow 
district to protest recent vandalism by neonazis including 
desecration of a treptow monument to soviet soldiers the official

vandalism and confrontations involving rightwing extremists 
opposition groups say the communists are playing up the neonazi 
issue to gain support for the party prior to elections 
the gravoid charges from 
congressional democrats that president bush was violating his 
nonewtaxes pledge the official said 
the proposal would have imposed new taxes on paper glass 
plastic and metals that were not recycled the environmental 
protection agency which favored the tax concept as a way of 
encouraging greater use of recycled materials by us industry 
wants to reduce the nations output of waste by 25 percent by 1992 
bush as part of his 1988 presidential campaign promised to 
make a national commitment to reduce waste by recycling and 
developing technology that produces less waste 
by making products made from virgin materials more expensive 
supporters of the tax had argued it would encourage businesses to 
use more recycled materials 
another revenue raiser rejected by the administration in recent 
days would have imposed a sales tax on offroad vehicles camping 
equipment motor homes and pleasure boats 
supporters of that rejected proposal wanted to have the new 
revenue earmarked for specific recreation and conservation programs 
on federal lands but it too fell victim to darmans concern that 
critics would charge the president with violating his pledge 
against new taxes 
the various decisions on spending and taxes are being made as 
the administration puts the finishing touches on a proposed 123 
trillion budget for the fiscal year beginning next october the 
budget will be sent to congress on jan 29

the arrival of usousted panamanian leader gen 
manuel antonio noriega to face federal drug charges was the 
crowning achievement of steppedup us efforts to bring key latin 
drug figures to this country 
removing drug suspects from their homelands by force has drawn 
criticism in the foreign countries threats of retribution by 
traffickers and concern from some american defense attorneys 
however prosecutors and president bush have hailed the 
cooperation of other nations 
noriegas apprehension should send a clear signal that the 
united states is serious in its determination that those charged 
with promoting the distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny 
of justice bush told the nation wednesday night 
the arrests of leading figures have had little effect on the 
flow of drugs said broward county sheriff nick navarro but they 
make life more difficult for traffickers and hearten us drug 
fighters 
i think it is important for all of us engaged in this effort 
to see that some of the people who have been getting away with so 
much for so long are being neutralized said navarro leader of a 
statewide antidrug task force and of a department known for 
cocaine sting operations 
since the colombian government began a new crackdown on drug 
dealers last august 11 fugitives have been brought to the united 
states to face charges they include eduardo martinez romero 
reputed financial wizard for the medellin cocaine cartel being 
held at the federal penitentiary in atlanta no trial date has been 
set 
last month the bolivian government arrested former interior 
minister luis arce gomez dubbed the minister of cocaine and 
turned him over to us authorities on 1983 drugtrafficking 
indictments arce gomez is being held without bond south of here 
some bolivian opposition politicians criticized the extradition 
of arce gomez from the country colombian traffickers blamed for 
some 200 deaths and hundreds of woundings in the past year in 
colombia have vowed revenge for extraditions and security has been 
increased for us officials from president bush to miami mayor 
xavier suarez because of alleged assassination plots 
a miami attorney whos a veteran of drug cases said thursday 
that noriegas overthrow highlights a trend toward questionable 
actions abroad in the war on drugs 
i am troubled as a criminal defense lawyer about sending 
troops in a highfashioned posse to secure someone whos alleged to 
be a fugitive said joel hirschhorn 
its scary its as if the rule of law has been abandoned in 
quest of solving a major problem even though its our government 
thats doing it and its for a very lofty reason that doesnt make 
it right he said 
when we look back in the year 2000 im afraid were going to 
have a wasteland of constitutional rights hirschhorn said 
however he and other attorneys said that while noriegas 
attorneys may challenge the way he got here similar cases have 
stood up in the courts before 
there is no formal extradition involved here and the case law 
is that the court will not look to the circumstances by which the 
person was brought to the united states unless those circumstances 
shock the conscience said robert w merkle who was us 
attorney in tampa when noriega was indicted there in 1988 
merkle who is in a private law practice successfully 
prosecuted colombian cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas taken to 
the united states on feb 4 1987 after a shootout at a jungle 
hideout near medellin colombia 
lehder 40 was convicted of conspiracy cocaine importation 
operating a continuing criminal enterprise and eight counts of 
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute he was sentenced 
in july 1988 to life in prison without the possibility of parole 
plus 135 years and is being held in federal prison in marion ill 
lehder rivas was considered a leader of the medellin cartel as 
was gonzalo rodriguez gacha killed last month by colombian police 
in a shootout at a ranch owned by pablo escobar a reputed kingpin 
still being pursued by colombian authorities

ahmad abassi regional traffic officer for pakistan railways at 
sukkur 225 miles north of karachi

other roman catholic nuns said 
thursday they believed contra rebels were responsible for an ambush 
in which two nuns were killed and two other members of the clergy 
were wounded 
we know the area is full of contras said mother superior 
paquita alcacer head of the immaculate conception school in 
managua by logic if they contras are capable of killing 
peasants defenseless women and children then there is no doubt 
they attacked the pickup truck on new years day 
she said that is what i think which doesnt necessarily mean 
its the truth but i think so 
mother superior raymond grieble of the order of st agnes the 
fond du lac wis order to which the nuns belonged said her 
religious workers always travel in clearly marked vehicles 
mother raymond regional head of the order in managua said she 
did not know whether the pickup carried the customary 
whiteandyellow roman catholic flag but added we did have red 
crosses on the front window and the back window 
such identification may have been meaningless because the attack 
occurred after nightfall when only headlights would be visible 
the leftist sandinista government and usbacked contras have 
accused each other of ambushing the vehicle in a remote part of 
northeastern nicaragua 
sister francisca colomer a nicaraguan miskito indian wounded by 
grenade shrapnel was flown milwaukee thursday morning on a plane 
that carried the body of sister maureen courtney home for burial 
the other dead nun sister teresa rosales a miskito indian was 
buried wednesday in puerto cabezas about an hours drive from her 
hometown of santa teresa in northeastern nicaragua 
auxiliary bishop pablo schmitz of the capuchin order was wounded 
in the left arm sister mirna alvarado of the order of st agnes 
said he underwent surgery wednesday and was in good condition at a 
military hospital in managua 
barricada the sandinista party newspaper said in an editorial 
thursday the attack proved the need for disarming the contras 
while the rebels are armed it said each day that passes there 
will be a greater number of defenseless citizens assassinated 
contra leaders have denied responsibility for the attack and 
accused the sandinistas of carrying it out n an attempt to 
discredit the rebels with the us congress 
current us aid to the contras runs out at the end of february 
and congress is expected to discuss continued nonlethal 
assistance the bush administration has indicated it wants the 
contras to remain in existence until after nicaraguas general 
elections feb 25

a senior administration official said thursday 
that china has given indications it will improve its grim human 
rights record in the wake of talks with two highranking bush 
administration officials 
the official speaking to white house reporters on condition of 
anonymity would not disclose those indications but answered 
affirmatively when asked if there were any signs beijing would 
conduct itself differently on human rights 
president bush was widely criticized for sending national 
security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger to beijing in the months after the president 
barred highlevel exchanges to protest chinas violent crackdown on 
prodemocracy protesters in tiananmen square in june 
the second trip a clandestine mission announced only after the 
two arrived in beijing last month was billed as an opportunity for 
the officials to brief the chinese on bushs recent summit meeting 
with soviet president mikhail gorbachev as well as open the door 
to possibly normalizing uschina relations 
we were given some indications of the chinese attitude which 
in addition to the presidents interest in a strategic sense in 
informing the chinese of the discussions at malta seemed to make 
it important that the two make that trip the official said 
vice president dan quayle has predicted that china will take 
actions within six months that will make it clear that bush made 
the right decision in resuming contact with beijing while dropping 
such hints officials have refused to say what china is expected to 
do 
bush said he was cutting off high level contacts and imposing 
economic sanctions after beijing sent tanks to mow down the 
demonstrators leaving a massacre of hundreds 
it was only after the december trip was announced that it was 
revealed scowcroft and eagleburger had also visited china in july 
the month after the bloody repression at tiananmen square 
i dont think simply sitting on the sideline and condemning is 
really the way to deal with the situation that prevailed in 
china the official told reporters 
scowcroft and eagleburger forcefully represented what the 
united states expects of china the official said 
meanwhile bush notified congress that the international 
development association a world bank subsidiary that makes 
lowcost loans to poor nations had not made any new loans to china 
since junes crackdown 
bush filed the report to comply with legislation enacted in 
november that puts restrictions on us payments to the fund

a legislator of the centerleft labor party 
accused prime minister yitzhak shamir on thursday of helping incite 
death threats against liberal legislators who supported a peace 
demonstration in jerusalem 
police commissioner david krauss ordered an investigation of 
police behavior during the demonstration which took place saturday 
in arab east jerusalem 
police fired rubber bullets tear gas and water cannons and 
beat demonstrators with clubs when about 15000 peace activists 
tried to form a human chain around the walled old city 
shamir said parliament members who supported the demonstration 
were traitors labor party legislator avraham burg said 
thursday shamirs comments were partly to blame for death threats 
burg and other liberal legislators received 
in another development thursday shamir said secretary of state 
james a baker iii and the foreign ministers of israel and egypt 
would meet next month in an attempt to revive middle east peace 
efforts the meeting had been expected in january but never was 
scheduled 
as a result of the events in the world and the crisis that we 
had in the government and the fact that the egyptians are not 
prepared it seems as though the meeting will be in february 
shamirs office said in a statement 
baker proposed the meeting as a way of breaking a deadlock 
caused by israels refusal of any contacts with the palestine 
liberation organization 
the death threats against liberal legislators came from the 
sicarites a shadowy group that has claimed responsibility for 
several attacks on arabs and liberal israelis 
there is an exact direct and full connection between verbal 
violence and physical violence burg said on army radio when 
the prime minister is the prosecutor the sicarites are his 
henchmen 
peace activists demanded an independent inquiry to examine what 
they called excessive use of force by police during the 
demonstration 
officials said police charged after demonstrators hurled stones 
and raised outlawed palestinian flags but most reporters said they 
saw no flags or stonethrowing before the police charged 
krauss asked for film and tapes from television crews to be 
examined by a special police unit that will investigate the 
incident the unit includes a state attorney 
about 1000 israelis plan to make another appeal for peace by 
holding what would be an unprecedented meeting with plo chief 
yasser arafat organizers said 
adopting the theme reach out for peace the activists hope 
to urge palestinianisrael negotiations and dramatize opposition to 
a law that bans contacts with the palestine liberation organization 
the daily hadashot newspaper said the planned meeting in egypt 
may be attended by european parliament members and several dovish 
israeli legislators 
sarah osashki of the collective farm of kibbutz ramot menashe 
said the meeting was expected in late january or early february 
neva garbars another activist involved in the organizing said 
egypt had not formally consented to act as host 
in the occupied territories the army said muhammad shehta abu 
shaar 20 died thursday of a rubber bullet wound to the head 
suffered during a clash with soldiers last week in gaza 
shaar is the 642nd palestinian to be killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the 2yearold uprising against israeli occupation 
fortythree israelis have been killed in the violence and 166 
palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs who accused them of 
collaborating with israeli officials

families whose homes were destroyed in 
fierce fighting in bucharest after nicolae ceausescu was overthrown 
will move into spacious apartments built for the late dictators 
associates media said thursday 
the daily adevarul truth which replaced the communist party 
daily after the dec 22 revolution that ousted ceausescu said 110 
of the apartments built along the boulevard of the victory of 
socialism the dictators pet project would be turned over to 
homeless families 
the homes were destroyed in fierce fighting last month around 
the staterun television one of the centers of the revolution and 
other points in bucharest adevarul said 
it said the 110 apartments concerned had been vacant for four 
years pending completion of the palace of the republic that tops 
what adevarul referred to as the pharaonic artery of the 
former boulevard of the victory of socialism 
families are being allotted some of the new apartments but 
officials at the site said actual turnover might be delayed because 
only the facades of many apartment buildings are complete 
ceausescu and his wife elena poured money and labor into their 
pet project to put their stamp on central bucharest and workers 
hurriedly put up the elegant facades 
but the interiors are still largely incomplete apart from a few 
apartments clsoe to the vast palace itself officials told the 
associated press 
the 10story elegantly designed apartment blocks were 
originally built for members of the securitate the communist party 
and government elite who were to work in the palace adevarul said 
six years ago ceausescu ordered thousands of old homes and 
dozens of churches and other historic landmarks destroyed in the 
center of bucharest to make way for the 500foot wide 
threemilelong boulevard and the gigantic still unfinished palace 
at its head 
ceausescu and his wife were tried by a military tribunal and 
executed on christmas day

prosecutors facing a minefield of legal 
challenges to their drug cases against manuel antonio noriega 
combed cia files thursday for secrets that defense lawyers might be 
able to expose at his trial 
whats more there is the potential problem of finding a jury 
for a man publicly branded as a thug by president bush 
earlier this week dexter w lehtinen the us attorney in 
miami and the prosecutor overseeing the case against noriega came 
to washington to join in the review of cia documents that might 
pertain to the case said justice department spokesman david runkel 
it would be our intention to review material which may be 
relevant runkel said of the review which began this week 
in the meantime runkel suggested that financial documents and 
other material seized from noriegas headquarters in panama might 
be used to bring a superseding indictment against the fallen 
dictator 
those documents have already helped investigators trace 
drugtrafficking profits noriega allegedly stashed in european 
banks runkel said 
the review of files at cia headquarters was being conducted by 
justice department lawyers and prosecutors from miami and tampa 
where noriega faces a second set of drug charges runkel said 
the review which would normally occur before an indictment is 
returned is being conducted to determine if there are intelligence 
documents that noriega could obtain for his defense because of the 
extensive dealings he once had with the cia as an informant 
the deposed panamanian ruler is expected to try to force the 
dismissal of the drugtrafficking charges against him by 
threatening to disclose sensitive information about his 
longstanding relationship with the cia 
but attorney general dick thornburgh in an appearance on 
abctvs good morning america thursday indicated the review 
had not turned up anything so far that would hobble the case 
obviously we cant anticipate what general noriega may raise 
by way of defense at trial but suffice it to say at the moment 
that theres nothing thats come to our attention that would 
indicate that this trial cant go forward the attorney general 
said 
runkel stressed that noriega would have to show that any secrets 
he thinks are in the cias possession are relevant to the charges 
that he provided a haven for colombian drug lords and shared in 
their profits 
this is a drug case and i would assume that any documents 
which anyone would seek to introduce have to meet the test of 
relevancy runkel said 
to show relevancy noriega would have to demonstrate that the 
cia was a partner in drug operations and such evidence is just 
not there said one justice department official speaking on the 
condition of anonymity 
besides cia secrets prosecutors face a number of potentially 
serious legal issues that are expected to be raised by noriegas 
defense lawyers 
one is the issue of pretrial publicity that will most certainly 
be raised in light of statements since the us invasion of panama 
made by bush and others in the administration 
before noriega gave himself up bush said that the general 
should be brought to justice for poisoning the children of 
america with illegal drugs and that the vatican in whose embassy 
noriega took refuge had a history of giving asylum to people who 
are fleeing even thugs like noriega 
after noriegas arrest white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
told reporters you can expect the president and all of us to be 
very careful in the days ahead not to offer any comments on the 
case that might prejudice it in any way 
the justice departments runkel who himself once called the 
exruler an international thug has now taken to describing him 
as a defendant of allegations of criminal conduct 
thornburgh noting that pretrial publicity did not prevent 
trials of watergate defendants expressed confidence that 
statements about noriega wouldnt jeopardize the courts ability to 
pick impartial juries 
weve had numerous cases within the past decade or so of 
persons who have recived a great deal of public attention who have 
in fact been the subject of extended congressional hearings that 
set forth all kinds of charges against them thornburgh said 
recalling trials arising from the watergate and irancontra affairs 
louis michael seidman a criminal law professor at the 
georgetown university law center noted that thenpresident nixons 
comments labeling charles manson as a criminal didnt derail the 
cult killers murder trial in los angeles 
the supreme court has never said that adverse pretrial 
publicity is such that it would make a trial impossible in a 
notorious case seidman said the justices have always said it 
is the obligation of the judge to do the things necessary to 
minimize the effect of the publicity 
careful questioning of prospective jurors would accomplish that 
goal seidman said 
if the justice deparment tries to use as evidence material 
seized during the us invasion defense lawyers are expected to 
claim that the warrantless search violated noriegas fourth 
amendment rights 
the justice department says that items found include cocaine and 
financial documents that have allowed investigators to trace as 
much as 10 million noriega allegedly kept in foreign banks the 
assets are being frozen in five european countries 
runkel said prosecutors may use evidence seized in panama to 
bolster the existing case and he wouldnt rule out the option of 
using it to seek a superseding indictment against noriega 
later in the day runkel said 
were on the early end of reviewing documents and no decisions 
have been made in this area its premature to talk about what 
action might or might not be taken in the future 
seidman said he doubted a fourth amendment challenge to the use 
of the evidence would result in the evidence being excluded from 
the case 
in an emergency situation in a fastmoving situation or in 
situations where the primary aim is not law enforcement you dont 
need a warrant and you dont need probable cause to search a 
location seidman said 
i would not be surprised if a court would hold that the 
exclusionary rule does not apply to the armed forces when 
conducting military operations seidman said

the vatican embassy told gen manuel 
antonio noriega it would lift its diplomatic immunity and invite 
panamanian security forces inside to arrest him if he didnt 
voluntarily leave a spokesman said thursday 
rev javier villanueva assistant to the papal nuncio monsignor 
sebastian laboa said noriega was not given a specific deadline 
but if he would not have given himself up the panamanian 
government not the us government would have been invited to 
send in forces to take him out we would have lifted the diplomatic 
immunity villanueva said in a telephone interview 
he said that position was made explicitly clear to noriega who 
surrendered wednesday night to us troops after a 10day stay at 
the embassy that began christmas eve 
meanwhile maj gen marc cisneros the commander of us army 
south confirmed that noriega kept a submachine gun under his bed 
during his entire stay at the nunciature that would have made it 
difficult for unarmed embassy staffers to remove him against his 
will 
vatican and us officials have insisted noriega walked out of 
the embassy wednesday night because he came to the conclusion that 
he had no other option or that it was in his own best interests 
this lifting diplomatic immunity would never be done with 
anyone taking sanctuary for political reasons but this man is a 
highly dangerous criminal said villanueva 
capturing noriega might have been a mixed blessing for the 
panamanians president guillermo endara said that the new 
government had no facilities or judicial system adequate to the 
task of prosecuting and imprisoning the fallen dictator and that 
noriega should go to the united states where he has been charged 
with drug trafficking 
but several top panamanian officials said there was no provision 
in panamanian law for noriega to be extradited so if he had come 
into panamanian hands they might have been legally stuck with him 
vice president ricardo arias calderon had suggested early this 
week that if noriega did not voluntarily give himself up the 
vatican could move its embassy leaving noriega behind 
according to that scenario the vatican would have taken down 
its flag from the pole in front of its compound removed its 
personnel and established a temporary or permanent mission in 
another building 
but villanueva a parish priest at one of panamas most 
important churches who was helping laboa said that course was not 
seriously considered he said the lifting of immunity so noriega 
could be removed was a hypothesis that became logical

general mills inc says it will drop 
its benefit breakfast cereal because of poor sales in the wake of a 
federal inquiry provoked by the companys claim that the cereal 
could help lower cholesterol 
we envisioned that with all the interest in cholesterol a 
product like benefit would appeal to a broad range of consumers 
company spokesman r craig shulstad said wednesday what we found 
was that it appealed to a much narrower range than we had 
expected 
the cereal contains about 8 percent by weight of psyllium a 
soluble fiber that general mills said had been scientifically shown 
to reduce cholesterol 
the company said it was removing benefit from grocery store 
shelves after eight months of disappointing sales in test markets 
it was strictly a business decision based on disappointing 
product performance shulstad said 
general mills marketing strategy and psyllium which separated 
benefit from other cereals promoted for their health benefits led 
to a controversy in the food industry over whether the cereal was a 
drug or a food 
the food and drug administration expressed concern about the 
amount of psyllium people should consume and called for supporting 
scientific data 
general mills brought the downfall of this product on 
themselves by trying to market t with noriega associates

manuel antonio noriega surrendered to us 
authorities only after the vatican embassy in panama city told him 
his safe haven there would expire as of noon thursday a senior 
bush administration official said thursday 
the official briefing reporters at the white house on the 
condition of anonymity said the ultimatum may well have prompted 
noriega to turn himself over to us troops rather than be left to 
deal with a hostile crowd surrounding the embassy 
the papal nuncio had said that his asylum or what have you 
would expire by noon today meaning he noriega would no longer be 
a welcome guest the official said 
he speculated that noriega might have noted the crowd and 
wondered what would have happened to him if the troops stepped 
aside 
as far as i know we had absolutely no role to play in 
organizing that demonstration the official said 
in panama rev javier villanueva assistant to the papal 
nuncio said it was made clear to noriega that if he had not given 
himself up the panamanian government not the us government 
would have been invited to send in forces to take him out 
in miami at noriegas arraignment on drug charges attorney 
frank rubino said that the general had been told wednesday 
protection would be withdrawn from the embassy and that he 
surrendered to avoid further bloodshed 
rubin told the judge at the arraignment that noriega is a 
political prisoner and he refused to enter a plea to the charges 
the judge then entered an innocent plea 
meanwhile noriegas removal from panama was hailed by us 
officials who said it would hasten withdrawal of us troops the 
officials vowed to avoid harsh comments that might sabotage his 
trial on drug charges 
but there was no doubt the administration was enjoying noriegas 
surrender and subsequent trip in custody to florida to stand trial 
defense secretary dick cheney called it the icing on the cake 
for the us military action that began dec 20 
the senior administration official asked about reports that 
vatican staff members were considering evacuating the mission and 
leaving noriega alone at noon said i have no further 
understanding of what would happen at noon today if noriega didnt 
leave 
the official said that members of noriegas family now sheltered 
in the cuban embassy in panama city are expected to be given safe 
passage to the dominican republic 
with noriega facing arraignment in miami and his countrymen 
rejoicing at his departure back in panama city bush dispatched 
colin powell the nations top general to panama to work on troop 
withdrawals 
cheney said on cbstv that powell who is chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff would work with the head of the southern command 
to develop a plan for withdrawing those troops over the next 
several weeks 
several democratic members of congress also called for quick 
withdrawal of the forces that ousted noriega from power 
we need the us military presence not only to become less 
visible but less present said one of them sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee 
at the white house bushs spokesman was choosing his words 
carefully in speaking of the deposed ruler previously dismissed as 
a thug in comments by the president as recently as last weekend 
you can expect the president and all of us to be very careful 
in the days ahead not to offer any comments on the case that might 
prejudice it in any way said press secretary marlin fitzwater 
some 2000 of the 14000 extra troops sent in for the invasion 
have come home however pentagon spokesman pete williams said the 
total number of troops in panama about 26000 has changed 
little because military police and civil affairs specialists have 
replaced some combat units 
a day after he triumphantly announced noriegas surrender on 
nationwide television the president kept out of the public eye 
he was said to have telephoned pope john paul ii to thank him 
for any efforts in persuading noriega to leave the vatican embassy 
in panama city and surrender 
the pope expressed his humanitarian concerns for the people of 
panama president bush assured the pope that gen noriega will be 
treated to all the protections of us law and would receive a fair 
trial fitzwater said 
in other developments 
a us drug enforcement official said noriega might eventually 
be returned to panama for trial on other charges including murder 
returning him to panama remains a possibility for the future 
after his us trial said david westrate assistant administrator 
of the us drug enforcement administration 
pentagon spokesman williams said a noriega bodyguard overheard 
two us servicemen discussing the invasion of panama hours before 
it occurred it was unclear however whether the guard relayed 
that information to noriega williams said 
us prosecutors combed cia files for sensitive materials in 
advance of an expected request by noriega in connection with his 
trial for classified documents dealing with his long relationship 
with the agency 
in recounting noriegas surrender and arrest us officials 
said the ousted military leader was handcuffed read his 
constitutional rights in spanish and examined by us military 
doctors aboard the c130 military transport plane that flew him to 
homestead air force base near miami 
the doctors found noriega in good health fitzwater said 
he faces trial on twoyearold drugtrafficking charges that 
accuse him of accepting a 46 billion bribe from colombian drug 
lords among other offenses noriega could face up to 145 years in 
prison and 11 million in fines if convicted on all counts 
administration officials said that noriegas surrender left four 
panamanians still sheltered in the vatican embassy in panama city 
all noriega loyalists 
fitzwater said that us troops will stay outside the building 
while the four remain 
bush also called canadian prime minister brian mulroney in 
canada thursday to discuss the noriega surrender and to thank 
canada for supporting the united states at the united nations 
which voted 7520 last week to condemn the us invasion

distinctions between domestic and imported cars 
will disappear in this decade a toyota motor corp executive said 
thursday and ford motor co introduced what it said ushered in the 
age of the world car 
during the 1990s engineering design and manufacturing centers 
will move freely around the world focusing in europe asia and 
north america said robert mccurry executive vice president of 
toyota motor sales usa inc the american marketing arm for 
japans largest automaker 
protectionist sentiments will be out of step as trade deficits 
begin to balance out mccurry said during the second day of a 
threeday media preview of the north american international auto 
show in detroit 
a few hours before he spoke ford officials described their 
centers of excellence approach that led to the development of 
the 1991 ford escort the car was developed in association with 
mazda motor corp of japan which provides some of the drivetrain 
and other components for the successor to one of the bestselling 
cars in the 1980s 
its a new way of doing business at ford said company 
executive vice president alex trotman 
the world car along with its sister vehicle mercury tracer 
will be built in wayne mich and hermosillo mexico and ford 
expects to sell about 500000 of them in north america and 950000 
worldwide annually 
sales of escorts have been slipping lately in 1987 and 1988 it 
was the bestselling car in the united states in 1989 it slipped 
to third place behind the honda accord and the ford taurus but 
escort assembly plants were down for part of the year to change 
over for new models 
one of the reasons ford executives hope the car will catch on is 
the impact that it will have on the companys corporate average 
fuel economy ratings or cafe 
the federal government mandates that automakers must maintain a 
fleet fuel economy average of 275 miles per gallon during the 1990 
model year or face fines there has been speculation the minimum 
will rise in coming years 
that gives automakers an impetus to sell small more 
fuelefficient cars but theres a gamble involved since small cars 
dont provide automakers with as much profit on a percar basis as 
larger cars and incentives which have become a part of buying 
cars these days can cut further into the profit margin for each 
car sold 
these products dont provide the normal level of profit 
because of the volumes we have to maintain for cafe said kenneth 
dabrowski program manager for international and small car programs 
ford chairman donald petersen said the new escort couldnt be 
more crucial to fords cafe rating 
its the foundation upon which the whole ford motor company 
cafe is built said ford division general manager tom wagner 
in addition to helping the company with its average fuel economy 
ratings auto analysts said thursday it keeps ford in the 
lowerpriced entrylevel market a market segment that chrysler 
corp largely is leaving when it stops production of its dodge omni 
and plymouth horizon cars next month general motors corp is in 
the segment with its geo line of small cars 
the escorttracer program involves a 2billion ford investment 
the level of mazdas isnt known but analysts speculated that it 
must be in the neighborhood of 1 billion mazda builds its 323 
hatchback off the platform used in the ford and mercury vehicles

blackhawk helicopter you also could vaguely see human forms 
special night lenses on network cameras helped record panamanian

officials who took him aboard the helicopter and eventually to the 
united states to face drug trafficking charges 
it was notsonew technology though the lenses which nbc news 
executive david miller says cost about 30000 each amplify 
existing light and are similar in principle to nightvision devices 
used in vietnam 
they have been routinely used for years network executives say 
we have several of them most of the bureaus have them 
its a standard piece of equipment said robert murphy abc news 
vice president for news coverage 
the lenses were used last year in eastern europe to cover 
demonstrations he said 
after it was learned that noriega fled to the vatican embassy in 
panama city on christmas eve all the networks set up observation 
posts at a holiday inn overlooking the embassy and began a 
dayandnight stakeout

a lawsuit has been filed in federal court 
asking that the name mission and recruiting practices of 
mississippi university for women be changed so more men will enroll 
the lawsuit filed by attorney wil colom on behalf of himself 
keith washington and edward pleasant follows their previous lawsuit 
which was thrown out by a federal judge in november 
the lawsuit claims washington did not apply to muw in 1985 
because of its singlesex mission name and recruiting practices 
and is now at alcorn state university 
pleasant is a senior at the states school for math and science 
a high school on the muw campus in columbus his mother phyllis 
said in the court papers filed tuesday that her son is attracted to 
muw for economic reasons because he would be able to live at home 
but will not apply for admission because of the schools name and 
mission 
following a us supreme court decision muw first admitted men 
in 1982 when 131 enrolled male enrollment then rose for five 
years to 460 in 1987 it fell to 417 in 1988 and to 390 in the 
fall of 1989 the schools total enrollment this year is 2109 
the latest lawsuit names muw president clyda rent the state 
college board and gov ray mabus there was no comment from them 
thursday the school is on holiday break and rents home phone was 
answered by an answering machine the boards director was in a 
meeting the governors office referred questions to the attorney 
generals office where assistant attorney general gail lowery said 
there was no comment because they had not seen the lawsuit 
colom said he believes the federal court can order the 
legislature to create a genderneutral name and mission for the 
columbus school now in its 105th year 
that change would be required if the court finds the present 
mission and name to be unconstitutional thats what we seek in 
this suit he said 
the lawsuit was filed as a class action on behalf of all males 
who failed to apply to or attend the school because of its 
philosophy and admissions requirements 
the lawsuit asks the court to stop the defendants from carrying 
out the singlesex mission to order them to adopt a genderneutral 
name for the school and to order muw to recruit male students on 
the same basis it uses in recruiting females

thousands of people marched past 
parliament on thursday to protest liberal new ethnic policies 
while the ruling communist party and democratic opposition met 
inside to plan bulgarias future 
bta the official news agency said detailed roundtable 
talks between the party and opposition would be held jan 1624 
the protesters most from the southern cities of kardalji and 
haskovo threatened strikes in several cities for friday unless the 
government reversed its decision to restore minority rights to 
ethnic turks 
they waved banners reading bulgaria for bulgarians and 
chanted slogans against a decision announced dec 29 that ended 
such discriminatory practices as requiring ethnic turks to take 
bulgarian names 
leaders of the protest delivered a petition to parliament 
demanding a referendum on ethnic questions 
bta quoted spokesmen for both the communists and opposition as 
rejecting the demand on grounds that the validity of human rights 
in bulgaria cannot be submitted to any referendum 
in ankara foreign ministry spokesman murat sungar said the 
demonstrations were intended to damage turkishbulgarian relations 
ivan angelov a prominent economist speaking for the communists 
said highranking officials he did not identify met thursday to 
discuss ethnic issues the agency reported it gave no details 
angelov and opposition spokesman georgi spassov spoke after the 
communists the opposition and other groups reached agreement on 
future negotiations after two days of negotiations 
the discussions later this month will cover problems of 
national agreement and reconciliation restructuring of the 
political economic and legal systems and drafting a new law for 
free elections according to the report 
an umbrella organization of opposition groups the union of 
democratic forces demanded the right to publish its own daily 
newspaper time on state television and radio and the use of a 
building as headquarters the agency said it said a decision would 
be made before the talks began 
parliament is expected to pave the way for a pluralistic 
political system jan 15 when it votes on removing communist 
partys guarantee of a power monopoly from the constitution 
the dec 29 decision on ethnic rights also gave turkish 
bulgarians the right to choose their own religion and schools 
about 300 ethnic turks fled to turkey last year after the 
restrictions were imposed by todor zhivkov the communist party 
chief whose stalinist regime was deposed in november after 35 years 
in power

a top drug enforcement administration official 
indicated thursday that ousted panamanian dictator manuel antonio 
noriega now in miami to face drugtrafficking charges may be 
returned to panama for trial afterward 
we feel its important to bring people to trial wherever the 
best case exists david westrate assistant dea administrator for 
operations said in an interview returning him to panama remains 
a possibility for the future 
richard arias calderon a vice president of panama said it 
would be imposible for panamanian officials to provide noriega with 
either security or a fair trial now 
he left us without a judicial system calderon said we 
couldnt have guaranteed under the circumstances due process 
he said on the macneillehrer newshour program on public 
television 
but calderon said panamanian officials would definitely seek to 
prosecute noriega in panama if by some impossible occurrance he 
were to go scot free in the united states 
earlier guillermo ford another vice president installed in 
office following the dec 20 invasion of panama by us troops 
said noriega would be returned to panama for trial on a long list 
of charges after his us trial ends 
no revenge due process he said on abcs nightline 
wednesday night several hours after noriega emerged from the 
vatican embassy in panama city where he had been holed up since 
christmas eve and gave himself up to us forces 
officials of panamas new government have said they plan to 
charge noriega with murder in the deaths of officers who led a 
failed oct 3 coup and were allegedly slain after their capture 
dea officials formally arrested noriega at howard air base west 
of panama city and accompanied him to miami along with us 
marshals and us military 
in his interview westrate discussed the impact noriegas 
incarceration on the drug trade 
the functioning of panama as a safe haven and a point of 
facilitation to the drug trafficking organizations has been 
important and is now eliminated westrate said in fact i 
think panama will emerge as a strong ally in the antidrug fight in 
the weeks ahead 
you have to take this in context with a lot of other things 
going on right now he said 
other recent events include the dec 15 shootout in colombia in 
which alleged medellin cocaine cartel kingpin gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha was killed by security forces the dec 10 extradition from 
bolivia of luis arce gomez dubbed bolivias minister of 
cocaine to the united states for trial in florida on charges of 
conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine and colombias 
extradition to the united states of 11 people wanted on drug 
charges here 
the capture of noriega has had a major impact on those fighting 
the drug war he said 
this is an important confidence builder the type of thing 
that renews everybodys commitment agents prosecutors people 
working in the prevention areas we know we can get this job done 
he acknowledged that us law enforcement officials including 
dea administrator john c lawn had praised noriega as recently as 
a few years ago for his help in antidrug efforts 
weve done a lot of positive business there with the 
panamanian defense forces over the years in individual cases 
westrate said but in recent years its quite clear that panama 
has been utilized by these trafficking organizations to their 
benefit 
now in addition to good work in the past we will be able to 
do even more with the officials in that country specifically in 
curtailing moneylaundering and eliminating panama as a stopping 
off point for traffickers he said 
the dea which closed its panama office when the us embassy 
was shut down last may expects to reestablish a presence there 
soon with a few agents he said

the communist party chairman 
assailed on thursday remarks by new president vaclav havel that 
indicated czechoslovakia might apologize for expelling its 3 
million german minority after world war ii 
i declare with the utmost resolution that the communist party 
of czechoslovakia and i personally do not agree with apologies to 
sudeten germans for their resettlement from czechoslovakia 
chairman ladislav adamec said in a frontpage article in his 
partys rude pravo daily 
it marked the first public rift between havel and adamec since a 
peaceful revolution in november stripped the communists of their 
monopoly on power and forced creation of a coalition with former 
dissidents until free elections this year 
sources in the civic forum the opposition group that backed 
havel for president acknowledged that popular reaction to havels 
suggestion was unequivocally negative 
czechoslovaks traditionally have been wary of german 
expansionism and retain strong memories of nazi atrocities and 
occupation during world war ii 
havel himself underlined the importance of the german question 
here by making east and west germany his first state visit 
that visit was meant to stress the need for a new era in 
relations with both germanys 
but when civic forum spokesman martin palous was asked thursday 
about the prospect of an apology to the germans he replied 
as far as we are informed the czechoslovak government is not 
contemplating anything of the sort 
rude pravo quoted havel as saying on television before christmas 
and his dec 29 election that it is our duty to apologize to 
germans who were resettled after world war ii 
it further quoted from what it said was a letter havel wrote to 
president richard von weizsaecker of west germany that referred to 
the expulsion as an immoral act of the utmost depth damaging 
both germans and czechs 
lubos dobrovsky another civic forum spokesman commented it 
is not in agreement with the spirit of european politics to 
resettle an entire minority the way the third reich acted against 
czechoslovakia and other nations is even less in agreement with 
such policy 
the point is to realize our duty to make sure that such evil 
is not repeated

delta air lines said thursday it is stepping up 
security and giving passengers the option of canceling their 
reservations after receiving a general threat against its 
transatlantic flights 
delta spokesman jim lundy said the threat did not name a 
particular flight city or day he would not say when the threat 
was received or give other details 
lundy said passengers were being notified of the threat upon 
checkin and were given the option of canceling or delaying their 
trips deltas transatlantic operations include flights to and 
from germany ireland england and france 
at this point we have no information that it is anything but 
a hoax lundy said weve got to take it seriously we do take 
it seriously 
lundy said federal authorities had been notified but a 
spokeswoman for the federal aviation administration arlene salac 
said the agency was not involved 
the intensified security will remain in effect until officials 
are sure the threat has ended or have confirmed it as a hoax lundy 
said 
delta officials said early thursday evening that only 20 to 30 
of about 700 ticket holders on its four international flights 
scheduled out of atlanta during the night had switched airlines 
patrick walsh and his wife of belfast northern ireland said 
they switched from delta to swissair after hearing about the 
threat the switch means they will arrive in dublin six hours later 
than planned 
you have two options about it so you take the one youre more 
comfortable with mrs walsh said if wed known about it 
sooner wed have stayed in miami a little longer 
birgit sekulin of munich west germany said her family of four 
switched to lufthansa german airlines but the move made her feel 
only slightly better 
first of all we are a family we dont like to fly all four 
of us on the same plane if there are things like this she said 
roger white of chicago however said he was not changing his 
flight plans the bomb threat didnt mean a thing about choosing 
an airline he said

received a bomb threat after passengers were told they could 
cancel the dc10 which holds 284 passengers made a safe flight 
saturday carrying 22 passengers and 14 crew members

fallen panamanian dictator manuel noriega told a 
federal judge thursday that he is a political prisoner and refused 
to enter a plea to charges he took 46 million to turn his nation 
into a way station for the cocaine trade 
general noriega refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of this 
court because he is a political prisoner brought to this 
country illegally noriega attorney frank rubino told us 
district judge william hoeveler 
the judge then entered an innocent plea for noriega 
rubino said during the halfhour hearing that the general had 
been told wednesday that protection would be withdrawn as crowds 
surrounded the vatican embassy in panama city he said noriega 
surrendered to avoid further bloodshed however the archbishop of 
panama said the surrender followed noriegas realization he had 
lost all support 
in washington a senior bush administration official said the 
vatican embassy had been planning to order noriega to leave at noon 
on thursday had he not surrendered to us authorities that 
previously undisclosed ultimatum may have been the final straw that 
prompted the surrender the official said 
noriega was dressed in olivegreen trousers and a khaki uniform 
shirt with a generals four stars on the epaulets he walked into 
the courtroom without handcuffs or shackles when questioned by the 
judge he stood with a military bearing hands clasped tightly 
behind him 
he answered softly in spanish and stared at the judge showing 
no emotion noriega listened to a translation of the judges 
questions through head phones which he removed when he answered 
us marshals stood against the doors of the courtroom which 
was filled with reporters 
the defense said the case could take nine months to prepare and 
six months to try us attorney dexter lehtinen said he thought 
the trial would take only two months 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombian drug cartels to aid and protect their smuggling and 
processing charges that carry 145 years in prison and 11 
million in fines 
a bond hearing was waived until it is requested by the defense 
noriega who gave his age as 51 although some records indicate he 
may be older will be held without bond he also faces drug charges 
in tampa 
rubino said us marshals have assured that noreiga can be made 
available to defense counsel within a halfhour to an hour noriega 
will first held at an undisclosed location in the miami area said 
rubino 
administration sources said noriega was assured he would not be 
tried under a statute that carries the death penalty for 
drugrelated killings the law was passed in 1988 after his 
indictment and he has not been charged under it 
noriega surrendered wednesday night to us troops outside 
panama citys vatican embassy 10 days after he took refuge there 
and was flown into homestead air force base south of miami under 
cover of night thursday 
us marshals with binoculars scanned the downtown area 
continuously from atop the federal courthouse and patrolled halls 
in plain clothes but otherwise were inconspicuous in what hoeveler 
said was an effort to treat noriega like any other defendant 
exactly a year ago hoeveler ruled the united states has 
jurisdiction rejecting defense claims of immunity for a head of 
state the judge said the state department never recognized 
noriegas political legitimacy 
several experts in international law said noriega has little 
basis for the claims it is not clear if such immunity exists they 
said but if it did noriega probably wouldnt qualify because the 
crimes he allegedly committed were not part of his official duties 
as far as i know the things noriega is accused of doing have 
nothing to do with his being a head of state said alfred rubin 
a professor of international law at the fletcher school of law and 
diplomacy at tufts university 
noriega cocounsel steven kollin has noted other potential legal 
pitfalls in the case including extreme pretrial publicity and 
noriegas links with us intelligence agencies but us attorney 
general dick thornburgh said he was confident the case was solid 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush and 
other white house officials would be careful about what they say 
lest they prejudice the trial 
justice department spokesman david runkel said that noriega was 
not formally placed under arrest until the c130 he was aboard was 
taking off from panama runkel said us officials decided to make 
the arrest in american territory 
noriegas surrender was met with joyous celebrations in the 
streets of panama city and miami that continued thursday 
the general who had ruled for six years thumbed his nose at 
two us presidents and annulled an election he apparently was 
losing gave up still wearing his military uniform after 
realizing even his supporters had turned against him the 
archbishop of panama marcos mcgrath said thursday 
the people feel a sense of peace knowing that the monster is 
leaving our land said panamanian president guillermo endara 
frequently a target of noriegas thugs 
the indictment against noriega names 15 other people including 
the reputed head of the medellin cocaine cartel pablo escobar 
gaviria who is being hunted by colombian authorities 
one of noriegas righthand men lt col luis del cid 
surrendered to us troops after the dec 20 invasion of panama and 
has pleaded innocent prosecutors have refused to say if he will 
testify against his former boss 
us troops who seized noriegas military headquarters in panama 
city reportedly found documents and files supporting the 
prosecution case 
that along with the arrests of del cid and others has made the 
case stronger said richard gregorie who headed the investigation 
until he left the us attorneys office a year ago 
president bush on thursday sent gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff to plan the withdrawal of us combat 
troops some 25000 remain in panama 
panamanian exiles here celebrated noriegas fall illustrated by 
a plane flying above the courthouse towing a banner that said bye 
bye tony 
for all panamanians this is one of the final chapters said 
aurelio barria head of the noriega opposition until he was forced 
into exile in 1988 but he still has to answer for what he did in 
panama 
gen maxwell thurman commanding general of us forces in 
panama said noriegas surrender completes the fourth of our four 
objectives in invading panama in operation just cause the 
others he said were to protect american lives safeguard the 
panama canal treaties and restore democracy to panama 
according to authorities about 290 panamanian soldiers 300 
civilians 23 us troops and three american civilians died in the 
invasion 
fitzwater said bush was gratified this operation was completed 
in such a successful fashion 
bush had called pope john paul ii to thank him for the 
distinguished efforts of the vatican and the papal nuncio in 
panama in getting noriega to surrender

that and the constant calls he made for the lower class to 
rally against the usoriented oligarchy were enough to create 
stiff resistance that flashed into the fear if for a few days 
that the united states had stepped into a guerrilla war 
but in the end he was alone separated from his lover and from 
his wife and three of his daughters who sought refuge inside the 
cuban embassy many of his cronies and friends were scattered in 
embassies throughout the capital 
there was no reservoir of faith or affection the kind that 
allowed cardinal josef mindszenty of hungary to resist communist 
rule and stomach 15 years in a us embassy he could feel none of 
the loyalty that chinese dissident fang lizhi commands in the us 
embassy in beijing an exile that has lasted seven months so far 
the last day of noriegas stay inside the mission was perhaps 
the loneliest as 20000 people filled the streets and shouted 
assassin no more and out of the nunciature 
they hanged his effigy clad in military garb noriegas face 
was made out of a pineapple a reminder of the acne scars that gave 
him the nickname pineapple face often during his 10 days in 
the embassy angry panamanians smashed pineapples to yellow pulp in 
the street 
if he had any supporters they were silent 
he saw himself as something of an emperor in this part of the 
world and i think that dream has been shattered said archbishop 
marcos mcgrath on abcs nightline 
shrouded by palm trees the gates of the vatican embassy opened 
and closed wednesday the papal nuncio in his long white robe a 
crucifix dangling from his neck came in and out talking to us 
army officials 
panamanian sources said one of noriegas last conversations was 
with his longtime mistress vickie amado the us southern command 
had tried to convince her to lure noriega out 
but she didnt the sources said that during a 10minute 
conversation she told him the decision is in your hands 
gen maxwell thurman head of the southern command agreed 
people have to make up their own minds 
the man who survived two coup attempts and humiliated the united 
states eventually made his decision under pressure 
villanueva said the vatican told noriega it was preparing to 
lift its own diplomatic immunity to allow panamanian security 
forces to enter the embassy and capture a highly dangerous 
criminal 
despite the submachine gun he had brought into the embassy and 
despite his image as a man who would rather die than surrender 
noriega decided not to go down shooting 
he made few demands phone calls that his surrender be kept 
secret until it was time to wear his uniform one last time 
thurman said noriegas coffeecolored uniform was brought to him 
because he didnt have it with him 
he reportedly talked to his wife felicidad who was in the 
cuban embassy sources in the dominican republic said she and the 
couples three daughters would join a fourth daughter married to a 
military officer in santo domingo 
in washington officials said noriega was assured he would not 
face the death penalty 
just before he left he got a hug from lt col nivaldo 
madrinan who was himself to surrender thursday noriega bid 
farewell to the former head of his secret police just inside the 
missions big wooden door 
madrinan came to attention and saluted militarily said

with the dictator gone and the wild 
celebrations over panamanians on thursday tried to start 
rebuilding their country battered by more than 2 billion in 
damage from the us invasion and burdened by six years of despotic 
rule 
still the joy here seemed boundless 
we are too happy said reynaldo de gracia a night watchman 
who witnessed the revelry in the capital wednesday night after word 
spread that gen manuel antonio noriega had surrendered to us 
troops 
noriegas transfer to florida to face federal drug trafficking 
charges ended a brutal reign that had intimidated this nation of 
22 million people since 1983 
down to the small kids everybody knew he is a criminal 
said truck driver crispiniano avila we dont want to see him 
ever again not even in a painting 
avila was part of the wild singing drinking chanting kissing 
hornblowing and potbanging that took over the streets until the 
wee hours thursday the scene recalled nothing so much as the 
munchkins ecstasy at the death of the wicked witch in the wizard 
of oz 
the guy was a danger and a burden to the country he had the 
whole nation knotted up wasting away said de gracia 
panamanians are still trying to figure out just how much harm 
noriega caused 
the economy hobbled by american sanctions designed to get rid 
of noriega suffered another blow from the widespread looting and 
vandalism during the american dec 20 invasion 
economiss are trying to total the damage but estimates run to 
more than 2 billion in an economy that shrank by 18 percent last 
year 
in recent years millions of dollars were sent out of the 
country for safekeeping as panamas banking system began to crack 
panamanian funds were frozen in the united states and government 
income such as panama canal fees have been held in escrow 
guillermo ford who is planning minister as well as second vice 
president said his agency hopes to quantify damage to the economy 
in the next few days 
if noriega was unaware of his unpopularity the misconception 
could not have survived wednesday afternoon the deposed leader sat 
isolated in a small room at the vatican mission where he was holed 
up for 10 days fleeing thousands of us troops who invaded the 
country dec 20 
the walls of his room could muffle but not block out the 
thunderous chant of 20000 people outside clamoring for his head 
cruzada civilista the coalition that ran opposition candidates 
during noriegas time including guillermo endara panamas new 
president called the demonstration and then tried to cancel it 
because of security concerns but the people showed up anyway 
to let noriega know how their felt about him 
he was cornered said roman catholic archbishop marcos 
mcgrath 
he also was unwelcome 
the vatican embassy had told noriega it would lift its 
diplomatic immunity and ask panamanian security forces to come into 
the mission to arrest him if he did not leave voluntarily a 
spokesman said thursday 
rev javier villanueva assistant to papal nuncio monsignor 
sebastian laboa said noriega was not given a deadline but the 
position was made clear to him 
he said the vatican would not have lifted diplomatic immunity on 
anyone taking sanctuary for political resasons 
but this man is a highly dangerous criminal he said 
maj gen marc cisneros commander of the us army south 
confirmed that noriega kept a submachine gun under his bed during 
his stay at the nunciature which would have made it difficult for 
the unarmed staff at the vatican mission to evict him 
gen maxwell thurman head of the us southern command said 
thursday that the demonstration was a key factor in noriegas 
decision to turn himself in 
also thursday lt col nivaldo madrinan a top noriega adviser 
and head of his secret police walked out of the embassy and 
surrendered to us troops 
in managua nicaraguan president daniel ortega said thusday the 
us troops should leave panama at once because they achieved their 
goal of capturing noriega so there isnt a single reason for 
the yankees to remain in panama not one more moment 
in the meantime the cleanup continues 
us army engineers are bulldozing blocks of the the poor el 
chorrillo district which was heavily damaged and in some cases 
leveled 
thousands of people displaced by the fighting went to a camp in 
a baseball stadium but most have relocated with relatives 
many of the slums destroyed were barracks built to house panama 
canal laborers at the turn of the century and were never meant to 
last more than a dozen years 
american delegations are arriving here to examine among other 
things what the united states can or should do to help but nobody 
is discussing specific numbers yet 
money is dribbling back in about 70 million in frozen funds 
has been thawed but about 300 million more remains blocked in 
accounts frozen by economic sanctions imposed nearly two years ago 
millions of dollars of noriegas money also has been taken over 
and given to the government 
but insurance companies said they will not honor claims for 
losses because of a war clause in the policies 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger said in panama 
wednesday the united states feels no responsibility to businesses 
that were looted and therefore is not obligated to make good on 
the losses

elie wiesel remembered fellow nobel peace 
laureate andrei sakharov on thursday as the godfather of 
perestroika and glasnost at a memorial service for the soviet 
dissident 
it is possible for one person to say no to evil and in doing 
so render it vulnerable said wiesel he taught his 
contemporaries that every human being is unique 
wiesel the american writer and death camp survivor who won the 
1986 nobel for his human rights campaign emphasizing the nazi 
holocaust was among the speakers thursday at the new york public 
library service 
sakharov a human rights activist and a physicist who created

he won the nobel in 1975 but the soviet leadership at the time 
refused to let him go to norway to accept it he was banished in 
1980 to what wiesel termed prolonged horrifying ugly internal 
exile after calling for the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
afghanistan president mikhail s gorbachev allowed him freedom of 
movement in december 1986 
robert l bernstein chairman of the us helsinki watch who 
published much of sakharovs writings said he was sad that 
sakharov did not live to see the publication of his latest book 
which is scheduled for next spring 
his was the strongest voice in the world for individual 
rights said bernstein 
in a short time he was really able to change things around 
said alexey semyonov son of elena bonner the dissidents wife 
in 1981 bonner and sakharovs wife went on a hunger strike to 
convince soviet authorities to allow semyonovs wife to emigrate to 
the united states 
he has changed it seems the way people in the soviet union 
look at things what is important and how it can be achieved 
semyonov said 
the service was organized by the international league for human 
rights a private group that works to end torture disappearances 
religious intolerance censorship and other human rights abuses 
sakharov became honorary president of the groups moscow affiliate 
in 1970

the soviet union has shifted its military 
doctrine from an offensive posture to a strictly defensive one a 
highranking soviet military planner said thursday 
the definition of soviet military doctrine now includes 
prevention of war and civil defense lt gen herman starodubov 
said thursday at the opening session of a twoday arms control 
symposium sponsored by texas aampm universitys mosher institute for 
defense studies 
the conference arms control problems and prospects 1990 
has brought together negotiators and policymakers involved in top 
arms control negotiations 
we are consciously putting ourselves at a disadvantage by 
being defensive and turning over the military initiative to any 
adversary said starodubov deputy operations director for the 
soviet general staff 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has previously heralded a 
shift to a defensive posture by proposing deep cuts in conventional 
and nuclear arms in may 1987 the sovietled warsaw pact announced 
a new military doctrine of reasonable sufficiency which 
stipulates that a country needs only enough military might to repel 
an assailant 
american and western european officials however questioned 
whether any army could be used strictly as a defensive tool 
nuclear weapons in europe may be needed to ensure coexistence they 
said 
gen edward meyer former us army chief of staff and moderator 
of the conference said the challenge before the military on both 
sides is to define doctrines and strategy 
the opportunity is now on the militarys side to make a 
difference there will be great political and economic pressure to 
make those changes he said 
while starodubov called for a nuclearfree democratic 
world jean felixpaganon the diplomatic adviser to the french 
minister of defense stressed french security would continue to 
depend on nuclear weapons 
nuclear weapons are not weapons of war felixpaganon said

a new air force one jet will be delivered to 
president bush sept 30 almost two years late largely because of 
efforts to make it resistant to a nuclear explosion boeing said 
thursday 
boeing which has been building two modified 747 jumbo jets for 
the presidents use originally promised a new air force one would 
be ready in november 1988 or in time to take former president 
reagan home to california when his term ended 
boeing military airplanes spokeswoman carolyn russell in 
wichita kan said the original delivery was revised to november 
1989 as design modifications slowed the production schedule 
a second backup air force one plane is expected to be delivered 
from the wichita plant by early 1991 boeing said 
progress on the planes was burdened by boeing efforts to equip 
the plane with wiring that could withstand a nuclear blast the 
company said 
when about 70 percent of the planes wiring was complete boeing 
engineers foresaw that the rest of the wiring wouldnt fit and 
about 20 percent had to be removed and replaced russell said 
the air force told congress in 1988 that the planes cost had 
soared to 385 million over budget russell would not confirm that 
estimate or comment on the planes final cost 
boeing signed a fixedcost contract with the us air force to 
deliver both planes for 250 million that price was later revised 
to about 266 million the news tribune of tacoma wash reported

first lady barbara bush on thursday underwent 
the second of 10 radiation treatments for eye irritation caused by 
her immune system disease 
the 64yearold first lady received the 10minute radiation dose 
early in the morning at walter reed army medical center she 
suffered no aftereffects and returned to the white house for her 
normal daily activities said her press secretary anna perez 
that included an afternoon tea for people involved with a 
washington home for the infirm with which mrs bush has long been 
associated 
she is undergoing 10 consecutive days of radiation treatments in 
hopes of eliminating swelling behind her eyes that has caused her 
double vision and tearing for months 
the eye problem results from graves disease a condition in 
which the thyroid gland becomes overactive an earlier radioactive 
treatment and drugs rendered the thyroid inactive 
treatment with a powerful steroid prednisone has failed to 
correct the eye disorder however so doctors are using 
lowintensity radiation aimed at swelling in the small muscles 
that control the eyes as the next therapy 
aides say the first lady is otherwise perky and has not had to 
curtail her activities because of the disease which was initially 
diagnosed last winter

last at least a year

against the marcos clan 
president corazon aquinos government has claimed that marcos 
plundered up to 10 billion in government funds during his 20year 
reign manila authorities allege hundreds of millions of dollars in

the swiss government froze assets held by marcos and his 
associates in march 1986 shortly after he was ousted pending 
complex procedings in zurich and two other cantons geneva and 
fribourg 
about 45 million of alleged marcos funds are frozen in fribourg

a man whose cries for help over his car phone led 
police to where he and his pregnant wife had been shot threw 
himself to his death off a boston harbor bridge thursday after he 
became a suspect in her slaying 
basically its fair to say he could not handle the 
allegations or statements made about him suffolk county 
prosecutor newman flanagan said describing a suicide note found in 
charles stuarts car at the bridge 
stuart was implicated by his brother who went to police 
wednesday because stuart apparently was identifying an innocent man 
as his assailant the brothers attorney said thursday 
flanagan said he ordered police to arrest stuart in his wifes 
killing but police could not find him and no arrest warrant had 
been issued 
stuart 29 had told police that he and his wife carol who was 
seven months pregnant were shot by a robber who commandeered their 
car after they left a childbirth class at a hospital oct 23 their 
son was delivered by caesarean section but died 17 days later 
flanagan said stuarts account is not true he said the case 
was still active and other people were being questioned but he 
gave no details 
officials said stuart apparently knew he was a suspect police 
in his hometown of reading a boston suburb had watched his home 
overnight but he did not go there and police didnt find him 
before he jumped off the 300foot tobin bridge over the boston 
harbor his death was ruled a drowning 
at a news conference thursday flanagan confirmed that his 
office was contacted wednesday by a lawyer for one of stuarts two 
brothers police spoke with the brother and then obtained 
statements from other relatives and friends 
flanagan said the new evidence included mrs stuarts engagement 
ring 
after careful review of this new evidence i instructed boston 
police homicide detectives to arrest charles stuart for the 
murder he said 
attorney john perenyi said stuarts brother matthew 23 came 
to him early in december with his suspicions 
according to perenyi matthew stuart said that on the night of 
the shooting his brother asked him to meet him near the hospital 
and that he would pass a bag to him through the car window matthew 
stuart said he took the bag which contained a snubnosed revolver 
asked if matthew stuart saw mrs stuart perenyi said thats 
a very difficult question because matthew did not expect to see 
her and did not see her but he thought he saw something in the 
front seat of his brothers car 
perenyi said it would seem to have been inevitable that chuck 
had to have been shot at that time 
a search of the pines river in stuarts parents hometown of 
revere on thursday turned up the bag which included a gucci bag 
wallet makeup and other of mrs stuarts personal belongings the 
gun which matthew stuart said was disposed of separately is 
missing 
matthew stuart was really at a loss to give me a motive 
perenyi said in a telephone interview he didnt think his 
brother was into gambling drinking or other women 
in recent weeks police had several times discounted rumors that 
stuart could have been involved 
i would say the whole town is shocked they were portrayed as 
a model couple said wally arsenault a restaurant manager in 
reading 
john vajdic who lives across the street from the stuarts 
slateblue home said at this point i still dont know what to 
believe i still wonder what is the truth 
the shootings of the prosperous suburban couple he a fur store 
manager and salesman she a 30yearold lawyer in an innercity 
neighborhood drew cries of outrage about city violence from around 
the country as well as charges from blacks and others that the 
outrage was spurred in part by racism 
stuarts dramatic call to police on a car phone after the 
shootings was widely broadcast it took police about 10 minutes to 
figure out where he was from clues such as the sound of sirens 
over stuarts car telephone 
stuart had been shot in the abdomen his wife in the head 
at one point dispatcher gary mclaughlin said ok chuck 
helps going to be on the way bear with me is your wife 
breathing 
shes still gurgling stuart cried theres a busy street 
up ahead ahh man i cant see where i am 
mclaughlin patiently tried to coax stuart into identifying some 
building or street near his car and at another point said you 
cant blank out on me i need you man chuck chuck 
oh man it hurts and my wife has stopped gurgling shes 
stopped breathing stuart replied 
stuart wrote a statement for his wifes funeral in which he 
said for us to truly believe we must know that gods will was 
done and that there was some right in this meanest of acts in our 
souls we must forgive this sinner because he would too the 
couple had been married four years 
among those at the funeral were gov michael dukakis and mayor 
raymond flynn 
shortly before christmas stuart viewed a lineup while 
officials refused to say whether an identification was made news 
reports said stuart had indicated that william bennett a man with 
a long police record could be the assailant 
on thursday prosecutors publicly cleared bennett 
perenyi said matthew stuart came to him after the lineup 
what he told me when the brother identified mr bennett as 
the assailant that sort of pushed matthew over the brink 
perenyi said 
a man answering the telephone at the suburban home of michael 
stuart stuarts other brother said the family had no comment 
mrs stuarts father giusto dimaiti was taken to a hospital 
thursday morning with an undisclosed ailment but was released after 
an examination 
in the hours after the first news reports of thursdays 
developments some still refused to believe stuart could have had 
anything to do with the shootings 
one neighbor wailed that if stuart had indeed killed himself 
he just wanted to be with his dead wife and child

far eastern manufacturers have been dumping 
certain machine tools small business telephone systems and door 
locks in us markets the commerce department said thursday 
dumping is the sale of products at less than what the 
department determines is fair value it can lead to imposition 
of duties to offset the dumping margin the amount by which the 
price of the product fails to meet the fair value test if the 
international trade commission finds that the affected us 
industry is being hurt by the practice 
the commission now has 45 days to decide that issue 
the determinations thursday were for 
automatic metalforming machine tools with multiple die 
stations known as mechanical transfer presses from japan some 
109 million were sold in the united states in 1988 the department 
said dumping margins ranged from 749 percent to 1516 percent 
the ruling was in response to a petition filed in behalf of the 
us industry by the verson division of allied products corp the 
united auto workers and the united steel workers of america 
small business telephone systems and subassemblies from south 
korea of which 227 million worth were imported in 1988 dumping 
margins ranged from 134 percent to 1585 percent 
the ruling was sought by two competing us manufacturers 
american telephone amp telegraph co and comdial corp 
house door locks and parts from taiwan of which the united 
states imported 495 million worth from taiwan in 1988 the 
department said dumping margins were 127 percent to 1775 percent

a soviet spokesman on thursday likened to lynch 
law the expected us trial of gen manuel antonio noriega and 
said that even a conviction would not justify the us invasion of 
panama 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the trial 
will involve a violation of the rights of the government of 
panama a violation of the principles of nonintervention of the 
charter of the united nations 
no state has the right to take the law into its own hands 
he told reporters thats basically lynch law 
panamanian dictator noriega surrendered to us authorities in 
panama city on wednesday and was flown to miami where he faces 
drugtrafficking charges 
gerasimov questioned whether an american court had the right to 
try noriega and said the united states violated international law 
by invading panama last month and now removing noriega for trial 
from the outside gerasimov said noriegas capture looked 
like government vengeance against a former cia agent who got away 
he said it appeared that the real issue at stake in the american 
intervention was trying to hold onto the panama canal which is due 
to revert to panamanian control in the year 2000 
he added that even if noriega is found guilty of drug 
trafficking armed intervention is still not how things should be 
done thats not how the struggle with drug business should be 
waged

ethiopian rebels kept up an offensive that 
has seen their greatest gains in a 14year insurgency and claimed 
on thursday that they put out of action 1536 soldiers in 
recent fighting 
the rebels also said they shot down a mig23 fighter jet and 
damaged a helicopter during a government air raid that inflicted 
heavy casualties on debre tabor a garrison town in gonder province 
recently captured by the tigre peoples liberation army 
the rebels fighting in conjunction with the much smaller 
ethiopian peoples democratic movement said the government 
suffered the losses saturday in a threepronged guerrilla attack to 
the southwest west and northwest of debre tabor 
in a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in nairobi the tigre 
rebels reported 1465 troopers killed or wounded and 71 captured 
they also claimed to have captured weapons and destroyed two tanks 
and seven vehicles 
the broadcast did not mention rebel or civilian casualties 
reporters are denied access to the region and it is impossible 
to verify the reports independently 
the rebels said earlier that they killed captured or wounded 
more than 8000 soldiers in capturing debre tabor and three other 
towns including one 70 miles from the capital addis ababa 
the rebels since august have made their greatest gains since 
taking up arms in 1975 in an uprising seeking the ouster of marxist 
president mengistu haile mariam and greater autonomy for their 
province 
they now control tigre and have made significant advances into 
wollo gonder and shoa provinces to the south and the west 
the government faces an even older insurgency in the 
northernmost province of eritrea where rebels have been fighting a 
secessionist war for 28 years

a study showing that global warming could speed 
the destruction of forests by fire and windstorms suggests 
noticeable change could occur in the earths forests by early in 
the next century a researcher said 
the rate of change will be faster than we thought before 
said jonathan overpeck the studys principal author 
the change will be marked by the appearance of fastgrowing 
species of trees in areas where mature trees have been destroyed 
said overpeck a staff scientist at the lamontdoherty geological 
observatory in palisades 
previous computer projections have shown that changes in 
temperature and rainfall could affect the growth of forests this 
is the first to show that physical destruction of trees will play a 
significant role in changing forests as the earth warms overpeck

the samaritans known 
mainly for jesus parable of the good samaritan use a hebrew 
saying to describe their lives in the midst of the palestinian 
uprising against israeli rule 
they say its like being caught between a hammer and an 
anvil americans would call it trapped between a rock and a hard 
place 
in any language it means uncomfortable 
about 275 samaritans whose daytoday language is arabic live 
on mount gerizim or in nearby nablus a moslem arab town of 120000 
which has been a focal point of antiisraeli unrest in the uprising 
an equal number of samaritans speak hebrew and live in holon a 
jewish city of 144000 just south of tel aviv 
in nablus there are those who understand what the samaritans 
are and say we always have lived with them and there are those 
who say we are jewish said itamar cohen seated behind the 
counter of his small grocery the only shop on the mountain 
but with all this we are not jews and we are not moslems we 
have our own religion said cohen 52 who also works for the 
israeli government as a guide to the historical sites here 
the samaritan religion is an offshoot of judaism the samaritans 
claim to be descendants of three of the 12 tribes of ancient israel 
and believe that mount gerizim not jerusalem is the place chosen 
by god for the true temple 
although smaritans base their faith on the old testament 
theyre best known for an account in the new testament luke 
103037 of the tale told by jesus to fellow jews about the good 
samaritan 
at that time jews resented samaritans as distorting the faith 
jesus story was about a samaritan who helped an injured jew 
ignored by passing jewish priests the samaritan thus proving 
himself a good neighbor 
samaritan scripture a mixture of ancient hebrew and aramaic 
consists of their version of the first five books of moses the 
samaritans consider moses to be the sole prophet of god while they 
celebrate most of the same holidays as the jews many of their 
rituals are profoundly different including the slaughter of 
sacrificial lambs on mount gerizim during passover 
our goal is to continue our lives until the end of the world 
we believe in the resurrection of the dead cohen said 
but the samaritans say quietly cautiously nervously that 
they are increasingly having trouble assuring their survival as a 
result of the nearly twoyearold palestinian uprising 
several samaritan homes in nablus were burned last fall during 
the jewish and samaritan holiday of sukkot which commemorates the 
desert wandering of the israelites during the exodus nablus 
leaders have condemned the attacks and promised compensation the 
samaritans say 
most nablus samaritans are employed by the west bank military 
government 
zevolon altif 60 a retired high school english teacher said 
about 10 in the transportation and tax offices received telephone 
threats from palestinians ordering them to quit two army cars now 
take them to and from work 
it is not good for them to go in an army car in front of the 
surrounding population at the same time we dont know how to get 
out of this problem they want to leave their work but they cant 
earn their living any other way altif said 
until the uprising began altif and most samaritans from nablus 
lived on mount gerizim for only two months in the summer and during 
the three major religious holidays 
now as a result of the increasing violence and armyimposed 
curfews they are staying on the mountain as much as possible 
because of the uprising few holon samaritans join relatives on 
mount gerizim except for holidays or celebrations although all 
have homes there said israel sedaka 57 of holon who works for 
israels state commemorative coin office in jerusalem 
since the intefadeh uprising we only go when theres no 
choice sedaka said theres a road that you can drive without 
going through the city and placing yourself in danger 
although the samaritans do not consider themselves jews and are 
not considered to be jews by the israeli rabbinate the samaritans 
of holon go to jewish schools and serve in the israeli army 
the samaritans of nablus study in arab schools and do not serve 
in the military some learned hebrew after the 1967 sixday war 
and many now choose between a hebrew or an arabic first name 
depending on the listener 
we were two parts of the same nation because of that some 
people are suspicious altif said

return of the agents body for burial in calexico calif 
thats in a show that also has actors playing tv reporters and

begin appearing in business magazines this spring 
silver said trumps lawyers usually pounce on any attempt to use 
the trump name and we havent lost a case trump said in his 
letter to zito that he decided to join forces with pcl instead of 
fighting it because he examined the photo business cards and liked 
them 
silver said trump has some of the cards with his photo on them 
but wasnt sure if he was using them regularly 
i cant tell you if he hands them out to everyone silver 
said hes never had a business card before so i imagine thats

but some complain that a game based on a war in which more than 
150000 people are reported to have been killed since 1975 is 
offensive 
i wont allow it in my home snapped housewife majwa shami 
i think its sick and will corrupt my children 
tueini maintains theres nothing immoral about his game 
its just very realistic he said if id included drugs 
and stolen cars as sources of income in the game then it would have 
been immoral 
but people dont need to be taught how to be immoral 
everybody knows what happens here 
the games not just about lebanon tueini added it can be 
applied to all third world conflicts like the ones in cambodia el 
salvador and nicaragua 
i used the ingredients from lebanon because weve had 15 
years experience 
the game is set in mabil a country torn by civil war and 
has become a mixture of savage and unscrupulous 
minidictatorships 
but unlike lebanons army fractured like the country itself 
between feuding christians and moslems mabils military is strong 
and united 
the object of the game with two to four players is to collect 
40 military units five more than those run by the army to take 
the reins of government 
the instructions read the best man will be the most 
unscrupulous 
civil war has its own rules which have nothing to do with 
the international conventions with military rules of conduct or 
with what is commonly called human rights 
the instructions note in fact the rules of civil war are 
nothing but the absence of rules 
racketeering taking hostages terrorism blind shelling 
blockades seizure of ports corrupt practices and so on all these 
are an integral part of the civil war 
players throw dice to move their markers around the yellow 
board which is divided into squares orange for events green for 
battles and blue for revenue 
the elementary rule of any civil war is to make money to buy 
weapons tueini said to make money you need revenue 
the squares denoting revenue sources include liquor tobacco 
restaurants casinos electricity and water and hostages the 
most lucrative 
if a player lands on a battle square he can declare war on any 
militia leader provided the aggressor has 15 military units 
players landing on an events square pick up cards outlining a 
situation that will determine whether they win or lose money 
tueini said all the events described have actually taken place 
in lebanon 
i picked the funniest and most unscrupulous scandals without 
naming names he said 
one events card reads the regional power protecting you and 
the country where your hostages come from come to an agreement 
your protector asks you to release the hostages in return you 
receive the equivalent of your throw of dice multiplied by 30 
mabilian pounds 
tueini noted ive even printed a multiplication table for 
younger players who may not know how to multiply 
another events card reads you have just received an 
international donation of flour that you have sold without scruples 
on the local market you win 100 mabilian pounds 
tueini has made 2000 copies of the game in french and english 
and hopes to market it abroad he said its selling quite well

a panel of conservatives grading the 
administrations first year says president bush is ok but hes 
no dan quayle 
a conservative think tank issued that report card giving bush a 
gentlemans c 
the vice president got an a 
that spells success in one of quayles tasks covering the 
conservative political flank for the administration it has been 
handled with differences in tone and emphasis that leave both 
quayle and bush room to insist there is no disagreement on policy 
there cant be it is a fact of vice presidential life that the 
no 2 man doesnt have any policy options of his own 
quayle has said there is no good guybad guy strategy at work 
but on such topics as eastwest relations he tends to emphasize 
the negative while bush deals with the positive that reassures the 
right still suspicious of soviet intent internal reforms 
notwithstanding 
the white house describes that as a difference in perspective 
not in substance quayle underscores his loyalty to the president 
and his policies at every opportunity and dismisses suggestions 
that theyre not always in tune its the ageold game that is 
played in trying to find some distinction between the president and 
vice president quayle said in a new year interview with the 
associated press 
still there are distinctions and they register clearly with 
conservatives that shows in the report card 
the heritage foundation published the freshman year appraisal 
this month in its quarterly magazine policy review grading was 
done by five conservatives who were willing to put their names 
behind their marking system 
given the magazine deadline bushs decision to intervene in 
panama on dec 20 didnt come within their grading period 
conservatives generally applauded him for it 
and they unanimously applauded quayle for his years work 
quayle has proved to be a very effective advocate of 
conservative positions within the administration and as a liaison 
with conservatives on capitol hill said paul weyrich president 
of the free congress foundation 
weyrich rated quayle at aminus suggesting he ought to be more 
independent of the administration to add to his own stature and 
build a viable national political base for himself 
that may sound good to conservative republicans but 
independence in policy or politics is not part of the job 
description that goes with the vice presidency 
bush got a b from weyrich ditto on the card of pat robertson 
the television evangelist who challenged him for the 1988 
presidential nomination robertson chief executive of the 
christian broadcasting network called bush steady competent 
unimaginative and cautious 
he has not told the american people where he wants to go 
robertson said he has not outlined a cogent policy agenda for 
them to support 
robertson said quayle merits an a as a superb vice president 
whether he can rehabilitate himself politically after the 
vicious beating he took from the media last fall remains to be 
seen robertson said i hope he can 
amy moritz executive director of the national center for public 
policy research agreed on the a and on the complaint about quayle 
coverage quayle has done a tremendous job under this pressure 
and its time the american people told the bullies in the media to 
lay off she said 
she saw bush as no better than a cminus saying he has 
delivered neither victories nor vision george bush is not sure 
why he wants to be president she said so he reacts to events 
and compromises between opposing viewpoints 
harsher still was edward h crane president of the cato 
institute who gave bush a d bush is a creature of government 
who does not object to a single federal program or department 
crane contended his continued popularity among conservatives 
is a sad commentary on whats left of the reagan revolution

chief justice william h rehnquist who early 
in his supreme court tenure was kidded for being an ideological 
lone ranger marks his 18th anniversary on the high court 
sunday now the leader of a conservative majority 
the survivor of a bruising 1986 senate battle over his elevation 
to chief justice rehnquist has emerged as the collegial 
orchestrator of a major rightward shift in the courts direction 
the rehnquist court came of age in 1989 said ae dick 
howard a law professor at the university of virginia 
i think hes been an enormously effective chief justice 
added professor dennis hutchinson of the university of chicago 
the court appears to operate more efficiently and harmoniously 
than it has in decades and hes able to utilize the court 
membership in ways he thinks are advantageous 
rehnquist who declined to be interviewed for this article 
turned 65 in october he has said privately he might have retired 
had he not become chief justice and if he found himself 
consistently in the minority on key issues 
but his promotion and thenpresident reagans appointment of 
three conservative justices shelved all talk of retirement 
today even those on the opposite end of the political spectrum 
applaud rehnquist for his affability and brilliance 
justice william j brennan the courts liberal anchor has 
called him a splendid chief justice seasoned court observers 
say they are not surprised that an easy informality has been 
injected into the justices private conferences and personal 
relations 
i think rehnquist has removed any internecine bitterness in 
the court said bruce fein a washington lawyer and longtime 
court watcher 
rehnquists predecessor as chief justice warren e burger 
sometimes ruffled the feathers of his colleagues but flashes of 
selfdeprecating humor and a lowkey style are more the rehnquist 
hallmarks 
the chief justice has been known to lead judges and lawyers in 
song in afterhours sessions at judicial meetings wear a softball 
tshirt to the justices private conferences and tell a joke at his 
own expense he has a wellearned reputation as a practical joker 
but the public face rehnquist shows is not always so convivial 
a lawyer arguing before the court last month in support of a 
constitutional right to die had his concluding remarks 
brusquely cut off in midsentence by the chief justice the 
allotted 60 minutes for arguments had expired 
rehnquists attimes caustic interrogation of lawyers is 
defended by some scholars who say his own high intellectual 
standards make him impatient with sloppy work 
the more cerebral members of the court get upset at 
ineptitude said fein the chief justice has to take the lead 
there and make sure arguments are productive 
rehnquist sometimes can appear ill at ease in public as he did 
at the rancorous public hearings the senate judiciary committee 
held before the full senate confirmed him as chief justice by a 
6533 vote 
opponents challenged rehnquists integrity honesty and 
commitment to equal rights 
five witnesses swore under oath that rehnquist had harassed and 
had intimidated black and hispanic voters as a republican party 
official in phoenix in the early 1960s 
the charges were nothing new they were raised in 1971 when 
thenpresident nixon nominated rehnquist a 47yearold justice 
department lawyer to the high court 
on both occasions rehnquist swore he could not remember taking 
part in any harassment 
rehnquists early years on the court were most notable for 
frequent and often solitary dissents that many feel laid the 
intellectual groundwork for the courts rightward turn of later 
years 
in the mid1970s rehnquists law clerks gave him a lone ranger 
doll to symbolize his status 
rehnquist may have moderated some views since but the more 
likely explanation is that the change in the courts composition 
has placed him closer to its ideological center 
in his first court term as chief justice rehnquist seemed 
outmaneuvered by brennan as court liberals prevailed in key cases 
when voting in the minority the chief justice must turn over to 
the senior justice on the other side the job of writing or 
assigning the courts majority opinion 
when justice anthony m kennedy joined the court in 1988 a 
moreseasoned rehnquist began to place his imprint on the courts 
work 
the chief justice seems to have absorbed a lesson from a 1976 
article he wrote about some of his predecessors 
it may well be that the office of chief justice of the united 
states calls for skills and abilities more readily honed in the 
giveandtake of political life than in the practice and teaching 
of the law rehnquist wrote 
there is little question of rehnquists intellectual capacity to 
lead he graduated first in his class from stanford universitys 
law school in 1952 as a thinker and a writer many place him in 
the first rank of the 16 men to have served the nation as chief 
justice 
rehnquists plans may be uncertain he has hinted privately that 
after several more years he might retire to spend more time with 
his four grandchildren and his hobbies which include playing 
tennis and poker studying history and painting landscapes in 
acrylic

after 10 years of focusing on shuttles 
nasa plans 64 space exploration missions this decade creating a 
data deluge that could swamp an agency already drowning in 
information thats never been studied 
we will acquire in the next three years what its taken 25 
years to get said james green director of the national space 
science data center at goddard space flight center the volume will 
double every two years after that with a virtual information 
explosion in 1996 from the earth observing system 
eos is expected to transmit more data in 30 hours than is 
already stored from 25 years of space travel before eos the next 
three years should see the launch of the cosmic background 
explorer the galileo mission to jupiter the hubble space 
telescope gamma ray observer ulysses mission to the sun the mars 
observer and the topex poseidon oceansensing satellite 
scientists hope eos will yield data to such solve threats to the 
earths survival as global warming and the thinning of the 
protective ozone layer 
the critical question is whether it will be in a form they can 
use 
industry hasnt developed hardware or software to serve the 
demands of disciplines as diverse as anthropology zoology and 
atmospheric physics so it has been up to government scientists to 
pioneer solutions that have put nasa at the cutting edge but still 
short of making computerized data easily usable 
observers say part of the problem lies with nasa itself the 
agency traditionally has been most willing to cut funds for 
archiving data if it ran short of money when launching a space 
mission it is undergoing a change in focus too moving from an 
era of general space exploration to one of information gathering 
and funding for that lags 
in the fiscal 1990 budget the data center received 47 million 
for managing archiving and distributing data up from the 1989 
budget allocation of 32 million by comparison nasas entire 
1990 budget was 125 billion 
green likens the data analysis and management after a space 
launch to the the last puppy that comes to supper if theres 
too many puppies theres not much left but while he agreed his 
area frequently gets short shrift he said funding increases show 
the agency is moving in the right direction 
the thing is you dont put the space probes up there for no 
reason said david dickerson an aide to rep bill nelson 
dfla chairman of the house space science subcommittee the 
distance they travel is not whats important its the information 
they send back theyre going to have to put increasing amount of 
thought and resources to that 
alan robock a university of maryland meteorologist who is 
testing nasa techniques for improving accessibility to data said 
the fault isnt just with the space agency computers and data 
analysis are not nearly as sexy theyre harder to sell to 
congress 
william campbell a nasa artificial intelligence expert is 
developing techniques to build intelligence into the data 
gathering increasingly fast and sensitive instruments can gather 
data faster than anyone can analyze or catalog it campbell said 
its not just the volume its the complexity 
he and other nasa scientists believe they are on the brink of 
developing systems that would put the data in usable form almost 
from the time instruments capture it in space by analyzing it with 
the users needs in mind 
the idea is to build intelligence into the whole system from 
the back end to the user he said this is a whole new way of 
thinking about the problem i contend it is the only hope 
in the five years since green took over the space science data 
center has gone from a tape landfill to concentrating on data 
accessibility but as it struggles toward answers to the pending 
data deluge it is burdened with catching up from years of neglect 
of approximately 80000 magnetic tapes dating to the early 1960s 
that are in a climatecontrolled federal warehouse in suitland 
about half need to be restored said robert mcguire who heads the 
project about 9000 have been restored since the effort began in 
july 1988 
another 30000 to 40000 tapes are at the space science data 
center 
under green the centers goals shifted from storage to 
accessibility and he said it now handles 6000 requests a year up 
from 2000 five years ago using new computer networks to 
universities and research centers electronic mail and the postal 
service data in demand on climate atmosphere and other subjects 
are online in the computer in 15 systems that information is 
stored on magnetic diskettes or highdensity optical disks that 
hold as much as 40 of the sequential magnetic tapes and let the 
user go right to the needed data 
if the technology doesnt exist to manage data beamed back from 
eos the instruments should be monitored only some of the time or 
not launched green said it doesnt do anybody any good if we 
cant manage the data

some of alvin burketts coworkers thought he 
was kidding when he told them the diagnosis even some nurses 
didnt believe him 
burkett a 51yearold computer specialist from bellevue neb 
had breast cancer and in june he had a mastectomy 
as a man youve got to be careful when you tell people youve 
had a mastectomy he said recently they think vasectomy 
only about 900 men a year are diagnosed with breast cancer and 
some 300 die of it annually compared to about 142000 diagnoses 
and 43000 deaths in women 
experts say it is too rare in men to justify widespread 
screening as is urged for women and that few doctors check for it 
while doing physicals 
burkett now 52 had never heard of breast cancer in men when he 
noticed a lump near his right nipple beneath the surrounding 
areola an internist sent him to a surgeon for a biopsy in which a 
piece of tissue is removed for microscopic inspection 
even before the diagnosis burkett had started checking around 
for information about male breast cancer and found little 
available by the time the lab reported the lump was cancerous he 
said i sort of suspected it 
he spent two days in the hospital after a modified mastectomy 
tests at the time and since have shown no evidence of any remaining 
disease 
my doctor says im a very lucky fella burkett said 
in fact the prognosis for men as a group is worse than for 
women experts say one reason is that men tend to be diagnosed in 
later stages because few men or medical personnel are watching for 
it in earlier stages 
in addition because men have so much less breast tissue than 
women it is easier for cancer to spread to adjacent tissue said 
robert crichlow professor and chairman of surgery at 
dartmouthhitchcock medical center in hanover nh 
why is breast cancer so rare in men 
it doesnt appear to be simply that men have so much less breast 
tissue as the risk is not related to breast size in women said 
arthur holleb a retired american cancer society official who has 
studied breast cancer in men 
instead the key seems to be that a mans breast is not the 
target for hormones that a womans breast is the changes hormones 
induce in a womans breast may make cancer more likely than in a 
mans he said 
any lump in a mans breast is reason to consult a doctor 
especially if it is under the nipple said william donegan 
professor of surgery at the medical college of wisconsin in 
milwaukee most breast cancer diagnoses in men are made around ages 
60 to 65 but men in their 20s can develop the disease as well 
donegan noted that many teenage boys get harmless breast lumps 
that tend to disappear in a year or two breast cancer is very rare 
in teenage boys 
doctors treat breast cancer in men just as they do in women 
with surgery and sometimes followup chemotherapy or radiation 
treatment a mastectomy removes the nipple and leaves a scar 
donegan said 
burkett has written to columnist ann landers and offered himself 
for an interview with a local television station about his 
experience 
his goal he said is to spread the word that men can get breast 
cancer too if that makes men examine their breasts and consult a 
doctor early about suspicious lumps he said maybe it will save 
some lives

from aids to organ transplants pope john 
paul ii is keeping closing track of scientific issues to ensure the 
roman catholic churchs moral agenda is promoted in the push for 
progress 
the relationship between science and religion is long and 
stormy but things have come a long way since the church tried the 
17th century astronomer galileo galilei for teaching that the earth 
orbits the sun 
the process of reconciliation has accelerated under john paul 
who often addresses scientific issues and solicits research by 
vaticanappointed scientists on developments of interest to the 
church 
while it is not the churchs specific role to advance 
knowledge of a strictly scientific nature she cannot ignore or 
neglect issues which are closely related to her mission he said 
dec 14 to a group of scientists meeting at the vatican this is 
particularly true when it is a question of defining the rules which 
should regulate human conduct 
these are often issues that raise moral or ethical problems 
such as artificial procreation genetic engineering and nuclear 
war but the vatican has also promoted research into less 
controversial matters including tropical disease leprosy and 
alternative energy 
the pope frequently reminds scientists not to lose sight of the 
moral and ethical implications of their work warning of potential 
risks and abuses 
in its undisputable task of research and service science has 
an intrinsic morality it must respect he said sept 24 at the 
university of pisa without imposing repressive limits on 
research scientists should respect the supreme laws of nature 
and life he said 
that also was the message of a 1987 vatican document condemning 
testtube births surrogate motherhood and experiments on living 
embryos church doctrine on sexual and moral issues also took 
center stage at an international meeting on aids in midnovember 
while the meeting attracted hundreds of scientists church 
officials set the agenda at the vaticansponsored conference 
issues with moral implications are also being taken up by the 
pontifical academy of sciences the academy which dates to 1603 
but took its present form in 1936 has become recognized as one of 
the worlds most prestigious research institutes it has 80 members 
from around the world including 26 nobel prize winners many are 
noncatholics or nonbelievers 
in the early 1980s the pope sent envoys to world capitals to 
present the academys dark conclusions on the possible consequences 
of nuclear war and he embraced the scientists opposition to 
deployment of weapons in space 
in interviews several academy scientists acknowledged that 
dealing with delicate issues can pose difficulties 
its hard to draw the dividing line between scientific issues 
and moral and religious issues said stanley k runcorn who now 
teaches physics at the university of alaska but the academy has 
to maintain its view that it has something to say strictly on the 
scientific aspects of a lot of these problems it has to try and 
avoid getting itself into political and religious controversies 
hermann bruck 84 an astronomer and retired professor at the 
university of edinburgh in scotland noted not all scientists agree 
on such issues as when life begins and ends but at the academy he 
said the fundamental belief is that if you get down to things 
properly in an unbiased way you find there is never a real 
opposition between faith and science because both things are 
concerned with truth about the world 
william w morgan a retired astronomy professor at the 
university of chicago who has been an academy member for more than 
25 years said the institutes work has never been dictated by 
religious priorities 
but he said he has noticed the academy is increasingly examining 
issues with ethical implications and he would not participate in 
meetings he considered too closely linked with morality 
im not damning them but this is not in the realm of what i 
would call science said morgan 83 who now works at the yerkes 
observatory in williams bay wis i am not qualified in such 
matters 
the pope stresses that science and morality are intertwined 
scientific research and moral reflection must proceed side by 
side in a spirit of mutual help we must never lose sight of the 
supreme dignity of the human person whose wellbeing research and 
reflection are called to serve

a zinc selenide laser that produces a 
blue beam and can be focused more tightly than other lasers could 
eventually triple the amount of information stored on optical 
computer disks its developer says 
japanese researchers in march developed a zinc selenide laser 
but it had to be cooled to 135 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
according to the university of florida which announced a more 
practical roomtemperature laser 
zinc selenide produces a blue beam that can focus on a spot 
onethird the size of that produced by current materials packing 
information more densely on optical disks increasing capacity 
optical storage has been slow to be adopted in computers because it 
is not as economical as magnetic storage 
but optical disks have some marked advantages primarily in 
volume the next computer developed by apple founder steven jobs is 
the first desktop model to use an optical disk as a primary storage 
device 
peter zory a university of florida electrical engineer who led 
the development of the zinc selenide laser said that before it 
makes its way into use for information storage it will be 
necessary to develop a blue laser diode of the same material 
diodes allow lasers to be powered by electricity without them 
semiconductor lasers must be powered by other lasers or electron 
beams 
zory who has worked on lasers for ibm and general electric 
said ibm is trying another technique called second harmonic 
generation its expensive but theyre doing it anyway because 
they want that blue light if we come in soon with the blue diode 
it will blow that technology out of the water 
glenn sincerbox a former colleague of zorys who manages 
optical recording for ibm in san jose calif said blue lasers 
are very important we consider them strategic

construction could begin by the end of this 
year on the first solar houses in the proposed 500 million tucson 
solar village which is envisioned as a guide for energyefficient 
housing in the coming century 
were getting interest from all over the globe because of the 
uniqueness of this project said john beimfohr of the state solar 
energy office 
the overall effort will be to provide an affordable mixeduse 
community using less energy and resources than traditional 
developments and complying with more stringent environmental 
performance codes said wilson orr project manager for the 
800acre village to be built on stateowned land 
workshops review meetings and surveys will allow the public to 
offer opinions on transportation density jobs energy costs 
water use solid waste management open spaces wildlife 
recreation and affordability orr said 
basically our drawing board is blank right now he said 
in the coming months well be relying on the public to help us 
define this community and the performance standards for the 
community 
beimfohr said the village will incorporate such passive 
solar techniques as narrower treelined streets to reduce the 
urban heat island effect landscaping and house designs and 
orientation as well as active techniques such as solar 
collectors to heat water or provide energy 
initial funding for the project will come from an 850000 oil 
overcharge restitution fund administered by the state another 
69000 in the first year will come from the urban consortium 
which administers energyrelated funds for the us department of 
energy orr said 
under a bestcase scenario officials said construction on 
the first model homes could begin late this year with land 
auctions by 1992

insect pests could be quickly and safely 
killed by enticing them to eat a gelatinous meal containing 
parasites a biologist says 
such biogel pesticides cant harm plants animals or the 
environment but kill beetles termites cockroaches boll weevils 
corn rootworms tobacco worms and other insects within days said 
frank chang a temple university biology professor who developed it 
with graduate student michael gehret 
biogel is a soft material that contains an insect 
attractant a feeding stimulant food and nematodes insects 
natural enemies chang said nematodes live naturally in the soil 
and farmers to control pests spray them in large quantities in 
fields a process chang said is generally inefficient 
the nematodes can be rendered harmless by lack of moisture 
ultraviolet light and heat it is most likely that many nematodes 
die before killing any insects at the same time insects are able 
somehow to detect the meatodes and the pests will often avoid 
these supersaturated areas 
by contrast biogel placed in small containers attracts 
insects while preventing detection of the nematodes biogel 
reduces the use of nematodes by 99 percent chang said in 
other words instead of spraying 10 million nematodes per 225 
square feet of soil you only need 100000 
as the nematodes produce offspring in the remains of each 
insect the progeny return to the soil to repeat the infectious 
cycle 
he estimated that corn farmers who spend an estimated 10 an 
acre for chemicals to control rootworms could halve their costs 
ray mcallister director of regulatory affairs for the 
washingtonbased national agricultural chemicals association said 
changs work makes dramatic promises as with all new products 
it must prove itself in the marketplace against some stiff 
competition 
it has potential but it is not the cureall and it is 
certainly not the replacement for pesticides 
attempts at biological control predate chemical pest control 
strategies and often have had good results he said but they tend 
to be specific to one pest rather than the variety that attack 
crops

economic activity rebounded in most of the 
nations largest commercial centers during the third quarter as 
construction and employment levels improved according to a study 
the accounting firm grant thornton said wednesday its index of 
seven economic vital signs for two dozen us metropolitan areas 
rose from july through september after falling in the second 
quarter 
the index showed the average growth rate of the 24 cities rose 
by 082 in the third quarter to 1084 in the second quarter the 
index fell 077 
activity picked up in 22 of the 24 centers in the third quarter 
grant thornton said 
in making its assessment grant thornton evaulated factory 
hours nonfarm employment construction permits retail sales 
business starts business failures and money supply 
cincinnati which had gains in employment retail sales and 
construction permits in the third quarter saw the largest increase 
in economic growth followed by san francisco atlanta seattle and 
houston 
san francisco benefited from strong retail sales and employment 
growth while atlanta had the biggest gains in construction permits 
of any city seattle had the largest improvement in retail sales 
and also had a pickup in construction permits and employment and 
houston posted large gains in construction permits and factory 
hours 
boston was the only city studied by grant thornton to show a 
drop in activity declines in employment retail sales and factory 
hours and an increase in business failures were blamed for the 
areas poor showing 
growth remained flat in the new york metropolitan area where 
weakness in employment and retail sales was offset by a moderate 
improvement in factory hours 
during the 12 months ended september 1989 activity rose in all

the nearly dead us consumer electronics 
industry could rebound in the 1990s through a major effort 
involving both industry and the federal government a private 
research group says 
a report issued wednesday by the economic policy institute 
called for relaxation of antitrust laws to allow manufacturers to 
share production facilities and for increased support by the 
government for research and development 
without an ambitious new effort we are bound to fall farther 
behind those nations which take the new international manufacturing 
competition seriously said susan walsh sanderson a professor at 
rensselaer polytechnic institute and the author of the report 
the report noted that in the past two decades the united states 
has gone from being the worlds leading producer of electronics 
goods to a major importer of these products 
beginning in the 1970s american companies gave up making radios 
and black and white televisions and in the 1980s lost out in the 
competition to manufacture more sophisticated products such as 
video cassette recorders and compact disk players 
though americans invented videotape no vcrs are manufactured in 
the united states only one us television company remains zenith 
electronics corp though several foreign firms make tvs 
domestically 
in one branch of electronics after another us firms have 
failed to achieve commercial advantage from technical innovation 
while the japanese and the newly industrialized countries of asia 
have caught up with and in many instances surpassed their us 
rivals the report said 
this pattern is repeated in cases where the technology is 
stable toasters radios and irons and where the technology is 
changing rapidly televisions video cassette recorders 
semiconductors and computers 
lost markets for hightechnology products are particularly 
threatening since this is where most experts believe the united 
states must make gains if it ever hopes to close its yawning trade 
deficits 
the report hailed a recent decision by seven leading computer 
and semiconductor firms to invest up to 500 million in us 
memories inc a joint venture which will produce key computer 
components it said such joint efforts were an example of the 
innovations necessary for the united states to compete in world 
trade 
the study entitled the consumer electronics industry and the 
future of american manufacturing made these other points 
us firms have been able to find government support in weapons 
manufacturing the defense share of total federal spending on 
research and development rose from 514 percent in 1964 to 684 
percent in 1987 but these funds are likely to shrink dramatically 
with the expected cuts in defense spending from a relaxation of 
eastwest tensions 
as defense support for research and development declines 
congress must channel part of the peace dividend into increased 
civilian research including the public financing of demonstration 
projects aimed at improving manufacturing processes 
the government also needs to adopt policies that will reduce 
the cost of capital to us businesses and encourage more corporate 
investment in research into new products and development of new 
manufacturing processes 
for decades military and space spending has been our countrys 
only program for assisting competitiveness of electronics 
manufacturing sanderson said with a major shift of these 
resources we could help to assure a strong underpinning for our 
national commercial security 
the economic policy institute is a nonprofit research 
organization founded in 1986 with several prominent liberal 
economists among its founders it is backed by grants from

the nations thrift institutions lost 56 
billion in deposits in october the 16th outflow in 17 months but 
an improvement over the previous month the government said 
the office of thrift supervision said wednesday the october 
outflow at 2895 thrifts followed 87 billion in net withdrawals 
in september and brought the total for the year to date to 592 
billion leaving the industry with a total deposit base of 9493 
billion 
the industry has recorded net withdrawals in every month 
starting in june 1988 except for july 1989 when net deposits 
totaled 66 million 
withdrawals earlier in the year which hit a monthly record of 
108 billion in january were attributed to depositor uncertainty 
about president bushs bailout plan and to rising interest rates 
which made other investments such as money market mutual funds more 
attractive 
since the enactment of the bush plan aug 9 however continuing 
outflows have been attributed to a deliberate strategy by 
institutions to shrink their operations to meet new capital 
standards that took effect dec 7 
as part of that thrifts have been selling their assets which 
declined a record 152 billion in september and a slight 6 
million more in october 
the thrift office in a statement said the industrys 
adjustment to new financial standards appeared to be continuing in 
october but at a slower pace 
this is just a momentary slowing in the shrinkage of the 
industry but its not over by any means said bert ely a 
private industry analyst in alexandria va 
one month does not make a trend basically the only way most 
thrift institutions can meet the new capital requirements is by 
shrinking and theres more to be done he said

clothing makers worried that they might not get 
paid by cashstrapped campeau corp still are reluctant to let 
relations unravel with stores that have been good customers 
but the financial crisis facing the canadian retail and property 
company remains unresolved 
most of the garment manufacturers that traditionally supply 
merchandise to stock campeaus us department stores are holding 
back shipments until the situation becomes clearer 
some of them said wednesday they are meeting small orders to 
satisfy shoppers at campeauowned stores such as the wellknown 
bloomingdales chain which has been put up for sale to help ease 
campeaus cash shortage 
bud konheim president of apparel maker nicole miller inc said 
his company has assured bloomingdales buyers that it wont 
withhold goods that customers want 
im taking care of bloomingdales on special orders he 
said i am not cutting off any of these stores rudely crudely 
or abruptly we still have to treat them as very good customers 
but it isnt exactly business as usual by a long shot for 
konheims company or its competitors several big factors 
companies that provide credit support to manufacturers started 
telling clients weeks ago that they wouldnt accept the risk of 
doing business with torontobased campeau any longer 
over the past few months some mainstream suppliers have disposed 
of merchandise through discounters and offprice outlets instead of 
shipping to stores operated by campeaus allied stores corp and 
federated department stores inc divisions based in cincinnati 
they were willing to take less for their goods rather than risk 
not being paid at all by campeau 
manufacturers are waiting to see whether they receive payment 
for goods shipped to the allied and federated retailers between 
nov 20 and the week before christmas the deadline for those 
payments is jan 10 
if the bills arent paid manufacturers likely will continue to 
balk that raises the spectre of sparsely stocked shelves at such 
campeauowned retailers as burdines the bon marche lazarus and 
richs 
currently there is a betweenseason lull in shipments from 
manufacturers to retailers most stores are in the midst of 
postchristmas sales with enough winter merchandise to tide them 
over until late january or early february when spring goods 
usually start showing up retail analysts say 
there has been speculation within the retail trade that heavily 
indebted campeau might delay paying bills as long as possible so 
that it can accumulate cash before seeking refuge for its retailers 
in bankruptcy court 
allied and federated had warned last month that they might be 
forced to file for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the bankruptcy code unless bondholders agree to reschdule certain 
debts 
campeau has debts in highinterest junk bonds that were sold to 
finance its 67 billion takeover of federated parent of 
bloomingdales in 1988 
geoffrey lurie president of gdl management inc which 
specializes in advising companies in turnaround situations said he 
is convinced that a chapter 11 petition will be filed by 
campeau on behalf of its retailers 
such an action actually would reduce the turmoil in the apparel 
trade he contended manufacturers could resume shipments to allied 
and federated after a filing knowing that they would be among the 
first in line to get paid claims that crop up after a filing have 
priority over unsecured creditors who had payments due them before 
a company files for chapter 11 protection 
meanwhile an announcement tuesday that allied and federated won 
a temporary reprieve from a threat by bank lenders to declare the 
retailers in technical default on a 234 billion loan didnt 
provide much comfort for suppliers 
the banking syndicate led by citicorps citibank agreed not to 
press the point before jan 15 giving campeau more time to show it 
is making progress in sorting out its financial problems the 
bankers previously said they might ask for full repayment of the 
loan a demand that presumably could have forced campeau to file a 
chapter 11 petition immediately 
theres no measure of comfort now said konheim of the 
nicole miller apparel company he said in order for the garment 
trade to alter its stance toward campeau it would like to see 
campeau get backing for its restructuring plans from citibank or 
another financially sound supporter 
bernard chaus who heads a womens clothing manufacturing 
company that bears his name was more optimistic the news 
certainly is encouraging he said we are quite confident that 
these stores will be in business for many years to come

merrill lynch amp co says it will sell its 
canadian retail brokerage operations to wood gundy inc a 
torontobased securities firm 
the deal announced wednesday is part of a piecemeal 
restructuring the largest us brokerage launched in november to 
reduce costs and improve profits in a slumping wall street business 
environment 
the sale of merrill lynch canada incs retail arm includes the 
transfer of 20 offices professional and support staffs and access 
to the firms us research capabilities terms of the deal with 
wood gundy were not disclosed 
merrill lynchs retail sales operation in canada employs 685 
people including 264 registered representatives after the sale 
merrill still will employ about 300 people in canada in 
institutional sales trading and research investment banking 
mergers and acquisitions and crossborder financing 
dumping the retail operation will reduce merrill lynchs total 
work force to about 39800 from a peak of more than 46000 before 
the october 1987 stock market crash 
merrill officials said the firm decided to sell the retail 
division because it appeared unlikely merrill lynch would receive a 
banking license in canada 
we believe that the strategic future of the retail business is 
directly linked with access to the canadian banking system 
jerome p kenney president and chief executive of merrill lynch 
capital markets said in a statement 
kenney also said merrill is studying its other businesses around 
the world as part of its streamlining effort 
since november merrill has abandoned the european commercial 
paper business and one equity division at its new york 
headquarters a subsidiary broadcort capital corp recently sold 
some retailoriented clearing counts to a division of donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
merrill lynch entered canadian finance in 1969 when it acquired 
royal securities 
after the deal with merrill wood gundy will employ more than 
2500 people in canada and elsewhere wood gundy which is 62 
percent owned by canadian imperial bank of commerce has 39 offices

coniston partners is dismissing as irrelevant a 
decision by ual corp to accelerate the schedule for its talks with 
nonunion workers over a possible employee buyout of the airline 
company 
the talks will begin two days after a monday deadline for a 
buyout plan imposed by the investor group a major ual shareholder 
pressuring the parent of united airlines to enhance its stock value 
with a buyout or other measures 
the announcement of the speedup implied that ual would not meet 
conistons deadline but coniston principal augustus oliver 
shrugged off the development 
i dont view the scheduled meetings with noncontract 
employees as necessarily relevant to our jan 8 deadline oliver 
said in a telephone interview from new york 
oliver said the success of any employee buyout plan hinged less 
on the participation of uals 23000 salaried and management 
employees than on the involvement of the unionized pilots flight 
attendants and machinists who together represent about 46000 ual 
workers 
those three groups along with management are the key to 
getting something off the ground oliver said 
it then becomes important to find the proper role and place 
with noncontract employees he said we obviously think the 
noncontract employees are an important element in the company as a 
whole but i think the key focus in the company is the unionized 
employees 
uals management already has met with leaders of uniteds pilot 
and flight attendant unions over an employee buyout plan 
ual chairman stephen wolf in an internal memo wednesday said 
the talks with salaried and management employees were being moved 
up to jan 10 and 11 from jan 16 and 17 to provide meaningful 
input on employee ownership issues prior to any significant 
developments that could affect the structuring of any new 
employee ownership proposal 
one way to look at it oliver said is that maybe steve 
wolf is scheduling these meetings to explain a proposal that 
theyre going to announce prior to that 
ual fell 775 a share to close at 16275 wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange 
a 675 billion buyout proposal led by ual management and the 
pilots union collapsed in october when the group was unable to 
raise financing for the 300ashare deal 
the machinists opposition to the plan helped kill it ual 
management reportedly is considering a deal that would not include 
the companys 25000 machinist union members 
coniston which owns 118 percent of uals common stock has 
said it would press for a recapitalization of the company if there 
was no acceptable employee buyout plan by monday 
a recapitalization could involve a cash dividend to 
shareholders although some analysts believe such a plan would be 
worth less than 200 a share that compares with the 240ashare 
buyout proposal that ual management reportedly has discussed in 
meetings with its pilots and flight attendants 
airline industry analysts were divided on the significance of 
the accelerated meetings 
it certainly isnt what coniston wanted said an analyst who 
spoke on condition of anonymity coniston set a deadline but the 
company is saying it will move at its own pace were not bullish 
on the stock 
but samuel buttrick of the investment firm kidder peabody amp 
co saw room for give and take between coniston and ual 
my interpretation is that the date neednt be set in stone as 
long as some progress is being made buttrick said

general motors corp chairman roger smith 
urged the united auto workers to acknowledge the car industry is 
mired in a slump and declined to rule out more plant closures in 
the first quarter 
smith at a news conference wednesday to discuss gms prototype 
electricpowered impact car said future closures would depend on 
demand for gm cars and that it was too early to predict demand this 
quarter 
fortytwo assembly plants will be down for at least one week in 
january the big three operate 53 assembly plants in the united 
states 
among the plants targeted for temporary slowdown are several in 
ohio including gm plants in columbus and dayton which will idle 
more than 4700 workers the company announced wednesday 
as automakers grapple with high inventories and low demand 
total shutdowns will affect more than 127000 auto workers 
smith declined to directly answer a question on what effect the 
plant closures would have on contract talks with the united auto 
workers which begin in september 
he suggested though that workers should realize the auto 
industry has hit hard times 
the uaw has got good economists too so they should know 
smith said 
about this time last year smith accurately predicted record 
earnings for gm but he refused to make such a prediction on 
wednesday saying that securities and exchange commission rules 
precluded him from doing so 
reminded that he had done so last year before fourthquarter 
earnings were released he said it was easier to read last year 
because of the first nine months which he said were so good that 
it was clear a record would be set 
smith was peppered with questions about the documentary roger 
amp me which contains interviews with people who said they lost 
their homes after gm plant closures in flint mich 
one woman said she had to start killing rabbits for food after 
smith shut down the plants eliminating 30000 jobs in the city of 
150000 
i havent seen it smith said im not much for sick humor 
and i dont like things that take advantage of poor people 
filmmaker michael moore said he arranged with warner bros to 
reserve a seat for smith at every showing of the movie across the 
united states

a computer chip built smaller than a credit 
card and packed with the power of a roomsized supercomputer has 
been unveiled by trw inc and motorola corp 
the new chip first will be used in the military as the brain in 
spacecraft missiles and jet fighters and the makers hope it 
eventually will help free united states from relyiance on japanese 
chip makers 
the chip called cpuax for central processing unit arithmetic 
extended is expected to enter the commercial electronics market as 
other technologies catch up 
trw and motorola issued a statement wednesday saying their chip 
can perform 200 million operations per second by placing several 
times more transistors on a chip than ever before 
two hundred million operations per second mean the chip is 
the computational equivalent of some supercomputers that fill an 
entire room require elaborate refrigeration systems and weigh 
several tons said thomas a zimmerman a research director at 
trw the clevelandbased aerospace and defense company 
the chip is packaged at 21 inches by 21 inches and weighs 15 
ounces it has 4 million transistors each smaller than a light 
wave according to trw and motorola the schaumburg illbased 
electronics company 
commercial successors of the superchip could find use in a 
wide variety of applications where high speed small size and great 
computing power and reliability are needed zimmerman said 
among these are computeraided design medical diagnosis plant 
process control and complex imaging 
william s richardson executive vice of ncube a beaverton 
orebased computer company that builds such parallel processing 
supercomputers said the trwmotorola chip is a pretty impressive 
system 
when you put 4 million transistors on a single computer chip 
that in effect means far higher performance he said its 
probably three or four times the number of transistors of anything 
before 
the chip is able to repair glitches in its operations when 
used in conjunction with a satellite chip essentially by 
disconnecting the faulty parts of the superchip the companies said 
the chip was produced by a trwmotorola contractor team working 
on the defense departments very highspeed integrated circuits 
program the team has worked for 10 years on three phases of the 
program the companies said 
the selfrepair function is probably necessary because the 
transistors are so tiny and the chip so complex that inevitable 
glitches otherwise would render it useless said richardson 
he said that previously the smallest transistor in a computer 
chip was about 08 to 10 microns twice the size of those in the 
trwmotorola superchip 
recent top of the line chips have handled up to 50 million 
instructions per second with industry leader intel claiming 100 
million to 150 million instructions per second for its newest and 
hottest microprocessor compared with the new superchips 200 mips

apple computer inc said today its 
board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to 25 million 
additional shares of common stock 
the ongoing openmarket purchases are part of an ongoing program 
announced last august when apples board first authorized purchase 
of 25 million shares 
john sculley apples chairman and chief executive said the 
purchase represents good longterm value to our shareholers 
last month apple projected a decline in earnings in the first 
quarter of fiscal 1990 and said sales would grow more slowly than 
previously predicted 
the announcement surprised industry watchers coming just two 
weeks after a top executive of the personal computer maker told 
security analysts in new york that it expected worldwide sales 
growth of more than 20 percent 
before august apple had completed two share repurchase programs 
in 1986 and 1987 which together involved 15 million shares of 
stock

the father advertisement was an illconceived project from 
the start said analyst thomas ogrady of integrated automotive 
resources inc of wayne pa 
it made a lot of statements that lacked the ability to sell 
the cars he said it was an ad campaign that had to go 
ogrady said the campaign made the mistake of targeting car 
buyers around 40 years old who usually dont consider buying 
oldsmobiles while alienating the traditional older oldsmobile 
buyers by saying the car is not for them 
oldsmobile sales suffered in 1989 through dec 20 the 
divisions sales were running 154 percent behind last years pace

oldsmobile which had stopped producing trucks in 1934 returned 
to the truck market last year with the silhouette minivan 
it will get us back market that weve lost losh said car 
buyers have been changing to truck buyers with the relatively 
recent popularity of minivans and sportutility vehicles like jeeps 
we dont see ourselves doing a pickup truck for instance 
he said 
loshs comments came during the first day of the threeday media 
preview for the north american international auto show in detroit 
also at the preview chrysler motors president robert lutz said 
chrysler was conducting two studies to develop a successor for its 
plymouth horizon and dodge omni subcompact cars those vehicles go 
out of production early next month when chrysler shuts down its 
jefferson avenue plant in detroit 
lutz said one of the studies involves a possible link with an 
asian automaker probably mitsubishi motors corp 
this study is focused primarily on mitsubishi for the obvious 
reason that they are our primary asian partner lutz said but 
the study is not exclusively focused on mitsubishi 
chrysler and mitsubishi currently are involved in a number of 
manufacturing and marketing associations 
lutz said the second study was focused on whether the car could 
be developed exclusively by chrysler 
whichever plan is selected he said the omnihorizon successor 
wouldnt hit showroom floors until the mid1990s after chrysler 
begins car production from its lh program 
at one time chrysler commanded a large chunk of the smallcar 
market with its omni and horizon partly with its america series of 
subcompacts but since then sales have eroded amid criticism that 
the subcompacts styling had become stale 
combined omnihorizon sales through dec 20 this year had fallen 
to 78461 thats 334 percent behind last years sales pace

oil which further supported the soybean futures market

exxon officials say a heating oil leak is 20 
to 100 times larger than first estimated and that up to 500000 
gallons of fuel spilled into a waterway separating new jersey and 
new yorks staten island 
the officials are investigating whether a leak detector in an 
underwater pipeline may have malfunctioned the coast guard closed 
much of the arthur kill channel to boat traffic wednesday 
coast guard chief gene hoff said today the waterway was likely 
to be closed an additional 24 to 48 hours 
in pennsylvania officials reopened a stretch of the monongahela 
river today that had been closed since new years day after some 
five dozen barges broke loose from moorings during a thaw one 
wayward vessel spilled 10000 gallons of gasoline into the water 
exxon said from 100000 to 500000 gallons were spilled into the 
arthur kill after the coast guard questioned its initial estimate 
of 5000 gallons and the company conducted an inventory officials 
said 
hoff said today the actual spill of refined no 2 oil probably 
was closer to 400000 gallons and that 100000 to 200000 remained 
on the waterway 
coast guard capt robert north on wednesday had estimated the 
spill at 200000 gallons and said about half already had 
evaporated of the remainder about half had been contained by 
booms within the kill he said 
the spill first discovered early tuesday left an 11mile slick 
from shooters island at the mouth of newark bay in the north to 
tottenville at the southern tip of staten island 
it was traced to an underwater rupture in a 67mile 12inch 
pipe connecting the exxon plant in bayonne to its bayway refinery 
and chemical plant in linden 
the arthur kill which is in a heavily industrialized area lined 
with oil companies and storage tanks was closed wednesday 
afternoon to general traffic for the cleanup north said vessels 
were being allowed through by special request 
dozens of vessels use the arthur kill each day north said 
adding that there was some backup because of the closing 
the cleanup which exxon is handling could take several weeks 
north said 
ben marvin spokesman for the new york state department of 
environmental conservation in albany said workers had recovered 10 
oilsoaked waterfowl nearly two dozen ducks have been found dead 
most on pralls island a protected state wildlife sanctuary in the 
arthur kill 
there was no evidence of damage to fish life north said 
exxon initially said the pipelines leak detector system 
automatically shut the pipeline but exxon plant manager katherine 
cochrane said wednesday officials were not sure 
she said it would have taken about three hours for the pipe to 
discharge 500000 gallons at its full capacity of 168000 gallons 
an hour 
it is also possible that workers may have ignored the devices 
leak advisory because it has given faulty leak reports in the past 
ms cochrane said 
exxon spokesman louis jung said divers had determined there was 
a 4foot by halfinch gash in the pipe the company is trying to 
determine what hit the line he said 
about 50 workers were setting up booms to trap the oil or 
removing it from the waters surface with skimmers and vacuums 
said exxon cleanup coordinator joe czarnecki he said priority is 
being given to environmentally sensitive areas such as pralls 
island and saw mill creek 
pennsylvania officials said environmental damage was slight from 
the gasoline spill on the monongahela 
the coast guard had warned barge operators dec 26 that a thaw 
was expected by weekend and advised them to secure barges tightly 
so that rushing chunks of ice and high water would not knock the 
vessels free but at least 61 barges were torn from their moorings 
37 of them at the maxwell dam 60 miles upstream from pittsburgh 
the coast guard began searching for sunken barges wednesday over 
20 miles of river with sonar equipment the procedure was completed 
early today and the coast guard reopened the entire river to 
traffic

impossible to move quickly to a freemarket system prime minister 
petre roman was quoted as saying thursday 
we are going to try to establish an appropriate relationship 
between planning and the market he was quoted as saying by the 
independent french daily le monde to say we will starting now 
create a market economy would not correspond to the situation in 
which we find ourselves 
petre said the new government put in place by the national 
salvation front until free elections planned in april would try to 
decentralize control over stateowned enterprises but said the 
idea of privatization had not been raised the newspaper reported 
we favor the abolition of the states monopoly on foreign 
trade but for now our economy is a planned economy he was 
quoted as saying we cant say to the enterprises from now on 
do what you want that would destablize the whole economy 
petre a frenchtrained scientist said he had been a marxist 
but never a communist le monde reported 
in any case we are no longer the slaves of any ideology that 
cost us too much he said

history demonstrates that rarely do two powerful 
leaders follow each other but that relatively ineffectual leaders 
often do 
that concept is the heart of what eugene jennings calls the 
lfor leadership principle and it suggests intriguing 
possibilities for the future of the united states the soviet union 
and much of europe 
what type of person for example is likely to follow soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev will the leadership of eastern european 
nations be strong or weak can george bush be a powerful leader so 
soon after ronald reagan 
jennings professor emeritus at michigan state university is 
author of the landmark volume anatomy of leaderhip written in 
1961 which traces leadership back to the egyptian pharoahs and 
princes heroes amp supermen 
in addition he has advised corporate chairmen and sometimes 
political candidates on how to conduct their affairs the better to 
demonstrate their leadership 
as he interprets the lprinciple powerful leaders come forth to 
fill voids rising in response to circumstances and needs of 
people but when they are through they often leave another void 
behind them 
into this void step what jennings calls representative 
officials or people who represent the popular thinking of their 
constituency unlike the powerful giants these folks and their 
ideas arent above or ahead of the people 
in jennings view dwight eisenhower was a representative leader 
rather than a giant he was followed in the presidency by john 
kennedy who jennings feels was emerging as a giant and then 
lyndon johnson became one 
johnson came forth and filled the void says jennings for 
better or worse he changed the direction and character of what the 
country had been under eisenhower 
under jimmy carter says jennings the country lost confidence 
to do anything right making conditions ripe for ronald reagan to 
come galloping in on a white horse 
does that mean george bush and the nation are in for a dull time 
not necessarily says jennings appearing to bend the 
lprinciple just a bit in his first term reagan was a giant he 
says an example of the wedding of the individual and the needs of 
the people in his second he wasnt 
after reagan says jennings we should be in a void defined 
as the absence of a need or condition for strongwilled chiefs 
but as he interprets the principle reagan actually created his own 
void in his final four years leaving room for bush to achieve the 
status of giant should events conspire 
it would be he concedes a rare but not unprecedented situation 
more common is the succession of two or more representative 
officials such as harding coolidge and hoover sandwiched between 
woodrow wilson and franklin roosevelt but wouldnt that have made 
harry truman representative 
thats another example of bending roosevelt says jennings was 
a giant of a leader in his early years changing the direction and 
character of the country but he was worn and torn by the time he 
died in office 
with the world turning over as he puts it and democracy 
sweeping old regimes from power jennings believes conditions are 
now ripe for a strong president to exert his will bush he 
believes could become a giant 
in jennings interpretation winston churchill was a giant but 
anthony eden was not stalin was a giant but he was followed by a 
series of less powerful officials gorbachev filled the void they 
created and depending on how irreversible his initiatives are 
he will be a giant 
that brings up the future the lprinciple suggests that 
gorbachev will leave a void to be filled by the socalled 
representative or transitional types first however gorbachev 
must nail down his reforms 
jennings also feels that like them or not the former leaders of 
the east bloc were powerful enough to leave a void that will be 
filled by transitional or representative types that leaves the 
question of who will follow them 
if the future remains unstable he says it could mean a giant 
of a leader perhaps antidemocratic could follow the possibility 
of future dictators still exists he says

sell three divisions that supply electronic and electrical 
interconnection products saying the divisions no longer fit well 
with its corporate plans

milan italy and winchester electronics based in watertown conn 
they have combined annual sales of about 170 million and employ 
about 2200 people at locations in the united states and europe

benefit from association with a company where they will fit 
better said alton j brann litton senior vice president and 
head of the companys components and industrial products business 
robert s knapp a spokesman for the beverly hillsbased 
company said the operations are growing and profitable but are 
being sold as part of littons strategy of concentrating on its 
three core businesses those are advanced electronic and defense 
systems resource exploration services and industrial automation 
systems 
brann said he hoped the divisions would be purchased as a unit

soybean futures prices closed moderately lower 
thursday and sharply below the days highs as early excitement 
about new export business gave way to bearish technical signals 
most grain futures finished narrowly mixed 
the soybean market opened with a burst of buying linked partly 
to new export sales of the commodity and partly to lingering 
bullishness from the previous session 
but traders grew discouraged and selling materialized after the 
march contract failed to reach 585 a bushel a point at which new 
buyers were known to be waiting 
when that failure occurred i think the bears gained a little 
more confidence and they began to press the market said pat 
oconnell a grainmarket analyst with refco inc in chicago 
the selling snowballed as prices fell through successive support 
levels and closed at or near the days lows 
at the close soybean futures were cent to 5 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in january at 563 a bushel wheat 
futures were cent lower to cent higher with march at 409 a 
bushel corn futures were cent lower to 1 cent higher with march

drexel burnham lambert inc on thursday paid a 
13 million fine to the state of illinois for securities fraud an 
administrative penalty stemming from a highly publicized wall 
street corruption case 
the negotiated settlement is the biggest such penalty for 
securities law violations in the states history far exceeding the 
previous record fine of 156000 said secretary of state jim edgar 
the settlement also exceeds by nearly 1 million the highest 
penalty collected by any of the 36 other states with which the new 
yorkbased brokerage firm has reached agreements as a result of its 
pleading guilty last september to federal mail and securities fraud 
in us district court in manhattan edgar said 
in addition to the fine drexel agreed to pay for a 
firstinthenation search for illinois investors who may be 
entitled to civil damages as a result of its fraudulent activities 
from early 1984 to late 1986 edgar told a news conference in 
chicago 
drexel also agreed to contribute 100000 to an independent 
foundation that will educate the public about securities markets 
and safeguards to prevent fraud edgar said 
this record settlement makes clear illinois firm commitment 
to enforce the law and combat fraud he said 
security fraud and stock price manipulation will not be 
tolerated edgar said the law is the law whether you are a 
nationwide multimilliondollar operator or a oneperson storefront 
shop 
steven anreder a drexel spokesman in new york said the firm 
was very pleased that weve been able to work to put this behind 
us 
were hopeful that we will resolve it with all the 
jurisdictions and be able to move on anreder said 
drexel has yet to settle securitiesfraud charges with 13 
states including new york and california the only two states in 
which the brokerage did more business than in illinois 
edgar said the illinois settlement stipulates that if drexel 
negotiates significantly higher settlements with california or new 
york the brokerage must increase the fine paid to illinois to 53 
percent of the california settlement and 66 percent of the new york 
fine 
we wanted to make sure our settlement was in the proper 
perspective to those other settlements edgar said 
the settlement allows drexel to keep its brokerage license in 
illinois although the company sold its retail brokerage business 
last summer 
edgar said he rejected an initial drexel settlement offer of 
400000 
drexel pleaded guilty to six felony counts and paid 650 million 
in fines and restitution to settle charges of insider trading and 
other offenses brought during the governments threeyear crackdown 
on wall street crime 
edgar whose office handles securities violations driver and 
vehicle licensing and other functions is seeking the gop 
nomination for governor in the march primary

quaker state corp is offering a free 
warranty on the lubricated engine parts of new cars for 10 years or 
250000 miles extending warranties offered by automakers said 
president jack w corn 
new car owners must meet strict rules to qualify including an 
oil and filter change every four months or 4000 miles by a lube 
shop or auto dealer the quaker state warranty does not cover 
claims already covered by auto manufacturers warranties but it 
will pay for deductibles not covered by automaker extended service 
contracts 
we are providing every car owner who uses quaker state 
additional protection for a quarter of a million miles or 10 
years corn said wednesday in a news release 
the oil citybased refiner previously offered a similar but more 
limited warranty available at fewer than 1000 auto dealers 
nationwide the company said 
but the new warranty goes beyond that said spokesman benton 
h faulkner potentially thousands of lube shops and auto 
dealers will offer it he said 
in recent years general motors corp ford motor co chrysler 
corp and other automakers have extended warranties on engines and 
transmissions chrysler extended its coverage to five years or 
50000 miles and gm and ford followed with sixyear or 60000mile 
coverage 
faulkner declined to reveal the cost of the warranty program he 
said only our estimate is that we can manage it 
he said quaker state expects the warranty to increase sales of 
motor oil 
this reflects our conviction that more people are concerned 
about caring for their vehicle properly he said 
the fourmonth 4000mile oil and filter change requirement is 
more strict than that recommended by auto manufacturers faulkner 
said but quaker state has claimed for some time that motor oil 
should be changed more often than those recommendations he said 
this puts us on the record as saying what people should do 
he said 
the warranty is being offered through auto dealers service 
stations and quick lube shops quaker state said 
to enroll in the warranty program car owners must sign up at 
participating shops that sell quaker state motor oil new car 
owners have six months from the date of purchase or before the car 
has 6000 miles to sign up 
quaker state said it will replace or repair lubricated engine 
parts that fail or wear abnormally due to failure of its motor oil 
to qualify for reimbursement the company said a new car owner 
must keep records of oil changes which must be submitted at the 
time of a claim quaker state will pay for reasonable costs 
associated with parts and labor

the number of oil and gas wells drilled in the 
united states last year was probably the lowest for any year in the 
decade according to an annual survey by petroleum information 
it was the worst year because of fewer wells drilled less oil 
produced and the decline in gas production after it had been going 
up jack ekstrom director of industry affairs for the energy 
services reporting company owned by dun amp bradstreet corp said 
wednesday what this means for the 1990s is that production will 
decline even faster than it has been 
petroleum information expects well completions to total about 
28100 for 1989 ekstrom said the 1989 projection is 16 percent 
below the 33500 wells drilled in 1988 the previous low for the 
decade 
the worst year recorded by petroleum information was 1971 when 
27682 wells were drilled 
the number of successful natural gas wells drilled last year 
totaled 6401 through yearend up 88 percent from 5882 a year 
earlier meanwhile the number of producing oil well completions 
totaled 8009 down a precipitous 266 percent from the 10916 
counted at the end of 1988 
texas led the nation with 7116 completions of exploratory wells 
through yearend this figure exceeds oklahoma with 2070 kansas 
with 1989 and california with 1467 and texas bucked the trend 
with a higher success rate for wildcats 236 percent compared with 
21 percent in 1988

stock prices sagged today amid increasing doubts 
about the staying power of the rally that greeted the start of 1990 
analysts said the market appeared to be suffering a bit 
paradoxically from signs that the economy was maintaining 
strongerthanexpected momentum as the new year began 
that appeared to chill hopes for any further easing soon in the 
federal reserves credit policy and to raise new questions about 
the outlook for interest rates 
what buying interest there was seemed confined largely to 
computer and other cyclical stocks that languished in the waning 
months of 1989 as expectations increased of a general business 
slump 
those issues have rebounded in recent days on the theory that 
they were unduly depressed by recession talk

the market to sell dollars

the canadian dollar chorek said breaking the 16750mark level 
during the day was a real bad sign and predicted the dollar 
could fall as low as 15600 marks

disappointed with the marks recent relative weakness

fridays release of unemployment data for december people are

zenith data systems corp has agreed to 
drop its protest against a 706 million air force contract to rival 
unisys corp for desktop computer equipment both companies said 
thursday 
lawyers for the companies an intervenor and the air force 
reached a settlement wednesday evening that asks the general 
services administrations board of contract appeals to dismiss the 
protest 
gsa spokesman steve guiheen said the dismissal would probably be 
issued in one or two days 
the desktop iii contract calls for unisys a computer 
manufacturer based in blue bell to make equipment that combines 
two of the most widely used desktop operating systems unix and 
msdos 
the equipment would give the government wide flexibility in the 
types of programs it can run and the types of machines with which 
it can communicate 
zenith data systems based in mount prospect ill held the 
defense departments two previous desktop computer contracts and 
had vigorously sought the desktop iii contract 
we maintained from the beginning that the protest was without 
merit james mcguirk unisys vice president and general manager 
of aerospace operations said in a statement 
unisys hopes to gain significant market share in the desktop 
arena as a result of the project mcguirk said 
zenith data systems and the intervenor government technical 
services inc will be allowed to buy or license up to two units of 
any unisys product offered under the contract at a 30 percent 
discount according to the threepage settlement 
the air force agreed to start its functional test demonstration 
by jan 24 at gunter air force base near montgomery ala 
zenith data systems which was sold last week by zenith 
electronics corp to groupe bull of france had alleged violation 
of the trade agreements act improper evaluation of proposals and 
failure by unisys to meet minimum requirements of the contract 
specifications 
we are disappointed by the award of the contract to a 
competitor but through discovery and the settlement all of our 
concerns about the fairness of the competition and the adequacy of 
the contract are alleviated tom buchsbaum zenith data systems 
vice president for federal systems said from vienna va

measures 
the annual growth rate in m2 so far this year is 45 percent 
which is within the feds target range of 3 percent to 7 percent 
the annual growth rate in m3 is 33 percent which is below the

hog and pork belly futures prices shot up their permitted daily 
limits thursday after the agriculture department issued a quarterly 
hogs and pigs tally that showed far fewer animals than traders had 
expected 
on other commodity markets energy and orange juice futures 
turned lower precious metals advanced strongly and grains and 
soybeans were mixed 
hog futures settled 15 cents higher across the board on the 
chicago mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in 
february at 505 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 2 cents 
higher across the board with february at 5147 cents a pound 
live cattle futures settled 20 cent lower to 40 cent higher 
with february at 7695 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged 
to 35 cent higher with january at 8455 cents a pound 
market analysts had predicted limit gains in the pork complex 
following wednesdays usda hogs and pigs inventory report which 
showed a 3 percent drop in the national herd size from the end of 
1988 to the end of 1989 
the report also indicated that springtime farrowing intentions 
a measure of expected herd expansion were down 6 percent from a 
year ago 
the report surprised most analysts whose observations of 
slaughter rates relative to the september report had led them to 
expect little change in the december tally 
one reason for the decline in herd size was the usdas sharp 
downward revision in the september inventory some analysts found 
the revision especially disturbing because the usda in september 
had revised sharply upward the june inventory number 
its really casting a little bit of doubt on the credibility 
of the hog numbers being released by the usda said analyst dale 
durchholz of agrivisor services inc in bloomington ill it 
makes you wonder what the actual benchmark is 
charles levitt senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc was more blunt 
the numbers just dont make sense he said we are being 
kicked around back and forth from one report to the next simply to 
make the inventory figure fit the subsequent slaughter 
orange juice and energy futures turned lower ending steep 
runups in those markets linked to the december cold spell which 
damaged the florida orange crop sharply boosted heatingoil 
demand froze some oil refineries and taxed others to the breaking 
point 
i think it was just a lot of liquidation said energy 
analyst andrew lebow of edamp f man international futures inc 
the crudeoil market had gone up about 2 iin three days thats 
a huge move and the market was a little tired 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 27 cent to 57 cent 
lower on the new york mercantile exchange with february at 2341 a 
barrel heating oil was 145 cents to 501 cents lower with 
february at 7319 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 125 cents 
to 194 cents lower with february at 6529 cents a gallon 
brazilian authorities announced a resumption of orange juice 
exports to the united states after a weeks suspension which 
contributed to the drop in orange juice futures prices 
orange juice futures finished 105 cents to 3 cents lower on the 
new york cotton exchange with january at 171 a pound 
precious metals futures rebounded after two days of deep losses 
platinum led the rally as japanese buyers returned to the market 
after a fiveday new years break 
on the new york merc platinum futures soared 1630 to 1890 
with january settling at 48870 a troy ounce 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold futures settled 440 to 
530 higher with february at 40080 a troy ounce silver was 115 
cents to 125 cents higher with march at 5335 a troy ounce 
soybean futures prices finished moderately lower and sharply 
below the days highs on the chicago board of trade as early

signals

563 a bushel wheat futures were cent lower to cent higher

we want to be certain that our customers obtain the maximum 
potential from firestone radial truck tires both during the 
original tread life and in the retread stage said thomas r

and that sort of thing troyer said in the normal course of 
doing business we review the operations of our network of stores 
over the years we have closed stores which were not profitable or 
were marginal 
we are currently reviewing about 80 to determine whether or 
not they will be closed or perhaps sold to an independent tire 
dealer at the same time we are reviewing sites to add stores in

energy prices fell sharply thursday as traders 
decided to sell after two days of strong gains 
the contract for february delivery of west texas intermediate 
the benchmark grade of us crude oil fell 27 cents to 2341 per 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange following a 
79cent rise on wednesday and a jump of 107 on tuesday 
prices of wholesale unleaded gasoline and home heating oil also 
fell sharply 
the february contract for gasoline which surged 548 cents over 
tuesday and wednesday gave back some of those gains thursday 
falling 194 cents to 6529 cents a gallon 
heating oil skidded 501 cents to 7319 cents a gallon wiping 
out the 395 cent gain it ran up the previous two sessions 
analysts attributed the rally earlier this week to strong 
fundamental demand combined with speculative buying 
andrew lebow an energy market analyst at edampf man 
international futures inc said many traders having watched the 
market move steadily upward in recent weeks decided to liquidate 
some of their large positions on thursday 
an american petroleum institute report on wednesday indicated 
heating oil stocks were at their lowest levels in years but the 
markets appeared to be looking beyond those figures lebow said 
milder weather following the recent prolonged cold wave and 
anticipation of new oil imports coming into the united states may 
have been factors in thursdays trading he said

william r mclucas new head of the securities 
and exchange commissions enforcement division has been described 
by some associates a lowkey downtoearth guy others say hes an 
intense lawman savvy in stuff they dont teach in law school 
but most agree that when sec chairman richard c breeden tapped 
mclucas a 12year sec veteran for what is widely perceived as the 
second most important job in the agency it was a vote of 
confidence in the sec staff 
the world sort of saw this as an inhouse race between mclucas 
and several other senior staffers at the sec said john coffee a 
professor of securities law at columbia university picking an 
outsider would have had a demoralizing effect on the staff 
said coffee 
its commendable that people are promoted within the ranks 
when they deserve it and from what ive heard about him he 
deserves it said paul curran a prominent new york defense 
attorney 
breeden only on the job since october himself announced his 
selection of mclucas 39 on the day after christmas ending 
months of speculation about who would succeed gary lynch as wall 
streets top cop 
lynch who headed the enforcement division for four years before 
leaving public service last summer led the secs campaign against 
insider trading and other abuses by ivan boesky and other prominent 
wall street professionals 
the choice of mclucas seemed to please almost everyone from 
federal prosecutors to securities industry lawyers who are 
themselves mostly former government lawyers 
hes a really smart and extremely personable guy said alan 
cohen head of the securities fraud unit of the us attorneys 
office in manhattan 
cohens boss us attorney otto g obermaier said he hadnt 
been in contact with mclucas since taking over as top federal 
prosecutor in manhattan but in my former life as a prominent 
white collar criminal defense attorney i dealt with him almost 
all the time we didnt always agree on issues but i always found 
him fair accessible ready to reconsider a point of law 
we see appointing someone from the staff as a continuation of 
their policies said susan e bryant administrator of the 
oklahoma department of securities a statelevel version of the sec 
we were glad to see chairman breeden appoint someone from the 
staff who is familiar with the issues said ms bryant who is 
also president of a national organization of statelevel securities 
regulators the north american securities administrators 
association 
i do not think you could have had a more impressive choice 
said harvey pitt a prominent washington lawyer who represented 
boesky when the takeover stock speculator was nabbed in the insider 
trading scandals 
pitt a former sec lawyer himself who has known mclucas for 
years said the new sec enforcement chief is personable but he 
can be very tough very forceful and energetic 
even arthur mathews a washington securities lawyer who had been 
touting a member of his firm robert mccaw for the enforcement 
post said mclucas was a good choice 
i dont think anybody inside the sec wouldve compared to 
mccaw but once the chairman chose to go inside rather than 
outside i think mclucas was the best choice said mathews 
mclucas is very well liked and well respected by the bar by 
the internal staff and by the investment community said mathews 
asked if it was wise to have an enforcement chief that everybody 
liked mathews said by like i mean respect 
when people describe mclucas they use words like quiet 
confident and compassionate 
but lynch mclucass predecessor said he knows that such 
descriptions of incoming office holders can get excessive 
i was described in so many newspaper stories as softspoken 
i thought i should start screaming said lynch now in private 
practice in new york 
i wouldnt describe bill as lowkey at all i think hes a 
very intense person as a matter of fact he certainly has a lot of 
common sense 
if mclucas is downtoearth said lynch its because he has 
the knowledge you dont get in law school 
mclucas who is said to smoke a pipe occasionally and follow the 
football fortunes of his alma mater declined to be interviewed 
stating it was too soon for him to be talking to reporters 
my preference is to get my sleeves rolled up and get the cases 
going and then give interviews he said during one of the few 
intervals when he wasnt in a meeting or on the telephone last week 
a native of western pennsylvania mclucas graduated pennsylvania

thousands of individuals and families who 
thought they didnt qualify for a home mortgage might be pleasantly 
surprised by relatively recent developments in an old law 
those developments enable some wouldbe buyers to qualify for 
loans with minimum downpayments and less than the usual income 
requirements and to benefit from lower than normal closing costs 
the community reinvestment act was passed in 1977 but 
implementation on a large scale remained rather dormant until the 
past few years now it has been given a big push by congress and by 
privatesector institutions 
the latter however needed prodding themselves before they were 
convinced of the viability of the acts central theme which is to 
compel lenders to provide mortgage financing equitably in all areas 
of their communities 
implementation was delayed also by confusion among lenders by a 
failure of regulatory agencies to enforce compliance and simply by 
the effort needed to convince lenders that poor people could be 
good credit risks 
that educational effort was pushed largely by the national 
training amp information center a nonprofit chicagobased agency 
that trains community action groups in dealing with various social 
challenges 
a big breakthrough occurred in september when general electric 
capital corp developed a packaged program enabling laggard lenders 
to minimize risk in making loans to those who otherwise wouldnt 
qualify 
ge capital has signed up lenders throughout the country to offer 
the package which involves a buyer education program more 
flexible qualification criteria and mortgage insurance 
such loans then would qualify for sale by the lender to the 
federal national mortgage association or fannie mae and the 
federal home loan mortgage corp or freddie mac 
the package benefits borrowers in a various others ways among 
them 
they can designate a higher portion of their income 33 
percent to monthly housing expenses than the ratio 28 percent 
accepted for traditional financing 
the traditional cash reserve requirement of two monthly 
mortgage payments is waived 
if the borrower hasnt develped a credit history his or her 
payment record for expenses such as rent and utilities is 
acceptable in establishing credit worthiness 
in some instances subsidized second mortgages may be employed 
to reduce housing costs 
education is at the foundation of ges community home buyers 
program it involves four sessions of two hours each plus two 
followup sessions taught locally by the lenders personnel 
the course explains the roles of participants in the application 
and approval process the savings and income needed household 
budgeting credit reports home selection presale inspections and 
tax and equity advantages 
fortysix institutions covering the entire country have signed 
up for the package said jeannette bernay of ge capital in raleigh 
nc 
she said about 10000 borrowers will be accommodated in the 
initial phase of the program but that already there are hopes of 
expanding we think we can make money in this she said 
convincing lenders and regulatory officials that loans to the 
poor could be good business was a slow process however in some 
instances said tom schraw of the national training amp information 
center community leaders got action only by raising the threat of 
charter revocation 
good experience in chicago and st louis helped lenders there 
cooperated and helped establish a record in a fiveyear period 
said schraw chicago institutions lent 150 million with a default 
rate of less than 1 percent 
ge capitals entrance into the picture encouraged by such 
experiences now has given the effort a huge thrust since it 
provides lenders throughout the country with a turnkey program for 
compliance with the law 
mortgage guaranty insurance co is testing a somewhat similar 
program in milwaukee des moines and knoxville although that 
companys major effort is in customized work for individual lenders 
those interested in obtaining local lenders affiliated with the 
ge capital program may call the companys action center at

phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr 
testified thursday he doesnt know who in his real estate and 
thrift empire made the decision on a stock deal that stripped his 
lincoln savings and loan association of up to 12 million in 
potential profits 
testifying on his suit challenging the governments takeover 
last april of his irvine calif thrift keating said he 
personally had approved the oct 21 1987 repurchase of memorex 
stock at twice the price lincoln had sold it for four months 
earlier 
federal regulators have focused on the memorex deal and several 
related transactions with phoenix developer and stockbroker ernest 
c garcia as a centerpiece of their contention that keating was 
operating lincoln in an unsafe and unsound manner 
a central figure in the savings and loan crisis and a related 
congressional ethics scandal keating spent more than a hour 
thursday testifying about his use of lincoln to finance massive 
planned community projects in the phoenix area 
in its takeover and a related 11 billion fraud and 
racketeering suit against keating the government contends his use 
of federally insured deposits in lincoln to finance his dreams may 
eventually cost taxpayers up to 2 billion making it the biggest 
of nearly 600 sampl failures since 1986 
by losing the sampl we lost the ability to complete this 
program keating testified thursday the saddest thing in my 
life is that we were brought to this pass 
just two months ago keating had claimed a fifth amendment 
protection against selfincrimination in refusing to answer 
questions by the house banking committee saying through attorneys 
that he wanted a more objective forum for laying out his case 
the memorex deal was part of a series of interwoven transactions 
with garcia involving what the government says were sham land 
deals to book phony profits 
those profits enabled american continental to collect deferred 
taxes from lincoln on the deals the source of those tax dollars 
totaling 94 million between 1985 and 1988 regulators contend was 
actually federally insured deposits in lincoln no money was 
actually ever paid to the government as taxes 
justifying their takeover of lincoln the regulators contend 
that american continental usurped a corporate right and 
opportunity of the thrift to reap a 12 million profit in two 
purchases and two sales of the same memorex stock 
the memorex deals date back to december 1986 when lincoln 
acquired 79275 shares for 1 each as a sweetener to a purchase of 
40 million of junk bonds as part of british financier sir james 
goldsmiths attempt to take over the company 
lincoln which eventually made a 15 million profit on the junk 
bonds sold the stock in june 1987 to garcia for 1 million with 
an option to buy it back for a maximum price of 425 million 
during the next 18 months 
however when the stock market crashed in october 1987 garcia 
was in desperate need for cash keating testified and american 
continental purchased the memorex stock from him for 2 million 
six months later american continental sold the stock for 132 
million reaping a 12 million profit that the government says 
should have gone to lincoln 
keating testified that he was in europe when garcia wanted to 
sell the stock and that he approved having either american 
continental or lincoln buy it back 
i dont believe that i made the decision where to put it he 
said i dont know who made the decision on waiving the 
lincolns buyback option 
another reason that lincoln did not repurchase the stock 
keating said is that the thrift at the time was under tremendous 
pressure from the regulators not to be in the equity business 
his son charles h keating iii then chairman of a lincoln 
subsidiary that held the option testified earlier that he signed 
the waiver but had no detailed knowledge of the repurchase option 
and was not otherwise involved in the deal 
it was a large company and there were a lot of deals going 
on the younger keating said we have to rely on experts i 
would sign my name on something they did i had a lot of faith in 
these people i would stake my life on what they did 
the elder keating said he bought lincoln in 1984 after both the 
federal government and california deregulated the sampl industry so 
that thrifts could make direct investments in real estate 
previously the great bulk of an sampls investments had to be in 
home mortgages 
i saw the sampl as a place to do land development and housing 
he said ninety percent of what we do is housing you could do 
precisely what we did with lincoln at the time we bought it

twentyone former employees of charles h keating 
jrs phoenix hotels filed a 42 million lawsuit thursday against a 
federal official who fired them last fall in what their lawyer 
called an earlymorning gestapolike raid 
the lawsuit filed in maricopa county superior court claims the 
workers were fired improperly treated like common criminals 
and refused severance pay or references in many instances 
named as defendants were herbert chin a senior investigations 
specialist with the federal resolution trust corps regional 
office in denver and three former keating companies that are now 
controlled by the rtc 
chin in a telephone interview said he had not seen the lawsuit 
but believed his actions were proper 
the suit does not name the federal government itself but could 
be amended later to include the government according to kraig 
marton the lawyer who filed it 
the hotels the phoenician and the crescent are owned by 
companies that are 55 percent owned by lincoln savings and loan 
association and 45 percent by a group of saudi arabian investors 
keating controlled lincoln until federal banking regulators 
seized control last year saying the thrift was in danger of 
collapse 
keating remained in control of the two hotels as long as the 
saudis sided with him however and it was not until nov 16 that 
the federal regulators won agreement from the saudis and seized 
control of the hotels 
they moved in at 2 am posting termination notices at the 
homes of the employees and allowing them to collect their 
belongings from the hotels under guard and while being videotaped 
by guards and news organizations 
chin said that the regulators picked 2 am as the time to fire 
the workers in order to minimize disruption and that extra security 
and videotapes were meant to ensure that no one later claimed to be 
missing property 
but marton alleges in his lawsuit that the way the firings were 
handled caused great emotional distress 
the government made it look like the fired workers were so 
dishonest as to require a large body of guards many armed and in 
uniform to be present and treated them like common criminals 
as the media recorded the events marton said 
marton also said in his suit that chin and the companies under 
rtc control fired the workers without sufficient cause refused to 
give many of them severance pay and refused to provide job 
references 
chin said he did not believe most of the workers had contracts 
specifying what was needed in order to justify a firing he also 
said he believed all the fired clerical workers had been given 
severance pay and that the workers should seek job references from 
the keating group rather than the government

howeyinthehills fla ap us agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter bluntly told his counterpart from japan on thursday 
that japan would have to cooperate with the rest of the world in 
removing protectionist barriers to trade according to yeutter and 
others at the conference 
yeutters comments at the gathering of agricultural leaders from 
five of the worlds top foodproducing areas were in response to 
the japanese position that rice and other farm products vital to 
that nation should be exempt from the more liberal trade policies 
sought by other nations 
the japanese have for years closed off or severely restricted 
certain imports particularly agricultural products because of 
their professed need to be selfsufficient 
michihiko kano japans minister of agriculture forestry and 
fisheries led a 1 hour discussion on the subject at an informal 
closeddoor gathering of agricultural leaders from japan the us 
the european community canada and australia 
we have to have a lot of debate with japan over that 
yeutter told reporters afterwards 
the informal sessions at central florida hotel are being held in 
the final year of the socalled uruguay round of negotiations for 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade the international 
organization based in geneva ninetysix member nations of gatt 
have presented position papers on a wide range of issues and 
negotiations are at a crucial stage 
after the agreements are hammered out at the end of this year 
member countries will pass enabling legislation to enact the new 
gatt policies 
also a major issue in the first session of the twoday gathering 
described as the first of a series of casual gettogethers was 
food safety 
the ministers agreed to draft a crisismanagement plan on 
foodsafety issues once canada and other participants develop more 
information and details on it 
there were no real fireworks but there were lively 
discussions said a member of the canadian delegation kanos 
presentation provoked the most comment 
the japanese want 100 percent selfsufficiency on rice and 
perhaps on other products yeutter said meaning that japan wants 
to continue shutting the door on imports of those products 
we could make the same argument on industrial products such 
as automobiles and television sets and limit exports of those to 
this country he said 
this is not a oneway street japan cannot make protectionist 
arguments on agriculture and expect liberalization arguments to 
prevail in the industrial sector or viceversa 
yeutter said there has to be a common understanding in some 
areas and what that means is that japan will have to find a way 
to be accommodating on rice just as well have to find a way to 
be accommodating in product areas where japan and other countries 
wish to expand exports to the united states 
ray macsharry representing the 12member european community 
said he was philosophically in agreement with the japanese over the 
selfsufficiency issue 
we do see food security as an important issue along the lines 
the japanese propose macsharry said the us seems to be very 
strong on access to the japanese market for rice 
officials said there was general agreement to a presentation by 
canadian agriculture minister donald f mazankowski that there was 
a great need for a coordinated crisis management plan on food 
safety 
the problems created by the cyanide scare on chilean grapes and 
the emotional debate over the use of the chemical alar on apples 
make it mandatory that the countries involved in farm production 
communicate better with each other and with consumers mazankowski 
was quoted as saying 
another example cited by yeutter of a problem that such a 
crisismanagement plan could prevent or quickly solve was the 
korean claim last summer that florida growers were using alar on 
citrus 
the koreans halted imports of thousands of tons of florida 
grapefruit causing heavy losses to producers until the industry 
could persuade the koreans that alar was never used on citrus
