the deputy defense minister denied 
monday that hungary was involved in selling advanced soviet 
military technology to the united states as alleged in a published 
report 
the state mti news agency said the newspaper mai nap quoted 
brig gen ferenc szombathelyi as saying in an interview published 
monday as far as hungary is concerned i am positive that the 
hungarian military authorities did nothing which could have 
endangered our national integrity 
defense ministry spokesman col gyoergy keleti told mti that 
soviet military technological means and secrets could not have 
been supplied from hungary 
he said hungary never had the most modern soviet military 
equipment that the standard of military technology here lagged 
behind the most uptodate soviet technology by up to 10 years mti 
reported 
the washington post quoting unidentified intelligence 
sources in washington and abroad said in sundays editions that 
the united states secretly bought advanced soviet military 
technology from romania for 10 years prior to the december 
revolution that ousted dictator nicolae ceausescu 
ceausescu was executed on christmas day 
the newspaper said the romanian connection was part of a larger 
weaponsbuying operation that allowed the us military to obtain 
important components of soviet air defense systems 
it quoted its sources as saying the united states paid more than 
250 million the past 10 years to obtain the latest versions of 
sovietmade weapons systems through contacts in other east bloc 
countries including hungary 
asked if he considered the washington post article a mere 
slander szombathelyi was quoted as replying as far as hungary 
is concerned it definitely is 
but he was quoted as adding that a thorough inquiry would be 
launched into the matter and that a parliamentary inquiry was also 
expected 
mai nap said szombathelyi responded when asked how moscow 
counterintelligence could have been unaware of the reportedly 
extensive operation that is exactly why i consider these 
allegations pure nonsense 
he was said to have added however that that everything is 
possible in trade 
the washington post report said the democratization of eastern 
europe had disrupted the broader operation but not stopped it

a fundamentalist moslem guerrilla 
leader threatened to fight against any superpower deal to end the 
12yearold struggle to oust afghanistans promoscow government 
gulbuddin hekmatyar firebrand leader of hezbiislami or party 
of islam has vowed to launch a jihad or holy war if a dealis 
worked out at this months ussoviet summit in washington 
the afghan war is expected to figure prominently in talks 
beginning may 30 between president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the superpowers have agreed to prevent the formation of an 
islamic government in afghanistan said abdul qadir karyab who 
heads hekmatyars politicial committee 
we will not only continue our jihad on the battlefield but we 
also have other ways should the superpowers interfere in our 
internal affairs karyab told the associated press 
western diplomats and afghan experts in islamabad have hinted 
the superpowers are close to a deal but decline to give any 
specific details 
the likeliest scenario they said was have elections in 
afghanistan run jointly by the united nations and the organization 
of the islamic conference or by a neutral group chosen by the two 
organizations 
but they also warned it will be very difficult to find a 
political solution acceptable to both the rebels and the afghan 
government 
afghan president najibullah has refused to step down prior to 
elections a precondition set by even the most moderate guerrilla 
groups headquartered in pakistans rugged frontier city of peshawar 
the guerrillas have come under increasing pressure particularly 
from the united states to end their internal rivalries and devise 
a political settlement to the war 
but the seven guerrilla groups are deeply divided the president 
of the guerrillas selfproclaimed governmentinexile 
sibghatullah mojaddidi has branded hekmatyar a murderer and 
accused him of killing more innocent afghans than soviet or afghan 
soldiers 
karyab said the hezbiislami would consider imposing its will 
on the other guerrilla groups 
if they cant agree with our reasonable proposals we have our 
unreasonable ways he said refusing to elaborate 
hekmatyar is also feuding with burhanuddin rabbani leader of 
the powerful jamiatiislami or society of islam the two have 
traded threats and accusations of murder kidnapping and theft 
hekmatyar who is strongly antiwestern fought ferociously 
against the soviets and received the lions share of us military 
assistance during the 12yearold war 
karyab said washington now fears hekmatyars strength in 
afghanistan 
as far as i can see the united states has very dangerous 
plans including certain activity even terrorist acts against the 
hezbiislami leader karyab said 
the united states sends 500 million a year in aid to the 
guerrillas while the soviet union gives an estimated 5 billion a 
year to the kabul government

scientists say they may have found the 
approximate location of a second defective gene that promotes 
alzheimers disease a possible step toward a treatment 
the work which follows a 1987 report of one such genetic 
defect sort of shines a flashlight on a new area to pursue 
said researcher dr allen d roses of the duke university medical 
center in durham nc 
the new work focused on a form of alzheimers that runs in 
families and strikes at an average age of about 69 said roses the 
genetic defect located earlier was associated with alzheimers that 
strikes at a younger age 
alzheimers is a progressive degenerative disorder that attacks 
the brain and impairs memory thinking and behavior some 44 
million americans are affected most of them older than 65 
according to the alzheimers association no cause or cure is known 
roses reported the new study last week at the annual meeting of 
the american academy of neurology 
in a telephone interview monday he said it is not clear what 
percentage of alzheimers cases is accounted for by the form of the 
disease the researchers studied 
but he said that his findings might be applicable to socalled 
sporadic cases of alzheimers 
the new work was aimed at finding a location for a second gene 
among the bodys 23 pairs of chromosomes 
the results suggest a very high likelihood that a defective 
gene conferring susceptibility to lateonset familial alzheimers 
resides in a portion of the chromosome numbered 19 roses said 
in 1987 other researchers said they had found evidence that a 
gene or genes in a region of chromosome 21 was linked to a form of 
alzheimers that strikes before age 65 
alzheimers researcher gerard schellenberg of the university of 
washington in seattle said monday that while he has not seen a 
final report of the new work it appears to be extremely 
interesting and worth more investigation by a standard 
statistical measure the strength of the evidence is quite strong 
he said 
the work was done by studying genetic material from 258 members 
of 28 families that included cases of lateonset familial 
alzheimers 
researchers essentially used three locations on chromosome 19 as 
signposts and analyzed their data to check the likelihood that an 
alzheimers gene lay near those locations

an heir to the du pont chemical fortune who 
was found mentally incompetent after he gave money to political 
extremist lyndon larouche goes to court this week seeking to prove 
he is fit to manage his own affairs 
lewis du pont smith 33 heir to about 10 million is due to 
appear tuesday in common pleas court before chester county judge 
lawrence e wood it will mark the latest development in a 
5yearold squabble pitting smith against his parents 
i have never had any mental illness or a breakdown in my 
life smith said in an interview i hope with this petition 
that will be cleared up once and for all 
david foulke the attorney for smiths parents e newbold and 
margaret du pont smith of paoli said family members will testify 
against him 
they dont have to but a couple of them will he said 
im not sure who will yet i dont want to get into that at this 
time 
on one side the wealthy du pont clan believes smith is being 
influenced by larouche on the other smith says the family is 
irked because they dont approve of his political beliefs 
relations between smith and his family soured after he gave 
larouche 212000 for what smith said was to benefit a publishing 
venture 
smiths parents argued in court that his association with 
larouche indicated his inability to handle his money and in 
november 1985 wood ordered that the familyowned wilmington trust 
co monitor smiths spending 
since that ruling larouche has been convicted on conspiracy 
mailandtax fraud charges stemming from political fundraising and 
is serving a 15year federal sentence 
smith said he hasnt given any money to larounche since 1985 but 
still considers himself a supporter he is running for congress as 
an independent and his advertising cites larouche as the worlds 
leading physical economist and smith continues to argue that his 
family is wrong about larouche 
lyndon larouche was best man at my wedding but he has no 
magical powers over me smith said i have no intentions of 
throwing away or giving away my fortune to lyndon larouche this 
whole thing is so ridiculous 
he notes that under the order taking away his control over his 
total fortune he is allowed 15000 a month or 180000 a year 
if im competent to manage 180000 a year that seems to be 
an inconsistency he said 
through a series of appeals and hearings smith has repeatedly 
asked the judge to reconsider his ruling and each time wood has 
refused 
over the objections of his family wood did agree to validate 
smiths marriage in december 1986 to 25yearold andrea diano of 
south philadelphia 
the hearing coming up this week will be the first at which smith 
actually takes the stand to testify it really hurts he said 
im nervous about testifying but my life is riding on this 
foulke countered that the family believes lewis is mentally 
ill and it is in his best interest that the guardianship be 
continued 
meanwhile smith is waging a political campaign to get himself 
elected to the 5th district congressional seat the district 
includes philadelphia suburbs to the west and north 
in order to run against incumbent rep dick schulze rpa in 
the november election smith must collect 3000 signatures on 
election petitions by august he will run as an independent 
he said the campaign is going extremely well and expects to 
gather far more than the minimum number of signatures needed the 
people know me well they smell blood and their rooting for the 
underdog 
smith has bought blocks of time on six philadelphiaarea radio 
stations to broadcast messages in support of independence for the 
soviet republic of lithuania the air time reportedly cost an 
estimated 6000 to 8000 a week 
he also has run newspaper advertising my fiveyear long 
association with the worlds leading physical economist lyndon h 
larouche jr the only economist to forecast the october 1987 stock 
market crash five months before it occurred will enable me to 
bring a degree of economic expertise to washington that is 
otherwise sorely lacking he said in an ad last month in the 
daily local news of west chester 
it is high time that the american citizenry took it upon 
itself to sweep the economic incompetents that dominate the us 
congress out of washington dc

central america has achieved neither 
peace nor complete democracy through the pact president oscar arias 
drafted in 1987 but has taken steps toward both and is poised for 
more 
arias who ends his fouryear term tuesday and hands the 
presidency to rafael calderon wants to see the isthmus 
demilitarized and its 28 million inhabitants achieve full human and 
political rights in this decade 
his departure marks the symbolic end of the group of five 
presidents who set a region embroiled in wars on a path toward 
peace arias won the 1987 nobel peace prize for leading the effort 
former president jose napoleon duarte of el salvador died of 
cancer feb 23 jose azcona hoyo of honduras left office in january 
and daniel ortega of nicaragua surrendered power last month after 
an upset loss to violetta barrios de chamorro 
in a region known for coups and revolutions all were replaced 
in free elections 
the fifth president who signed the peace plan in 1987 is vinicio 
cerezo of guatemala scheduled to leave office in january 1991 
after elections later this year 
arias feels the central american gains could be diminished or 
erased unless economic development accompanies democratization 
it will not be possible to consolidate the democracies that 
have emerged in central america unless were successful in the 
economic and social fields he said in an interview this is 
the great challenge if the democracies dont deliver the goods we 
will not end the decade with democratic regimes 
rodrigo madrigal nieto his foreign minister said in a separate 
interview if a person lives in misery liberty loses its 
meaning 
costa rica is relatively prosperous but misery abounds in the 
four other nations between it and mexico 
depressing statistics of life expectancy infant mortality 
literacy and access to potable water make the region one of the 
worlds most desperate 
arias sees his country the areas showcase of civic culture as 
a model for the others costa rica abolished its armed forces 41 
years ago and has lived in peace and democracy since 
the decade of the 90s must be the decade of disarmament if we 
want greater development he said costa rica buys tractors 
while the rest of central america buys tanks tractors produce 
food tanks do not 
the gap between the rich northern nations and the poor 
southern ones continues to widen rich countries financial 
commitments to poor countries are not increasing so we must depend 
more on internal savings we must dedicate our resources to the 
satisfaction of our peoples needs and not to buying arms 
the highest remaining hurdle for the arias plan is el salvador 
where a 10yearold civil war continues to claim lives and spread 
destruction 
leftist rebels and representatives of president alfredo 
cristianis usbacked government are to resume peace talks this 
month negotiations broke off late in 1989 after two fruitless 
sessions 
rebel leaders say they want to abandon armed struggle for 
political action but also call cristianis government little more 
than a civilian facade for a military regime that grossly violates 
human rights 
insurgent demands include a purge of rights abusers from the 
armed forces and reform of the judicial and electoral systems 
arias and foreign minister madrigal say recent changes in 
eastern europe and as arias put it the end of the cold war 
make a propitious time for the salvadoran talks 
neither the government nor rebels appears to have substantially 
modified positions that led to stalemate last year however 
moving nicaraguas election ahead to february and an internal 
agreement to end its civil war are the firmest results of the arias 
plan so far 
a pact signed by usbacked contra rebels the sandinista army 
and mrs chamorros antisandinista government commits the contras 
to disband by june 10 but peace is not assured 
several thousand contras are assembled in five internationally 
monitored security zones inside nicaragua 
contra commanders have made tough demands of mrs chamorro 
principally that sandinistas be purged from ranking positions in 
the army and police and express readiness to resume battle 
otherwise 
honduras lost a great burden in april when thousands of contras 
based there for years abandoned their camps and returned to 
nicaragua but consolidation of democracy in both honduras and 
guatemala is proving slow and difficult 
their armed forces retain independent power far beyond that 
afforded the military in true democracies corruption and drug 
trafficking threaten to undermine progress toward modern democratic 
systems 
we cannot say the peace plan has been a success that peace 
and democracy have been established madrigal said but we have 
made notable advances and i see a new attitude that favors further 
progress 
he spoke of the other countries where dictatorships were the 
norm for most of this century as advancing along a sort of 
democratic scale 
before they were at zero he said now they are at 10 or 
15 theyre far from 100 but it is inevitable that they will 
continue to advance some in the short term others will take 
longer 
the arias plan provides for a central american parliament to 
present a united voice to the world ironically it is delayed 
because the costa rican legislature has yet to approve 
arias described the reluctance as an idiotic superiority 
complex many costa rican legislators argue that an established 
democracy should not get involved in such a regional project with 
less democratic governments

the goddess of democracy radio ship is headed 
for troubled waters on its mission to broadcast prodemocracy 
messages to china risking retaliation from beijing and raising 
tensions in the region 
the 1200ton ship outfitted by chinese dissidents set sail 
from france in march and began the last leg of its journey thursday 
after picking up provisions in singapore 
it is expected to reach international waters off china in about 
two weeks to begin broadcasting 
chinese officials who sent the army into tiananmen square to 
crush the prodemocracy movement in june 1989 have refused to rule 
out using force to stop the ship 
analysts believe china probably will jam the goddess of 
democracys broadcasts and may direct its navy to board the ship 
seize its equipment and make arrests 
one diplomat said on condition of anonymity that the chinese 
might try to incapacitate the vessel by ramming it what action 
international law would allow on the high seas was unclear he 
added 
xu tianfang deputy secretary of the parisbased boat for china 
foundation the projects main organizer said from taipei he could 
not predict whether china would use force 
we have sent journalists on board the ship and they will be 
the witnesses if any such action occurs he said 
using force against the ship probably would lead to 
confrontation between china and several governments the goddess of 
democracy is registered in st vincent and the grenadines has a 
french crew and carries western journalists 
the chinese have pressured nearby governments to refuse 
assistance to the ship the taiwan stock market fell for three 
straight days after china accused the island of open 
provocation by offering help to the vessel 
as taiwan became increasingly jittery goddess of democracy 
organizers said they would seek permission to call at hong kong on 
chinas southeastern coast to take on provisions 
officials of the british crown colony which reverts to chinese 
sovereignty in 1997 are extremely sensitive about relations with 
beijing and announced thursday the ship would not be allowed in its 
waters 
chu yungchuan of taiwans communications ministry said friday 
the ship would be allowed to dock at the northern port of keelung 
unless his ministry received orders otherwise so far the 
government has indicated the goddess of democracy could take on 
provisions 
an independent legislator announced plans to organize a flotilla 
of fishing boats to escort the vessel when it approaches the island 
a defense ministry spokesman maj gen wei chiaching has said 
the taiwan military would protect the vessel if it came under 
attack within taiwans defense zone an area he refused to 
define 
the timing could not be worse for taiwan which is experiencing 
a thaw in its historically chilly relations with the communist 
government in beijing 
tension across the 100milewide taiwan strait has eased 
dramatically in recent years accompanied by increasing trade and 
travel 
secretarygeneral hu chichiang of the anticommunist league a 
semiofficial group said 70 private taiwan organizations had 
decided to withhold donations to the ship 
we absolutely support the ship but we dont want to see 
tension increase because of our support he said 
threats from beijing also forced organizers to abandon the 
possibility of having chinese dissident leaders who escaped to the 
west such as wuer kaixi and chai ling broadcast from the vessel 
xu said there would be no dissidents on the ship but refused to 
say who would make the broadcasts 
the goddess of democracy which left france on march 17 is 
named for a statue erected by prodemocracy demonstrators in 
tiananmen square in may 1989 before the military crackdown in 
which hundreds perhaps thousands were killed

leaders of congress say serious budget 
negotiations with the white house now appear likely with 
everything on the table including the possibility of new taxes 
the leaders left the white house sunday night after a private 
90minute meeting with president bush saying they would be back for 
more talks with the president after consulting with other lawmakers 
they said they discussed no specifics with bush but established 
that whatever negotiations take place will be without preconditions 
house speaker tom foley asked if things now were on track for 
fullscale budget negotiations said i think thats going to be 
the outcome 
asked if bush stood ready to drop his nonewtaxes pledge foley 
said no specifics were discussed but he added the assumption is 
that all matters would be on the table that we would not enter any 
talks with preconditions 
senate majority leader george mitchell said there was a 
general agreement that any discussions will be without 
preconditions if and when they occur 
senate minority leader bob dole said the lawmakers expect to 
meet again with bush late tuesday after conferring with colleagues 
including leaders of the key budget and taxwriting committees 
the white house had no comment on the talks deputy spokesman 
stephen hart said 
house minority leader bob michel also took part in the unusual 
90minute session in bushs private residence the talks took place 
after bush the congressional leaders and 200 other guests attended 
a lecture on theodore roosevelts presidency by author david 
mccullough 
the full house and senate budget committees approved democratic 
versions of the 1991 budget last week 
congress and the white house have made repeated efforts in 
recent years to forge grand compromises on the deficit most have 
fallen short of expectations 
congress has ignored the 12 trillion budget blueprint that 
bush submitted jan 29 that budget was supposed to meet the 
grammrudman target of a deficit no larger than 64 billion for 
fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
sluggish economic growth and rising interest rates have driven 
up the deficit since then 
foley said he expects more lasting results this time 
all of us who took part in this meeting today feel that we 
need a major and meaningful effort that has been somewhat lacking 
for various reasons in past years to narrow the deficit for next 
year and over several years the speaker said 
i think theres goodwill on all sides in attempting to deal 
with the fiscal problems the country faces said foley were 
going to i think find a way to deal effectively with them 
bush was joined at the meeting by white house chief of staff 
john sununu budget director richard darman and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady brady came directly from talks on capitol hill with 
finance ministers from the group of seven nations the other major 
western democracies 
the 1990 deficit was supposed to be 99 billion under a budget 
deal that bush and congress struck in april 1989 but that has been 
undone by higher spending and slower than expected growth of tax 
revenues now the nonpartisan congressional budget office expects 
the 1990 shortfall to reach 159 billion up from 152 billion in 
1989

life is a slow tedious limbo at a place called 
krome and tempers are short and getting shorter 
krome the krome service processing center is where newcomers 
from haiti and other countries await word on their future in the 
united states 
many people pass through the fencedin holding center but most 
are haitian refugees some with stories to tell of alleged abuse 
and neglect at the hands of the us immigration and naturalization 
service 
miamis haitian community is generally considered peaceful but 
on april 29 more than 1000 haitians demonstrated outside krome 
tearing at its fences after years of seeing their countrymen locked 
up while others go free 
we want freedom and justice for the haitian refugees and all 
the refugees detained said the rev gerard jeanjuste a haitian 
community leader we must break down the walls of krome which 
reminds us of hitlerism 
on average twothirds of the centers 400 or so residents are 
haitians they are picked up at the airport with fake passports and 
visas or plucked from rickety boats by the coast guard while trying 
to slip into the united states 
arrivals at krome a former missile base on the steamy edge of 
the everglades 25 miles west of miami are dressed in orange 
uniforms and given medical exams and then they wait 
the most horrible part of this place is time said nuhu 
aminu 35 a tv production specialist from nigeria 
the average stay at krome is 18 months sometimes more than two 
years detainees wait to learn whether they will be deported or 
released 
the one thing people kind of lose sight of is that we dont go 
out and try to shanghai these people krome administrator 
constance weiss said theyre here because they attempted to 
break the law 
in affidavits many signed with encoded names to avoid 
reprisals krome detainees have told of experiences far more 
horrible than agonized waiting women have said they are sexually 
abused and harassed by guards 
the krome officers often told the male detainees at krome that 
they had sex with the female detainees they bragged about this and 
laughed and thought it was real great said chantale pierre a 
former detainee who now lives in miami 
men and women have complained of beatings and restricted access 
to telephones and bathrooms haitian detainees say latins get 
preferential treatment 
detainees say they often arent given enough time to eat their 
meals and have charged that an aspirin substitute is given for any 
complaint 
on many occasions we are physically abused one detainee 
said since we are scared and dont speak english we keep 
quiet 
the allegations angered many in the haitian community sparking 
the april 29 demonstration that ended with no arrests and the 
retreat of the protesters 
the allegations have stirred up ins officials two of whom 
visited krome on april 24 shortly afterward the agency announced 
the additions of two more immigration judges and 27 guards to 
improve conditions and speed up the wait 
on may 1 the ins began an alreadyplanned test program under 
which about 200 detainees will be released in miami los angeles 
new york and san francisco they must meet certain conditions 
including having what appears to be a good case for asylum and a 
source of income or support posting a bond of 500 to 2500 and 
agreeing in writing to surrender for deportation if ordered 
the justice department is looking into allegations of abuse at 
krome because of the investigation miami ins director richard 
smith and krome officials would not comment on the detainees 
complaints 
meanwhile life at krome drags on 
detainees spend their days cleaning their quarters watching 
television playing volleyball or basketball outside or lounging 
under shelters men and women cluster at the 10foot fences that 
keep them apart 
sometimes we stay in bed think about everything said a 
haitian who asked that her name not be revealed think about your 
country think about your family we suffer 
detainees also take classes they can work toward high school 
equivalency diplomas learn english or study crafts such as 
ceramics and sewing some work earning a dollar a day as laborers 
at the camp 
sick detainees go to a clinic with an emergency room and xray 
and dental facilities mental health professionals also are on duty 
detainess watch video movies mostly in english every night 
weiss said 
one thing you have to do is keep yourself together said 
detto bilkerdyk who works in the krome sign shop a former 
military policeman from suriname he said he left home fearing for 
his life after refusing orders to commit executions 
if they deport me back home i know im dead he said

republican james mcclures decision to 
retire from the us senate has set up a struggle between two 
wouldbe successors in a plot straight from a frank capra movie 
jim jones a plucky populist attorney general with almost no 
cash or campaign staff is giving fiveterm congressman larry craig 
a spirited but possibly futile run for his money in the may 22 
republican primary 
ive always been an underdog in my political races said 
jones who ran for the house twice before winning the states top 
legal office in 1982 its a role that i dont mind you have to 
try harder 
craig 44 is campaigning on his record and generally playing 
the role of the cautious veteran politician above the fray 
jones 47 is cast as the scrappy nothingtolose challenger 
with a folksy accessible style and independent agenda 
ive got more courage and innovation than craig has jones 
said hes been in congress for 10 years and has done very 
little 
the craig campaign is a juggernaut fueled by essentially the 
same field and fundraising organization that made mcclure all but 
unbeatable for three house and three senate terms mcclure 
however has made no formal endorsement 
through the first three months of the year craig had built up a 
war chest of 260000 while spending 135000 jones had received 
contributions of less than 19000 and most of it was quickly spent 
the winner of the gop primary is expected to face boise 
businessman ron twilegar in november twilegar 46 is a former 
state senate minority leader who faces token opposition in the 
democratic primary 
while craig is the heavy favorite there is a perception he 
remains a relatively untested and possibly thinskinned campaigner 
with a formal somewhat stiff manner 
democrats had to scramble to find replacement candidates to 
challenge him when the 1984 nominee died in a car accident and the 
frontrunner in the partys 1986 primary was killed in a plane 
crash 
the implication irks craig 
ive won but ive worked hard in each case he said 
with a network of volunteers in every county craig contends he 
has made quick progress in heavily republican eastern and southern 
idaho where most of the partys statewide primaries are decided 
weve spent a lot of time there and i may run very well in 
the south and southeast better than i had anticipated he said 
im finding the support for jim jones there is very soft 
if true that may be partially a result of jones lack of money 
for major advertising in a farflung state where key markets are 
separated by mountains and hundreds of miles 
jones has tried to get his message out through news conferences 
and personal appearances usually traveling alone his primary 
focus has been on pocketbook issues such as consumer protection 
possible pricing collusion in the oil and meatpacking industries 
and action needed to reduce the federal budget deficit 
jones has tried to undercut craigs position as a primary 
sponsor of a proposed balanced budget amendment to the us 
constitution over the past 10 years jones contends craig has 
continually weakened it to the point where its meaningless in an 
effort to get more cosponsors 
jones knows his kind of underfinanced oneman campaign has not 
succeeded in idaho since democrat glen taylor known as the 
singing cowboy won a senate seat in 1944 but he remains 
optimistic 
its a disadvantage but its something that can be overcome 
by just sheer determination hard work and free publicity and ive 
been pretty good over the years in generating coverage he said 
craig is clearly ahead but he wont reveal the results of his 
own polling he credits organization but chafes at jones 
contention it was inherited from mcclure 
i inherited nothing craig said jim mcclure did not call 
anyone or ask anyone to work on my behalf i did it myself

andrei sakharov the late soviet physicist and 
human rights champion wrote that his life and work in many ways 
paralleled the violence repression and eventually the reforms that 
have swept his homeland 
excerpts from sakharovs memoirs appeared in the sunday times of 
london in advance of british publication in july 
he died in moscow on dec 14 at age 68 after a heart attack 
the book titled memoirs will be published in june in the 
united states by alfred a knopf inc excerpts also will appear in 
time magazines may 14 and may 21 issues 
sakharov who endured years of persecution by soviet authorities 
but was mourned as a hero and visionary recalled the awe and fear 
he felt when he heard of the atomic bombing of hiroshima by the 
united states in 1945 
i was so stunned that my legs practically gave way wrote 
sakharov who was considered the father of his own countrys 
hydrogen bomb 
there could be no doubt that my fate and the fate of many 
others perhaps of the entire world had changed overnight he 
said in the sunday times excerpts something new and awesome had 
entered our lives a product of the greatest of the sciences of 
the discipline i revered 
in the time excerpts he wrote of the tragedy cruelty and 
terror of the era of his childhood the 1920s and early 1930s 
and remembered the stalinist repression that left parents afraid to 
speak freely before their children 
this reluctance to reveal ones thoughts even to ones own son 
may be the most haunting sign of those times he wrote 
later sakharovs calls for political reforms presaged many of 
the changes under soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who 
allowed sakharov to return to moscow in 1986 after nearly seven 
years of internal exile in the city of gorky 
in the memoirs sakharov said that after world war ii when he 
was made a member of igor tamms topsecret team developing the 
hbomb at the physics institute of the soviet academy of sciences 
nobody asked if i wanted to take part i had no real choice 
but the concentration total absorption and energy that i 
brought to the task were my own he recalled in the sunday times 
exceprts 
i understood the terrifying inhuman nature of the weapons we 
were building he wrote but the recent war had also been an 
exercise in barbarity 
it was sakharovs call for a worldwide nuclear test ban in the 
late 1950s that first brought him into conflict with soviet 
authorities 
during the last three decades of his life he fought against the 
jailing of innocent people for free emigration and for disarmament 
and other causes 
he said he was not convinced that mutual assured nuclear 
destruction had truly helped to keep the peace 
thermonuclear weapons could end human civilization they have 
become so frightening that the very thought of using them seems 
unreal their credibility as a deterrent has thus decreased while 
their threat has increased enormously he wrote 
the first extract from sakharovs memoirs dealt mainly with his 
being sent to internal exile in 1980 for criticizing soviet 
intervention in afghanistan

the farmers home administration has written 
off nearly onethird of 88 billion owed by delinquent borrowers 
and says there is an increase in foreclosure activity to collect 
the rest 
as of march 31 reports by the agriculture department agency 
show that proceedings were initiated against 4110 farmers in the 
first six months of the fiscal year that began oct 1 that 
compared with 5002 in all of the 1989 fiscal year and 1459 in 
1988 
agency officials say the trend is expected to continue at least 
through the rest of this year 
spokeswoman marlyn aycock said that 75352 collection notices 
were sent out beginning in late 1988 and that 32584 were resolved 
by being paid off brought up to date or otherwise settled 
but that left more than 42000 overdue loans still hanging fire 
many of those have been appealed or are in some kind of mediation 
with the agency 
the fmha often is called the governments farm lender of last 
resort and eligible borrowers cannot qualify for loans from 
commercial lenders 
procedures for collecting and servicing fmha loans were refined 
by congress in the agricultural credit act of 1987 including 
requirements that collectors tell delinquent borrowers about 
various liberalized debtserving options available 
the law also provided for writedowns and writeoffs of loans in 
cases where collection costs would exceed the recovery value in 
many cases fmha had made loans far in excess of the eventual value 
of a farmers assets 
land values the main asset of farmers plummeted in the 1980s 
and wiped out much of the collateral worth held by borrowers as a 
result many wound up owing a bundle without sufficient net worth or 
cash flow 
aycock said that as of nov 30 the most recent tabulation 
about 796 million had been written down an average of 172857 on 
4608 loans in these cases loans were reduced to the current 
value of the collateral 
similarly 5029 borrowers were allowed to buy out their 
loans at current liquidation values this writeoff amounted to 
more than 103 billion an average of 205674 
the excused debts have included nearly 100 individuals who each 
have had fmha loans reduced or written off by 1 million or more 
aycock said that 933 million in old debt also has been written 
off by fmha as uncollectable those involve 6341 deadend 
accounts some going back 10 years or more 
the number of potential foreclosures is indicated by 
acceleration letters sent to thousands of delinquent borrowers 
the acceleration process is a major step toward final closeout of 
an fmha loan through foreclosure 
another indicator the next step is the number of accelerated 
cases referred to usda lawyers to await formal foreclosure action 
by the government 
by comparison the number of actual foreclosures by the agency 
those that have gone through final settlement is relatively 
small but those also are beginning to increase 
so far this fiscal year the records showed 107 foreclosure 
actions completed plus 113 by banks and other lienholders that 
share loans with the agency 
that compared with only 45 foreclosures by fmha and 258 by other 
lienholders in fiscal 1989 in 1988 fmha foreclosed on 58 
borrowers and other lienholders 504 
but foreclosures arent the only way fmha can collect what is 
owed nor are foreclosures the only reason for farmers to go out of 
business 
pressure by fmha can result in the sale of property in which 
case the debt is often settled or voluntary transfer of property 
to the agency as part of a settlement deal 
although the fmha records are still sketchy figures for the 
first half of fiscal 1990 show that the pace of those who are 
quitting the farm due to financial difficulties of all types 
is increasing 
in fiscal 1988 3159 fmha farm borrowers quit because of 
financial trouble that represented 13 percent of the agencys 
total number of farm borrowers in 1989 the number dropped to 
2046 who left farming or 09 percent of the agencys borrowers 
so far this year according to firsthalf figures 1314 
farmers or 06 percent of the fmhas 218000 farm borrowers have 
quit the land that would be an annual rate of 12 percent if the 
pace continues the remainder of the year

political passions have come alive in 
romania after decades of repression and their target is often 
interim president ion iliesco seen by critics as a communist agent 
in liberal disguise 
a roundtheclock rally by iliescus foes which began sixteen 
days ago has transformed downtown university square into what the 
demonstrators call a communistfree zone 
iliescu was a high official under dictator nicolae ceausescu 
who was overthrown and executed in december but fell out of favor 
and was given relatively unimportant party jobs he gained 
prominence during the revolution when the national salvation front 
was formed to run the government 
up to 10000 people have filled the square to applaud speakers 
from national figures to workers who demand that iliescu resign 
about 40 tents have been pitched around the square and 57 
protesters are on a hunger strike 
supporters of iliescu have held at least one rally and rumors 
persist of plans for an attack on the university square protest 
knots of people form around university square every day to argue 
about iliescu and the elections scheduled for may 20 which will be 
the first free vote for romanians in 50 years 
people here in the square hate iliescu because he wants us to 
live in darkness a woman shouted thrusting her chin toward a 
supporter of the president who retorted he doesnt want to keep 
romania in darkness he wants to create a bright romania 
another woman swept an arm toward the crowd in the square and 
asked how can romania become a prosperous country if people 
camp outside like this without working 
on april 29 tens of thousands of people demonstrated against 
iliescu in timisoara dej and the port city of constanta 
timisoara in western romania was where the uprising against 
ceausecu began 
in rural romania horse carts still are the principal mode of 
transport and people wait up to a week for telephone calls to or 
from abroad many have no access to television cannot read 
newspapers and accept rumors as fact 
is it true that revolution has broken out in the capital 
asked a gypsy woman openly selling black market cigarettes in 
tecuci a moldavian town 150 miles northeast of bucharest 
moldavia has been relatively quiet but there is a surge of 
nationalism among moldavians across the soviet border which was 
opened for six hours of visafree travel on sunday 
vasile dogaru deputy mayor of iasi the cultural capital of 
moldavia said moldavians in romania seek no more than increased 
cultural ties with our brethren in the soviet union 
many romanians however including iliescu have said all 
moldavia must be part of romania 
in transylvania where timisoara is located historic frictions 
between romanians and the large ethnic hungarian minority turned 
violent in march 
at least six people were killed in tirgu mures 180 miles 
northwest of bucharest and 300 were injured before the army could 
restore order 
representatives of romanias 22 million hungarians say their 
struggle for minority rights is being suppressed as it was under 
ceausescu 
part of the support for iliescu rests on the interim 
governments ability to provide relative plenty after years of 
privation under ceausescu who starved the people to pay off the 
foreign debt with exports 
generous foreign aid an end to food exports increased energy 
imports and mild weather since february have kept people fed and 
warm but luxury items such as chocolate and citrus fruits are in 
short supply

elvis the man the music the curtain 
the elementary school that elvis presley attended is cashing in 
on its most famous pupil selling scraps of the maroon velveteen 
curtains that hung on the stage when presley was a shy barefoot 
boy singing at weekday devotionals 
the going price is 5 for a 5inch square and the lawhon school 
has already reaped 3000 the money has gone toward new playground 
equipment and a 1700 sound system for the auditorium 
principal dale dobbs said hes amazed that elvis fans are so 
eager to buy anything connected to him 
when the old stage curtains were taken down they were stored 
away and not disposed of probably because someone had the 
foresight to realize that they might be a novelty they are 
definitely that dobbs said 
the sales started last summer after the schools parentteacher 
organization got the idea to offer scraps of the tattered curtains 
to visitors arriving for the anniversary of presleys death on aug 
16 1977 
superintendent richard thompson said that for years fans have 
stopped by the school to beg for anything that elvis might have 
used as a student 
now we have something to offer them he said

the national rainbow coalition came to town to 
put together its strategy for the next year and a lot of political 
attitudes got adjusted in jesse jacksons favor 
the conference which ended sunday was billed as a plenary 
session with an eye toward reapportionment in the south in 1991 it 
wound up tangling with the question of black unity within the 
democratic party 
jackson the rainbow coalition leader who has run twice for 
president slapped backs with major black democrats democratic 
national committee chairman ronald brown virginia gov l douglas 
wilder and former atlanta mayor andrew young 
jackson spent much of his time pushing for statehood for the 
district of columbia something that would create a congressional 
seat for which he could run 
young and wilder whose quiet mainstream politics are in stark 
contrast to jacksons vocal activist style came out in support of 
jacksons efforts and jackson endorsed the gubernatorial bid of 
young who was roundly booed by jackson delegates during the 1984 
democratic national convention 
there was talk of working within the democratic party and moves 
to end speculation that jackson and wilder are locked in a battle 
over how the party should proceed to become competitive again in 
presidential elections 
wilder whose status as the nations first black elected 
governor could make him a formidable rival to jacksons position as 
the top black politician in the party said he has no problem with 
jacksons leadership 
he said he came to jacksons conference to show those who 
would care to see there isnt that opportunity to split us up or 
cause us to go oneonone with one another 
jackson who has never been elected to public office said he 
and wilder are inextricably bound in their direction they 
simply have differing styles 
he calls it the new mainstream jackson said i call it 
expansion 
brown the dncs first black chairman set out to discourage 
talk that jackson was a divisive force in the party he said 
jacksons bringing thousands of voters into the party proves he was 
no impediment during the 1988 presidential campaign 
in fact hes one of the greatest assets to our party brown 
said he was not the reason we do not have a democrat in the 
white house 
but those under the rainbow wanted to make it clear that they 
will play hardball with the democrats to make sure the party 
addresses the concerns they expressed in atlanta 
i dont think we have a democratic party i can give my support 
to in spite of what ron brown says said mayor ben nichols of 
ithaca ny what i do know is that in the long run we can have 
a democratic party which is a real democratic party because we can 
organize it together 
meanwhile washington mayor marion barry quietly took part in a 
mayoral conference on reshaping urban america one that skimmed 
over the issue of drugs and drug crime in big cities 
barry who faces trial june 4 on cocaine possession and perjury 
charges got at least two standing ovations from people loyal to 
jackson who turned down a chance to run for barrys job 
barry humbly thanked the crowd for your heartfelt and 
deeprunning prayers during my situation 
he deferred to jacksons leadership expressing great 
excitement about the vision of jesse jackson to call us 
together here in atlanta 
im glad to be here on the cutting edge of this progressive 
agenda he said

former hostage frank reed in a riveting 
account of the brutal beatings he suffered at the hands of his 
islamic captors says he kept his spirits up by using matches to 
draw pictures of his family 
he drew images of his syrianborn wife fifi and son tarek on 
the ceiling and the door of his cell to remind himself that he must 
stay alive if he wanted to see them again reed said sunday at a 
news conference 
i knew if i didnt keep my life going there certainly 
wasnt going to be any fifi or any tarek he said and that 
permeates and transcends all of our thinking 
reed called for negotiations to free the remaining six americans 
and 10 other westerners held hostage even if you have to get in 
bed with the devil 
he said that on several occasions his captors told him that 
all they want is someone to talk to us we had some not so 
nice thoughts about people we thought werent willing to 
trade or negotiate for our lives 
the 57yearold reed interrupted his hospital stay to give 
reporters a chilling glimpse of his life as a hostage in lebanon 
for 44 months he said he was doublechained to a wall or radiator 
and blindfolded much of the time 
reed said his islamic kidnappers broke his nose jaw and ribs 
slightly fractured his feet with iron rods and bloodied his kidneys 
for trying to escape twice 
thank god they didnt kill me he said i was one of their 
pet whackers i did everything in my power not to cry out and not 
let them think they were ever going to get a single advantage on 
me and i didnt 
his account stunned another freed hostage fellow educator 
robert polhill who was at his side at the news conference polhill 
was freed eight days before reed who was released a week ago 
i was as shocked as you were to hear what frank has been 
saying here polhill said i cant say that i was maltreated i 
was never beaten we were not blindfolded things of that sort 
polhill also differed with reed on negotiations he said he 
agreed with president bushs position of refusing to negotiate for 
their release i dont like the thought of negotiating for human 
lives polhill said i just dont think its right 
reed said other hostages were mistreated but not as badly as he 
was he did not elaborate or identify them 
but he said he was held at varying times with terry anderson 
the chief middle east correspondent of the associated press thomas 
sutherland a dean at the american university of beirut john 
mccarthy a british television journalist and brian keenan an 
irish teacher of english at the american university of beirut 
reed said he last saw anderson 18 months ago and sutherland 14 
months ago he left mccarthy he said two days before he was freed 
he said the kidnappers made doctors and dentists available to 
the hostages if they asked for them 
fortunately for me reed said the worst i had was maybe 
one cold and a half all the time i was there the others have 
not been quite as fortunate they have been ill and i pray that 
whatever the illness was it is not that serious that it cant 
eventually be corrected 
he said anderson sutherland mccarthy and keenan had been 
vigorously exercising and look wonderful physically he said he 
stopped exercising because i was angry that i had no freedom 
over the past two years he said the hostages were given boxes 
of books to read john and brian and especially terry go through 
a book a day he said they were held in bedrooms in apartments 
most of the time he said 
at one point the kidnappers allowed them to have a radio for 
about three months over which they listened to bbc the voice of 
america and local stations the hostages heard one broadcast 
quoting the kidnappers as threatening to kill anderson and 
sutherland if the united states didnt take a certain action 
the reaction from us was baloney they wont do it said 
reed and within 30 minutes some captain came down and said 
dont worry about that and we said were not going to 
reed said that after his first escape attempt his hezbollah 
guards battered him with more than 200 blows and he was eventually 
put in solitary confinement for more than two years 
sen bob dole the republican minority leader from kansas and 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny also spoke at the news 
conference calling for the release of the remaining hostages 
dole urged foreign leaders to press for the hostages release 
and moynihan urged israel to release the moslem prisoners it holds 
it is in their interest to do and if theyre part of the world 
nations seeking legality and decency they should now act to bring 
it about in lebanon moynihan said 
syrian and iranian officials said sunday the release of any more 
american hostages likely hinges on israels willingness to free 
hundreds of moslem prisoners including sheik abdul karim obeid a 
shiite cleric taken from his home in southern lebanon in 1989 
president bush on thursday again appealed for the release of all 
hostages but avoided comment on whether that should include 400 
shiites held by israel

thousands of people who came to 
industrialized southern brazil seeking work are now returning home 
frustrated by the rising unemployment the governments austerity 
plan has wrought 
i arrived here with almost nothing and im going back with 
less said jose loreno filho 30 as he prepared to board a bus 
late last week at sao paulos huge tiete bus station 
he had a ticket home to a tiny village in impoverished alagoas 
state on the northeastern coast 
loreno filho who had once worked a small plot of land in 
alagoas scrimped together about 50 and bus fare to come to sao 
paulo in early march he stayed with relatives and hoped to earn 
money to bring his wife and four children to join him 
but on march 16 brazils new president fernando collor de 
mello launched his austerity plan in a bid to defeat record 
inflation that reached nearly 5000 percent over the past year 
while the initiatives which include an 18month freeze on 115 
billion in bank deposits have drastically reduced the cost of 
living businesses have fired hundreds of thousands of workers 
i walked the streets for the past two months and there arent 
any jobs said loreno filho the streets arent paved with gold 
the way i imagined 
sao paulo brazils industrial and financial center has 
attracted millions of migrants during the past two decades most 
came from the northeast to escape that regions grinding poverty 
but since collors economic plan was announced the stream of 
economic refugees has been at least temporarily reversed 
our buses to the northeast have been packed for the past six 
weeks and when buses from the region arrive at the station 
theyve been almost empty said elias perreira manager of the 
sao geraldo bus line the major company servicing the northeast 
from sao paulo a city of 7 million people 
he said the movement to the northeast is now only slightly above 
normal but in midapril the company was carrying 1700 passengers 
a day twice the normal number it needed 11 extra buses a day to 
accommodate the crunch 
many of the returning migrants were working in construction 
which was especially hard hit by collors program an estimated 
300000 construction workers were laid off nationwide more than 
onethird of them in sao paulo 
edmilson mariano de oliveira 27 who arrived in sao paulo eight 
months ago from the northeastern state of piaui recently lost his 
construction job 
ive got a wife and two young kids back there so id always 
planned on going back but i didnt think it would be so soon he 
said 
ill be happy to see my family but theres not much work to 
be had other than subsistence farming he said 
ana correia salles a local social worker said 99 percent of 
construction workers in the area are northeasterners and most 
sleep and eat at the job site if they lose their job they lose 
everything so its either live on the streets or return home 
even some longtime residents of the city are packing their bags 
jose francilino 40 brought his family here from the 
northeastern state of pernambuco in 1977 he said hed always been 
able to find work 
one week after collor took office though he was fired from his 
longtime job as a metalworker he was now heading to pernambuco 
i never thought id be leaving but i dont know what else to 
do my father still works the land and i wrote to tell him wed be 
needing a place to stay for awhile he said as his wife tried to 
quiet the youngest of their four children 
ms salles the social worker said the plight of migrants shows 
collor was wrong when he claimed that only the rich were paying the 
cost of economic adjustment 
the wealthy lost their savings but the poor are losing their 
jobs id say thats just as important she said

the perception that illegal drug use is 
decreasing among suburban whites could lead to a reduced sense of 
urgency in fighting the nations war on drugs some analysts say 
as a result they say mostly black innercity neighborhoods may 
have to find their own solutions to drugrelated problems 
i can see it happening and its unfortunate said kevin b 
zeese director of the washingtonbased center for the study of 
drug policy which advocates legalization of some drugs like 
marijuana and cocaine zeese was a speaker at a conference last 
week sponsored by the washington journalism center 
casual use is declining what is left is a hardcore group of 
people who are heavily into drugs said charles r schuster 
director of the national institute on drug abuse nida is the 
federal governments lead agency in researching drug abuse problems 
schuster said studies have shown that in 1985 an estimated 58 
million americans used cocaine at least once a month by 1988 he 
said the number had decreased to about 29 million 
at the same time he said the number of weekly users rose from 
an estimated 650000 to about 800000 although he said he believed 
those estimates are low 
studies have shown that the decline in drug use is primarily in 
mostly white suburban america schuster noted while use is on the 
upswing in poor predominantly black innercity neighborhoods 
conference speakers said however that differences are better 
linked to socioeconomic status than race 
schuster said he worries that policy makers may lose concern 
about illegal drugs if theyre convinced that antidrug efforts 
have worked in middleclass communities 
there is always that potential the attitude may be out of 
sight out of mind added reggie walton a deputy to federal drug 
policy coordinator william bennett and a former district of 
columbia superior court judge 
for a long time illicit drug use was perceived as an 
innercity minority problem and it wasnt aggressively attacked 
he said 
but a federal drug enforcement administration official said he 
believes problems related to the innercity drug trade will keep 
public attention focused on drug abuse in both urban and outlying 
communities 
the issue of violence will keep this on the front burner 
said david westrate dea assistant administrator for operations 
walton said that while the drug problem appears to manifest 
itself in its worse sense in our inner cities it is simply 
covered up a lot better in suburbia where parents can afford 
private treatment programs 
a lot of parents in inner cities do a tremendous job in 
deterring their kids from drug use he said 
drug abuse did not become a real issue in this country until 
it affected middle and upperclass families added joanne c 
benson principal of john h bain elementary school in capitol 
heights md just outside washington 
benson has been recognized for her efforts to rid the 
neighborhood around the school of drug pushers and to get parents 
involved in drug rehabilitation and community improvement projects 
benson said drug policy makers must make sure that no community 
is forgotten even those with little political clout like capitol 
heights

five mothers days have passed since rep 
patricia schroeder first advanced a plan guaranteeing jobprotected 
time off to workers with new babies or an illness in the family 
the sixth could be a charm 
this week just before mothers day 1990 the family and medical 
leave act is scheduled to come up on the house floor for the first 
time 
is it an intrusive mandate that would dictate corporate 
personnel policies inhibit flexibility and deprive workers of 
other benefits thats what the influential business lobby contends 
but supporters say theyre asking lawmakers to consider the 
plight of american families and simply make sure people dont lose 
their jobs when they are needed at home 
were not talking about the mword mandates here were 
talking about the vword values said rep marge roukema rnj 
she said shes telling her colleagues dont give us lip service 
about family values if you dont recognize them in this bill 
under the family and medical leave act employees would be 
entitled to unpaid time off to care for newborn newly adopted or 
seriously ill children to cope with personal health problems and 
to tend stricken spouses or parents 
as schroeder dcolo introduced it five years ago all 
businesses employing more than five people would have had to offer 
18week leaves in its present form all businesses with fewer than 
50 employees would be exempt and the companies would have to offer 
12 weeks of unpaid leave 
i obviously would much prefer to have something else 
schroeder said but we have to act on it we cant just keep 
introducing it 
the business community says it cannot accept a federally 
mandated benefit in any form there can be no compromise on this 
legislation the national federation of independent business told 
schroeder in a letter last week moreover mandated leave is just 
the first step toward 100 percent coverage and paid leave 
but house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said many 
successful companies offer leaves and consider them investments in 
their work force 
in the modern world more parents work and more children are 
left without the kind of supervision and help they need he said 
child care and family leave can begin to fill in those gaps 
gephardt said he took advantage of his st louis law firms 
leave policy when his son had cancer years ago companies without 
such arrangements put employees into a real bind he said 
you feel like a trapped animal he said you realize that 
if you leave youre likely to lose your job and thats the last 
thing you need to do at a time of tremendous expense and stress 
supporters of the family leave bill range from the house 
leadership to a coalition that includes feminist and church groups 
pediatricians and labor unions a house vote is expected in 
midweek and they predict they will prevail on a close vote and 
send the bill to the senate 
roukema said she has urged the bush administration to avoid veto 
threats before congress completes action on the measure she said 
she is getting mixed white house signals on the bills prospects 
some people say the administration is totally against all new 
mandates others say well well see 
bush who espoused family values during the 1988 campaign has 
said he favors jobprotected leave for new mothers but says 
employers should provide it voluntarily 
it is voluntary and a lot of companies arent doing it 
schroeder said 
roukema said she fears the issue could damage her party unless 
bush and her gop colleagues change their minds 
im very worried that this will be used against republicans 
roukema said polls have demonstrated that republicans are 
not perceived to be responsive to the working family issue and 
what could be more of a defining issue than family and medical 
leave it defines where you stand on women children grandma and 
grandpa

a close observer may doubt congress sincerity 
on issues such as the environment abortion and the deficit but 
not on campaign finance reform 
many lawmakers sincerely want to reform their campaign opponents 
out of contention 
for the past two years the idea of revamping the federal 
campaign finance system has been at the top of the congressional 
agenda 
but so far theres been more heat than light from the 535 
experts grappling with the issue from their seats in the capitol 
the senate deadlocked repeatedly on the issue in 1988 and 
agreement remains elusive today house republican and democratic 
leaders formed a task force on campaign reform in the wake of the 
ethicsrelated resignation of former speaker jim wright and nearly 
a year later it is stalled 
theres little disagreement over the problem campaigns cost so 
much that raising money for them is a fulltime job prone to 
conflicts of interest and not leaving much time for legislating 
but almost any solution favors one side over another 
the main democratic proposal would cap the total amount that 
candidates may spend in a campaign republicans dont like the idea 
because the democrats get a lot of offthebooks help primarily 
from labor unions 
the gop would eliminate most donations from political action 
committees nonmonetary help from labor and other groups and give 
the political parties a bigger role in house and senate elections 
pacs give mightily to democratic incumbents while the republican 
party with president bush as chief fundraiser can easily outspend 
the democratic party 
some democrats favor public financing of campaigns perhaps 
through an income tax checkoff but that proposal is anathema to 
most conservatives 
the differences between the parties are so sharp that in the 
house speaker thomas foley dwash and minority leader robert 
michel rill recently agreed to hold off action until later in 
the spring in hopes the senate can find some common ground 
it is widely expected that the houses majority democrats will 
muscle their bill past republican objections but the gop members 
will get a chance to vote on their alternative that way both 
sides can go home to the voters and say they supported reform 
the senate could do the same thing but probably not as tidily 
and with more acrimony if pushed hard enough perhaps by the 
continuing scandal over campaign donations from executives from 
failed savings and loans its possible a bill could emerge 
there are a few areas of possible agreement for example 
mandated discounts for television campaign advertising 
but even proposals that would hit incumbent candidates from both 
parties equally can be sensitive such as the proposal by senate 
republicans to place tough restrictions on taxpayerfinanced 
mailings by senators in an election year 
the congressional frank is one of the big advantages 
incumbents have over their challengers the minority republicans 
are looking to make all of congress more vulnerable to increase 
their own chances of taking over 
but house speaker foley recently refused to consider even the 
moderate step of disclosing publicly how much each house member 
spends on mass mailings foley said the public has repeatedly said 
in polls that it wants to hear from elected officials more often 
not less 
its too early to rule out a significant revamping of campaign 
laws but resistance to any proposed changes must be expected 
because those 535 experts on capitol hill have proven they can 
master the current system 
despite grumbling about its burdens its still the devil they 
know

theodore roosevelt boldly shaped the powers of 
the presidency but wasnt too busy for nightly pillow fights with 
his kids according to a white house lecturers fond remembrance 
president bush and 200 guests listened raptly to the lecture on 
the bold noisy irrepressibly energetic 26th president on 
sunday by prizewinning biographer david mccullough 
bush called roosevelt a favorite of mine a man who helped 
shape the modern presidency the inexhaustible tr 
the audience included congressional leaders who met afterward 
with bush to discuss future budget negotiations 
bush smiled broadly at house speaker tom foley dwash when 
mccullough read from one letter in which roosevelt complained he 
felt like a stewed owl after dealing with members of congress 
all day 
roosevelts solution to such frustrations was vigorous physical 
activity including workouts with japanese wrestlers that left him 
bruised from head to toe 
he once marched two british visitors right through a duck pond 
on the white house grounds that fortunately turned out to be only 
three feet deep 
roosevelt only 42 when he became president in 1901 upon the 
assassination of william mckinley was the first tennisplaying 
president as well as the first to ride in an automobile fly in a 
plane sail on a submarine and venture abroad 
he dispensed with the formality of being addressed as your 
excellency and paid no heed to public opinion 
mccullough quoted the rough rider as saying i dont know what 
they think i just know what they ought to think 
when congress objected to his sending 16 us battleships on a 
tour around the world roosevelt sent the fleet off anyway 
theodore determined that there was enough money in the 
treasury to send them halfway so he said ill send them halfway 
and congress can decide whether to appropriate the money to bring 
them back again said mccullough author of mornings on 
horseback an account of roosevelts early years 
roosevelt was a prime participant in rampant wild pillow 
fights almost every night with his six children the writer said 
he went on a reallife safari after leaving office in 1909 but 
his reluctance once to fire upon a small bear led a new york 
toymaker to conceive a novelty item the teddy bear 
he set aside millions of acres for national forests and parks 
and did more for conservation than any president before and very 
few since mccullough said 
he renovated a somewhat creepy white house and scuttled 
plans to fill the mansion with offices and make the president live 
elsewhere 
he couldnt spell worth anything but read a book each night 
and could quote from them years later the author said 
he created a stir in the south by inviting booker t washington 
of tuskegee institute as the first black dinner guest at the white 
house 
that so delighted pianist scott joplin that he promptly wrote 
the strenuous life rag in roosevelts honor mccullough 
interrupted his narrative and had a pianist play the piece for the 
east room audience 
his words many of them written or spoken so long ago still 
have enormous validity today said mccullough 
among roosevelts sayings this country will not be a 
permanently good place for any of us to live unless we make it a 
reasonably good place for all of us to live

a diary that could help convict a salvadoran 
army colonel in the slayings of six jesuit priests and two women in 
1989 has vanished the new york times reported today 
the loss of the colonels diary and the transfers overseas of 
four soldiers who may be important witnesses have greatly weakened 
the case against col guillermo alfredo benavides moreno the 
newspaper said 
the developments also may hurt efforts to prove that other high 
military officials were involved in or tried to cover up the 
killings the times quoted unidentified salvadoran judicial 
officials as saying 
six priests their cook and her daughter were slain nov 16 in a 
predawn attack at the jesuitrun central american university 
which lies just outside the capital san salvador 
benavides and seven other officials were chargd with the 
slayings in january 
critical evidence including the diary has disappeared the 
times said 
also four soldiers who were stationed at a military school run 
by benavides have been transferred abroad to study and two other 
witnesses failed to appear to testify the times said 
the only evidence so far against benavides the highest ranking 
official ever charged in a human rights case in the country 
consists of statements by some of the seven other officials charged 
in the case in el salvador a defendants statement cant be used 
against a codefendant the paper said 
investigators believe the colonels diary lists his activities 
and the meetings he attended before the killings the times said 
another missing piece of evidence is a log from the military 
school that the colonel headed the tribunal investigating the 
slayings was told that the log was lost it might show who entered 
and left the school the night of the killings the report said 
the four soldiers who were transferred also may have been able 
to say who was at the campus that night they were responsible for 
logging the names of anyone entering or leaving the campus

hes 12 years old and his goal is not to set 
video game scoring records but to be the youngest doctor in the 
world 
meet thirdyear premedical student balamurati krishna ambati a 
prodigy who wants to graduate medical school before he turns 18 
while the wouldbe doogie howser is causing some nervousness 
at new york university friedrich ulfers director of the 
presidential scholars program which awarded him a full 
scholarship is pleased with his pace 
what if we had told mozart he was too precocious ulfers 
said 
the youngster mastered calculus at age 4 and described himself 
as a prodigy with a purpose on his college application 
he said that after learning that an israeli at 18 was the 
youngest medical school graduate he decided that he wanted to beat 
that record 
a reference to the tv program doogie howser md about a 
teenage doctor doesnt draw much of a response from bala as he 
is known hes never seen the show preferring the news 
jeopardy and star trek the next generation 
he was born in india and was 3 when his parents moved to 
buffalo as his father ambati murati an industrial engineer and 
his mother gomathi rao a mathematics teacher moved around the 
country bala skipped grades and excelled 
some of his professors dont share the enthusiasm of bala and 
his family 
i worry that it is the parents that are pushing said 
physics professor leposava vuskovic it is one thing to perform 
and be creative but he just wants to get the degree 
the boys father said he has had to fight school administrators 
to get bala skipped to higher grades and the idea of a 14yearold 
medical school applicant doesnt sit too well in some quarters 
i think questions might be legitimately raised about his 
emotional maturity said dr andrew frantz chairman of the 
admissions committee at columbia universitys medical school why 
does he need to why not wait 
the boys father wont listen to that kind of talk 
as we have set this goal even if he only gets into the worst 
medical school in new york we will go for it murati said

sugar growers contributed more than 33 
million to congressional campaigns between 1983 and 1989 as part of 
an effort to keep us sugar prices artificially high a consumer 
group says 
us sugar support policies artificially keep the price of 
sugar so high that consumers have spent billions more than they 
should have ellen haas executive director of public voice for 
food and health policy said sunday 
officials for the sugar industry acknowledge the campaign 
contributions but disputed the contention that consumers are paying 
too much for their product 
the program keeps prices stable said joe terrell spokesman 
for the american sugar alliance consumers in this country pay on 
average about what is paid in developed countries worldwide or 
less in some cases 
critics contend that the system of price supports and quotas for 
sugar is among the most blatantly protectionist of any us farm 
programs 
many foreign suppliers are third world countries whose economies 
rise and fall dramatically depending their access to the us

enough to go around get on with expanding the horizons of 
cooperation while working through the disputes that frustrate 
both said a report issued by the commission last week

louis farrakhan leader of the nation of

a comprehensive review of us defenses could 
permit spending cuts of 20 to 25 percent the nations top military 
officer was quoted as saying today 
gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said american weapons systems personnel levels training practices 
and military strategy should be transformed to adjust to the 
muchdiminished soviet threat the washington post reported 
we know we have to get smaller powell said in the post 
interview we can go down considerably 
but powell an army general who served as national security 
adviser in the reagan administration said some congressional 
critics were proposing to put the defense budget in too steep a 
dive 
the aim of a toptobottom review would be to determine the 
minimum forces the united states needs he said 
there is a base level below which you cant go because we 
are a superpower with worldwide interests the newspaper quoted 
him as saying 
powell said he did not want to spell out his views for future 
budgets but said he believed a fundamental break point would 
occur somewhere in the neighborhood of maybe a 20 to 25 percent 
reduction from where we are now in both force size and military 
spending the post reported 
defense secretary dick cheney has proposed cutting the current 
291 defense billion budget by 2 percent each year through 1997 
after taking into account the effects of inflation 
powell told the post that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs political and military changes mean the united states 
no longer needs to see the soviet union as a real and present 
danger whos coming at me tomorrow 
instead of seeing the soviets as the enemy powell said i 
want to deal straight up with them as businessmen like two real 
estate lawyers closing a deal i want title insurance i want a

accounts controlled by the ceausescu family the washington post

said the arms purchases were of immense value to us intelligence 
the romanian operation was interrupted when ceausescu was 
overthrown and executed the post said

the post reported that the ceausescu connection was part of 
a larger 250 million operation by the cia and us military to 
buy weapons and technology from the military in eastern european 
countries allied with the soviets 
last years prodemocracy upheaval in eastern europe has 
disrupted the broader operation but not stopped it the newspaper 
said 
from romania alone the acquisitions included the latest version 
of an antiaircraft system called the shilka mobile rocket 
launchers modified and improved by the romanians and radar systems 
used by soviet antiaircraft weapons the newspaper said 
the potential value of these things is almost incalculable 
an unidentified us intelligence officer was quoted as saying 
the only way you can truly unlock the secrets of your 
adversaries weapons is to physically have them 
nicolae ceausescu was not personally involved in the dozen or so 
sales the post said but it quoted american officials as saying 
they believed the sales could not have taken place without the 
dictators tacit approval

richard cooksie tried to walk home over the 
weekend but turned back he would have had to swim the last block 
the 63yearold retired construction worker found himself back 
at a temporary shelter sunday night passing his time making mental 
lists of what possessions he might be able to save from the trinity 
river flood that has swamped his home since thursday 
its not the first time cooksie has been forced out by high 
water flooding devastated his previous home in rochester park a 
suburb southeast of dallas last summer 
everything i had was totally destroyed for two years in a 
row he lamented i had moved from where i lived before it was 
higher i thought it was high ground i moved two blocks up but 
the same thing happened 
the only thing cooksie managed to grab when he discovered water 
from the rainswollen river was rising rapidly early thursday was 
one pair of pants and a few changes of underwear he said 
flood stage is 30 feet and the trinity stood at 438 feet in 
dallas early today more than 400 people have been forced from 
their homes 
cooksie who said he depends entirely on monthly social security 
checks was one of the last flood victims to remain at the exline 
recreation center which has served as dallas main shelter for 
flood victims 
many others have found lodging with relatives or have been given 
vouchers for hotel rooms authorities said 
officials expected no more than 10 people to spend sunday night 
at the shelter down from more than 50 the night before 
rickey henderson a 30yearold unemployed handyman staying at 
the shelter said he had managed to make it back to rochester park 
over the weekend his gamble of storing all his furniture in 
someone elses apartment on the second floor had paid off he said 
it was still there 
police reported at least two looters were arrested for wading 
into the flooded areas and floating stolen goods out using inner 
tubes and trash cans 
its not bad here and its not good but its better than 
being nowhere henderson said of life at the shelter we watch 
tv here we go outside we walk kids around we play basketball or 
something but mostly we just talk to other people 
henderson said he would like to move to an area where floods are 
something people only watch on tv but he cant afford to move away 
from the federally subsidized housing project where he lives along 
with his mother and two nieces 
they say its not going to be until 1993 until they can stop 
flooding down there he said i would like to move to a better 
location but i dont know how

tens of thousands of people some 
chanting greater romania streamed across the soviet border to 
visit their ethnic romanian brethren after the frontier was opened 
for the first time in decades 
for six hours on sunday romanians needed no visas to cross into 
the soviet republic of moldavia which was known as bessarabia and 
was part of romania before the soviets seized it 50 years ago 
lets cover the wound of moldavia with flowers and see our 
forgotten brothers again said an appeal published in faclia the 
local daily in the soviet republics capital of kishenev 
demands for the return of bessarabia have grown strongly on both 
sides of the border since the december overthrow and execution of 
hardline communist nicolae ceausescu in a popular revolution 
political reforms have allowed free expression of nationalist 
yearnings in the soviet union and the nationalist fervor was 
tangible sunday as romanians streamed through eight temporarily 
opened border crossings into soviet moldavia 
at least 40000 exuberant flagwaving people poured over 
ungheni bridge throwing flowers into the prut river that forms the 
frontier many carried romanianlanguage books and records to their 
kin in the soviet union 
when the bridge became crowded some people decided not to wait 
and swam the river instead 
other groups of people stood on the banks of the prut heatedly 
arguing the question of possible reunification 
this bridge of flowers is our first crack in the wall for 
bessarabia was always romanian said 24yearold electrician 
vasile haciu 
local inhabitants said hundreds of thousands of people flooded 
through the border crossings into soviet moldavia but no official 
figures were available 
the border opening occurred at the initiative of the popular 
front of moldavia and other cultural organizations official and 
independent on both sides of the river 
soviet sources said the request was approved april 17 by 
moldavias parliament it was not known whether moscow gave its 
formal approval 
soviet citizens were not allowed to cross into romania but 
small groups from kishinev sneaked in 
the soviet union occupied bessarabia and the north of bukovina 
in 1940 after signing the hitlerstalin pact with nazi germany the 
two regions were then joined as soviet moldavia and for decades 
under stalinist leaders in both countries talk of reunification 
was taboo 
but with the dramatic political changes in romania and the 
soviet union people on both sides of the border are now talking of 
increased ties 
soviet moldavians last year were finally permitted to restore 
the latin script for their language which is virtually identical 
to that of romania stalin imposed the russian cyrillic script on 
the area 
the tragedy of the romanian people started with the 
hitlerstalin pact when unjust frontiers were imposed said 
gheorghe ghimpu head of the official popular front of moldavia a 
communistrun umbrella organization 
many fear that talk of reuniting romania and soviet moldavia 
will exacerbate political tensions in the soviet union where 
moscow is already feuding with secessionist republics in the 
baltics 
the interim government in bucharest that took over after 
ceausescus executed has not explicitly rejected the idea of 
reunification but it has offered no specific initiatives

pope john paul ii says he will not visit cuba 
this year despite a vatican announcement last month that the 
pontiff might travel to the communist country in december 
it seems that this project will not be mature for the end of 
the year john paul told reporters sunday on the papal flight 
from rome to mexico city 
the invitations have arrived the pontiff said but the 
cuban bishops the vatican and the government of president fidel 
castro have yet to agree on a date vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro said december had been only one of several possible dates 
for a trip 
john paul has visited every country in central and south america 
during his pontificate but he has never been able to visit cuba

close of 15855 yen the market was closed thursday and friday for 
holidays 
it opened at 15836 yen and rose no higher than 15837 yen

major industrialized nations had agreed to correct the current 
level of exchange rates 
finance ministers and central bankers from the group of seven 
the united states japan west germany britain france italy and

on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which gained 48381 points on wednesday rose another 
78263 points or 259 percent closing at 3095627 
securities dealers said investors were encouraged by the strong 
showing of stock markets around the world and the strengthening of 
the japanese yen 
the yens rise gave investors incentive to buy domestic 
marketoriented shares said a dealer with a major japanese 
brokerage speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said construction real estate and miningrelated shares were 
main beneficiaries of the yens rise today 
but the rising yen worked against exportoriented issues such as 
electricity and automobile shares which had led the tokyo market 
in recent weeks when the yen was falling 
ichitaro watanabe a dealer with nikko securities said the 
strong showing of foreign stock markets especially new yorks 
also encouraged investors in tokyo

a retarded man whose release to a group home 
after three decades in a mental hospital spurred a public outcry 
was behind bars today for investigation of theft and attempted 
burglary 
bernt murphy 52 was jailed sunday following a report of an 
attempted breakin saturday night at a home about seven blocks from

fortyfive years after gen george 
pattons 3rd army drove the nazis from this city its czech 
residents finally had another chance to thank the americans 
the communists who ruled czechoslovakia until november had 
written the american liberation of pilsen out of their history 
books 
finally the day has come when we can express our gratitude and 
thanks publicly to all those persecuted forgotten or erased from 
world history president vaclav havel told up to 40000 people 
who packed the citys central square sunday for liberation day 
celebrations 
many of them did not live to see this welldeserved 
recognition by our country said the former dissident playwright 
but scores of us veterans did take part in the weekend 
celebrations in this western bohemian city which was for the first 
time the site of the main czechoslovak observance of the end of 
world war ii 
in past years the celebrations took place in prague the 
capital and highlighted only the soviet role in the countrys 
liberation 
under the hardline communist rulers toppled in last falls 
peaceful revolution the official position was that only the soviet 
red army liberated czechoslovakia in 1945 
czech revelers drove restored world war ii jeeps through pilsen 
and wore american army uniforms 
it was a moving experience for the many elderly american 
veterans who took part many were making their first trip back 
they stole our hearts then and they are doing it again 
today said bobby capps of birmingham ala now retired to lake 
alfred fla who was a member of the 396th field artillery 
you cant describe how much love there is 
the holiday brought tens of thousands of people to pilsen from 
across western czechoslovakia to drink the famous pilsener beer 
eat sausages hear speeches and indulge in a festival of americana 
including country and western bands swing music and a us film 
festival featuring patton starring george c scott 
people displayed us and czechoslovak flags in the windows of 
their homes and flew the stars and stripes from car antennae 
this is a dream something genuinely unbelievable said 
czech singer pavel bobek who recalled visiting pilsen as a 
7yearold and seeing the us troops 
during a ceremony at city hall a plaque commemorating the us 
liberation was remounted it had been taken down by stalinist 
authorities at the height of the cold war in 1951 
all americans thank czechoslovakia for putting american 
soldiers back in their true place in history us ambassador 
shirley temple black the former child film star said during the 
ceremony 
earlier in the day havel spoke at a ceremony in the small town 
of rokycany where a plaque was unveiled honoring the troops of the 
us 9th infantry regiment 2nd division who rolled into town in 
their jeeps on may 5 1945 
rokycany is near the demarcation line where us troops halted 
their eastward advance in world war iis closing days as part of 
the yalta conference agreement which allowed the red army to 
occupy much of eastern europe 
under the agreement us troops were prevented from pushing on 
to liberate prague just 50 miles away 
in 1949 the communists established full control and set up a 
sovietstyle state

molten rock from kilauea volcano flowed 
to the oceans edge and officials warned of hazardous steam clouds 
when the lava plunges into the sea 
the sevenyear eruption has destroyed 138 homes in kalapana and 
elsewhere on the volcanos flank 60 of them since april 4 
the unpredictable flow has encircled this tiny coastal town and 
scientists said lava could overrun whats left of the community 
within days all residents have left some of them bringing their 
houses with them 
highway 130 is littered with displaced houses and the roman 
catholic star of the sea church which have been temporarily moved 
out of harms way 
one arm of the flow pooled at the base of sand dunes near harry 
k brown state park said bruce butts deputy administrator for 
hawaii county civil defense 
it was just a matter of time until enough lava amassedto spill 
over the sand and into the ocean he said 
hot lava mixing with salt water produces steam clouds known as 
laze that contain hydrochloric acid and other hazardous chemicals 
our main concern is the trade winds said civil defense 
spokesman bruce butts as long as there are trade winds the laze 
will be blown away 
the kalapana mauna kea congregational church and kalapana store 
and drivein at the heart of the community were standing sunday 
but butts said the lava threatened both 
lava felled two more houses sunday and overran the park forcing 
the civil defense command center to move to higher ground at a 
papaya grove 
gov john waihee asked that the town and other coastal 
communities inundated by lava over the years be declared a federal 
disaster area waihee estimated damage at 61 million

authorities said today they were 
investigating the possibility of braketampering on a steam train 
that was hit in the rear by an an express train leaving at least 
six people dead and more than 100 injured 
rescue teams were still cutting at the wreckage of the steam and 
intercity express trains today fearing more people were trapped 
the passenger trains crashed sunday night near the hamlet of 
brooklyn 25 miles north of sydney as the oldfashioned steam 
engine carrying about 300 people from a jazz festival struggled 
up a steep gradient 
the electric train was carrying about 100 people on two decks 
en route to sydney from newcastle 
new south wales transport minister bruce baird said it was 
possible an emergency brake had been on set on a car of the steam 
train which had been trying to pick up speed before it was hit 
there is evidence the handoperated brake in the third 
passenger carriage was on baird said 
investigators were also looking at why the express was not aware 
of the steam trains presence on the track which has a signal 
system 
the crash site is surrounded by dense bushland and rescue 
workers had to drive down a dirt track to reach it when they 
arrived they found debris from the trains scattered over a 
100yard area 
police said six of the 106 people injured were in critical 
condition 
one survivor richard stohr said the steam train appeared to 
have trouble getting up the hill 
he said the electric train seemed to be trying to pick up speed 
to tackle the hill when it emerged from a tunnel and crashed into 
the other train 
this woman just flew past me just sailed past he said 
i think she was killed 
australias worst rail disaster killed 83 people when a crowded 
commuter train derailed and hit a bridge at granville in sydneys 
western suburbs in january 1977

the dollar was lower in europe late this morning 
as a bank holiday in britain sharply reduced trading 
gold was slightly higher in zurich 
traders said that although the dollar was down trading was calm 
and the us currency was showing signs of steadying after its 
sharp selloff friday afternoon 
that selloff came in response to surprisingly weak us 
unemployment figures which showed the jobless rate rising to 54 
percent in april from 52 percent in march 
a dealer at a european bank in frankfurt said the momentum for a 
lower dollar had been building up for several weeks and that the 
us unemployment report was only the trigger 
dealers said a key reason for the dollars weakness was positive 
news for the west german mark including last weeks accord on 
details of german monetary union 
the clouds that had been hanging over the dmark are suddenly 
gone said a dealer at a west german bank it is safe to buy 
the mark again 
one trader in milan said the meeting of finance ministers from 
the seven major industrialized nations in washington on sunday 
turned out to be a nonevent for foreign exchange markets 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 075 yen to a closing 15780 yen later in europe 
it was quoted at a lower rate of 15775 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late friday 
16600 west german marks down from 16710 
14370 swiss francs down from 14435

18665 dutch guilders down from 18782 
121750 italian lire down from 122450

his remarks were reported by the daily news and in a letter of 
complaint to newsday managers signed by 46 members of the papers

president roh taewoo warned today of 
a nation on the brink of chaos but defiant militants stormed 
his partys headquarters firebombed one of its provincial offices 
and battled police in several cities 
in a nationally televised speech roh said a wave of strikes and 
protests by militant workers and radical students were threatening 
the social fabric and the economy 
he said the government would guarantee a legal labor movement 
but will deal strongly with illegal labor disputes or collective 
actions with political purposes he did not elaborate 
but even as the president spoke 21 radicals yelling down with 
roh taewoo stormed governing party headquarters and held it for 
10 minutes before being driven out about 50 people fled the 
building coughing and choking as police firing tear gas battled 
students on a stairway witnesses said 
radicals barricaded themselves inside a thirdfloor office 
broke the windows and threw firebombs down on the police while 
shouting antigovernment slogan witnesses said police and news 
reports said five students were injured and all 21 who took part in 
the attack were arrested 
the windshields of three cars in an outdoor parking lot were 
shattered by firebombs and some furniture inside was smashed 
police said 
news reports said the group scattered leaflets demanding the 
ouster of us ambassador donald p gregg 
radicals claim gregg devised this years merger of the governing 
party with two smaller parties to serve conservative us business 
interests 
radical students also fought police outside campuses in kwangju 
muan punchon yongin and two small towns outside seoul according 
to yonhap the national news agency a total of about 2500 
students took part it said there were no reports of arrests or 
injuries in those clashes 
ten radical students hurled firebombs and smashed windows at the 
wonju city chapter of the governing democratic liberal party and 
fled before police arrived yonhap said 
radical students are a small minority and many koreans do not 
approve of their tactics it is difficult to estimate the numbers 
of members in outlawed dissident groups but they number at least 
several hundred thousand in this country of 42 million 
in his television speech flanked by cabinet ministers roh said 
right now we are in a difficult time 
we are on a crossroads where the country can either be on a 
road toward progress or fall into a road toward chaos 
roh whose party has been losing popularity asked all south 
koreans to work to solve the problems of labor unrest land 
speculation crime and eroding confidence in the economy 
but the radical national council of student representatives and 
the peoples alliance an umbrella alliance of 17 dissident groups 
announced new nationwide protests aimed at forcing the governing 
party to disband 
in seoul professor oh sechul of yonsei university released a 
statement signed by 1041 professors at 57 colleges and 
universities nationwide demanding the dissolution of the 
conservative governing party 
the statement charged that the party represents an effort to 
prolong the anticommunist proamerican ultrarightist rule of the 
present regime 
kim daejung leader of the opposition party for peace and 
democracy issued a statement calling the party merger a plot by 
the roh regime to prolong power 
in his speech roh said the recent heightening of uneasiness 
had been partly caused by what he called illegal labor strikes at 
the state television network and the hyundai groups shipyard in 
ulsan about 200 miles southeast of seoul 
in the strike at the hyundai heavy industries co shipyard up 
to 100 workers on a huge shipyard crane began talks on ending their 
protest with company executives today witnesses said by telephone 
the workers have been on the 240foot crane since april 28 when 
police raided the shipyard the worlds largest to oust strikers 
the raid set off a round of nationwide sympathy strikes but 
most workers returned to their jobs by the end of last week 
wages have not been an issue at the shipyard workers on the 
crane are demanding charges be dropped against union leaders 
arrested in earlier protests 
in his speech roh appealed to workers to refrain from demanding 
wage increases higher than productivity until the economy has 
recovered 
inflation has been increasing at an annual rate of more than 10 
percent for the first time in many years and the stock market is at 
a twoyear low in addition south korean products have lost some 
competitiveness overseas because of domestic labor unrest huge 
wage increases and the rise of the south korean currency against 
the dollar

nearly a week of sitins and hunger strikes in 
mongolia ended after the countrys largest opposition group agreed 
to a compromise and joined a government advisory body mongolian 
radio said today 
the mongolian democratic association decided late sunday to join 
other opposition groups in accepting a government offer to set up 
an advisory council from which they can submit draft bills and 
suggestions to the communistdominated legislature 
shortly after the agreement was reached the mda and its 
supporters ended hunger strikes in three cities and sitins in the 
mongolian capital of ulan bator and several other cities mongolian 
radio said 
mongolian president punsalmaagiin ochirbat meanwhile flew home 
from china two days earlier than planned but neither the chinese 
nor the mongolian embassy gave any explanation 
he had arrived friday for a sixday visit that normalized 
relations after nearly three decades of coolness caused by the 
chinesesoviet split mongolia is a soviet satellite 
after his departure the official chinese news agency xinhua 
released the text of a chinesemongolian communique that said the 
visit opened up a bright prospect for further expanding and 
developing bilateral relations 
it said ochirbat invited chinese president yang shangkun and 
premier li peng to visit ulan bator and they accepted no dates 
were set 
the communique also said the two sides believed it was useful 
to exchange information and experience on socialist construction 
and economic reform and were ready to hold more meetings on the 
subject 
mongolia has been following the soviet example of allowing 
vigorous political debate but moving slowly on economic reform 
while china has introduced wideranging economic reforms without 
relaxing political controls 
china has shown concern about moves toward democracy in mongolia 
by curbing travel there by its citizens and increasing surveillance 
over ethnic mongols in china chinas communist party leader jiang 
zemin advised ochirbat on saturday that internal stability is 
essential for economic development 
the wave of sitins and hunger strikes in mongolia began last 
week to press for the resignation of the legislature dominated by 
the ruling communist party and establishment of a multiparty 
provisional legislature until elections are held this summer 
a source in ulan bator interviewed by telephone said the 
sitin by 25 to 30 people in the capitals central square which 
began wednesday had ended by midnight sunday 
it never attracted crowds of more than several hundred said the 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in contrast thousands of people attended rallies in january and 
february at which the mda and other opposition groups pressed their 
initial demands for democratic reform many of those demands were 
met including that the communists give up their constitutional 
guarantee of power and allow opposition parties 
local newspapers reported today that the opposition groups had 
agreed to work together to restructure mongolias political system 
the source said 
details of the advisory councils size function and makeup were 
not disclosed but it is to work under the legislatures council of 
ministers and be allowed to draft legislation the source said 
the president proposed the council as an alternative to 
opposition demands that the 370member legislature resign and a 
multiparty legislature be set up until summer elections more than 
93 percent of the lawmakers are members of the communist party

member had planned to use the missiles to shoot down planes and 
helicopters carrying barco and members of his cabinet as part of 
the groups campaign of violence against the colombian governments 
war on drugs

us rep donald lukens running for 
reelection this week under the cloud of a sexrelated conviction 
is now facing allegations that he owes more than 1500 in state 
taxes 
the columbus dispatch reported sunday two days before the 
republican primary for lukens congressional seat that the ohio 
department of taxation has certified lukens as delinquent in paying 
1514 in state taxes including a penalty and interest on his 
1988 earnings 
the paper said the delinquency was certified april 18 and the 
ohio attorney generals office filed a lien april 27 with the 
butler county clerk of courts in hamilton to collect the money 
lukens top spokesman confirmed sunday night that the 8th 
district congressman hasnt paid the money but spokesman bill 
jarrell said lukens and his staff havent received any notice about 
a lien 
jarrell said in a telephone interview that lukens will pay the 
state once he receives a 4000 tax refund from the federal 
government 
hes more than willing to pay the money as soon as possible 
jarrell said he has no problems with paying that back they 
state officials have never contacted him 
jarrell said he was suspicious about the timing of the report 
the only thing thats a little strange to us is that it came 
out two days before the election jarrell said it brings out a 
good case that the other candidates in this race are nervous about 
buz lukens 
lukens was convicted in columbus a year ago of contributing to 
the unruliness of a minor when a 16yearold girl said she had 
sexual relations with him 
the congressman has said he is innocent of the misdemeanor but 
lately has been saying he made a mistake in the matter without 
going into detail he was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined 
500 and remains free on bond while an appeals court considers his 
case 
last week despite calls from his party to resign lukens 
officially began a reelection campaign he had delayed pending a 
decision on his appeal 
also on the republican ticket are former rep thomas kindness 
who gave up the congressional seat in 1986 to challenge sen john 
glenn state rep john boehner of west chester and mort meier a 
bond underwriter from hamilton 
the nominee will be whoever gets the most votes regardless of 
whether he receives a majority there is no provision for a runoff

sugar growers contributed more than 33 
million to congressional campaigns between 1983 and 1989 as part of 
an effort to keep us sugar prices artificially high a consumer 
group says 
us sugar support policies artificially keep the price of 
sugar so high that consumers have spent billions more than they 
should have ellen haas executive director of public voice for 
food and health policy said sunday 
officials for the sugar industry acknowledge the campaign 
contributions but disputed the contention that consumers are paying 
too much for their product 
the program keeps prices stable said joe terrell spokesman 
for the american sugar alliance consumers in this country pay on 
average about what is paid in developed countries worldwide or 
less in some cases 
critics contend that the system of price supports and quotas for 
sugar is among the most blatantly protectionist of any us farm 
programs 
many foreign suppliers are third world countries whose economies 
rise and fall dramatically depending their access to the us

problems at home rather than blame each other for trade friction 
the commission on usjapan relations for the 21st century

enough to go around get on with expanding the horizons of 
cooperation while working through the disputes that frustrate 
both said a report issued by the commission last week

university of south carolina president 
james holderman says spending thousands of dollars from his 
discretionary fund on luxury hotel rooms and gifts was necessary to 
help raise donations 
i meet a lot of people who only want to meet in hotels 
holderman said sunday theyre important people who contribute a 
lot of money the hotel rooms are being used as meeting rooms 
the expenditures occurred during the last fiscal year according 
to the news of greenville and the charlotte nc observer which 
obtained the records under the south carolina freedom of 
information act 
the 533898 spent from the fund some of it paid with 
holdermans stateissued american express card was more than 
double the amount spent the previous year the total includes items 
for the school such as new band uniforms and artworks for the 
university museum as well as the travel and gift expenses 
holderman on sunday said the expenses on gifts and hotels for 
him and other officials were justified since they have so far this 
year helped raise more than 25 million in donations 
more than 90000 of the expenses charged to the account were 
spent on travel including hotel charges for holderman ranging as 
high as 826 a night records show 
state law does not limit spending by agency heads on expenses 
such as hotels but rep david beasley said the spending was a 
grave hypocrisy since university officials had asked the state 
for more money to maintain education standards 
the discretionary account is funded from the proceeds of campus 
vending and game machines and concessions it does not include 
stateappropriated funds holderman said 
among other expenditures were a 1533 boston hotel bill from 
aug 19 1988 and 2738 worth of flatware from tiffany and co 
the greenville news said 
the discretionary account was used to buy five paintings for the 
universitys mckissick museum worth 48195 holderman used his 
stateissued american express card to buy two bronze sculptures 
worth 6900 which he said he charged to the museums account

said today that economic hardship in eastern europe was causing a 
rise in antisemitism 
the congress is holding its first meeting ever on german soil 
and president edgar m bronfman acknowledged that some delegates 
had declined to attend the threeday conference because of berlins 
strong links to the nazi past 
bronfman told the 500 delegates at sundays opening session that 
a united germany must forever teach about the nazi slaughter of 
6 million jews nearly twothirds of european jewry he called the 
holocaust the lowest point ever reached in mans inhumanity to 
man 
at a news conference today he expressed concern for the 
survivors of eastern europes once vibrant jewish community and for 
the nearly 15 million jews in the soviet union 
these countries are trying to introduce democratic changes at a 
time of economic difficulties and bronfman said jews once again 
face being singled out for attack 
referring to antisemitic tendencies in such countries as the 
soviet union and east germany bronfman cited attempts to revive 
the ageold scapegoat the jew during economic hard times 
we dont like it bronfman told the new conference at the 
west berlin jewish community building the only way to fight it 
is to expose it 
he said he had received personal assurances from soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze that law enforcement officials will 
take action against those responsible for antisemitic activities 
in the soviet union ultraright members of the russian 
nationalist pamyat organization have threatened jews in east 
germany groups of young skinheads have expressed pronazi 
sentiments 
early sunday rightwing militants fought with foreigners in 
street clashes in east berlin the official east german news agency 
adn said five people were injured and eight people were arrested 
lionel kopelowitz head of the european jewish congress said he 
had also seen signs of antisemitism in romania 
during the romanian election campaign the rightwing national 
peasants party has attacked interim prime minister petre roman 
because he is a jew and some older party members have links to the 
pronazi iron guard of world war ii 
the world jewish congress was formed in 1936 in geneva to 
mobilize jews and democratic forces to stop the nazis from 
persecuting jews 
the organizations threeday meeting is to end tuesday with a 
ceremony dedicating a holocaust memorial at the villa in berlins 
wannsee district where nazi leaders met in january 1942 to plot 
their socalled final solution to kill jews worldwide the ceremony 
coincides with the anniversary of the allied victory over nazi 
germany 
the congress executive director elan steinberg said about 10 
percent of the invited delegates from outside germany declined to 
attend the berlin meeting there are 80 delegates from outside the 
two germanys at the meeting 
there are people who will not come to berlin and they have a 
right not to come bronfman said 
in his speech sunday bronfman told the delegates that berlin is 
likely to become the capital of a unified germany and inevitably 
the questions of forgiveness and of reconciliation arise 
reconciliation is possible if we speak the truth and the 
truth is that only the 6 million jews who were murdered can 
forgive bronfman told the crowd which included west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
he said a new generation of germans should not be blamed for the 
crimes of their fathers but we do demand nonetheless an 
admission of collective responsibility 
in an address to the delegates kohl said never may it be 
forgotten that the genocide of the european jews was prepared and 
directed by the national socialists nazis under the violent 
leadership from berlin 
he said it remained the duty of all democratic powers also 
those in a united germany to fight without compromise against 
those who secretly or openly spread prejudice

voters overwhelmingly rejected a 
proposed halfcent increase in the sales tax to pay for a new 
crimefighting agency touted as the first of its kind in the nation 
the proposed tarrant county crime control and prevention 
district lost saturday by a vote of 22784 against to 9179 for it 
won support from only 29 percent of the voters taking part in the 
election 
opponents had handed cards to voters on their way to the polls 
that warned your taxes are about to go up 
the crimefighting tax would have raised an estimated 45 
million a year for police courts education crime prevention 
punishment and rehabilitation programs 
advocates said the separate taxing district for crimefighting 
would have helped dissolve boundaries between governmental agencies 
and link private organizations involved in the battle against 
crime they said it would have been the first of its kind in the 
nation 
in kansas city mo voters last year approved a special sales 
tax but it was for a slightly more narrow purpose aimed at drugs 
rather than crime in general the new tax there went into effect 
last month 
the fort worth plan drew opposition from two separate fronts 
conservatives opposed to a tax increase and minority groups who 
said the plan wouldnt be an improvement 
some of the revenue would have paid for four new criminal courts 
in fort worth a stateoftheart computerized fingerprint 
identification system to be shared by all police agencies in the 
county a boot camp for young firsttime criminal offenders 
and several new community jails 
also proposed were drug education and treatment programs and 
expanded citizen crimeprevention programs 
half the money from the sales tax would have gone to county 
programs a quarter would have been divided among the 37 
municipalities in the county and a quarter would have been 
reserved for multicity projects

syria announced today it will not attend 
an emergency arab summit in baghdad capital of its archrival 
iraq arab officials said 
the syrians instead proposed that foreign ministers of the 
22member arab league meet in tunis to recommend an alternative 
venue the syrians have said they werent consulted before the 
meeting place was selected 
it was not immediately clear whether the summit would go ahead 
the syrian decision stymied arab efforts led by saudi arabia 
egypt and jordan to mediate a reconciliation between syrian 
president hafez assad and iraqi president saddam hussein and end an 
11yearold rift 
foreign minister farouk alsharaa conveyed syrias decision 
today to arab league secretarygeneral chadlie klibi who arrived 
in damascus late sunday arab officials said on condition of 
anonymity 
the official syrian arab news agency reported the meeting 
between sharaa and klibi 
sharaa suggested the arab league council convene to conduct 
consultations on a convenient venue and date for the summit and to 
agree on the topics to be discussed at the forum the news agency 
said 
the arab league council comprises the foreign ministers of the 
21 member states plus the palestine liberation organiztaions 
political department chief regarded as a foreign minister in the 
arab world 
earlier saudi arabia syrias main bankroller threw its weight 
behind an emergency arab summit in baghdad saudi arabia was 
understood to have said previously that it would not attend a 
summit in baghdad unless syria did 
saudi arabias crown prince abdullah bin abdul aziz flew from 
baghdad to amman jordan today after lengthy talks with the iraqi 
president he met assad in damascus saturday 
abdullah met with king hussein in amman the monarch who has 
also sought to mediate an end to the 11yearold break between 
syria and iraq is a close ally of saddam 
a senior jordanian official said on condition of anonymity we 
believe an arab summit will be convened for sure this month in 
baghdad 
all the indications are that a summit will take place 
especially after saudi arabia announced it will attend he said 
assads dispute with iraq and his 7yearold feud with plo 
chairman yasser arafat are the main obstacles to arab efforts 
toward a new unity 
arafat has been at odds with syria since 1983 when syrianbacked 
radical palestinian factions mutinied against him and drove his 
guerrillas out of their last lebanese stronghold 
assad has not recognized the palestinian state declared in 
1988 and still holds 2000 of arafats loyalists in his prisons 
syria and iraq have been at odds since 1979 the countries are 
ruled by different wings of the arab baath socialist party and are 
rivals for political leadership of the modern arab world 
arafat in april called for the summit to be held in baghdad to 
discuss mass soviet jewish emigration to israel middle east peace 
moves and the crisis in lebanon 
the iraqis have said they also want to discuss perceived threats 
from israel and the west against them syrian officials have 
indicated they do not take iraqs concern seriously 
in iran the englishlanguage tehran times called the summit a 
political venture by saddam to gain arab backing in face of 
western criticism of his government

nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said 
today the soviet union has not yet accepted the western allies 
insistence that a reunited germany be a member of nato 
woerner after meeting with president bush said the upcoming 
nato summit in london will most likely be held in the first 
half of july but the dates are not yet set 
the annual economic summit of the seven major industrialized 
democracies all nato members except japan is july 911 in 
houston 
seeking to calm soviet concerns about germany woerner said 
we do not want to change the balance of power to their 
disadvantage 
he said the 16nation nato compact was taking on a more 
political role to fit the changing landscape of europe 
we are clearly on the move from confrontation to 
cooperation woerner told reporters outside the white house we 
are looking at this alliance as an element of cooperation in a 
new security structure for europe 
nato will clearly be one of the essential pillars if not the 
essential pillar in such a structure he said 
he said they are moving toward a landscape of disarmament and 
beyond disarmament a landscape of minimal deterrence a landscape 
in which really all nations only maintain as much forces as 
necessary for selfdefense and stability 
but asked if the soviet union has reconciled itself to germanys 
being a nato member he replied as far as i know not yet 
woerner stopped at the white house en route to canada where he 
will attend a meeting of natos nuclear planning group on wednesday 
and thursday near calgary 
bush announced last thursday that he was scrapping plans to 
modernize shortrange lance nuclear missiles in germany and upgrade 
nuclear artillery shells in view of the shifts toward democracy in 
the east bloc 
but in a speech at oklahoma state university on friday bush 
said nato must remain the foundation for americas peaceful 
engagement in europe he promised to keep nuclear weapons in 
europe to help maintain peace 
woerner praised bushs speech saying his ideas have gotten 
strong support broad support inside our alliance 
the soviets have suggested dual german membership in both nato 
and the warsaw pact 
woerner said to be a member of both pacts is just neutrality 
without a word

monopoly players no longer need to 
buy the board game to get their vicarious thrills at cornering the 
market on boardwalk park place and other properties in this casino 
city 
wouldbe wheelerdealers can be the boot the hat the horse 
the race car the thimble or the wheelbarrow when they participate 
in a new mailorder monopoly game in which a computer rolls the 
dice 
patience is a virtue in this version which is the idea of a 
gaithersburg md company called mail games each round of moves 
takes about two weeks 
why would anyone want to play in a game that extends the 
seemingly endless hours of monopoly play into weeks months and 
years 
mail games founder glenn leyba said the answer can be found in 
the fascination monopoly has held for people since parker brothers 
first immortalized the streets of atlantic city 55 years ago from 
60 mediterranean avenue to the highly coveted 400 boardwalk 
with this game leyba added theres nobody standing over 
you telling you to buy or sell a property 
he said he got the idea after visiting a friend in new york who 
was managing a dungeons and dragons mailorder game 
in the games first year leyba has advertised in magazines 
devoted to mailorder games to attract 24 players six games of 
four people apiece players have the option of spending 2595 in 
real money for a sixmonth subscription or 4995 for a 12month 
subscription 
atlantic city tourism officials are pleased by the prospect of a 
new twist on the game that helped bring fame to their city but an 
attorney for parker brothers which owns monopoly gave a more wary 
appraisal 
i havent heard about this said new york attorney steve 
weinberg id like to take a look at it 
in recent years parker brothers has gone to court for alleged 
infringements spawned by hometown monopoly games based on local 
streets and a worldopoly game 
leyba said he checked out his product with trademark and 
copyright attorneys before marketing the game he said he has 
avoided using the style and design of the game although the game 
literature does suggest use of a monopoly board to follow along

craig and bonnie dale didnt realize what 
they were getting into when they decorated the carriage house 
behind their new home with a sculpture of the greek deity pan god 
of pastures flocks and shepherds 
the dales thought the bearded horned creature would make a nice 
rooftop ornament for the carriage house which they plan to use as 
an art studio 
but rumors soon swept the town that the dales were devil 
worshipers pan is usually represented with the head body and arms 
of a human but the beard horns tail and legs of a goat 
it didnt help that the couples victorian home had formerly 
served as a funeral parlor 
in april the trouble culminated when a group of teenagers 
gathered outside the home yelling and pointing at pan 
its just bizarre craig dale told the journal of new ulm 
people are taking it way too seriously its just a wood carving 
on top of an art studio 
the dales say townspeople who have learned about their plight 
are spreading the word that theres no reason to panic 
this thing about being a satanist is very offensive said 
mrs dale 
dale said he has no hard feelings about their chilly initial 
welcome to new ulm a largely german town in southern minnesota he 
said he realizes its easy for rumors to spread 
people dont understand and they react with fear and 
paranoia he said

to swamp rural areas along the way after devastating a dallas 
neighborhood 
emergency workers helped sandbag rising streams in arkansas a

reached a record height and began falling today but high wind 
threatened to cause more shoreline damage by kicking up waves 
the death toll from the flooding caused by last weeks 
thunderstorms stood at six today all in texas twelve texas deaths

today more than 400 residents were evacuated last week 
alester crumbley said this is the third time in a year his home 
has been flooded he moved back in two weeks ago after spending 
11000 and several months rebuilding from two floods last year 
i dont think ill be able to do it again im so deep in 
debt he said 
north texas has had 2206 inches of rainfall in the first four 
months of 1990 the most since 1922 as much as 7 inches of rain 
fell within 24 hours in some areas in past days 
flooding continued in rural counties along the trinity south of 
dallas as high water washed out levees at trinidad 60 miles 
southeast of dallas the river was 475 feet deep sunday far above 
the 28foot flood stage 
in dallas the red cross has opened shelters for evacuees since 
heavy rain flooding and tornadoes swept across north texas a week 
ago through the weekend about 1500 people had been sheltered and 
more than 12000 meals served the red cross said 
in arkansas the worst of the flooding was likely in the little 
rock area on tuesday when the arkansas river is expected to crest

north little rock scaled back emergency personnel assigned to 
floodcontrol tasks to give workers a rest before tuesday 
we feel like were in pretty good shape that weve done all

you is itll go down 3 inches per day said marshall county civil

police arrested 163 fundamentalist 
hindus on monday and stopped them from laying the foundation of a 
shrine at a place of worship claimed both by the hindus and moslems 
the disputed site in ayodhya about 240 miles east of new delhi 
was the focus of bloody hindumoslem clashes last year 
indian news reports said two groups of hindu devotees were 
stopped from going to ayodhya to lay a foundation for a hindu 
temple the arrests monday brought to 313 the number of 
fundamentalists detained since saturday in the area 
bricks for the temples foundation were also seized the reports 
said police also sealed off roads leading to the disputed site 
ayodhya was at the center of a controversy between hindus and 
moslems last year and led to the deaths of about 300 people in 
clashes in three states 
last august hindu fundamentalists announced they would build a 
new temple to their god ram on the site of a 17th century mosque 
in ayodhya the vishwa hindu parishad which backs the temple 
program maintains the mosque was built atop an ancient hindu 
temple marking the spot where the group says ram was born 900000 
years ago 
most of the deaths occurred in late october in bihar state next 
to ayodhyas uttar pradesh state as bricks for the temple were 
borne by hindu processions to the dusty town on the saryu river 
the controversy which occurred shortly before national 
elections is thought to have hurt former prime minister rajiv 
gandhi gandhis congress party lost the election and was replaced 
by prime minister vp singh 
the problems in ayodhya also contributed to worsening ties with 
moslem pakistan during the troubles last year pakistan prime 
minister benazir bhutto made several statements in support of 
indias moslems 
relations between the two countries have deteriorated further 
because of a bloody separatist campaign in indias state of 
jammukashmir india accuses pakistan of fomenting the campaign 
with arms and training pakistan denies the charge and says india 
is crushing a movement for selfdetermination 
since jan 20 when india launched a crackdown in kashmir at 
least 349 people have died in the state 
twelve percent of indias 880 million people are moslems and 82 
percent are hindus

the hired assassin who almost succeeded in 
killing french president charles de gaulle in 1962 says disgruntled 
french officers planned to kidnap try and then execute the general 
in an interview published sunday in the daily el pais georges 
henri watin better known as the jackal said the plan went 
awry before he shot at de gaulle in his presidential vehicle in the 
french village of petit clamart 
the incident was dramatized in a 1971 novel by frederick 
forsythe called the day of the jackal it was later made into a 
film 
watin now a paraguayan citizen who claims to live 
handtomouth said the novelistic version of the aug 22 1962 
plot bears no relation to what really happened 
reality is too dramatic i know my own story and one thing i 
have to make clear is that there was never a plan simply to kill 
the old man in petit clamart the plan was to kidnap him bring 
him to justice before a military courtmartial and only then 
execute him watin said 
de gualle was to be tried for his support of algerias 
independence from france 
watin said the plan was to kidnap de gaulle at sunset but the 
officers who did the figuring used an almanac from the previous 
year and got the time wrong the presidential cortege arrived 
earlier than expected 
suddenly i realized that the whole plan should be scrapped 
immediately watin said but by then it was too late 
watin said he and the two other hired guns shot at the rear 
window of de gaulles car and at the two rear tires 
for a moment i looked directly at his de gaulles eyes our 
car was right alongside his but we had calculated shooting at a 
car that was practically immobile watin said later i learned 
i had missed him by just two centimeters 
de gaulle was harshly criticized in the early 1960s for favoring 
the independence of algeria in april 1961 four french generals 
based in algiers and belonging to the secret army organization 
staged an abortive coup against de gaulles government 
shortly after the petit clamart attack de gaulle announced 
algeria deserved to become independent on july 3 1962 he 
proclaimed algeria a sovereign nation 
watin said after the petit clamart attack the secret army 
organization sent him to switzerland where he was arrested six 
months later 
he said the french government immediately sent a special police 
unit to arrest him but swiss authorities decided he was not a 
political detainee so he could not be turned over 
two years later the swiss expelled me so i went first to 
seville and then to south america i am now a paraguayan citizen 
watin said

mohawks on both sides 
of a feud over gambling agreed to put aside their differences for 
the funeral today of an indian slain in a dispute in which he had 
no part 
harold edwards jr a 32yearold ironworker died tuesday after 
being shot near an antigambling blockade on the canadian side of 
this 28000acre reservation where mohawks are torn over whether 
to allow casinos 
edwards was described as neutral on the gambling issue 
authorities said only mohawks would be allowed at his funeral at 
st regis catholic church 
gambling advocates and opponents paid their respects to edwards 
family sunday said barbara barnes spokeswoman for an 
antigambling faction 
he was a friend of everyone he always had a smile he was a 
total victim said francis boots spokesman for the progambling 
warrior society a selfappointed reservation security force armed 
with automatic weapons 
also slain tuesday was 22yearold matthew pyke an opponent of 
gambling pyke was buried friday no arrests have been made 
gov mario cuomo repeated today that his administration is 
prepared to help negotiate a peaceful settlement to the dispute 
at a news conference at the state capitol cuomo said state 
police would remain on the reservation as long as it seems to me 
to be essential 
none of the elected chiefs have asked us to remove them 
said henrik dullea cuomos director of state operations and the 
man who will head the states negotiating team some indians have 
demanded that the state police be pulled out before negotiations 
begin 
boots said he doesnt believe edwards slaying and the union of 
pro and antigambling forces at his funeral would bring an end to 
beatings gunfire and arson that have torn apart the 9000member 
reservation for nine months 
the reservations six casinos bring busloads of gamblers from 
the northeast offering slot machines bingo roulette craps and 
other games 
supporters of gambling say the casinos produce jobs and revenue 
opponents say gambling has brought drugs guns and prostitution and 
is destroying traditional ways 
the canadian military has posted 260 soldiers and 100 vehicles 
at the border and about 500 state troopers patrolled in and around 
the reservation to keep the peace despite some mohawks insistence 
that the reservation is sovereign territory authorities said the 
reservation was quiet sunday 
about 200 of the 1000 mohawks who fled their homes after the 
slayings remained sheltered sunday at a military dormitory in 
cornwall ontario 
we will let them stay as long as they want to said jim

a cantankerous canada goose has taken on the 
internal revenue service with a vengeance some taxpayers may only 
dream about 
for two months the goose has settled in on a parking island at 
the ogden irs center chasing employees and otherwise taxing the 
taxers 
she gets a little bent out of shape said dennis howland 
assistant public affairs officer she tries to keep people from 
getting into their cars 
howland said one woman was trapped inside her car for 20 minutes 
while the goose sat outside the vehicle she was finally rescued 
when she put in her windshield a cardboard sun visor saying send 
emergency help 
a woman carrying pizza to her car was chased by the goose she 
dropped the food but made it to the car 
the next day she found the goose on her cars hood 
that goose literally destroyed her wax job howland said 
a male employee was outwitted by the bird when the goose reached 
his 4wheeldrive truck before he did when the man attempted to 
run around to the passenger side the goose beat him by running 
beneath the vehicle 
thinking maternal instincts might be to blame irs officials 
confiscated the gooses nest of four eggs and moved it to the 
nearby ogden nature center but mom didnt follow 
despite the cranky nature of the loose goose employees like 
having her around and center officials have no plans to move her 
howland said 
we figure she just doesnt want to be bothered during these 
taxing times he said

opening statements in the second molestation 
trial of ray buckey began today but were interrupted when an 
alternate juror reported she was distraught over a weekend boat 
fire that imperiled her family 
the woman juror who agreed to go forward with the trial of the 
mcmartin preschool case began coughing violently moments after 
the prosecutor began his address to the jury and had to be led out 
of the courtroom 
superior court judge stanley weisberg called a recess to give 
the juror time to compose herself and see if she would able to 
proceed 
the woman told weisberg before the session began that her entire 
family was aboard the boat which was engulfed in flames before 
they were rescued by the shore patrol she said she and others 
suffered smoke inhalation 
she said she took a tranquilizer before coming to court but i 
feel very nervous and upset 
the interruption came as deputy district attorney joseph 
martinez was beginning to recount for jurors the evidence which he 
said would prove that three little girls were molested by buckey at 
the family owned preschool in manhattan beach 
he told how one child began to have nightmares and showed other 
signs of molestation during the two years she attended the mcmartin 
school 
as martinez spoke buckeys mother peggy mcmartin buckey sat 
in the audience taking notes the defendants father charles 
buckey also attended but the spectator section was not as crowded 
as it was during the culmination of another trial in which buckeys 
mother was acquitted of all charges and ray buckey was acquitted of 
the majority of allegations against him 
the district attorneys office decided to retry the 31yearold 
buckey on eight counts involving the three children a greatly 
diminished number from the hundreds which were once said to have 
been molested at the school 
the prosecution has said the new trial could last six months 
the first trial lasted nearly three years and cost 13 million 
making it the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in us 
history 
the first trial ended in january when a jury acquitted peggy 
mcmartin buckey of 12 charges the same jurors acquitted ray buckey 
of 40 charges and deadlocked on 13 other counts 
over the weekend the parents continued an inchbyinch search 
of the school and its foundation the school is scheduled for 
demolition and the current owner agreed to let the parents conduct 
their search until he brings in the bulldozers 
more than a dozen former mcmartin students had talked to 
prosecutors about a trap door tunnel or secret underground room at 
the school but none was ever found prosecutors say only one 
student actually testified at the trial about a secret molestation 
room and he didnt indicate it was underground 
a search of the school years ago turned up no passageways or 
trap doors and no signs that floor tiles had been replaced or 
concrete patched prosecutors said but the parents refused to give 
up 
the mcmartin school is now owned by real estate broker arnold 
goldstein who plans to raze it and put up an office building he 
has given the parents until thursday to do their digging 
on sunday former los angeles fbi bureau chief ted gunderson 
now a private detective said disturbed earth was found below the 
foundation 
but he said an expert was prepared to say only that there was 
a probability of a tunnel as opposed to something else such as 
a garbage pit 
prosecutors have said their current case does not depend on any 
evidence that might be uncovered during the investigation of the 
site 
the prosecution has said the retrial can be completed in six 
months

the springs are gushing but the municipal 
tap may go dry as the wine country town of calistoga famous for 
bottled water and hot mineral baths watches drought and industry 
drain its only reservoir 
the fizzy water fad has been an economic gold mine for 
calistoga but it has severely depleted municipal supplies of 
drinking water 
countless gallons of mineralrich bottled water are exported 
every day and visitors flock to calistoga to soak in geothermal 
mineral baths 
although the bottled water industry is a major contributor to 
the water shortage the water thats brought wealth and fame to 
calistoga isnt the same stuff that flows through local taps in 
part because it can erode and clog heating systems 
that has contributed to the supply problem since the bottling 
operations of three mineral water companies use drinking water to 
clean equipment and rinse bottles 
the pinch is not nearly as bad as the 1977 drought but 
officials recently extended through june a building moratorium that 
was started in an effort to stem the demand for more water 
the town is using water at a rate officials didnt expect to 
reach until after the year 2000 according to city administrator 
natasha merkuloff 
planners anticipated the drain on water supplies and spent 5 
million to tap into the states north bay aqueduct in 1980 the 
26mile pipeline has provided a buffer for the city which had 
relied on one reservoir and a few wells for its water 
but four years of drought have aggravated the situation and 
stricter state water standards reduced the useful capacity of the 
towns kimball reservoir forcing the town to rely more on the 
pipeline and less on local supplies 
within a year the city hopes to make 500000 of improvements 
to kimball reservoir to expand its supply of usable water by about 
50 percent merkuloff said 
meantime officials say the 4500 residents of calistoga about 
50 miles north of san francisco are a conscientious bunch 
you dont see people in calistoga wasting water like you do in 
other places said jo ellen noble in the citys planning 
department 
it will be business as usual as tourists flock to the wine 
country retreats famous spas she said 
the drought of 1977 is the standard to which locals compare the 
current shortage then residents were limited to 50 gallons of 
water per person per day and the town was three weeks shy of having 
the state truck in water noble said 
today calistogans use an average of only 90 gallons each per 
day less than half the statewide average 
nevertheless city officials asked industrial users to cut their 
water use two years ago after they discovered the horrendous use 
of water merkuloff said 
calistoga mineral water co was using the equivalent of 25 
percent of the pipelines entire annual allotment she said 
although it has since cut in half its water usage and signed a 
contract that specifies usage and discharge levels 
fivetier water rates charge heavy water users more she added 
municipal water has always been a problem in calistoga said 
calistoga mineral water spokesman bob pusey its not something 
new theres always been some form of rationing or moratoriums on 
building permits or hookups 
at crystal geyser water co drinking water use dropped 25 
percent last year even though mineral water production increased 
50 percent because it introduced new labeling and cooling 
equipment and began recycling water used to rinse bottles said 
chairman peter gordon 
as word of the water pinch leaked beyond city limits concern 
grew about the impact the publicity could have on tourism 
at nances hot springs where mineral water is used in the pool 
and bathhouse and only the motel relies on municipal supplies 
clerk vickie vowser has had to reassure worried customers that 
theres no emergency 
its going to hurt business she said id like to know 
who the idiot is who did this

eleven weeks ago 47 antiabortion 
protesters put bicycle locks around their necks and chained 
themselves together at the vermont womens health center in 
burlington 
they were jailed without bail because they refused to identify 
themselves in court that issue was presented monday to the vermont 
supreme court 
with additional protests the ranks of the jailed have swelled 
to 95 all being held without bail on misdemeanor charges of 
unlawful trespass punishable by 90 days in jail 
the nobail detention has sparked more protests and a flood of 
court actions that have made this staunch prochoice state a focus 
for the antiabortion movement 
the protesters say they have a constitutional right to bail when 
charged with a misdemeanor 
the courts are stomping all over our rights as americans 
said the rev michael mchugh 37 leader of the local antiabortion 
movement 
the nobail detention first imposed feb 21 has made district 
judge matthew katz the movements public enemy no 1 he says 
identities are necessary to ensure that people released on bail 
will show up for trial 
on monday lawyers for the protesters urged the high court to 
overturn katzs ruling 
its time for this court to order that the vermont 
constitution means what it says daniel lynch told the justices 
but prosecutor edward sutton argued that detention without bail 
is justified he said the protesters forfeited their right to bail 
when they refused to identify themselves 
its reasonable for a trial judge to deny bail until they get 
basic information he said there was no indication when the 
court would rule 
since feb 21 eight more demonstrations have been held at 
burlington abortion clinics 
state officials say these continuing protests prove that the 
antiabortion movement is trying to clog the court system 
we are dealing with people who may have lost their aim said 
sutton it seems to have veered over to trying to punish a state 
our legal system is under attack 
the protesters also have targeted the judge a series of 
prayer vigils outside katzs burlington home led to mchughs 
arrest on felony charges of obstructing justice 
court records also show that a protester called katz a jew 
bastard during a march 22 court hearing mchugh in an effort to 
defuse accusations that his movement is antisemitic maintains the 
court reporter misheard the comment 
mchugh also has repeatedly denied vermont is a national target 
for the antiabortion movement 
to imply that national leaders have decided to make vermont a 
rescue focus is absurd mchugh said 
but only eight of the 95 jailed are vermonters the rest are 
from canada california iowa michigan new mexico ohio 
tennessee texas washington state and the northeast 
in addition several national leaders of the antiabortion 
movement are among those jailed including joan andrews 41 who 
helped found the rescue movement in 1979 and the rev norman 
weslin 59 head of the victim souls for the unborn christ child 
headquartered in mountlake terrace wash 
in an interview from the temporary jail andrews said she came 
to vermont in response to a national call from more than 150 
groups 
we came up here because they were trying to crush the local 
movement she said 
the imprisonments also led to a recent visit by randall terry 
the national leader of operation rescue he berated what he called 
vermonts prodeath judiciary for carrying out vendettas 
against his movement

nbc which once tried to buy 51 percent of cable 
news network is planning its own 24hour news service for its 
affiliates nbc news president michael gartner said monday 
the affiliates could use the service as part of their own 
broadcasts or when nbc is dark and not broadcasting the plan 
likely will be presented to affiliates at their annual convention 
on june 36 in washington dc 
the proposal drew praise from james r sefert chairman of the 
nbc affiliates board although he emphasized he didnt have full 
details of it he likened it to an extension of an nbc news service 
called anews which sends affiliates news reports from nbc news 
and nbc affiliates 
but nbc executives have told him in broad terms what the new 
service would be and i think its terrific said sefert 
president of cosmos broadcasting corp in greenville sc 
i really cant comment until i see the full proposal he 
said when asked if he thought nbcaffiliated stations would approve 
the idea but the outline sounded good 
its too early to tell cnn spokesman steve haworth said 
when asked about nbcs plan which could prove a rival for cnn at 
least with nbc affiliates that also take cnn service 
we still are studying it haworth said but weve 
developed very strong relationships with 220 broadcast affiliates 
over the 10 years that weve been in business were certainly 
confident that those relationships will persist 
according to atlantabased cnn whose 24hour news service began 
in june 1980 51 of nbcs 208 affiliates also are cnn affiliates 
one such double affiliate is wthrtv in indianapolis whose vice 
president and general manager michael j corken is head of the 
news subcommittee of the nbc affiliate board 
corken said it was too early to say what he would do id have 
to look and see what the viability of the nbcproposed system would 
be he said 
nbc officials havent yet told him what they plan he said 
nbcs effort to buy part of cnn in 1985 failed in part because 
of its insistence that nbc news have editorial control of any 
nbccnn operation that would result if the purchase went through 
nbcs plan to start its own 24hour news service was disclosed 
in mondays editions of the wall street journal 
although not available for an interview garter nbc news 
president confirmed in a statement that such a news service is 
planned it would be an operation that is separate from the 
networks regular newscasts 
while many details are yet to be determined we have an 
outline of the plan and hope to have a final plan by the time of 
the june affiliates meeting gartner said 
discusions of the plan have focused almost exclusively on the 
issue of content the value of our service to the affiliates and 
the methods of distribution he added

rebels launched a major offensive in march 1989 to take the eastern 
city 
troops loyal to najibullah repulsed the attack in which the 
usbacked guerrillas suffered some of their heaviest casualties 
in 12 years of fighting to unseat the marxiststyle government in 
kabul 
kabuls staterun radio reported last week that government 
troops had recaptured several key outposts around jalalabad in the 
latest offensive that began may 1 
but midia said that over the weekend guerrillas in captured 
tanks rolled into government posts in the khewa district three 
miles north of the city the report did not mention casualty 
figures 
the agency also reported that government warplanes bombed and 
destroyed a stretch of the highway linking kabul and jalalabad 
about 45 miles from the border with pakistan 
it said the guerrillas had earlier reconstructed the road under 
pressure from area tribal leaders who wanted the lucrative trade 
route reopened 
throughout the war afghan traders have continued to ply the 
eastern highway from kabul to the border

pope john paul ii speaking to a joyous 
crowd in one of mexicos poorest cities said today that living 
conditions for latin americas urban poor constitute an urgent call 
to carry out the churchs teachings 
we cannot live and sleep peacefully while thousands of our 
brothers very near to us lack the necessities for a dignified 
human life john paul told about 200000 worshippers gathered in 
a muddy field 25 miles southeast of mexico city 
thousands waved yellow banners and mariachi bands played 
cielito lindo or beautiful sky as the pope swept in by 
helicopter although gray clouds sometimes obscured the massive 
snowcapped volcanic cones of popocatepetl and iztaccihuatl 
the crowd was smaller than predicted cut down by hours of rain 
that lasted into the early morning and turned the normally dusty 
valley to mud 
the theme of the popes mass was the good shepherd seated 
at a microphone next to a giant crucifix under a yellowandwhite 
canopy john paul told the crowd that the good shepherd could be 
distinguished from mercenaries because he is ready to give his 
life for his sheep 
jesus christ being rich made himself poor to enrich us with 
his poverty said the pope 
he called on all christians and all men of good will to put 
into action the churchs preferential option for the poor 
first expounded in puebla 50 miles east of here on john pauls 
first visit to mexico in 1979 
president carlos salinas de gortari has made a point of 
improving life in chalco which has expanded from a population of 
6000 in 1975 to more than 60000 today as poor peasants migrate to 
mexico citys vast urban sprawl salinas went to chalco earlier 
this year to dedicate new electric lines sewers and running water 
john paul met with salinas before flying to chalco but neither 
made any statements afterward the two exchanged gifts the pope 
giving salinas three medallions and receiving three books in return 
as the pope was leaving for a helicopter ride to chalco a young 
woman broke through security lines and hugged him she was quickly 
hustled away by guards 
in a gesture that indicated warmer churchstate relations lie 
ahead salinas changed plans at the last minute and met the pontiff 
at the airport sunday instead of sending his foreign minister 
salinas greeting the pope said your visit is a new 
encounter with the generosity of a nation of many cultures plural 
visions and deep religious sentiments 
since he took office two years ago salinas has encouraged 
improved ties with the vatican while officials have widely ignored 
strict decadesold laws that intend to keep the church out of 
politics 
in february salinas named a personal representative to the 
vatican a sign the diplomatic ties mexico severed in 1926 might 
soon be restored 
during his 13hour flight to mexico the polishborn pope told 
reporters his trip was something new and very important we 
are making efforts to improve relations between the state and the 
church 
the roman catholic church backed the ruling classes against 
mexicos native population in the 19th century which is why 
restrictions on the church were written into the constitution 
during the countrys 19101920 revolution 
the 1917 constitution denies recognition to the church and bars 
priests from speaking about politics from the pulpit or wearing 
robes in public the church is also barred from owning property 
but mexico is a country where some independence leaders were 
priests and where the catholic church claims 90 percent of 
mexicos 85 million people the government has thus struck a 
working arrangement with the church which runs schools through 
intermediaries while priests speak out on political issues 
the church is seeking to appeal to the poor and indigenous of 
latin america and the pope bolstered those efforts with the 
beatification of mexicos most revered indian juan diego 
during the beatification at the basilica of guadalupe he urged 
mexicans to emulate that humble 16thcentury peasant in their fight 
to improve society 
later the pontiff greeted people and watched regional dances 
performed in his honor the crowd cheered him wildly as night 
settled on the city 
mexico knows how to dance mexico knows how to pray he 
said it knows how to sing but more than anything it knows how 
to shout 
the 10city visit is john pauls 47th trip outside italy as 
pope his 10th to latin america and his second to mexico which he 
visited first in 1979 
along with juan diego the pope beatified a 19thcentury priest 
and three indians known as the child martyrs of tlaxcala who died 
nearly 450 years ago beatification is a possible step toward 
sainthood 
according to legend juan diego carried outofseason roses to 
his bishop from a hill where the virgin of guadalupe appeared to 
him in 1531 when he opened his white cloak the image of the 
virgin appeared on it

the united states is barring the import of 
looted peruvian archaeologial treasures to protect them from greedy 
art dealers and collectors the administration said monday 
the import ban is the strongest action possible to assist peru 
in preserving its cultural heritage bruce s gelb director of 
the us information agency said at a news conference 
the ban affects artifacts being stolen by armed looters from the 
sipan region of peru the site of rich intact precolombian tombs 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
cesar atala the peruvian ambassador to the united states said 
the ban will help us avoid the enormous lure of the us market 
the presidents cultural property advisory commission found that 
the us market for objects looted from the tombs is so large it 
is encouraging looting in the region gelb said 
intricately crafted gold gilded copper and silver artifacts 
have been discovered at the site 
michael h lane deputy commissioner of us customs compared 
the looting to drug smuggling 
we see the same techniques and the same motive greed as we 
see every day in the smuggling of narcotics lane said 
under the presidential order requested by peru artifacts from 
the region will be seized by customs agents and returned to peru 
unless the items are accompanied by an export permit issued by the 
peruvian government 
atala said the looting was preventing archaeologists from 
evaluating the material in its original sites and from studying the 
moche culture its origins and its relationship to other 
precolombian cultures 
experts have said the tombs discovered in 1987 have yielded 
important information about the civilization that inhabited the 
river valleys of northern peru from 100 to 700 ad 
lane said the ban would not be retroactive but that objects 
from the region already in the united states would be affected if 
the artifacts are proved to have been stolen 
the united states imposed emergency restrictions on monumental 
precolombian artifacts from el salvador in 1987 and on some andean 
textiles from bolivia last year similar requests from canada and 
guatemala are pending

latvias parliament today assured soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev that despite the republics 
declaration of independence it will respect soviet interests and 
hopes to open talks soon 
the parliaments message was in response to a request from 
gorbachev for information on latvias may 4 declaration of 
independence 
we express the certainty that the character of the 
declaration the retention of current constitutional norms and 
sincere desire to respect the interests of the ussr will meet 
with your understanding and open the way to a fruitful dialogue in 
the spirit of honest cooperation between equals the letter to 
gorbachev said 
latvian president anatoly gorbunov had told the parliament this 
morning of the kremlins request and charged several deputies with 
preparing a reply 
dainis ivans chairman of the latvian popular front which has 
led the independence drive called gorbachevs request for more 
information wonderful 
this gives us a chance to present our point of view he told 
reporters 
ivans said latvia also planned to send a delegation to moscow 
within days and he believed the group would be received by the 
kremlin 
delegates from lithuania which has also voted to secede went 
through a similar exchange with the kremlin but to no avail 
unlike lithuania however latvia did not suspend the soviet 
constitution when it declared independence instead merely adding 
several sections calling for independence and democracy 
gorbunov and other latvian leaders have said the republics 
declaration with its unspecified transition period to full 
independence is calculated to leave the door open to talks 
with the kremlin 
they said today the kremlins request for an explanation 
indicated moscows reaction might not be as stong as initially 
indicated 
latvias communist party chief alfreds rubiks had said 
saturday that gorbachev might retaliate because of the secession 
vote 
the soviet news agency tass quoted rubiks as saying in a 
statement on television gorbachev told him the vote violated the 
soviet constitution gorbachev said in a telephone call he might 
impose political economic and administrative sanctions if the 
baltic republic didnt reverse its course rubiks reported 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov at a briefing 
today declined to answer questions about latviathere is no 
official response yet he said 
he said rubiks statement was not a direct response to the 
republics declaration of independence 
neighboring lithuania declared immediate independence from 
moscow on march 11 and gorbachev responded by sending troops to 
occupy some communist party buildings and by cutting off fuel and 
other vital supplies 
the third baltic republic estonia last month declared its 
intention to secede but set no date and left the door open for 
negotiations with the kremlin 
as the latvian parliament convened today about 50 soviet 
soldiers approached the building and unfurled a red banner reading 
comrades have no doubt we will defend the interests of the 
ussr with honor 
thousands of soviet troops are stationed in latvia 
several latvians incensed by the ominous tone of the slogan 
shouted shame in russian at the soldiers the argument 
remained peaceful 
even before gorbunovs announcement latvian deputies were 
discounting rubiks report that gorbachev had immediately rejected 
the latvian declaration and threatened sanctions 
legislator janis krumins said latvians who spoke with valentin 
falin head of the international department of the soviet communist 
party central committee in moscow thought gorbachevs reaction 
would not be as harsh as rubiks had reported 
to threaten that there could be a blockade without having 
fully understood what happened here would be irresponsible said 
ivars kezbers a latvian lawmaker who has been involved in talks 
with moscow 
lithuanian lawmaker nikolai medvedev visiting the latvian 
capital of riga said it appeared that although the three baltic 
republics have taken different approaches to their independence 
drives the answer is the same 
he said separatists in latvia lithuania and estonia were 
forging political and economic ties with such russian cities as 
moscow and leningrad where democrats who support the republics 
right to selfdetermination have come to power through popular 
election 
the soviet union forcibly annexed the baltic republics in 1940 
they began campaigning for independence shortly after gorbachev 
began his reforms the soviet president has offered them a greater 
say in economic and political decisions but not secession itself 
of latvias 26 million residents 53 percent are ethnic 
latvians and 33 percent ethnic russians many of the nonlatvians 
especially russians oppose secession

syria announced monday it will not attend 
an arab summit in baghdad capital of its archrival iraq hindering 
efforts to patch up the 11yearold feud that has blocked arab 
unity 
officials said damascus instead proposed that the foreign 
ministers of the 22 arab league members meet in tunis to decide on 
an alternative summit site 
in amman jordans king hussein insisted the summit be held in 
baghdad as planned reflecting a deepening rift in the arab world 
over the issue 
the upcoming arab summit will be held in baghdad and there is 
no intention whatsoever to change the location to somewhere else 
hussein said in a statement broadcast by staterun jordan 
television 
i hope that arab leaders will work to make this upcoming 
summit a successful one and i also hope that our brethren in syria 
and iraq will reconcile soon said hussein 
the syrian decision stymied efforts led by saudi arabia egypt 
and jordan to mediate a reconciliation between syrian president 
hafez assad and iraqi president saddam hussein they are the arab 
worlds most bitter foes 
the official syrian arab news agency quoted foreign minister 
farouk alsharaa as telling arab league secretarygeneral chadli 
klibi fixing a venue for the summit without prior 
consultations has cast a negative atmosphere in advance of the 
conference and this certainly is not in the interest of the arab 
nation 
sharaa sana added suggested that the arab league council 
convene to conduct consultations on a convenient venue and date for 
the summit and to agree on the topics to be discussed at the 
forum 
the council groups 21 foreign ministers plus the palestine 
liberation organizations political department chief who is 
regarded as a foreign minister in the arab world 
saudi arabia jordan and egypt have been making strenuous 
efforts to persuade assad to go to baghdad and end his feud with 
saddam 
that dispute and assads 7yearold feud with plo chairman 
yasser arafat are the main obstacles to arab efforts to forge a new 
unity after years of fragmentation 
arafat has been at odds with assad since 1983 when 
syrianbacked radical palestinian factions mutinied against arafat 
and drove his guerrillas out of their last lebanese stronghold 
assad has not recognized the palestinian state declared in 1988 
and still holds about 2000 of arafats loyalists in his prisons 
syria and iraq have been at odds since 1979 the two countries 
are ruled by different wings of the arab baath socialist party and 
are traditional rivals for political leadership of the modern arab 
world 
syria backed persian iran in the 198088 iraniraq war iraq 
supplied weapons to lebanese christian gen michel aoun in his 
effort to force the syrian army out of lebanon last year 
arafat called in april for a summit to be held in baghdad to 
discuss soviet jewish emigration to israel middle east peace moves 
and the crisis in lebanon 
the iraqis have said they also want to discuss perceived threats 
from israel and the west against them 
saddam wants to demonstrate that the arab world is behind him 
amid what he views as a concerted western campaign against him over 
his drive to build up his military arsenal 
saddam claims the western effort is aimed at setting the stage 
for an israeli attack to neutralize iraqs burgeoning military 
power

former surgeon general c everett koop 
says hes worried that americans may be losing their tolerance for 
people with aids 
i fear a growing resentment against all aids patients but 
blacks and hispanics in particular koop said sunday while 
accepting the 17th annual harry s truman award for public service 
koop said americans have been tolerant of health problems caused 
by drinking and overeating but may not be so tolerant of aids 
because of the way it is usually spread through highrisk sexual 
contact and intravenous drug use 
a person becomes infected with hiv by doing things most people 
dont do koop said adding that unlike diseases that can be 
treated there is no rescue from aids 
however he said that poverty is the main reason for the spread 
of aids among minorities he added that the disease poses the 
biggest challenge ever to public health care 
koop who served as us surgeon general from 1981 until 1989 
said he knew he would be remembered for his campaign against 
smoking and his work for education about aids a disease that 
could break the social compact of america

member of aids care education and training and chairman of the

when the exclusive inn at little 
washington opened in an abandoned garage in 1978 some of the 250 
residents of this northwestern virginia hamlet considered its 
nameplate well belittling 
the sign and the residents fury eventually faded 
but now the awardwinning inn some of whose celebrity guests 
travel the 67 miles from washington dc by helicopter is again 
provoking the wrath of neighbors who fear for the towns seclusion 
and its 200yearold heritage 
the mobil travel guide ranks it as the only fivestar inn in the 
country craig claiborne former food columnist of the new york 
times called it one of the most exciting retreats in all of 
america paul newman who celebrated a birthday there called it 
a most satisfying slice of comfort and royalty 
rooms cost 210 to 490 a night dinner will set you back 68 on 
weeknights and 88 on saturdays and the waiting list is 
lengthening said innkeepers patrick oconnell and reinhardt lynch 
they want to triple the capacity of the 10room inn by adding 22 
rooms and a pool 
we thought the town would be absolutely thrilled to have 
something magnificent oconnell said what is so astonishing 
is people drive in stay overnight and leave this doesnt impact 
the schools or police its clean tourism dollars 
but opponents cannot stomach an expansion even if it is 
designed to fit in with its homely surroundings 
the town council on wednesday considers the necessary zoning 
change it has a year to make a decision 
i think its a little too great for this small town said 
kermit weakley a 20year resident 
the inn became the key point in recent local elections both 
former councilman william wickens who once proposed a ban on the 
helicopter landings and lynch lost a bid for the council 
others cannot understand the fuss 
youd think we were talking about a highrise holiday inn 
said charles eldred who owns a shop and a house across from the 
inn theyre wonderful neighbors 
mayor dean morehouse favors a middle course a limited 
expansion 
one thing we dont want to end up with is a huge white 
elephant in the middle of our small town he said the inn 
generates 65000 of the towns 130000 budget he said 
the fourblock town has a restaurant beauty salon and bank but 
no traffic lights its theater has a volunteer staff and is open 
only on friday and saturday nights 
official letterheads describe the town as the first washington 
of all and residents proudly say george washington surveyed it 
himself 
when they decided to start the inn lynch and oconnell were 
running a catering business from their nearby farm 
their creation produced instant hostility when they hung out the 
sign some residents said the little was negative but 
oconnell said they used the name affectionately besides the sign 
cost 1000 or about a fifth of their net worth in 1978 he said 
today their worth is more than 3 million and the inn has a 
staff of 55 
the inn has 24hour room service each of the europeanstyle 
rooms is lavishly furnished with english antiques the canopied 
beds are draped with imported fabrics the bathrooms some with 
jacuzzis are done in brass and marble 
we want to offer personal service much like being in 
someones grand country house but also offer the discerning 
traveler anything they can find in a luxury hotel with more 
charm oconnell said

president roh taewoo said monday that 
south korea must choose between progress or the road toward 
chaos but dissidents and radical students stepped up violent 
protests demanding his ouster 
radicals armed with firebombs steel pipes and rocks battled 
riot police and attacked governing party offices in seoul and 
several other cities dissidents vowed to hold antiroh rallies 
this week across the nation 
as roh spoke in a nationally televised address 21 students 
armed with firebombs and iron pipes charged into the seoul 
headquarters of rohs liberal democratic party and seized a 
thirdfloor office 
riot police overpowered the protesters with clubs and tear gas 
about 10 minutes later witnesses said five people including 
protesters and police officers were injured 
office windows furniture and the windshields of three cars were 
smashed and a guard post was burned 
the protesters scattered leaflets demanding the ouster of us 
ambassador donald gregg they accused him of concocting this years 
merger of the governing party with two minor opposition groups the 
merger resulted in a large conservative governing party 
about 2500 students fought police with firebombs and rocks 
outside campuses in four provincial cities and two small towns 
outside seoul said yonhap the south korean news agency 
radical students firebombed liberal democratic party offices in 
two other cities taejon and wonju yonhap said there was minor 
damage but no injuries or arrests were reported 
right now we are in a difficult time roh surrounded by 
cabinet members said in his speech we are on a crossroad where 
the country can either be on a road toward progress or fall into a 
road toward chaos 
dissident groups called for new protests wednesday in 17 cities 
aimed at forcing the governing party to disband dissidents contend 
the threeparty merger in january was an attempt by government 
conservatives to prolong power 
a statement released monday and signed by 1041 professors 
nationwide also demanded the ruling partys dissolution 
roh said the recent heightening of uneasiness had been 
partly caused by labor unrest at a shipyard and at the staterun 
broadcast network kbs he called for industrial peace and firm 
action against illegal strikes 
in ulsan about 200 miles southeast of seoul shipyard workers 
began dialogue with company executives to negotiate an end to a 
9dayold protest at least 50 workers were perched atop a large 
crane 
company officials reported little progress saying the workers 
insisted that charges against union leaders be dropped they said 
the workers also asked the company to withdraw police and guarantee 
they would not be arrested 
the hyundai heavy industries co shipyard remained at a 
standstill monday with most of its 20000 union members staying 
home witnesses said by telephone 
the workers climbed atop the crane after thousands of riot 
police fired tear gas and stormed the shipyard april 28 to end a 
strike demanding the release of union leaders arrested in earlier 
protests 
the police assault triggered sympathy strikes in many other 
industrial plants but most workers returned to their jobs by the 
end of last week 
in seoul the staterun kbs network remained crippled by 
striking workers union leaders at the two other broadcast networks 
announced an end to their sympathy strikes monday 
the kbs protest began april 12 when police raided the network 
to arrest workers denouncing their new chief as antireform police 
arrested 468 kbs workers but most were released later

greyhounds chairman declared victory today in the 
2monthold bus drivers strike but the union said the bitter 
walkout was by no means over 
the strike is over or at least it is irrelevant said 
greyhound lines inc chairman fred currey the company no longer is 
driverinhibited and is operating as if there were no strike 
currey said at a news conference at greyhounds headquarters 
the statement came two days after the company proposed a 
fouryear wage freeze and the elimination of 4500 union jobs a 
proposal the union called an insult 
the union said the strike was far from over noting the 
companys recently announced 56 million quarterly loss in 
washington spokesman nick nichols said currey should review the 
bus lines financial documents and look at picket lines for a truer 
picture of the strike 
then quite frankly he should jump on a bus and try and 
travel across the country and see how far he gets said nichols 
a spokesman for the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions 
we hope his conclusion will be to get back to the bargaining 
table he added as for the companys claim that the strike is 
now irrelevant nichols said that the company has been saying for 
weeks that it could operate without its striking drivers but that 
the companys losses were proof that wasnt true 
in his announcement currey declared a new day in the life of 
the new greyhound which he said is currently serving the cities 
that brought in 98 percent of its revenue last year total revenue 
is about 70 percent of last year 
were putting the events of the last two months behind us 
currey said 
some 6300 drivers have been on strike since march 2 
despite proclaiming the strike over currey said the company 
would be willing to negotiate with the union and there would be 
some jobs available for drivers during the summer the company has 
hired hundreds of new drivers since the strike began 
union leaders had said sunday that the greyhound offer would 
force drivers to continue their walkout which has been marked by 
violence and bitter trading of accusations 
but greyhound vice president anthony p lannie had said the 
union should salvage the 1300 jobs the company is offering or 
there wont be any jobs for striking drivers remaining jobs will 
be filled by nonunion workers if the strike continues he said 
union president edward m strait had said he would not relay the 
weekend proposal to the drivers for a vote because theyd throw 
me out the upstairs window its an insult he caled the 
company greedy and said officials dont care about their 
employees 
union members will stay out on the picket line and hope 
something changes strait said sunday bargaining talks were 
halted indefinitely saturday after the company made its latest 
offer 
lannie also said sunday the company is abandoning charter 
service in all but 19 of the 197 cities where it was offered 
greyhound had said earlier that it would not restore service at 
least anytime soon for about 30 percent of its prestrike miles 
which had been unprofitable but currey said today that the towns 
left unserved by greyhound would not necessarily be left without 
transportation as the company would work to establish van service 
or other alternatives 
in addition to cutting the unprofitable miles curry said the 
company plans to reduce its practice of running additional buses in 
peak periods when buses are full now passengers will have to wait 
until the next scheduled bus departs he said 
saturdays bargaining talks were the first since midmarch and 
followed fridays announcement by the company that it lost 56 
million for the first three months of this year 
greyhounds offer would give drivers 1279 an hour rather than 
their previous 30centsamile rate lannie said he said the total 
the typical driver would take home under the new way of calculating 
pay would be about the same but strait contended the companys 
offer amounts to a wage cut for some employees 
the companys financial situation and move to reduce services 
are forcing it to eliminate about 2000 of its 6000 driver jobs 
lannie said 
an additional 2500 union jobs would go to nonunion replacement 
drivers the company hired after the strike began lannie said 
adding that the 500 union members who crossed picket lines also 
would be kept 
the bus line told union negotiators it had immediate openings 
for only 620 striking drivers and probably could take an additional 
700 back within a few months 
although 4500 union jobs would be eliminated 2000 striking 
drivers have already written greyhound off and found other 
jobs lannie said an additional 2500 strikers are either at 
retirement age or eligible for early retirement incentives the 
company is offering he said

hundreds of delighted pupils 
returned to sullivans island elementary school on monday nearly 
eight months after hurricane hugo battered it with 135 mph wind and 
a 12foot wall of water 
it took something like hurricane hugo to make us realize what 
sort of friends we have principal fleming harris said of the 
parents and teachers who helped clean up the school 
were home and were going to be back better than ever 
the school which stands about two blocks from the atlantic 
ocean required 1 million worth of repairs after the sept 21 
storm most homes on the island of 1900 residents were damaged by 
the storm which left 29 dead and an estimated 59 billion damage 
in south carolina 
all the other schools in the state that were damaged by the 
hurricane had already reopened said raymond l morton spokesman 
for the state department of education 
until monday sullivans pupils had to attend a school in mount 
pleasant on the mainland side of the island 
ive never seen a bunch of students happier to get back in 
school said sen ernest hollings dsc who led the pupils in 
the pledge of allegiance outside the school its an inspiration 
to us how you joined hands and made it 
before going inside for a special pancake breakfast the 
schools 360 pupils listened to speeches and a high school pep band 
its been a long time since september this is a time for 
celebration harris said 
were back at the beach to teach said a sign inside the 
school 
while summer vacation begins in about a month school officials 
said it was important the pupils return as quickly as possible 
mayor melvin anderegg said it was amazing how many people came 
from around the country to help rebuild the community 
its great to welcome you today to show the fruits of their 
work he said 
pupils milling about outside the school laughed and smiled 
im really happy were back said thirdgrader tamara 
kendalls who wasnt crazy about having to attend another 
school for most of the year 
were real glad to be back agreed classmate brian austin 
it feels real good said another thirdgrader clint gaskins 
parents helped spruce up the grounds at the school and in 
recent weeks read to pupils and conducted other activities to give 
teachers a chance to return to the repaired building to organize 
their classrooms 
i just started to sob when i arrived monday morning said 
corday rice the mother of a fourthgrader i said it was the pep 
band playing offkey but i know it wasnt that 
while the school has been repaired evidence of the hurricane is 
not hard to find on the island sullivans island and the other 
barrier islands were the first land to feel hurricane hugos wrath 
tree limbs and waterlogged home furnishings still clutter many 
yards and the sound of hammers and power saws fill the air as 
workers continue to rebuild

officials in east and west berlin said monday 
they have set a target date of july 2 to drop all border controls 
and provide full free access between the two sides of the city 
the comments came after east germanys first free local 
elections in which the social democrats emerged as the strongest 
party in east berlin 
the social democrats who won 343 percent of the vote in 
sundays local elections in east berlin offered coalition talks to 
other major groups in a move designed to keep the communists out of 
the local government 
the communists now called the party of democratic socialism 
came in second in east berlin balloting with 299 percent of the 
vote 
nationwide the conservative christian democratic union of new 
prime minister lothar de maiziere finished by far as the strongest 
party but it suffered losses compared with the votes it received 
in march 18 national parliamentary elections 
the party dropped about 7 percent from the 41 percent of the 
vote it received march 18 
the leftistleaning social democrats finished second in local 
elections and the reformed communists were third repeating the 
outcome of the march 18 ballot the social democrats had their 
strongest showing in east berlin 
the communists have governed east berlin since east germany was 
founded in 1949 and the former soviet zone of the divided city was 
proclaimed its capital 
the hardline national communist government was ousted by a 
peaceful revolution last fall that culminated in the opening of the 
berlin wall 
the communists were formally removed from power after the march 
18 ballot but ran local governments across the country until 
sundays vote to choose new administrations 
the social democratic candidate for mayor in east berlin tino 
schwierzina told reporters he would start coalition talks tuesday 
with all parties with the exception of the communists 
accompanied by west berlin mayor walter momper a west german 
social democrat schwierzina said the first coalition talks would 
be with the christian democrats and the leftist alliance 90 
if schwierzina forms a threeparty governing coalition it would 
hold 85 of the 138 seats in east berlins legislature 
schwierzina and momper said such a majority would allow the 
local government to quickly open all remaining barriers between 
east and west berlin 
momper said the two set a target date of at the latest july 2 
to eliminate all border controls between east berlin and west 
berlin 
schwierzina he would push for quick opening of the remaining 140 
sections of the berlin wall and other barriers blocking streets 
between west berlin and east germany 
this condition will soon be ended schwierzina said the 
wall must go as quickly as possible 
schwierzina also said that plans call for joining east and west 
berlins public transportation systems by this fall including the 
subway and streetcar systems

american workers productivity continued to 
lag in the first three months of 1990 posting its worst 
performance in a year the government said monday 
its a reminder of what we already knew that the economy 
isnt doing too well said david wyss an economist at drimcgraw 
hill 
nonfarm productivity defined as output per hour of work 
declined by 1 percent the biggest drop since productivity fell by 
an annual rate of 13 percent for the januarymarch period last 
year 
during all of last year productivity rose just 09 percent the 
poorest showing since the 198182 recession 
increasing productivity is considered basic to boosting living 
standards because it allows businesses to pay workers more as their 
output rises without risking higher inflation 
irwin kellner chief economist at manufacturers hanover trust 
said productivity sometimes plunges in a quarter because of 
statistical quirks but the nations continuing anemic productivity 
pace is distressing 
in the long term we should be very concerned because were 
not being efficient enough to increase our living standard its 
also making it difficult to compete with other countries kellner 
said 
meanwhile unit labor costs a key gauge of future price 
inflation rose a sharp 49 percent so far this year the report 
said compared with a 45 percent increase during all of 1989 
it suggests a rockhard underlying inflation rate of 45 to 5 
percent economist allen sinai said of the increase in unit labor 
costs its not likely to get much better anytime soon without 
the economy getting more productivity 
however sinai chief economist at the boston co noted that 
hourly labor costs a major inflation measure for businesses 
rose at an annual rate of 39 percent in the first quarter of 1990 
he called the 39 percent rise a bright spot noting those costs 
increased by 55 percent for all of 1989 
economists were also encouraged by the reports figures on 
productivity in the manufacturing sector which showed that factory 
workers registered a seasonally adjusted 41 percent increase so 
far this year 
although calling the decline in the productivity rate extremely 
disappointing sinai said it was not unusual for an economy using 
most of its workers plants and equipment 
the nations unemployment rate was 54 percent in april 
relatively close to the 5 percent jobless rate many economists 
consider full employment 
low unemployment holds back productivity because companies are 
tapping the bottom of the barrel in terms of qualified workers 
sinai said 
since 1982 productivity growth has averaged 18 percent a year 
while a slight improvement over the 12 percent average growth rate 
in the 1970s it was still far below the 33 percent rate of 
increase posted in the two decades after world war ii when american 
workers enjoyed healthy wage gains and a rising standard of living 
during those decades 
output in the nonfarm sector rose 27 percent during the first 
quarter of 1989 well below the 36 percent increase in the number 
of hours worked the labor department said

chinese authorities in tibet announced strict new 
controls monday on foreign travel to the region saying each 
traveler must submit an application in advance to local authorities 
the new rules apply even to ordinary tourists making it 
unlikely that tourism will get back to the levels of before march 
1989 when martial law was imposed to end proindependence rioting 
martial law was lifted just last week 
the official xinhua news agency quoted tang zhengqi deputy 
secretarygeneral of the regional government as saying the 
controls were imposed because tibet has limited capacity to 
accommodate foreign travelers 
however authorities clearly were concerned about contact 
between foreigners and tibetans who have demonstrated repeatedly 
over the past three years for independence china has accused 
hostile foreign forces of scheming to help tibetan separatists 
several tibetan cities were opened to foreign travelers in 1983 
they immediately became popular destinations for backpackers 
traveling overland from nepal and for package tours flying in from 
the chinese city of chengdu 
about 30000 tourists visited tibet in 1986 the last year 
unmarred by bloody clashes between tibetan nationalists and chinese 
security forces 
china says its sovereignty over tibet dates to the 13th century 
tibetan nationalists say the region was actually independent much 
of that time and should be now 
authorities expelled all foreigners from tibets capital lhasa 
when martial law was declared on march 8 1989 and has allowed 
only a small number of tour groups to visit since the coldwater 
hostels where foreign backpackers used to stay have closed for lack 
of business the westernstyle lhasa hotel run by holiday inn has 
been nearly empty 
travelers who have visited recently have been given printed 
notices at the lhasa airport warning them to not to endanger the 
national security spread words harmful to our national dignity 
sovereignty territorial integrity or interfere in our national 
affairs the notices also warn foreigners not to take drugs or 
go whoring 
tang said tourists should present their applications to visit 
tibet to the regional tourism administration in practice 
authorities have been requiring such applications for several 
weeks according to westerners who said they were given forms by 
the travel agency arranging their trip 
the main purpose appeared to be to screen journalists traveling 
as tourists authorities have allowed few journalists into tibet 
since september 1987 when the first of increasingly frequent 
proindependence demonstrations was held 
four of the demonstrations since then have ended in bloody 
clashes between tibetans and chinese security tibetans say more 
than 60 people have died hundreds have been arrested

many state lawmakers have become reluctant warriors for 
electionyear tax increases plans include extending rhode islands 
sales tax to bibles and broadbased levies on gasoline in 
california and income in massachusetts 
you cant live like a millionaire if youre not one said 
new jersey gov jim florio a democrat who wants to raise 116 
billion in new taxes mostly by increasing the sales tax from 6 
percent to 7 percent 
massachusetts lawmakers have balked at raising taxes even as the 
state has earned the lowest bond rating in the nation by falling 
800 million to 900 million short of cash to pay bills new yorks 
legislators have kicked around a 1 billion revenue increase far 
beyond an april 1 budget deadline 
texas deadlocked on school financing illinois got hung up on a 
phone tax florida and massachusetts hit the brakes on gas tax 
increases south carolina faced a multiple choice and picked none 
of the above 
proposals for new revenues also are pending in connecticut 
kansas louisiana north dakota rhode island and vermont 
the need for new revenues stems mostly from the northeasts 
economic slowdown and sun belt growth that requires expanded state 
services 
theres nobody going to stand up here and embrace a tax but i 
think people realize the magnitude of the problem were facing 
said florida house appropriations committee chairman tk 
wetherell youre going to see some reluctant warriors 
a researcher who tracks state budgets says many states this year 
are putting off inevitable hard choices because they have enough 
reserves to get by or would rather wait until after gubernatorial 
elections in november 
what were seeing this year is sort of a teaser for what were 
going to see next year said marcia howard research director 
with the national association of state budget officers in 
washington dc 
one thing that surprises me is that i know of two states 
already that have raised their sales tax rates she said 
referring to texas and georgia its not as easy to raise your 
sales tax rate as it is some other thing so it can be viewed as 
pretty dramatic 
rather than hiking a broadbased tax on sales or income some 
states are targeting items such as alcohol and gasoline that only 
fuel some of the people some of the time 
rhode island gov edward d diprete steadfastly refuses to 
consider anything called a tax increase but the republican 
governor has persuaded his democratcontrolled general assembly to 
approve increasing fees for such things as auto registrations to 
stave off a 100 million deficit 
some legislators proposed expanding the state sales tax by 
closing exemptions on such purchases as bibles and 12meter yachts 
a study says that could raise as much as 15 million 
new york lawmakers facing a 15 billion deficit are piecing 
together multiple sources of income that will cost the average new 
yorker more than 55 extra this year the increase includes a 
corporate tax surcharge of 15 percent the freeze of an income tax 
cut that was due this year and a broadening of the state sales tax 
to cover such things as public relations firms and custom computer 
programming 
florida has a nearly 1 billion puzzle of revenue increases the 
more imaginative pieces are motorist fees such as a 195 impact 
fee on any car brought into the state on which florida sales 
taxes have not been paid 
last week republican gov bob martinez who is fighting for 
reelection vetoed a 47 billion plan that contained a 
4centagallon gas tax increase 
gas taxes are of limited help in closing state budget deficits 
because they often are earmarked by law for highways an 
arrangement guarded by trucking and auto lobbyists 
nevertheless massachusetts democrats are working on a tax plan 
that combines a 20 percent rise in the state income tax and a 
10cent gas tax increase from the current rate of 11 cents a gallon 
in california voters will decide in the june 5 primary whether 
to relax an 11yearold constitutional spending limit to allow the 
doubling of the state gasoline tax to 18 cents a gallon the 
measure is aimed at raising an extra 155 billion during the next 
10 years for roads and transportation but probably would free 
money for other programs

world jewish congress officials said monday 
economic hardship has fueled antisemitism in eastern europe and 
they planned a solemn ceremony at the site where nazis plotted the 
extermination of the jews 
on the second day of the congress annual meeting a us 
justice department official said washington has rejected austrian 
president kurt waldheims repeated requests for a lifting of the 
ban that keeps him out of the country the official said the ban 
remains in effect because of waldheims role nazisponsored 
persecution 
the threeday meeting in berlin is the congress first in 
germany since the organization was founded in switzerland in 1936 
amid the horrors of the third reich 
some delegates declined to attend saying a visit to berlin the 
former nazi capital would be too traumatic six million jews were 
killed by the nazis between january 1933 and may 1945 
on tuesday congress officials will visit berlins wannsee 
villa where on jan 20 1942 leading nazi officials plotted the 
third reichs socalled final solution to exterminate jews 
worldwide 
a solemn ceremony at the villa will coincide with the 45th 
anniversary of the nazis unconditional surrender in world war ii 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir used the anniversary to 
speak out against arms sales to the jewish states arab enemies he 
told israels parliament that a united germany should learn the 
lessons of the past and not sell weapons to arab nations 
at a news conference monday in the heavily guarded west berlin 
jewish community headquarters world jewish congress leaders warned 
about present dangers and emphasized the need to recall past 
tragedies 
the jewish people have something to say to the new germany 
that is going to be created in a short time said congress 
president edgar m bronfman 
he opened the meeting sunday by saying a united germany must 
forever teach about the holocaust the lowest point ever 
reached in mans inhumanity to man 
congress leaders said that in eastern europe there were 
indications of growing antisemitism fueled in large part by 
economic hardship 
decades of communist mismanagement have driven the economies of 
east european countries to the brink many jobless youths have 
turned to rightwing extremism often blaming jews and foreigners 
for economic ills 
unfortunately as the economic situation worsens and the 
search for scapegoats goes on the ageold scapegoat the jew 
again takes his place in the forefront of those to be kicked 
around bronfman said 
when you see tens of thousands of jews leaving the soviet 
union and going to israel one of the main reasons theyre going is 
because of the rise of antisemitism he said 
hundreds of thousands of jews are expected to emigrate to israel 
over the next years in part because of looser soviet emigration 
policy but also in response to what they say is increasing 
religious persecution at home there are up to 2 million soviet 
jews 
bronfman said that when he visited poland a few months ago 
government leaders and solidarity chief lech walesa issued strong 
statements against antisemitism 
the only way to fight it is to expose it bronfman said of 
antijewish feeling 
lionel kopelowitz head of the european jewish congress said 
there were indications of growing antijewish feeling in romania 
the people are hungry they look for a scapegoat he said of 
romania home to about 25000 jews 
heinz galinksi leader of west germanys 35000member jewish 
community said he also sees increased neonazi activities and 
antisemitism in east germany 
neonazis and other rightists recently went on a rampage in east 
berlin shouting insults against jews and foreigners 
galinski a survivor of the auschwitz death camp said the 
congress meeting in berlin was perhaps one of the most important 
events since the downfall of nazi germany 
the world jewish congress executive director elan steinberg 
said 10 percent of delegates from outside east and west germany 
declined to participate about 80 of the 600 delegates were from 
countries other than east and west germany 
there are people who will not come to berlin and they have a 
right not to come to berlin bronfman said were dealing with 
huge huge emotions here 
neal m sher head of the us justice departments office of 
special investigations said in a speech to delegates that kurt 
waldheim had engaged in nazisponsored persecution 
the us government in april 1987 put waldheim an officer in 
the german army during world war ii on a watch list of people 
denied entry into the country the ban followed allegations 
waldheim was involved in nazi atrocities during the war waldheim 
has denied wrongdoing 
it is also wellknown that waldheim has tried hard and often 
to be a removed from the list sher said but all such 
approaches to our government have been rebuffed he will remain 
persona non grata

a top general stirred an uproar in the israeli 
army monday by suggesting prime minister yitzhak shamir should fire 
senior commanders for failing to crush the 29monthold palestinian 
uprising 
the armed forces chief of staff reprimanded the officer maj 
gen moshe barkochba for going public with his criticism in 
israeli newspapers a military official said 
it was one of the few disclosures of highlevel army infighting 
over tactics since the uprising against israeli rule of the west 
bank and gaza strip began in december 1987 
barkochba 60 adviser to the general staff on strategic 
planning is a former head of the southern command and won a 
citation for his role in tank battles during the 1967 middle east 
war 
in prestate days barkochba fought the british as a member of 
the underground irgun zvi leumi guerrilla force headed by menachem 
begin begin later became prime minister 
his criticism appeared sunday and monday on the front pages of 
the davar maariv and hadashot dailies 
according to davar barkochba said he went public after the 
army rejected his recommendations two months ago to use tanks and 
more live ammunition to quell riots in the west bank and gaza strip 
commanders had said it would be immoral to use armored vehicles 
against civilians and that it contradicted the armys code of 
behavior maariv said 
eight soldiers have died in the uprising and 683 palestinians 
have been killed in confrontations with israelis 
the daily hadashot said barkochba sought a meeting with shamir 
to recommend that certain commanders be forced to take the 
necessary conclusions or resign for their failure to put down 
the uprising 
no names were given 
the military chief of staff lt gen dan shomron summoned 
barkochba late sunday and reprimanded him for publishing his 
allegations an army official said on condition of anonymity 
the official said shomron told barkochba his behavior was not 
becoming a soldier with his rank and standing 
the chief of staff also said barkochba could freely express his 
views inside the army but they officers were not free to do 
so either directly or indirectly through the media 
regulations bar active soldiers from giving interviews without 
consent from the military spokesmans office 
shomron 52 is a veteran paratrooper who commanded israels 
rescue of 102 hostages from a hijacked plane at entebbe airport in 
1976 
believed politically closer to the centerleft labor party than 
shamirs rightwing likud shomron was appointed chief of staff in

two norwegian skiers have reached the north 
pole becoming the first people to make the icy trek without dogs 
motorized vehicles or outside supplies their colleagues reported 
monday 
erling kagge 28 and boerge ousland 27 pulled their 
provisions on sleds weighing up to 264 pounds across 496 miles of 
arctic ice after setting out from canadas ward hunt island north 
of greenland on march 8 
we received a satellite transmission sunday saying they made 
it said trond skaare of the teams communication center the 
pair arrived at the north pole late friday or early saturday 
skaare said 
at least 12 previous expeditions failed to reach the earths 
northernmost point without animals snow vehicles or supplies 
delivered en route none got further than 105 miles the norwegian 
news agency ntb said 
ousland a deepsea diver and kagge a law student trekked for 
58 days to beat british south korean and soviet teams also racing 
for the pole skaare said in a telephone interview 
they must have gone fantastically fast said ouslands 
father odd when he heard the news 
it was a tremendous relief there had been no radio contact 
since april 24 ousland said they could have run into polar 
bears or other problems for all we knew 
britons sir ranulph fiennes 45 and mike stroud 35 started 
from siberia in early march they were leading the race to reach 
the pole unaided when forced to turn back last week it was 
fiennes fourth unsuccessful attempt according to newspaper 
reports the south koreans had 188 miles to go despite airlifted 
supplies reports said 
kagge and ousland crossed crevasses rough ice and skirted 
patches of open water they suffered minor frostbite in 
temperatures that plummeted to minus 67 but were reported in good 
condition 
numerous expeditions have reached the north pole since it was 
conquered by american robert peary in 1909 but all had outside 
help 
the 107000 norwegian expedition was funded mostly by the sale 
of 50 artworks created and donated by norwegian painter jakob 
weidemann 
an airplane was to pick up ousland and kagge as soon as 
possible probably monday 
geir ramby a third member of the norwegian team who was injured 
and flown out 10 days after the trek began said his teammates 
probably will celebrate with a hot shower when they reach resolute 
bay as early as tuesday 
after using and sweating in the same clothes for two months 
theyre probably emitting a pretty powerful stink he told the 
newspaper verdens gang

the international monetary fund struggling to 
meet increased financial needs in eastern europe and latin america 
worked monday to resolve disagreements that have blocked a 50 
percent boost in the agencys loan resources 
delegates to the spring meeting of the 152nation agency 
expressed optimism that the imfs policysetting interim committee 
will reach an agreement by tuesday ending two years of debate on 
the issue 
the increase would boost imf resources from 120 billion to 180 
billion making 60 billion more available to support economic 
reforms in poland and other emerging democracies in eastern europe 
the additional funds would also be used to support treasury 
secretary nicholas bradys strategy of reducing the financial 
burden on debtstrapped latin american countries 
the increase would require a 12 billion contribution from the 
united states the increase is certain to draw opposition in 
congress from critics of american foreign aid efforts 
the increase received a big boost sunday with the approval of 
the worlds seven largest economies the united states japan west 
germany britain france italy and canada known as the group of 
seven endorsed the 50 percent increase making final approval by 
the imf highly likely 
the bush administration however has tied its support for any 
increase to a change in the imf charter that would allow the fund 
to suspend the voting rights of any country behind in its loan 
payments at present 11 countries sudan zambia peru honduras 
guyana cambodia vietnam liberia panama sierra leone and 
somalia owe a total of 42 billion in back payments 
these arrears pose a fundamental challenge to the imfs 
financial integrity and its central role in the world economy 
brady said in a speech to the 22member committee as it debated the 
issue 
delegates from debtor nations on the committee objected to the 
united states gettough approach a coordinating group for third 
world countries said in a statement that suspending voting rights 
would not serve a useful purpose and is not acceptable 
the loan resource increase was also tied up in the ticklish 
issue of how to rearrange the rankings and voting powers of rich 
nations 
under the plan expected to win final approval the united states 
would remain the no 1 shareholder in the imf with little more than 
19 percent of its voting power japan would move from no 5 to no 
2 a spot it would share with west germany each country would hold 
a 6 percent voting share 
britain would drop from no 2 to a tie for no 4 with france 
with each country holding a 55 percent voting share 
john major britains chancellor of the exchequer told 
reporters he believed the question of rankings was almost resolved 
a third issue under debate was the length of time the higher 
loan resource level would be in effect the united states is 
pushing for a fiveyear period before the imf again takes up the 
issue other countries lobbied for a readjustment after three years 
west german finance minister theo waigel and french economics 
minister pierre beregovoy suggested a compromise might be to settle 
on a fouryear period 
none of these issues was expected to delay the final resolution 
of the financing increase the imf and its sister agency the world 
bank are the largest sources for loans to developing countries 
the fund remains pivotal to the international debt strategy 
and it will be at the center of international efforts to help 
eastern european countries restructure their economies toward free 
markets brady said monday his remarks made during the private 
negotiations were made available to reporters later 
in addition to imf resources the finance ministers addressed 
the progress so far on bradys oneyearold initiative to reduce 
the huge 13 trillion third world debt burden and the economic 
impact likely to result from the unification of east and west 
germany 
officials generally gave high marks to the brady plan which 
employs the resources of the imf and world bank to provide 
incentives to commercial banks to cut old bank debt and interest 
payments owed by third world nations 
the ministers expressed optimism that german unification will 
not produce the adverse effects feared by some economists of 
driving up world interest rates and worsening inflationary 
pressures

a 34child baby boomlet is 
overwhelming this towns fiveroom school but residents rejected a 
property tax hike to solve the problem 
despite heavy lobbying by parents residents on saturday voted 
down 263122 a proposal to override a limit on property tax 
increases officials said the override was needed because schooling 
costs have risen 25 percent 
in massachusetts property tax increases of more than 2 percent 
must be approved by voters 
the baby boom began eight years ago when 29 women in this 
berkshire hills community of 250 families gave birth two to twins 
and three more adopted children the youngsters are all now in 
first and second grade driving up costs at the fiveroom school 
worthingtons school costs are up 130000 over last year they 
account for about onethird of the towns 17 million annual 
budget 
for a homeowner with property assessed at 100000 the override 
would have added 125 to the 896 annual tax bill 
worthingtons school funds come from the seventown gateway 
regional school district town officials said after the vote they 
would wait to see how the other towns in the school district vote 
before taking further action 
we havent really decided what will happen now selectwoman 
julia sharron said monday possibly if the other towns in the 
district vote it down the school will have to go back and make 
cuts 
mrs sharron said she suspected the override failed because 
people just cant afford to have any higher taxes than they had

convoys of khmer rouge trucks 
filled with the recent rice harvest move freely through this rural 
village in northwest cambodia and young guerrilla fighters flirt 
with relaxed villagers 
we are very happy to be back in our country said khmer 
rouge division commander mit soe over coconut juice as cambodian 
government artillery rumbled in the distance 
in a scene played out in scores of villages in rural cambodia in 
recent months pol pots khmer rouge have returned to areas they 
were driven out of when vietnamese forces invaded cambodia in late 
1978 and installed a prohanoi government 
to much of the world the khmer rouge are fanatics who killed 
hundreds of thousands of their countrymen during the 1970s in a 
savage bid to create a communist agrarian society 
but despite the widely held perception that they continue to be 
universally despised the khmer rouge maintain significant and 
increasing support in the longneglected poor villages of this 
ravaged country 
since the announced pullout of vietnamese troops in september 
the khmer rouge have seized hundreds of villages in the north west 
and southwest of the country 
khmer rouge officials in cambodia and western intelligence 
sources in bangkok thailand say the group is attracting followers 
by tapping the deep suspicion most cambodians harbor for their 
historical enemy vietnam 
the khmer rouge contend that vietnam intends to swallow 
cambodia they allege that despite the pledged vietnamese 
withdrawal vietnamese troops secretly remain in cambodia disguised 
as cambodian soldiers 
although human rights groups have described strict regimentation 
and brutality in khmer rougecontrolled areas over the past decade 
the guerrillas seem to have abandoned their harshest practices at 
least temporarily 
analysts are quick to point out that most cambodians still 
loathe the khmer rouge and note that pol pot khieu samphan and 
other leaders who presided over the 197578 reign of terror are 
still in charge there is fear that if the khmer rouge were to 
return to power their murderous ways would simply resurface 
but the analysts say the khmer rouge have managed to maintain a 
support network throughout rural cambodia and have been able to 
recruit fighters since being driven to sanctuaries along the 
thaicambodian border after the vietnamese invasion 
if they were that evil they wouldnt have survived the last 
11 years there must be something they are fighting for that makes 
the khmer people join them singapore prime minister lee kuan yew 
told the british newspaper the independent in a recent interview 
although he frequently condemns the khmer rouge cambodias 
exiled leader prince norodom sihanouk recently said they have 
adopted a new style that includes scrupulously honest and 
disciplined behavior when dealing with villagers 
sihanouk who ruled cambodia until he was ousted in a 1970 
military coup predicted the khmer rouge would win many seats 
in parliament should general elections be held in cambodia 
you wont get people to vote for pol pot himself for 
president said one western intelligence analyst in bangkok 
speaking on condition of anonymity but as an organization they 
have clear popular support based on their honesty dedication and 
nationalism 
by contrast the prohanoi government in phnom penh and the two 
noncommunist guerrilla groups which are loosely allied with the 
khmer rouge are rife with the decadeslong scourge of cambodian 
politics corruption 
in recent months soldiers of the two noncommunist groups have 
also displayed a gross lack of discipline that has shocked even 
their own commanders rape and robbery of villagers occur 
frequently 
when the khmer rouge come to town you dont have to hide your 
daughter and your money said a bangkokbased diplomat 
requesting anonymity 
in the un refugee camps that house 300000 
guerrillacontrolled civilians along the thai border relief 
officials say the khmer rouge camps are the bestrun 
we have the least problems in the khmer rouge camps said a 
senior un official in the border town of aranyaprathet a lot 
less corruption their leaders are hardworking and dedicated 
nobody wants to hear it but it happens to be true he spoke on 
condition he not be identified 
western and thai intelligence sources say that as many as 80 
percent of the khmer rouge ranks are new recruits who have joined 
since the vietnamese invasion troop strength is generally 
estimated at between 25000 and 35000 more than twice the size of 
the decimated forces which fled to the thai border in 1979 
dozens of khmer rouge fighters interviewed in recent weeks in 
newly seized villages in northwest cambodia say they considered 
themselves nationalists and openly rejected communism 
the average khmer rouge soldier thinks he is liberating his 
country from the vietnamese not fighting for an ideology said 
one western diplomat in bangkok requesting anonymity 
the khmer rouge which receives chinese support says it will 
continue fighting until there is an internationally verified 
withdrawal of vietnamese troops and a coalition government 
including the three guerrilla groups and the prohanoi government 
of prime minister hun sen 
the phnom penh government has rejected any interim coalition 
including the khmer rouge which it accuses of genocide against the 
cambodian people

nelson mandelas wife winnie 
whipped punched and slapped three men and a teenager who had been 
abducted and held captive in her home a witness testified in a 
trial monday 
the teenager 14yearold stompie seipei was found stabbed to 
death on jan 6 1989 one of mrs mandelas bodyguards jerry 
richardson is on trial for his death 
richardson pleaded innocent to the charges of murder 
kidnapping attempted murder and assault eight other bodyguards 
for mrs mandela face separate trials on lesser charges stemming 
from the incident 
the three men said they survived beatings by mrs mandela and 
her bodyguards in late december 1988 they have given sworn 
affidavits saying she participated in the assaults on them and on 
seipei 
police are investigating the allegations mrs mandela has not 
been charged with a crime and denies being present during the 
attacks 
kenneth kgase 30 one of the abducted men was the first 
witness to testify in the trial that began wednesday on monday 
kgase said mrs mandela assaulted all four of the captives 
punching and whipping them and pulling their hair 
according to kgase the attack occurred after mrs mandela was 
told that the four had homosexual relations with a methodist 
minister who ran the house where they had been staying in soweto 
the methodist church says it has investigated the accusation and 
cleared the minister 
mrs mandela left the room following the attack and then her 
bodyguards also known as the mandela united soccer team assaulted 
the captives kgase said he said the bodyguards lifted the four 
above their shoulders and then dropped them to the floor 
team members also hit the men on the knees with shoe heels and 
empty bottles he alleged 
when the beatings ended kgase said the captives were forced to 
clean their blood from the floor using a broom and hose 
leaders of major antiapartheid organizations in south africa 
have accused mrs mandela of complicity in the abductions and 
assault of the four they said her bodyguards mostly young men in 
their teens or early 20s had waged a reign of terror in 
soweto the black township outside johannesburg 
the antiapartheid leaders called for the black community to 
shun mrs mandela early last year but a few months later she began 
appearing at rallies with other leaders and she is now regularly 
at her husbands side when he makes public appearances 
mandela deputy president of the african national congress has 
made no public comment on the case since being released from prison 
in february 
mrs mandela is not expected to appear at richardsons trial 
she denied last year that she was in her house when the youths 
were allegedly assaulted 
in a separate development monday the ancaffiliated alexandra 
civic association condemned the reemergence of kangaroo courts 
the civic association some of whose members had supported the 
socalled peoples courts during the 198486 nationwide 
political violence said it was barbaric that inexperienced youths 
have been judging and meting out punishment to older citizens 
the organizations spokesman obed bapela said people in the 
township were taking their crime problems to young people known as 
comrades instead of to the police because residents had lost 
confidence in the authorities 
crime in alexandra is escalating every day but that kangaroo 
courts is a crime in itself bapela said 
the public condemnation of the peoples courts was made 
after frontpage newspaper accounts monday in which a 32yearold 
woman said comrades sentenced her to 100 lashes with a whip 
stripped her in front of a large crowd and flogged her because she 
had stabbed a man who broke into her home to rape her

a nationwide phonein game costing 3 to 
battle other trivia buffs for a 1 million prize started monday 
a congressman however has said callers were gambling and he 
wants the justice department to investigate 
the game uses computer technology to pit up to nine callers 
to a 900 area code number against each other in a trivia contest 
winners avance to subsequent rounds by calling a tollfree 800 
number 
examples of the questions which have numerical answers entered 
on touchtone telephones include what year did columbus sail for 
the new world and how many keys on a piano 
secondround winners get 5 fourthround winners 100 and sixth 
round 10000 every two weeks sixthround winners will compete 
for the 1 million seventh and final round 
we think its going to be a hit said lynn folse vice 
president of los angelesbased 900 million productions 
but rep bart gordon dtenn wants the justice department to 
intervene 
participants in this game are effectively betting 299 that 
they will win money much as participants in a lottery pay for the 
chance to win cash gordon said monday 
he complained in a letter sent friday to the justice department 
that the game may violate antigambling laws the congressman 
also noted there was a potential for children to run up telephone 
bills 
there is no way to restrict the game to adults because there 
is no way to verify age levels over the telephone kids can quickly 
run up huge phone bills without their parents knowledge gordon 
said 
no one can cash a check unless they are 18 or older so there 
would be no point in playing folse argued this has nothing to 
do with gambling this is a game of common knowledge and skill 
it has nothing whatsoever to do with a game of chance

occupied the capitals central university square for the 16th 
straight day monday the crowd swelled from 500 early in the day to 
about 1500 by evening 
iliescu had previously ruled out any dialogue with the 
protesters but on saturday he agreed to meet with leaders of the 
opposition groups coordinating the demonstration 
romanian officials said opposition leaders have yet to respond 
to an invitation for a meeting tuesday morning 
but representatives of the opposition groups said monday that 
they have some hesitation regarding the talks they expressed 
concern the meeting was intended only to calm the situation without 
seriously addressing the issues 
the state radio reported one protest leader dumitru dinca had 
stopped his nineday hunger strike to prepare for the meeting with 
iliescu 
as of sunday 57 demonstrators were fasting in university square 
to press their demands for iliescus resignation 
the demonstrators are also demanding free elections scheduled 
for may 20 be delayed to give newly formed opposition parties more 
time to organize and that the electoral law be amended to exclude 
former communist officials from high public office 
iliescu has ruled out any discussion of postponing the elections 
or the electoral law saying both were approved by the provisional 
parliament which includes opposition parties 
iliescu who heads the national salvation front that dominates 
the interim government was a highranking communist official under 
deposed dictator nicolae ceausescu but fell out of favor and was 
relegated to minor posts 
iliescus national salvation front is considered the favorite in 
the upcoming election a poll released this week showed iliescu 
with support of 79 percent of the voters 
the protesters say they are seriously concerned because the 
national salvation front contains many former communist party 
members who want to introduce a reformed version of communism 
the demand for excluding communists from top government posts is 
included in a proclamation drawn up in march in timisoara by 
opposition activists who fear that the interim leadership has sold 
out the anticommunist aims of the revolution that toppled 
ceausescu 
the december revolt that led to the ouster and execution of 
ceausescu began with the shooting of antigovernment protesters in 
timisoara 250 miles west of the capital 
in another development monday supporters of the front in the 
moldavian town of vaslui about 175 miles north of bucharest 
published a proclamation attacking what they described as the 
provocative rally in university square 
the proclamation accused the demonstrators of trying to 
disturb public peace and prevent the normal unfolding of the 
electoral process 
in an apparent reference to the protesters demand to exclude 
communists from public office the proclamation criticized what it 
called attempts to instill a venomous atmosphere and sow division 
among the electorate 
the proclamation was also read out sunday by interim prime 
minister petre roman during a profront campaign rally in vaslui 
that drew 20000 people

interviewed by federal agents sunday at grand isle then returned 
to their boat at port fourchon 
no names were released 
donald lirette of dulac president of the terrebonne fishermens 
organization said the fight was a result of tension between 
longtime area fishermen and vietnamese newcomers 
he said recent bad winter weather kept boats in port much of the 
time and that coupled with several bad years for shrimpers have 
left tempers short 
the vietnamese fishermen would not discuss the incident with 
reporters who gathered at the small fishing community of port 
fourchon 
lirette recounted it this way the vietnamese heard the 
americans say they had found a little spot of shrimp and they went 
in there and tried to run the americans off american shrimpers 
have a problem because they cant communicate with the vietnamese 
they come in with those big boats and know they can run the 
americans out of the shrimp

plans to save the northern spotted owl from 
extinction could devastate timberbased small towns in the pacific 
northwest bureau of land management director cy jamison told a 
congressional panel monday 
rep les aucoin dore also said economic fallout from the 
conservation plans and reduced timber harvests could literally 
throw the entire region into a recession 
jamison said the expected impact of setting aside millions of 
acres to protect the rare owl demonstrates weaknesses in the 
endangered species act 
if the act stays the same somehow we have to look at the 
management in a different light he said in testimony before the 
hosue appropriatiosn interior subcommittee on which aucoin sits 
if you manage a little area for the spotted owl here and an 
area for the desert tortoise over here and an area for something 
else here you end up with a hodgepodge on a map pretty soon you 
have no management system out there at all 
the fish and wildlife service is to decide june 23 whether to 
list the spotted owl as a threatened or endangered species which 
would require government agencies to protect its habitat the 
oldgrowth forests of the northwest 
a panel of government scientists led by forest service biologist 
jack ward thomas alredy has recommended an end to logging across 
large sections of federal lands in the northwest to keep the owl 
alive 
last week the forest service and the bureau of land management 
said that if the thomas recommendation is adopted timber harvests 
on northwest federal lands will be cut nearly in half over the next 
five years causing a net loss of about 13000 jobs in oregon 
washington and northern california 
jamison said his agency has identified 72 communities in oregon 
with populations of 3000 or fewer of those half or more are 
almost entirely dependent on the timber industry he said 
we would basically affect one whole strata of the communities 
in your state oregon if that isnt drastic i dont know what it 
is he said for those communities affected it could be 
devastating 
we are really talking aobut enormous staggering economic 
consequences 
aucoin said there is nothing that has come close to this in 
the entire history of the endangered species act

elections spent 127 million in the 15 months ending march 31 and 
had nearly 140 million on hand to begin the final months of the 
campaign season the federal election commission said monday 
the agencys analysis of 1990 congressional campaign 
fundraising and spending from january 1989 through march showed 
the benefits of incumbency particularly in receiving donations 
from political action committees 
incumbents had a more than 6to1 overall fundraising edge over 
challengers and a 16to1 edge when it came to pac donations 
according to the fec data 
overall the fec computer analysis showed receipts by 1990 
congressional campaigns totaled 1925 million from jan 1 1989 
through the end of march 7 percent more than was raised in the 
comparable period in the 198788 election cycle 
of those receipts 150 million went to incumbents and 
incumbents accounted for the 946 million of the reported 127 
million in spending 
the 127 million spent by 1269 candidates for house and senate 
seats up this year represents a 12 percent increase over the 
198788 cycle at this point two years ago 1344 candidates had 
spent 113 million 
the analysis was based on the quarterly finance reports all 
campaigns were required to file last month the reports detail 
campaign activity through march 31 and include all candidates who 
raised and spent money on 1990 congressional races even if they 
since have dropped out 
for many candidates the campaign season and its accompanying 
fundraising is just kicking into high gear but the fecs 
computer analysis showed the campaigns had a combined 1385 
million on hand at the end of march 
the clear leader in cash on hand was sen phil gramm rtexas 
who reported having 65 million as of march 31 the house 
candidate with the most on hand was california democratic rep mel 
levine with 15 million seventy candidates most of them 
longshots in house races reported zero balances 
the biggest spender so far on a 1990 senate race was new jersey 
democrat bill bradley who reported spending 36 million so far on 
his reelection effort leading spending for 1990 house races was 
california republican rep robert dornan who reported spending 
968525 as of march 31

contributions and 419 million from pacs 
the 118 senate candidates raised 83 million and spent 47 
million in the 15month period with 562 million of the receipts 
coming from individuals and 196 million from pacs

receipts of 150 million in the 15month period dwarfing the 234 
million raised by 600 challengers another 19 million was raised

latvia promised soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev on monday that the baltic republic will respect soviet 
interests despite its declaration of independence and expressed 
the hope that talks would open soon 
hours before gorbachev had asked for complete information about 
latvias independence declaration last friday 
latvian president anatoly gorbunov immediately assigned several 
members of parliament to prepare a reply 
also monday latvias parliament also elected a new prime 
minister ivars godmanis a physics professor and leader of the 
popular front 
chairman dainis ivans of the latvian popular front which has 
led the push for independence called gorbachevs request 
wonderful 
he told reporters this gives us a chance to present our point 
of view the letter from parliament explained certain points in 
the declaration then concluded we express the certainty that 
the character of the declaration the retention of current 
constitutional norms and sincere desire to respect the interests of 
the ussr will meet with your understanding and open the way to 
a fruitful dialogue in the spirit of honest cooperation between 
equals 
on monday gorbachev condemned separatists in a speech to a 
group of veterans but the tass report did not say he mentioned 
latvia directly 
there are forces that would like to use the atmosphere of 
democracy glasnost and freedom to implement their futile ambitious 
plans including separatist plans he said adding that their 
policy was irresponsible 
latvia plans to send a delegation to moscow this week ivans 
said and he thinks the delegation will be received 
a similar effort by lithuania which declared independence march 
11 proved fruitless 
the soviet president imposed an oil and natural gas embargo on 
lithuania idling 12500 workers he refuses to negotiate with 
lithuania until the republic of 38 million people rescinds several 
laws passed after independence was declared 
lithuania also must return to the soviet unions constitutional 
framework gorbachev says 
the three baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia were 
forcibly absorbed into the soviet union in 1940 soon after 
gorbachev began his reforms all three initiated independence 
drives he offered them more say in economic and political 
decisions but said secession would have to be by soviet law 
of latvias 26 million residents just over half are ethnic 
latvians and a third are ethnic russians many of the nonlatvians 
especially russians oppose secession 
latvia unlike lithuania did not suspend its soviet 
constitution upon declaring independence it just added sections 
calling for independence and democracy 
estonia last month declared it intends to restore its 
independence and called the soviet union an occupying power but 
it set no date for the split and left the door open for 
negotiations gorbachev threatened estonia but took no action 
against it 
lithuanian lawmaker nikolai medvedev visiting riga said it 
appeared that although the three baltic republics have taken 
different approaches to their independence drives the answer is 
the same 
gorbunov and other latvian leaders have emphasized that latvias 
declaration with its unspecified transition period to full 
independence is calculated to leave the door open to talks 
with the kremlin 
on saturday night latvian communist party chief alfreds rubiks 
said he had spoken with gorbachev that gorbachev ruled out talks 
and was considering sanctions instead 
but latvian politicians and soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov said monday that rubiks account did not 
constitute an official reaction 
godmanis the new prime minister told parliament his economic 
plan included denationalization of some industries rationing of 
some basic foodstuffs and free market prices on most other products 
he said the government would work to strengthen economic 
cooperation among the three baltic republics and foster direct ties 
between latvia and various soviet regions 
thousands of soviet soldiers continued to rehearse for the may 9 
parade in riga celebrating victory in europe in world war ii but 
ivans said latvians were refusing to consider it intimidation such 
as the repeated tank movements used in lithuania to unnerve 
independence activists there 
it might mean a demonstration of force ivans admitted 
but we are trying to approach it very tolerantly 
about 50 soviet soldiers approached the latvian parliament 
building when mondays session opened they unfurled a red banner 
reading comrades have no doubt we will defend the interests of 
the ussr with honor thousands of soviet troops are stationed 
in latvia 
latvians incensed by the slogans ominous tone shouted 
shame in russian at the soldiers the argument remained 
peaceful

jurors were urged monday to return a murder 
verdict against a white man accused of shooting a black teenager 
who ventured into a mostlywhite neighborhood and encountered an 
angry mob 
the attack blamed on defendant joseph fama stirred racial 
tension in the brooklyn neighborhood where the slaying occurred and 
throughout the city 
the victim yusuf hawkins 16 went to the bensonhurst 
neighborhood aug 23 with two friends looking for a used car and 
was beset by a group of batwielding white youths hawkins was shot 
through the chest 
when the mob turned that corner what did they know about yusuf 
hawkins asked the prosecutor assistant district attorney edward 
boyar they knew the color of his skin that was the only thing 
they knew about yusuf hawkins 
pointing across the courtroom at the 19yearold defendant 
during his closing argument the prosecutor said the evidence 
clearly and beyond a reasonable doubt proves joseph fama was the 
one who took a gun and pointed it at the body of yusuf hawkins 
and with a wanton disregard for human life shot again and again and 
again 
defense lawyer david depetris in his closing presentation 
attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses including two 
jailhouse informants who testified fama told them he killed hawkins 
the state court jury began deliberating after receiving 
instructions from justice thaddeus owens 
fama was charged with two counts of seconddegree murder he 
also was charged with riot assault unlawful imprisonment 
menacing harrassment discrimination and weapons possession 
summations in the case against famas codefendant keith 
mondello also charged with two counts of seconddegree murder 
were scheduled for tuesday the two were tried in the same 
courtroom but with different juries six other youths are to be 
tried later 
the judge rejected a lastminute effort to reopen the defense 
case by depetris who said a key prosecution witness franklin 
tighe was prepared to recant his earlier testimony 
tighe a 20yearold bensonhurst resident with a long history of 
mental illness including hallucinations was the only witness to 
say he saw fama pull an automatic pistol and shoot hawkins 
since taking the witness stand on april 27 depetris said tighe 
contacted him and said he wasnt standing next to fama when hawkins 
was shot as he had testified 
its too late now the judge said in refusing to allow 
tighe who was waiting outside the courtroom to take the stand 
the whole thing sounds suspicious to me 
the exchange took place outside the presence of the jury 
after owens refused to reopen the trial depetris showed 
reporters a 26minute videotaped interview of tighe in which the 
witness says he wasnt standing next to fama 
depetris told the jury tighe believed what he was saying when he 
testified but he said that the stress of coming upon hawkins who 
was dying on the street triggered hallucinations in the mentally 
unstable man 
in his summation boyar was highly critical of the many 
residents of the mostly white neighborhood who saw much or all of 
the attack but refused to come forward 
he spoke of the door stoops where the brother and sisterhood 
of bensonhurst sat watching but not seeing hearing but not 
listening as hawkins was surrounded by a white mob and shot 
through the chest

the white house put aside president bushs 
pledge against new taxes and said monday that talks to strike a 
budget deal with congress will have no preconditions 
although bushs position on taxes is well known he wants 
an open debate that is unfettered with conclusions about 
positions taken in the past said his press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
republicans involved in talks on capitol hill praised the white 
houses acknowledgement that all ways of reducing the deficit would 
be negotiable 
thats the only way he can do the job said rep bill 
frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the house budget 
committee 
there isnt any president who hasnt tried to make good on his 
promises theres no president who hasnt lived through times that 
change and maybe outdate some promises he said 
but sen pete domenici of new mexico senior republican on the 
senate budget committee predicted it would be tough to pass a 
budget that includes tax increases 
it would be hard to get anybody to agree to that not just 
republicans domenici said the question is overall how strong 
is the package in deficit reduction so tradeoffs are worth it 
fitzwater said bush intends to follow up his sunday night 
session with the four top congressional leaders with further 
meetings with lawmakers this week to discuss how to break the 
logjam that has persisted nearly a decade 
he will talk strategy on tuesday with house and senate 
republican leaders and hopes to hold another bipartisan session 
later in the week fitzwater said 
sixteen leading house and senate democrats met for an hour in 
the capitol and said afterward that they would consult with 
rankandfile lawmakers tuesday 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said the 
leaders discussed who would be involved in talks with the 
administration and when the discussions would start 
asked if the members at the meeting agreed that negotiations 
should begin mitchell said various opinions were expressed 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he believed 
congressional democrats would inform the white house about their 
desires by wednesday 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
he was willing to consider new levies including excise taxes and 
raising the income tax rate for topincome taxpayers particularly 
if bush continues to seek a cut in the capital gains tax 
if hes talking about reducing capital gains then i think 
obviously one of the places you look at is the tax rate bentsen 
said in an interview 
he said democrats would not require bush to endorse publicly a 
specific tax increase as a precondition to agreement 
i think that its a question of walking that plank together 
he said 
many democrats have advocated raising the maximum income tax 
rate to 33 percent for the 600000 wealthiest americans who now 
pay a 28 percent rate some members of both parties have also 
talked about boosting levies on gasoline imported oil cigarettes 
beer and alcohol 
the administration negotiated with members of congress last year 
on a compromise budget but the white house is pursuing a 
bipartisan budget pact even more intensely this year 
fearing that rising interest rates would seriously damage the 
economy the administration initiated the budget talks following 
the recent approval of rival 12 trillion budget propsals by the 
full house of represenatives and the senate budget committee 
bush shares with congressional leaders anxiety over a deficit 
that is fighting every reduction attempt that we can come up 
fitzwater said 
bushs own fiscal 1991 budget was never seriously considered by 
congress and the administration claims both house and senate 
measures would fall short of reducing the deficit over 150 
billion this year to the 64 billion required under the 
grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
failure to make this target will touch off automatic 
acrosstheboard spending cuts 
congressional leaders have said that getting the deficit down to 
the required range to avoid the automatic trigger would almost 
certainly require substantial tax increases 
fitzwaters comments monday generally reflected what 
participants in sunday nights white house meeting had reported 
that bush had assured them everything was on the table 
at his daily briefing for reporters fitzwater repeatedly 
declined to say whether bushs 1988 campaign vow of no new 
taxes was still in force bush has not repeated his promise in 
months

the italian communist party failed to stem its 
decline in local elections sunday and monday in 15 of the countrys 
20 regions partial results indicated 
the longdominant christian democrats suffered small losses and 
the socialists italys no 3 party scored gains according to 
early results and to projections on state tvs evening newscasts 
more than eight hours after polls closed 
local parties demanding greater regional autonomy in lombardy 
and veneto in the north showed surprising success 
up for election were 15 of 20 regional governments 87 
provincial governing councils and 6374 city governments city 
elections were not being held in such major centers as rome 
naples trieste catania and bolzano 
by 10 pm results were complete in twothirds of the 
precincts complete official results were expected tuesday 
the elections were considered an important barometer of support 
for the governing coalition which includes christian democrats and 
socialists and for the communists who decided on a new course at 
an extraordinary congress in march 
with 49267 of 73965 precincts reporting the communists had 24 
percent down from 302 percent in regional elections five years 
ago and from 278 percent in parliamentary voting in 1987 
christian democrats had 338 percent down from 35 percent five 
years ago and from 342 percent in the 1987 parliamentary vote 
the socialists had 147 percent up from 133 percent and 143 
percent respectively 
the communist party has been steadily losing strength after 
coming to the brink of power a decade ago it decided to enter a 
transition phase that could lead to changing its name and dropping 
its hammerandsickle symbol 
but the move angered many oldline communists and party leader 
achille occhetto said he would be content with 23 percent of the 
vote 
occhetto said on state tv that the partys poor showing would 
not alter the communist reformist course to do otherwise would 
be catastrophic he said 
he indicated the decline reflected the beatings taken by eastern 
european leftist parties in recent elections following the toppling 
over the past year of communists regimes there 
final projections indicated the communists would get 236 
percent down from 302 percent five years ago and 278 percent in 
1987 the christian democrats 331 percent down from 35 percent 
five years ago and 342 percent in 1987 and the socialists 154 
percent up from 133 percent and 143 percent respectively

democrats and liberals 
christian democratic party secretary arnaldo forlani said the

a salvadoran death squads threatening 
letter to an accountant for a landreform group gave him legitimate 
grounds to seek political asylum in the united states a federal 
appeals court ruled monday 
the death squad was arguably tied to el salvadors 
government the 9th us circuit court of appeals said the 30 
ruling barred the planned deportation of wilfredo mendoza perez and 
ordered reconsideration of his request for political asylum 
though the government did not control the death squad testimony 
about the killings of others who worked for mendozas organization 
suggested that people in such groups were in danger the court 
ruled 
the threat to mendoza was specific and real and persecution was 
more likely than not if he returned to el salvador the court said 
given mendozas involvement with a land reform organization 
and the apparent rightwing death squad mendozas testimony that 
his feared persecution is politically motivated finds support in 
the record said the opinion by judge jerome farris 
mendoza testified that he was an accountant with the salvadoran 
communal union for almost five years before he left the country and 
entered the united states illegally in 1982 he said he had been 
helping landless farmers form and manage cooperatives throughout 
the country 
the court decision reversed a board of immigration appeals 
ruling that denied mendozas request to stop his deportation since 
asylum is at the discretion of the attorney general that portion 
of the case was sent back to the justice department for a decision 
mendoza lives in phoenix with his wife and children the 
immigration and naturalization service began deportation 
proceedings after arresting mendoza about 10 months after he 
arrived in the us 
an ins judge denied mendozas request to stop his deportation 
and receive political asylum the board of immigration appeals 
affirmed that decision in october 1988 
mendoza said that shortly before he left el salvador he 
received a letter threatening him if he did not leave the country 
within 48 hours he said officials of the salvadoran communal union 
told him to take the threat seriously 
his attorney carolyn p blum called the appeals courts 
decision and mendozas prospects for asylum exciting and 
wonderful for him she said the ins boards decision had been 
outrageous 
she said the decision would send a message that the people who 
actively participate and work with groups in countries like el 
salvador and guatemala can receive asylum in the united states 
philip waters acting regional director for the ins in san 
francisco declined comment on the case until he and officials in 
washington studied the decision

thousands of israelis demanding electoral 
reform on monday booed legislators as they drove past the crowd to 
reach parliament for the opening of the summer session 
dozens of police officers held back about 4000 protesters as 
they jeered and waved placards reading we are sick of you and 
no less than democracy 
the rally was the latest protest by a growing electoral reform 
movement the protests were sparked by the political horsetrading 
following the march 15 collapse of the ruling coalition of the 
leftleaning labor party and the rightwing likud bloc 
the two rival parties have been trying the past six weeks to 
lure defectors from each others camps with offers of political 
posts and money there were growing signs monday that another 
likudlabor coalition could be in the offing 
israel television reported both parties were considering a 
compromise proposal by the national religious party that would 
avoid a clear yesorno answer to us mideast peace proposals 
the coalition government was toppled by labor after likud 
refused to accept proposals by secretary of state james a baker 
iii that would lead to an israelipalestinian dialogue in cairo 
at the protest rally in front of parliament meanwhile the 
crowd chanted we are fed up as legislators drove past 
the general feeling is that there is nobody who is actually 
representing you said mike marmer a rabbinical student who 
immigrated from london four years ago 
another demonstrator veteran soviet jewish activist vladimir 
slepak said he never expected he would one day protest against the 
israeli government 
in the soviet union we knew there was one party and we knew 
what they would do but here nobody knows what will be tomorrow 
said slepak who arrived in israel after waging a long fight 
against soviet authorities for permission to emigrate 
rally organizers accused politicians of abusing democracy and 
demanded that president chaim herzog appoint an independent 
commission to work out a new electoral system 
the campaign led by dozens of israeli mayors and army reserve 
officers has collected more than a halfmillion signatures 
under israels current system voters choose party slates and 
the country is treated as one electoral district a party needs 
only one percent of the vote to win a seat in the 120member 
parliament no party has ever won enough votes to rule alone and 
smaller factions are often cast in the role of kingmaker 
israelis are used to protracted coalition negotiations after 
each election but this time neither labor nor likud appears able 
to break a 6060 tie 
labor leader shimon peres failed after five weeks of 
negotiations and now caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir is 
trying to form a ruling coalition without labor 
but shamirs plans have been thwarted by two religious parties 
the national religious party and shas that support shamir in 
principle but insist that he form another government with labor 
under the national religious partys compromise a new 
likudlabor coalition would be based on the guidelines of the 
outgoing government including shamirs proposal to hold elections 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to determine negotiators 
for peace talks with israel 
but decisions concerning the peace process would be made by the 
full 25member cabinet which also includes ministers from smaller 
coalition partners 
in the outgoing government such decisions were made by the 
12member inner cabinet in which only labor and likud were 
represented the forum was usually deadlocked along party lines

a weak prosecution case and 
missing evidence make it unlikely those blamed for the november 
slaying of six jesuit priests and two women will be convicted a 
court source said monday 
the united states has warned el salvador it could face a cutoff 
of 85 million in annual military aid if it fails to actively 
pursue its investigation of the deaths of the priests the house 
foreign relations committee has approved a proposal to that effect 
the source at el salvadors 4th criminal court who insisted on 
anonymity told the associated press he believed col guillermo 
benavides commander of the military school at the time three 
lieutenants and five soldiers charged with the crime stood a good 
chance of being acquitted 
the source said the only evidence introduced against benavides 
is testimony from other suspects under salvadoran law a person 
accused in the same case cannot testify against a codefendant 
the evidence makes it difficult to convict benavides the 
principal suspect the source said 
the difficulties are compounded because the four cadets who 
could testify in the case were sent out of the country the source 
said also a logbook and a personal diary that could document 
benavides movements have been reported by authorities to be lost 
the disclosures regarding the cadets and the diary were made in 
mondays editions of the new york times 
all these problems raised obstacles to the courts effort to 
find out if any other highranking military men are involved or are 
trying to cover up for the murderers the source said 
gen humberto larios the defense minister said sending the 
cadets abroad was part of a project but if the judge 
considers the presence of the cadets convenient they could be 
recalled 
a personal diary that benavides was reported to have kept has 
also not been found the source said the source said benavides 
mentioned the diary out of court but later denied it existed 
no one has seen the diary the court never had possession of 
it as far as i know the source added 
the court also asked the high command for the academy guard 
logbook which would show who entered and left the academy nov 
1516 but the military claimed it was lost the source said 
the six priests their housekeeper and her daughter were rousted 
from their beds by uniformed soldiers at the central american 
university campus the night of nov 16 and shot to death 
the slayings occurred during the worst offensive by leftist 
guerrillas in a decade of civil war the campus branded a bastion 
of leftist thought by conservatives was under military control and 
a dawntodusk curfew at the time of the killings 
the four cadets on guard duty at the military school the night 
of the murders were sent to the united states and panama the court 
source said and when the judge asked them to testify he was told 
they were out of the country 
col sigifredo ochoa perez a retired officer publicly accused 
the military high command of protecting those who ordered the 
killings 
ochoa now a national assembly member from the conservative 
ruling arena party said benavides carried out the slayings on 
orders from above but he did not offer proof 
judge ricardo zamora who is handling the case refused to talk 
to reporters but the source said he recently had a long interview 
with officials of the us embassy 
about 72000 people have been killed in el salvadors civil war 
mostly civilians slain by rightist death squads

birendra to surrender his stranglehold on political power police 
arrested hundreds of protesters 
nepali congress party secretary general girija prasad koirala

more than 300 homes were evacuated by monday because of a slowly 
rising river in central arkansas and a texas river on a record 
rampage claimed scores of homes as it bulged out to 2 miles wide 
a reservoir on the texasoklahoma line hit a record of more than 
27 feet above normal after flooding more than 80 homes and began 
falling monday but only at a rate of about 6 inches a day 
thirteen deaths have been blamed on the weather during the past 
two weeks one in oklahoma and the rest in texas 
texans living in rural areas south of dallas were fleeing 
flooded homes as the trinity river swollen from the worst 
northern texas flooding in more than 80 years rolled slowly 
southward through homes fields and pastures toward the gulf of 
mexico 
near palestine about 90 miles southeast of dallas red cross 
officials said about 50 homes had been destroyed or sustained major 
damage sunday in the lakeside community of long lake 
we cant tell exactly how many residences are affected yet 
because we cant count underwater said bill walters manager of 
a red cross shelter set up in a campground about 100 feet from the 
river 
he said the victims saved practically nothing the water came 
up too quickly 
walters said that although the trinity had widened to about two 
miles at long lake many residents were reluctant to leave 
these people are pretty stubborn as all texans are they 
think they can stick it out but they really cant do it he said 
in spite of the amount of water at long lake anderson county 
sheriffs dispatcher troy freeman said hed been told the river 
wouldnt crest there until friday 
and 90 miles back up river water still had not fully drained 
out of a dallas neighborhood monday was the fifth day residents of 
the rochester park neighborhood ere out of their homes more than 
400 people were evacuated late last week before the water rose 
above rooftops 
in trinidad about 60 miles southeast of dallas at least 150 
people had been evacuated and main roads reported closed 
in central arkansas relief workers stayed busy around the clock 
shoring up levees sandbagging and helping residents rescue valued 
items from homes likely to be inundated by the arkansas river 
arkansas gov bill clinton added two more counties to last 
weeks disaster declaration monday bringing the total to 29 
counties 
an estimated 325 houses were evacuated in six counties said 
state office of emergency services spokesman gary talley 
the river was expected to crest 5 feet above flood stage tuesday 
at little rock downstream in the area of pine bluff water was up 
to 3 feet deep in homes in some lowlying areas officials said 
officials said the flooding along the arkansas river was the 
worst since a 1927 rampage that prompted construction of many of 
the levees along the river 
lake texoma on the texasoklahoma line crested during the night 
at a record 64476 feet above sea level or nearly 5 feet above the 
overflow spillways only the second time since the dam was built 
that water flowed out the spillways 
mike mccoy of the army corps of engineers said he expects it 
will take 45 to 60 days for the lake to return to a decent 
level as the corps plans to try to lower it by 6 to 9 inches a day 
a preliminary survey sunday found 83 homes at least partially 
submerged in oklahomas marshall county which is partly cut off 
from the outside by the swollen lake which has flooded some 
highways 
highway flooding made life strange for judy peterson who works 
in madill okla 
instead of simply driving the 18 miles from her home on sand 
point to the office she and her husband now must first take a boat 
a halfmile and then drive a circuitous 56mile route around the 
northern edge of lake texoma and back to madill theyd been doing 
that for a week as of monday 
its really getting old she said

croatias independence from the rest of yugoslavia took a 
commanding lead monday in early returns from the final round of the 
republics first free elections in 50 years 
with partial votes from 95 constituencies counted candidates 
for the croatian democratic union were leading in 48 
constituencies the communists were ahead in 34 districts and 
independents and other smaller parties led in the remaining 13 
the vote is considered crucial to the future of the fragile 
yugoslav federation 
the apparent victory of the croatian democratic union is likely 
to exacerbate political and ethnic tensions with yugoslavias five 
other constituent republics particularly with serbia the 
countrys largest republic 
about 15 million croatians voted sunday and monday in 111 
constituencies throughout the republic for the remaining 225 seats 
in the regions parliament final results were not expected until 
tuesday at earliest 
in the first round of voting april 2223 the democratic union 
won 104 of the 131 seats decided for the 356seat tricameral 
regional parliament 
the croatian communist party renamed the party for democratic 
reform gathered only 13 seats in the first round while the 
centrist coalition for national accord considered a preelection 
favorite won three 
croatians voted for us because we have offered them democracy 
to replace years of oneparty monopoly democratic union leader 
franjo tudjman said in a monday interview 
now we have to start fulfilling everything we promised to our 
voters he said celebrating his apparent victory with champagne 
at the partys zagreb headquarters 
tudjman waged his partys campaign largely on nationalist 
sentiments advocating croatias political and economic 
independence from the rest of yugoslavia 
he says yugoslavias republics should become independent states 
and establish relations only if they have common interests 
the reform communists say the national federation model is 
adequate but if it fails to reflect the republics needs in the 
future yugoslavia should become a confederation without central 
rule 
tudjman 66 became yugoslavias youngest army general but 
later spent five years in jail after being convicted of croatian 
nationalism and hostile activities against the state 
his bid for power has fueled a rivalry between croatia the 
secondlargest republic and serbia that dates to the creation of 
yugoslavia after world war ii 
serbias media strongly influenced by the republics hardline 
communist leaders has accused the democratic union of fascism 
yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two 
autonomous provinces torn by ethnic and ideological tensions 
croatia and slovenia are pushing for democratic reforms and 
closer ties with the west the centerright demos coalition won 
aprils free parliamentary elections in slovenia and is 
establishing the first noncommunist regional government in 
yugoslavia in more than 40 years 
serbia and montenegro have not legalized opposition parties

state sen andrew jenkins was convicted monday 
by a federal jury in a scheme to help a supposed texas financier 
launder 150000 in cash through a bank in zaire 
the financier was really an undercover fbi agent who arrested 
jenkins after giving him a briefcase with the money at a manhattan 
hotel in august 1987 
jenkins 48 was charged under a seldomused law that makes it a 
crime to accept deposits without authority to engage in banking 
business in the united states he also was charged with using the 
telephone in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to 
promote a crime 
each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison 
and a 250000 fine us district judge charles metzner set july 
26 for sentencing 
jenkins seat became vacant upon his conviction 
jenkins a democrat who represents the borough of queens showed 
no emotion as the verdict was announced and left the manhattan 
courtroom without commenting 
prosecutors said jenkins took the money to conduct business with 
the afroamerican development bank in zaire prosecutors said he 
was part owner of the bank 
the defense said jenkins never owned a bank in zaire but took 
the money as an investment to create one 
defense attorney samuel abady said the charge against jenkins 
was a madeup crime 
but assistant us attorney steven standiford said the statute 
had been used before most recently about two years ago in another 
moneylaundering case which also ended in a conviction 
another judge had in 1988 dismissed an additional charge that 
jenkins had violated a law requiring disclosures to us customs of 
overseas bank transactions of more than 10000 the count was 
dropped on grounds that jenkins had not taken the money out of the 
country 
the case began in may 1987 when a man named louie moore pleaded 
guilty to selling stolen and counterfeit checks and agreed to give 
the fbi information about 12 people including jenkins standiford 
said 
he said moore introduced jenkins to the undercover agent posing 
as dan garth a texan with cash to be cleaned up 
taped conversations revealed that jenkins devised a plan to put 
garths money in the bank in zaire then use it to finance a lumber 
project there with profits going to garth the prosecutor said 
abady described jenkins as a diligent legislator who had worked 
to promote african trade 
he dismissed moore as a thief and con man who cut a deal

two colombians who claim links to the 
medellin drug cartel were in custody monday accused of trying to 
buy stinger missiles to use against aircraft carrying colombian 
officials the fbi said 
the two men agreed to hand over 1 million in cocaine profits as 
a down payment for 120 stingers and 50 automatic rifles plus a 
plane to transport the weapons to colombia fbi agent charles a 
salemme testified at a court hearing 
the suspects claiming to work for reputed cartel kingpin pablo 
escobar said bribed officials would help them smuggle the weapons 
for attacks on the antidrug colombian government 
the suspects told undercover agents they would pay 5 million 
from the planned sale of 400 to 600 kilos of cocaine for the 
plane and the weapons and 1 million to the people who would steal 
the weapons salemme told a federal magistrate 
fbi officials said a stinger sells for about 14000 on the 
legitimate arms market the shoulderfired missile uses an infrared 
homing device to aim itself at the heat generated by an aircrafts 
engine it has proven highly effective against lowflying aircraft 
the 4footlong 35pound missiles were to be used against 
official colombian government aircraft according to allen 
mccreight fbi chief in tampa 
but he said investigators werent aware of specific plans by 
drug traffickers to assassinate colombian president virgilio barco 
vargas who has waged war on drug smugglers or his cabinet 
our investigation is continuing but at this point we have not 
established that the purpose of the purchase of the missiles was to 
be used against any officials and specifically the president of 
colombia mccreight said 
violence linked to colombias drug lords has claimed the lives 
of three presidential candidates in that south american country in 
the past year 
the case is the most recent of several reported attempts by drug 
traffickers to obtain stingers but federal officials say none of 
the earlier negotiations had gone as far as the plot involving the 
two men arrested saturday 
an undercover drug investigation in polk county in westcentral 
florida eventually led to the federal sting in the weapons deal 
i think this shows a correlation between narcotics and 
terrorism said polk sheriff lawrence crow 
this time instead of stingers the cartel was stung said 
bonnie tischler head of the us customs service in tampa 
authorities arrested alfredo antonio ramostinoco 47 at a 
tampa hotel bar and luis fernando arcilagiraldo 28 near miami 
international airport 
both were charged with conspiracy to receive stolen property and 
export arms illegally as well as aiding and abetting the 
importation and possession with intent to distribute marijuana and 
cocaine both have been ordered held without bond 
ramostinoco appeared before a us magistrate monday in tampa 
but the hearing was recessed after ramostinoco said he wanted an 
attorney but couldnt afford to pay one magistrate thomas wilson 
told the public defenders office to represent him 
arcilagiraldo appeared before a magistrate in miami 
an fbi affidavit said ramostinoco described luis as a close 
associate of colombian drug boss pablo escobar it also said 
ramostinoco stated that if this arms exchange deal went well it 
would be arranged for the undercover organization to handle future 
transportation of drugs into the united states on behalf of the 
pablo escobar group 
however mccreight cautioned we have not established these 
negotiations were directed or controlled by pablo escobar 
at a news conference in miami fbi agent william a gavin said 
there was at least one more potential suspect but that a decision 
on whether to charge that person would depend on how the case 
unfolded he also displayed firearms seized from a miami house 
where the two had stayed among the guns were a mac10 machine gun 
with silencer an ar15 assault weapon and a 9mm automatic weapon 
the traffickers were shown a stinger brought in from fort 
stewart ga crow said but no weapons exchanged hands federal 
authorities said there also were discussions of importing narcotics 
undercover polk sheriffs detectives had spent the past six 
months on a drug sting that netted 8 tons of marijuana plus 
500000 in cash and led to the weapons deal crow said 
we had to learn very quickly what a stinger missile was and 
how much they cost the sheriff said none of us had any idea 
what the going price for a stinger missle was we had to 
improvise 
sheriffs detectives met with the two colombians on april 18 to 
fix the deal for stingers and automatic weapons to be paid for with 
cash from the sale of cocaine authorities said 
then at a second meeting on may 1 in lakeland the detectives 
and fbi agents showed the pair a stinger and agreed on the 1 
million down payment officials said

france broke an agreement with new zealand by 
repatriating two french spies convicted in the 1985 bombing of the 
greenpeace flagship rainbow warrior a special tribunal ruled 
monday 
but it rejected new zealands demand that the two be made to 
serve their full sentences on a remote pacific atoll the panel 
instead recommended france pay 2 million to a fund to encourage 
friendly ties between the two countries 
new zealands prime minister geoffrey palmer said that 
although the french agents were let off the decision was a victory 
for new zealand 
the time has come to put this whole sorry tawdry episode 
behind us its dominated the relationship between france and new 
zealand since july 1985 palmer told reporters in wellington 
he said however that new zealand would continue to oppose 
french nuclear testing in the south pacific the rainbow warrior 
was to have led a protest flotilla toward a test site on the south 
pacific atoll of mururoa 
the french foreign ministry which announced the panels 
conclusions said it marked the end of the affair it said 
relations between france and new zealand could now develop in the 
traditional spirit of friendship 
the tribunal was set up after france brought home intelligence 
agents alain mafart and dominique prieur both of whom were 
convicted of manslaughter by new zealand courts 
they had been sentenced to 10year prison terms each for their 
roles in the july 1985 sinking of the rainbow warrior in auckland 
harbor in which a greenpeace photographer was killed 
under a unsponsored accord reached in july 1986 the 
sentences of the two french agents were commuted to 3year terms 
to be served on the pacific atoll of hao an isolated french 
military base the accord also ordered france to pay 7 million in 
reparations to new zealand 
france brought home mafart in december 1987 and prieur in may 
1988 
the tribunal concluded in a majority ruling that france did 
not violate the accord when it repatriated mafart for health 
reasons without consulting new zealand but it said france 
committed a substantial violation by not returning him to the 
base later 
it also ruled france committed substantial violations when 
it brought prieur home also without consultations due to her 
pregnancy and her fathers poor health she was not returned to the 
atoll either 
even so the tribunal ruled that france was no longer obliged to 
return either officer to the atoll because its obligations expired 
in july 1989 when the pairs threeyear terms would have ended 
the tribunal was presided over by dr eduardo jimenez de 
arechaga of uruguay a former president of the international court 
of justice and two arbitors chosen by france and new zealand 
they were prof jeandenis bredin picked by france and sir 
kenneth keith chosen by new zealand 
keith in an addendum to the decision said he disagreed that 
french obligations expired with the scheduled end of the sentences 
and argued that the two should finish their terms 
he also disagreed with the conclusion that mafarts evacuation 
without consultation was acceptable

someone tried to decapitate the 
little mermaid the beloved bronze fairytale figure in copenhagen 
harbor and danish detectives on monday were trying to figure out 
who and why 
they even assigned a homicide cop to the case 
the 7inch cut in the back of the statues neck apparently made 
with a hacksaw was discovered monday by an engineering student 
police said 
the 76yearold statue built in tribute to danish storyteller 
hans christian andersen depicts a winsome girlsized mermaid 
gazing pensively over the water from her perch atop a rock 
the little mermaids tale is one of andersens bestloved and 
the statue within stepping distance of the shore along langelinie 
quay is something of a danish national symbol about 500000 
tourists visit it each year 
homocide inspector jens christensen said the verdigris or 
bluegreen deposits in the gash indicated the attempt was made at 
least several days ago analysts were trying to pinpoint the time 
but so many people touch the statue that fingerprints arent 
likely to provide clues christensen said 
tourists and locals alike in their customary cluster at the 
quay were indignant 
its again a mad person who did this said ejnar weikop a 
dane 
oh no not again said audrey bates of sydney australia 
this is ridiculous 
the little mermaid has been the target of vandals before the 
original head was stolen in 1964 it was replaced by a new one cast 
from the original mold 
in 1984 an arm was taken but it was found and reattached the 
mermaid has also been marred by graffiti and paint and one 
prankster painted a pink brassiere on her 
the engineering student a specialist in metal work found the 
cut nearly a third of the way through the neck while studying 
the statues earlier repairs christensen said he declined to 
disclose the students name 
the detective said a conviction could lead to one to four years 
in prison for vandalism and damaging public monuments 
danish officials were already busy planning repairs 
we will have to solder her together said finn plov of the 
municipal works department but we dont know yet if she will be 
removed with the stone or if we have to built a scaffolding out in 
the water around her 
he said the damage would not be permanent 
despite her 76 years the lady is doing fine after all those 
surgeries she has been through said plov 
commercial rights to the mermaid are owned by the descendants of 
its creator edvard eriksen but copenhagen is in charge of 
maintenance the heirs earn annual royalties of about 750000

dissidents in violeta barrios de 
chamorros ruling coalition said monday they want to weaken her 
presidential powers and are willing to team up with their old foes 
the sandinistas to do so 
mrs chamorro won election on the ticket of the 14party united 
national opposition ending a decade of rule by the leftist 
sandinistas led by president daniel ortega 
but mrs chamorro inaugurated april 25 excluded uno party 
leaders when she named her cabinet she instead surrounded herself 
with technocrats and businessmen with no marked political loyalties 
she also raised the ire of some in her fragile coalition by 
keeping gen humberto ortega the former sandinista defense 
minister and brother of the former president as head of the army 
mrs chamorro has said she will serve as defense minister 
the president is also on the outs with her vice president 
virgilio godoy who has sided with those angry about gen ortegas 
retention 
the moves aimed at weakening the presidency would come in the 
form of constitutional changes uno has 51 deputies in the 
92member national assembly four short of the 60 percent needed to 
pass such measures 
but roberto urroz the head of the nicaraguan democratic 
movement an uno member said the sandinistas also favor a weaker 
presidency 
the sandinistas have 39 assembly votes so presidential foes 
within uno could easily get the 55 votes needed to change the 
constitution 
under the constitution passed in 1987 by a sandinistarun 
assembly the president can veto constitutional changes that veto 
can be overridden by a vote from half the deputies plus one 
the president also can issue decrees and declare a state of 
emergency and is the supreme commander of the armed forces 
urroz at a news conference said uno also plans to introduce 
reforms forbidding a president to run for two consecutive terms and 
forbidding the military to vote in national elections 
other reforms inclue a more independent judiciary 
shortly after the feb 25 elections godoy said unos lack of a 
60 percent majority in the assembly would not hinder its 
legislative effectiveness because the sandinistas created a 
strong executive and now were the executive 
that was before the split within the coalition which became 
evident when mrs chamorro denied godoy an office in the government 
complex 
godoy who left nicaragua suddenly on an unexplained threeday 
trip now has offices at uno campaign headquarters 
a secretary and godoys aides have said repeatedly he is not 
available to comment on unos views on a strong executive branch

mohawk leaders met 
with federal mediators monday in an effort to end a violent tribal 
dispute over gambling that has left two dead on the reservation 
the meeting began a few hours after a funeral was held at the 
st regis catholic church for 32yearold harold edwards 
he was killed may 1 in a gunbattle near a barricade in snye 
quebec another mohawk was killed near the same barricade on the 
reservation which straddles the uscanadian border 
some mohawks oppose casino gambling and bingo as an unwanted 
outside influence supporters note the gambling earns needed cash 
for the reservation 
outsiders efforts to end the violence are complicated by the 
contention of some mohawks rejection of state and federal 
jurisdiction on their land 
a team of 10 mediators from the us justice department met for 
several hours with representatives from the reservations elected 
councils on the american and canadian sides as well as the council 
of hereditary chiefs 
the meeting was held to lay the groundwork for negotiations to 
try to end the 9monthold gambling dispute said brenda lafrance 
a spokeswoman for an antigambling faction on the reservation she 
said those negotiations could begin tuesday 
indians at mondays meeting also were expected to respond to 
gov mario cuomos call for the st regis tribal council to create 
its own police force which could eventually operate on both sides 
of the border 
they expressed an interest to respond to the governors 
proposal said dan gaspe a spokesman for antigambling indian 
leaders 
the tribal police force was abolished in 1981 since then there 
has been no local law enforcement on the american side of the 
reservation called akwesasne where the partridge drums by 
mohawks 
mohawks on both sides of the gambling dispute attended edwards 
funeral which was closed to reporters 
there have been no arrests in either death but canadian 
provincial police say they expect to make a major announcement 
sometime this week about the murder investigation 
cuomo said monday in albany that he would keep state police on 
the reservation while he and tribal officials discuss setting up an 
indian police force 
the governor also said conditions at the reservation may have 
improved to the point where direct negotiations over allowing some 
form of legalized gambling could begin 
about 200 refugees from the canadian side of the reservation 
remained sheltered monday at the transport canada dormitory in 
cornwall ontario they are the last of a group who fled their 
homes last week after violence flared

cuba announced monday that us government 
radio broadcasts beamed to the island will be jammed 24 hours a 
day a move that drew a critical response from the bush 
administration 
the action marked the latest escalation in the electronic war 
between the two countries 
cuba began jamming the voice of americas radio marti broadcasts 
during the predawn hours last month then started interfering with 
programming between 6 am and noon 
after the announcement monday that jamming would be carried out 
around the clock the voa issued a statement saying we deplore 
this action which is clearly designed to deny the cuban people 
access to uncensored information 
the jamming of the broadcasts first began shortly after the 
agency started testing tv signals to cuba on march 27 cuba has 
jammed the tv tests each day since then 
the aim of both the audio and visual operations of voa is to 
bring news and entertainment to the cuban people that they cant 
get from official cuban media 
the cuban government tolerated the radio marti broadcasts for 
five years but reacted sharply to the introduction of tv marti 
calling it a violation of national sovereignty 
the voa statement on monday said the inteference of radio 
marti and tv marti broadcasts is an affront to the cuban peoples 
basic human right of free access to information

israel said monday that a delegation of 
antiguan officials was en route here to find out how a load of 
israelimade arms bound for the tiny caribbean nation wound up in 
the hands of a colombian drug lord 
foreign ministry spokesman baruch bina said after the antiguans 
arrive tuesday we will start the process of investigating 
together what happened israel army radio said a policeman a 
lawyer and one other man make up the antiguan delegation 
vere c bird jr public works minister and national security 
adviser to his father antiguan prime minister vere bird has been 
implicated in the case the younger bird denied wrongdoing but 
stepped down until the issue is resolved 
in april 1989 israel delivered to the antiguan government 100 
uzi submachine guns with short barrels 400 galil automatic assault 
rifles and matching ammunition an israeli official said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the shipment ended up at the ranch of gonzalo rodriguez gacha a 
notorious drug lord who died last december in a shootout with 
colombian police 
after colombian officials discovered the cache they approached 
israel with serial numbers from 200 galils made by israel military 
industries a defense ministry statement said monday 
it said the serial numbers were found to match the numbers of 
the rifles belonging to the shipment delivered to the antiguan 
government 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said the administration has expressed concern over the arms 
shipment 
since israel was the source our embassy in tel aviv has 
raised our concern about these arms with the government of 
israel he said adding that israeli is cooperating in the 
investigation 
bina said the weapons deal was brokered by a maurice sarfati who 
presented a letter introducing himself as an official envoy of 
antiguas foreign ministry published reports said sarfati is a 
former israeli army officer 
we received a receipt from the government customs agent in 
antigua that they had received the shipment we had no idea that 
anything went wrong for almost a year bina said 
then we got a message from the antiguan government asking for 
the details of who made the order and who received it they said 
the government did not order it he said 
sarfati presented to israeli authorities an order for the 
shipment an end user certificate guaranteeing the arms would be 
for sole use of the antiguan army and his accreditation letter 
from the antiguan government 
the letters on government letterheads were signed by bird jr 
the new york times quoting antiguan and us officials said 
sunday that investigators traced the arms diversion to two former 
israeli army officers sarfati and yair klein 
bina said his ministry could not identify sarfati as israeli or 
find links between him and the jewish state 
however a woman who answered a telephone registered to a 
maurice safarti in the tel aviv area told the associated press on 
sunday that sarfati no longer lived there having moved to the 
united states 
klein returned to his native israel last year after accusations 
surfaced that he trained assassination squads for colombian drug 
lords klein denied it saying he was teaching colombian farmers 
selfdefense 
he says he intended to set up a survival training school in 
antigua for panamanian rebels seeking to overthrow dictator manuel 
noriega now on trial in the united states on drug charges klein 
said documents linking him to the arms diversion were forged 
klein said the guns were meant for his school and he thought 
they were ordered by the panamanians 
israel army radio said both israels defense ministry and a us 
senate subcommittee asked kleins firm hod hahanit hebrew for 
spearhead for its version of the affair the radio quoted security 
sources as saying many false documents existed in the arms case 
but none was linked to hod hahanit 
bina said i dont know about hod hahanit from our point of 
view it was a governmenttogovernment deal 
the defense ministry stated that klein acted in latin america 
without the required permit and it knew nothing of his involvement 
in the antiguan affair

a prosecutor in the second mcmartin 
preschool trial told jurors monday he hasnt interviewed the three 
former pupils who claim they were molested and cant predict how 
they will testify 
i dont know in what condition these children will come to 
you deputy district attorney joseph martinez said in his opening 
statement i have not talked to them they are now young ladies 
on the verge of puberty 
i dont know how much they will recall how much they have 
repressed he said but he urged jurors to just remember they 
are children and they are telling about a very traumatic thing in a 
courtroom full of people its very traumatic 
the retrial of ray buckey is a case vastly diminished in scope 
from the scores of allegations that once enveloped the familyowned 
mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach and seven of its teachers 
the school is now closed 
the first mcmartin trial ended in january when a jury acquitted 
buckeys mother peggy mcmartin buckey of 12 charges the same 
jurors acquitted the 31yearold buckey of 40 charges and 
deadlocked on 13 other counts 
the district attorneys office decided to retry buckey on eight 
counts involving the three children a greatly diminished number 
from the hundreds that were once said to have been molested at the 
school his mother was not retaried 
the first trial lasted nearly three years and cost 13 million 
it was the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in us 
history 
the second trial is expected to last about six months 
martinez who spoke for less than one hour said he would prove 
his case through the testimony of parents medical evidence and 
videotapes of the childrens controversial interviews with 
therapists in the case 
the same tapes recorded at childrens institute international 
were cited by jurors in buckeys first trial as evidence that 
children were coerced by therapists into making accusations against 
buckey and his mother 
ray buckeys attorney danny davis told jurors they would see 
that the institutes therapists asked leading questions and planted 
in the childrens minds the idea they had been molested 
martinez said he would elicit testimony similar to that at the 
first trial that buckey wore shorts without underwear and he said 
he would show that the defendant once sat reading playboy magazine 
in front of his preschool class 
davis asserted that none of the children of their own volition 
ever accused buckey of molesting them 
he promised that the defendant will take the stand look jurors 
in the eyes and declare that he never molested anyone 
you will have the opportunity to see this man charged with 
these heinous crimes to look into his eyes and look into his 
soul davis told the jury 
outside court davis said he was shocked by martinezs statement 
that he had not interviewed the children 
he compared the prosecutors to world war ii japanese pilots on a 
suicidal mission with insufficient gas for a return flight 
this is nothing but a kamikaze run before the primary 
election davis said referring to district attorney ira 
reiners candidacy for california attorney general 
there is no gas for a return trip for ira reiner he said 
martinez however said he was confident we feel we have the 
three best children and the eight best counts you cant get any 
better than that he said 
the first prosecution witness was the mother of one of the three 
children she said that in the spring of 1983 her daughter 
protested going to the mcmartin school twice and became fearful 
she also recalled that the child who was prone to rashes showed 
her mother redness on her bottom 
i asked her if she knew why her body was in that condition and 
she didnt give me any answer said the witness 
on crossexamination davis noted that the woman was confused 
about dates of other events

pope john paul ii preaching on a muddy 
field in one of mexicos most impoverished cities urged the poor 
to follow the roman catholic church and reject political leaders 
who deny god 
throughout history there have been many pastors leaders 
dictators chiefs ideologues and creators of opinions or currents 
of thought who have tried to shepherd or guide the people 
toward artificial paradises john paul said in his homily to a 
joyous flagwaving throng of 200000 people 
but the only true shepherd said the pontiff is one like jesus 
christ who is ready to give his life for his sheep all 
others one after another showed themselves to be false 
shepherds 
the polishborn pope alluded to the reforms that have swept 
eastern europe saying the church had defended human rights crushed 
by political systems with an inhuman face 
on the second day of his second visit to mexico john paul also 
made an afternoon visit to the coastal city of veracruz 200 miles 
east of mexico city where roman catholic missionaries first landed 
in the 16th century 
the pope speaking to about 20000 people from a podium set up 
along the docks defended the celebration of the 500th anniversary 
of the arrival of christianity in the new world 
the ceremonies set to take place in 1992 celebrating columbus 
discovery of america have created some ire in latin america with 
critics saying the church arrived as an instrument of conquest that 
brought repression and disease 
the discovery the conquest and the evangelization occupy a 
decisive luminous place taken all together even though they are 
not without shadows the pope said in a homily 
in chalco the field where the pope spoke was surrounded by 
thousands of gray concreteblock homes topped with corrugated 
aluminum slabs anchored by rocks against the wind 
at least 700000 people most of them poor peasants who moved to 
the area the past decade live in the chalco valley 25 miles 
southeast of mexico city 
the setting is spectacular but the snowcapped volcanic peaks 
of popocatepetl and iztaccihuatl were largely obscured by clouds as 
the pope spoke 
people in threadbare clothes lined unpaved streets that had 
turned to seas of sticky mud after a night of rain john paul ii 
the whole world loves you they cried 
the pontiff earlier held a private meeting with president carlos 
salinas de gortari john paul made no statement about the meeting 
but the presidential press office said the two spoke of the end 
of dogmas in the world and in mexico and of the changes occurring 
in eastern europe 
it was the only reference to a possible discussion of 
churchstate relations in mexico although the church is 
constitutionally restricted many of the restrictions are ignored 
and salinas has been moving slowly toward a more formal recognition 
of the status quo 
the church had a history in mexico of supporting conservatives 
and found itself on the wrong side in the last half of the 19th 
century especially during benito juarezs reforms and during the 
mexican revolution that started in 1910 after the revolution all 
church property was confiscated numerous restrictions were written 
into the 1917 constitution and relations with the vatican were 
broken in 1926 
the vatican announced last month that the pope might travel to 
cuba in december but john paul told reporters sunday on the flight 
to mexico that it seems that this project will not be mature by 
then 
he said cuban bishops the vatican and the government of 
president fidel castro have yet to agree on a date john paul has 
visited every country in central and south america during his 
pontificate but not cuba 
in mexico crowds have been smaller than expected because the 
rainy season started several weeks early 
the field at chalco was divided by fences and scalpers seized 
control of some entrances charging 10000 pesos about 380 or 
the daily minimum wage 
john paul speaking from a pyramidshaped altar decorated with 
geometric aztec designs embraced a decision by latin american 
bishops to change the churchs tradition of siding with the rich 
ruling classes 
the church wants to give witness to the dignity of man and 
be his relief and defense he said 
however the pontiff emphasized that the churchs first 
responsibility was to give spiritual aid and called on betteroff 
mexicans to translate their catholic faith into help for the poor 
we cannot live and sleep peacefully while thousands of our 
brothers very near to us lack the necessities for a dignified 
human life john paul told the crowd 
since the popes visit was announced salinas has made highly 
publicized vists to chalco to dedicate street lights and electric 
lines 
but john paul recognized the poverty in which most residents 
still live crammed into small houses without bathrooms or running 
water 
in many of you i find the face of the suffering christ he 
said 
margarita pinzon de rios 48 of mexico city slept overnight in 
a car to be able to see the pope he is demonstrating the love he 
has for us the humble she said

the state department is considering 
increasing hazardous duty pay for diplomats based in the 
philippines because of threats by communist rebels officials said 
tuesday 
if approved the 300 us diplomats here would receive a 15 
percent pay increase such a designation would place the

afghanistan and lebanon 
us embassy spokesman gerry huchel confirmed the proposal was 
under consideration but that it had not yet been implemented

us government employees here including diplomats 300 peace 
corps volunteers and 40000 us troops defense department

on saturday the us military canceled all offpost leaves for 
service members and their families after suspected communist rebels 
killed us marine gunnery sgt john fredette near subic naval 
base 50 miles west of manila 
diplomats have been varying routes to work switching automobile 
license tags and taking other security measures to prevent attacks 
by communist rebels 
the british and australian embassies have quietly advised their 
nationals to avoid travel near us facilities for fear they might 
be mistaken for americans sources in the diplomatic community said 
fears of rebel attacks have mounted because us and filipino 
officials begin talks next monday on renewing the lease to the six 
american military bases here the lease expires in september 1991 
the rebels have demanded that mrs aquino close the bases and 
have offered peace talks if she does mrs aquino rejected the 
offer

marxist state

a california bank that allegedly was used by the 
late philippine president ferdinand marcos and his wife to launder 
stolen funds was turned over to the philippine government on monday 
the transfer of all shares in the california overseas bank of 
los angeles to the manila government was part of a march 16 plea 
bargain agreement in us district court where imelda marcos is on 
trial 
the bank estimated by a defense lawyer to be worth 20 million 
to 30 million had pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud 
other counts involving federal bank insurance fraud and 
racketeering conspiracy were dropped as part of the deal 
the sentence giving the philippines total control of the bank 
was a victory for president corazon aquinos government which 
seeks to recover more than 220 million allegedly embezzled by the 
marcoses from the countrys treasury during marcos 20 years in 
power 
the bank was owned by robert s benedicto a onetime marcos 
crony who was charged with conspiring to help the former president 
shift stolen money to secret swiss accounts and personal uses 
mrs marcos is alleged to have participated with her husband in 
the embezzlement using the money to finance a luxury lifestyle and 
investments in new york real estate codefendant adnan khashoggi 
the saudi arabian financer is accused of helping the marcoses 
conceal ownership of the new york properties 
marcos originally indicted with his wife died in exile in 
hawaii last september 
benedicto also indicted and listed as a fugitive by the court 
was dropped from the case as part of the plea bargain approved by 
judge john f keenan 
two former officials of the california overseas bank testified 
last week that benedicto had said he bought the institution for 7 
million in 1976 because the president marcos needed the bank 
and that he had personally managed several accounts whose owners 
were known only to himself 
government prosecutors say the accounts belonged to the marcoses 
and were used to launder money being funneled to other accounts to 
buy a manhattan office building and mrs marcos jewelry and to 
provide two of the marcos children with 10000amonth allowances

a heart transplant patient put on a 
heartassist mechanism after its use was restricted to lastresort 
cases died monday of multiple organ failure 
darwin kramer 65 died minutes after the two symbion inc 
assist devices which had pumped blood through his transplanted 
heart since april 17 and other life support were disconnected 
said university medical center spokesman george martinez 
martinez said the cause of death was multiple organ failure 
richard smith umcs chief biomedical engineer in charge of 
artificial heart and assist devices said the symbion devices had 
functioned well and caused no problems 
in january the us food and drug administration withdrew 
approval of symbion artificial hearts and heartassist devices 
citing safety concerns in february the fda said it would allow 
their use as a last resort 
kramer of scottsdale received his new heart march 10 when his 
body began to reject it the two symbion acute ventricular devices 
called a bivad were implanted to let the donor heart recover 
smith said 
the bivad which sits on the abdomen and is connected to the 
heart by tubes through the chest helped kramer stabilize martinez 
said 
but about five days ago doctors discovered a systemic infection 
of unknown cause when kramer lapsed into multiple organ failure 
and doctors saw no hope for recovery his family was consulted and 
life support disconnected smith said 
kramer had been a candidate for another donor heart since april 
28 when doctors determined his rejection of the first one was 
irreversible 
kramers bivad implant was the second done on a heart recipient 
by dr jack g copeland head of umcs transplant program but his 
first use of a symbion device since the fda action 
smith said the first umc transplant patient to receive bivad 
support had the device for 10 days after her donor heart failed to 
start 
the heart recovered and the woman is alive more than a year 
later he said

illfated lovers and ahrens who adapted the book and wrote the 
lyrics has come up with a leading female character an audience can 
cheer in a season of such effective but emotionally cold musicals 
like city of angels and grand hotel thats something rare 
ti moune is the sweetest caribbean heroine since ottilie a role 
played by the wonderful diahann carroll in harold arlens house 
of flowers years ago its a sympathetic part played to 
perfection by a performer with a dazzling smile and an unusual 
name la chanze 
the darkskinned ti moune falls for daniel the mulatto son of 
an island landowner and saves his life when his sports car crashes 
on a winding road she nurses him back to health but eventually 
the barriers of class and color prove to be too much 
in ti mounes quest for love she is helped and occasionally 
hindered by a quartet of rambunctious and rowdy gods deities of 
water earth love and death they add a touch of supernatural to 
the plot an otherworldly quality that gives the story much of its 
charm 
the score is completely different from lucky stiff a daffy 
dumbfun musical that ahrens and flaherty wrote for playwrights 
horizons several seasons ago the title character in that show was 
a corpse that refused to stay put and the witty music reflected 
the musicals farcical nature 
flahertys music for once on this island is more expansive 
and romantic it embraces a wide range of styles from calypso like 
in the gutsy mama will provide to more traditional theater 
love songs like forever yours ahrens lyrics are unforced and 
fit the music beautifully 
daniele has gotten strong ensemble performances from the rest of 
the cast fine singers and dancers all particularly effective are 
eric riley a sensuous demon of death and kecia lewisevans as a 
bigvoiced earth mother 
the directors production team set designer loy arcenas 
costume designer judy dearing and lighting designer allen lee 
hughes has created an atmospheric island environment a deep blue 
set painted with primitive trees and birds fills the small stage 
and embraces the actors 
so does danieles inventive choreography which becomes an 
important part of the story the dances swirl throughout once on 
this island turning the stage into a tropical nevernever land 
that wont disappear from memory even after the curtain has fallen

at the hartford conn courant the newsday editions on long 
island ny and in new york city and the baltimore sun 
newspapers 
those investments wont pay off until the economy recovers he

the most one can say is that 1990 is proving to be a very 
difficult year and the future course of the economy will be a key 
factor in our outcome erburu said

its northeastern papers consumer magazines and broadcast 
television operations

a state appeals court has rejected a 
bid by freedom newspapers inc shareholder harry hoiles to dissolve 
the 1 billion media group 
the court in a ruling made public may 1 upheld a 1987 decision 
issued by superior court judge leonard goldstein that found no 
basis in hoiles claim that onethird of the familyoperated 
corporation illegally was undermined by the twothirds majority 
the lawsuit stems from hoiles claim that his sister mary jane 
hoiles hardie promised to back him as the successor to harrys 
older brother clarence who headed freedom until his death in 1981 
but she refused to back him and harry hoiles talked to 
potential buyers for his shares including the rival times mirror 
co 
his sister and other family members offered to buy out his 
shares at an offer that reflected a minority discount harry hoiles 
said the 125 million offer was insufficient 
concerned about a possible stock sale to competitors the 
majority shareholders adopted a stock restriction to give the 
hardies and the family of clarence hoiles the first chance to buy 
each others stock 
harry hoiles also was not reelected to a threemember executive 
committee of freedom 
he sued alleging the actions had denied him a fair price for 
his stock and devalued it 
but goldstein ruled the majority stockholders had acted legally 
and the appellate court agreed 
fairness does not require the majority to submit to corporate 
blackmail at the whim of a minority any more than it will permit a 
majority to take unfair advantage of a minority wrote associate 
justice thomas f crosby jr 
harry hoiles lawyer kenneth scholtz said unless the appellate 
court grants a rehearing he will seek review before the state 
supreme court

union leaders from the new york daily news 
brought their battle with the tribune co to the media giants 
annual meeting may 3 predicting the newspaper would collapse in 
six months unless its decaying printing plant is replaced 
but company officials reiterated their commitment to first 
bringing costs under control at the newspaper once the nations 
largest metropolitan daily that position is now held by the los 
angeles times 
also at the meeting tribune co head stanton cook announced he 
will retire in august as chief executive officer and as publisher 
of the chicago tribune 
cook told stockholders that 1989 was a record year with 
earnings of more than 242 million but he said the company will 
not pour money into the daily news plant until excessive 
operational costs are eliminated 
it would not be prudent to recommend these investments until 
costs are brought under control said cook it would be a 
mistake to underestimate our resolve the advertisers deserve it 
and the shareholders deserve it 
george mcdonald head of the allied printing trades council 
which represents 10 daily news unions in contract negotiations with 
the company said corporate officials had it backwards the unions 
would make concessions he said but not until the tribune co 
agreed to substantial investments at what he called the 
dickenslike plant 
unless the investments are made now the news wont be around 
in six months mcdonald said lets stop this charade and 
settle this at the bargaining table 
cook who will be 65 in july will remain chairman of the 
tribune co after he steps down as chief executive officer and 
tribune publisher 
charles brumback president and chief operating officer will 
become chief executive officer 
john madigan president and chief executive officer of the 
newspaper will assume cooks publishing duties

the supreme court on april 30 let stand a 
ruling that says the public has no constitutional right to know the 
names of jurors while they are serving in a criminal trial 
the court without comment rejected a challenge to a delaware 
judges order that kept jurors names secret during a 
muchpublicized murder trial 
lawyers for gannett co publisher of the news journal in 
wilmington said the judges order contradicts previous supreme 
court rulings on the publics right of access to criminal trials 
the delaware supreme court saying those previous rulings do not 
apply to the release of jurors names upheld the judges order 
last nov 13 
gannett has failed to carry its burden of establishing any 
historical tradition of constitutional dimension regarding public 
access to jurors names the state supreme court ruled 
the dispute stemmed from the wilmington murder trial of steven 
pennell who was charged with the serial torture slayings of three 
women state prosecutors sought the death penalty 
pennell was convicted of two of the murders and was sentenced to 
life in prison 
before the trials jury selection began the presiding judge 
ordered that potential jurors be identified in open court by 
numbers not their names throughout the trial only the judge 
prosecutors the defendant and his lawyers knew the jurors names 
the news journal had published an article offering biographical 
sketches of all the jurors in a thenrecently concluded murder 
trial and the judge was concerned the newspaper might run a 
similar article during pennells trial 
jurors were not to be sequestered and the judge said he was 
worried jurors might be harassed during the trial interfering in 
pennells right to an impartial jury 
lawyers for gannett noted that jurors had not been sequestered 
in the previous trial and that none was harassed after being 
identified in the newspaper 
but names of jurors in pennells case were not made public until 
his trial ended 
in a landmark 1980 ruling the nations highest court said the 
public has a constitutional right to attend criminal trials even 
when defendants object the justices since have expanded that 
ruling to cover jury selection and pretrial proceedings in criminal 
cases 
judges cannot abridge that right the court has said without 
articulating the compelling interests to be served by secrecy 
in the appeal acted on april 30 lawyers for gannett said by 
cloaking jurors in anonymity the bond between the jury and the 
public is weakened hearing the name of each juror called and 
relating that name to the jurors testimony during jury selection 
insures public confidence that the process is fair and the answers 
are truthful 
the delaware supreme court rejected those arguments 
contrary to the rather pietistic claims of gannett and other 
news organizations there is nothing to suggest that such actions 
undermined public trust in the judicial system the state court 
said 
the case is gannett vs delaware 891324

attorney general dick thornburgh has reversed 
himself and will keep confidential the financial data of a 
newspaper seeking approval of joint operations with a competitor in 
nevada a spokesman said april 30 
the attorney general signed an order reversing his decision of 
feb 16 requiring the las vegas reviewjournal to disclose 
circulation and advertising revenue said spokesman david runkel 
the publisher of the newspaper donrey of nevada inc an arm of 
closely held donrey media group had sought reconsideration of the 
february decision in a march 2 petition 
donrey argued that disclosure would damage relations with 
customers suppliers and unions not only in las vegas but in the 73 
other markets in 21 states in which donrey operates 
in an agreement last june the reviewjournal and the las vegas 
sun said they planned to merge their business circulation and 
production operations keeping separate editorial departments 
along the lines of joint operating agreements in force in 19 other 
cities 
such agreements are permitted if the attorney general finds that 
one newspaper is in danger of failing in las vegas both 
newspapers have said the sun is in probable danger of financial 
failure 
the data in question already has been submitted to the justice 
department

a former city prosecutor won a record 34 
million libel award may 3 from the philadelphia inquirer but a 
media lawyer and a reporters group said the judgment will likely be 
overturned on appeal 
the judgment was the largest ever awarded against the news 
media surpassing the 28 million a heart surgeon won last month 
from a san antonio television station according to henry kaufman 
general counsel of the libel defense resource center in new york 
common pleas court jurors awarded 25 million in compensatory 
damages and 315 million in punitive damages to attorney richard 
a sprague a former first assistant district attorney 
sprague sued in 1983 over articles dating to 1973 in the 
inquirer which has won 17 pulitzer prizes in 16 years many for 
investigative stories 
i am a very strong advocate of first amendment rights said 
james e beasley attorney for sprague what i dont tolerate and 
i dont think society should tolerate is the use of investigative 
reporters or the power of the press for a personal vendetta and 
that is what developed here 
sprague sued over stories questioning his actions and decisions 
as a prosecutor 
he contended that greg walter one of the reporters involved in 
the stories had threatened to get and destroy sprague who had 
prosecuted walter in 1972 for taping a conversation without the 
other persons knowledge 
walter has since died 
beasley said the jurys verdict after deliberations of 2 hours 
at the end of the 11week trial before judge charles p mirarchi 
jr sent a message to investigative reporters not to destroy 
somebodys reputation 
we will of course appeal eugene l roberts jr executive 
editor and president of the newspaper said in a statement and i 
am confident that however long it takes the inquirer will prevail 
most of our case never got to the jury thirteen witnesses 
were eliminated by judge mirarchi and an investigative report by 
the then state attorney general that supported the inquirer story 
was not allowed into evidence 
sprague sued over articles that he said implied he was involved 
in an illegal wiretapping incident an allegation he denied and 
questioned his role in a homicide case involving a son of a friend 
former state police commissioner rocco urella an eightweek trial 
resulted in a 45 million verdict for sprague in 1983 
the state supreme court in june 1988 ordered a new trial 
declaring reporters have an absolute right to invoke the state 
shield law in refusing to identify confidential sources during 
legal proceedings 
in the original trial judge charles a lord ruled the law did 
not apply in the case and excluded all testimony about information 
from unidentified sources 
its unimaginable to me that a punitive damage award in this 
amount could or would be upheld said floyd abrams a prominent 
first amendment lawyer he represents nbc in appealing a 53 
million libel judgment won by entertainer wayne newton 
this is another example of libel law running amok abrams 
said i think that this case and others will sooner rather than 
later lead the supreme court to address the constitutionality of 
punitive damages in libel cases 
jane kirtley executive director of the reporters committee for 
freedom of the press sees a first amendment issue in such awards 
all a punitive damage award is when its awarded against a 
news organization is a fine for speaking she said but beyond 
that it doesnt have to bear any relationship to anything

did charge him with public disorderly conduct

been charged with assault and battery and disorderly the

his acquittal wilder said wilder also broadcast the story on the

pay 13500 and art ramirez a losing candidate for sheriff

april 11 1988 
all but 5000 from each man was to go to attorneys fees and 
court costs 
their cases were dismissed last year and the herald countersued 
claiming the lawsuits were frivolous 
rosenbaum and ramirez filed suit in connection with political 
advertisements the newspaper ran when rosenbaum was running for the 
county commission in 1988 
the men who also sued rosenbaums opponent ray ramon claimed 
that the herald and ramon conspired to run a political ad in which 
ramirez endorsed ramon for county commissioner 
according to the lawsuits the herald published the ad while 
knowing the information to be false 
after the suits were dismissed the newspaper filed and won the 
counterclaim against rosenbaum and ramirez 
state district judge robert f barnes said in his april 5 ruling 
that the complaints were totally without merit the judge said 
that the newspaper was entitled to additional damages as sanctions 
its our intent to countersue for damages and attorneys fees 
any time were faced with this kind of legal action said doug 
hardie herald publisher 
a large portion of those are frivolous lawsuits a large 
portion of those are politically motivated in an attempt to control 
what newspapers and television stations report he said

the weekly calhoun chronicle was 
ordered to publish a paid political advertisement urging defeat of 
a 53 million school bond issue it had supported 
the newspaper had earlier rejected the ad judge charles mccarty 
ordered it published may 3 because that was the last edition before 
a may 8 vote on the bond issue 
the case stemmed from an appeal by citizen awareness regarding 
education which opposed the bond issue designed to raise funds for 
a combined middle schoolhigh school 
carl morris the papers owner refused to accept the ad on 
march 30 saying supporters of the bond issue would not have time 
to respond to it the chronicle had previously published two of the 
groups ads 
the judges ruling said by refusing to publish the 
advertisement the calhoun chronicle is depriving the plaintiff of 
the only legitimate forum available to reach citizens of the 
county

free speech said loren b howley an attorney for the bond issue 
opponents if there were a competing newspaper it would be a 
different situation

association said the ruling disregarded the first amendment

black leaders have denounced a frontpage 
photograph in the boston sunday globe saying it is racist and 
glorifies guns 
the photograph in the april 29 newspaper which accompanied an 
article on the widespread availability of guns showed a black man 
with his athletic shirt pulled up to reveal a gun in his belt the 
caption said the man identified himself as a drug dealer 
state sen bill owens dboston said the globes photograph was 
exploitive and showed black youths in a negative light he also 
said it seemed to have been staged for the photographer 
the question that comes to my mind is when do you begin to 
make news and when do you begin to sell it he said 
owens said the photograph could fuel violence in the city 
suppose this person is a gang member another gang member will 
try to outdo that person 
globe editor john s driscoll said in a prepared statement we 
understand their concerns our intent was not to depict a 
particular person but to reflect the issue explained in the story 
rep shirley owenshicks dboston said the photograph made 
dealing drugs look cool 
the article had a lot of good information she added but 
a picture as they say is worth a thousand words this picture is 
worth a thousand words to gang members this says it is all right 
to carry a gun in that youll get acknowledgment in the newspaper 
for it 
bill owens also said the story had a lot of truth but he 
said a better accompanying photograph might have been taken of 
moneylaundering in the citys financial district of whitecollar 
guys counting the money that they have made off the black 
community

faced with a flood of phone calls and 
facsimile messages claiming responsibility for terrorist attacks 
colombias news media are beginning to ignore the messages 
the reason is simple it is impossible to tell who is really on 
the other end of the line drug traffickers police posing as drug 
traffickers leftist guerrillas pranskters 
until a few weeks ago virtually all of colombias radio 
stations and newspapers used the statements without question no 
one pointed out the information came from anonymous people and 
could not be verified 
recently the countrys two leading newspapers bogotas el 
espectador and el tiempo chose not to publish news about some of 
the anonymous messages 
an example of the confusion came after leftist presidential 
candidate carlos pizarro was killed april 26 by an assassin on a 
colombian airliner 
within two hours the anonymous telephone calls started 
it was the medellin cartel one man said another president 
would be assassinated he said 
the next day brought another facsimile message also supposedly 
from the medellin cartel to a bogota radio station caracol 
it wasnt us the supposed cartel communique said it accused 
the police of killing people and setting off bombs so that the 
cartel would be blamed 
another example came after a truck bomb in medellin killed 20 
people on april 11 
facsimile statements under the letterhead of the extraditables 
a name assumed by leaders of the medellin cartel said the cartel 
was not responsibile 
recently there have been facsimile and telephone messages from 
anonymous people claiming to speak for the cartel saying those 
statements directly after the april 11 bombing were fakes 
somebody has been using us as their public relations office 
a senior editor at a bogota newspaper said april 28

entitled

the transformation of japan in two generations is 
embodied in kimiko omori who scratched a living from the ruins of 
war and her granddaughter a child of prosperity who spends every 
yen she earns 
mrs omori 70 was the privileged daughter of a prosperous 
restaurant owner world war ii changed everything 
in 1950 in a devastated city she became a kimono tailor hard 
work and prudence have left her comfortably fixed but she gives 
her extra money to her childrens families rather than treating 
herself to an afternoon of kabuki theater or a trip abroad 
norie omori 22 lives in a world alien to her grandmothers 
experience 
she is an unskilled office assistant at a japanese securities 
firm lives at home and earns the equivalent of about 640 a month 
after taxes she gives 190 to her parents and spends the other 
450 on clothes cosmetics eating out and skiing 
her grandmother doesnt think norie is spoiled but still she 
shakes her head and says society has really changed 
more and more the pursuit of work yields to chasing pleasure 
especially among the young 
many in japans working population still lead frugal lives 
weighed down by high schooling costs and mortgages on houses priced 
at more than five times their annual incomes surveys show the 
average japanese spends about half as much time on leisure pursuits 
as an american 
the young single woman has become japans big spender and is a 
major target of those with something appropriate to sell 
like norie omori she lives with her parents pays little or 
nothing toward living expenses and has an office job she plans to 
hold only until marriage 
with plenty of time and disposable income she propels the 
fashion industry nearly 562 billion travel industry 187 
billion and publishing industry 13 billion 
she travels with other young women to hawaii and australia 
devours novels and magazines buys the worlds leading brandname 
shoes bags and perfumes and goes to trendy restaurants 
her gifts for birthdays and valentines day are generous and she 
spends thousands of dollars a year on golf or health club fees 
according to a profile by dentsu japans largest advertising and 
marketing agency 
tokyo disneyland japans premier amusement park overflows with 
young women female visitors to the park outnumbered males nearly 
2to1 last year 
young adult females are the core of our repeat customers 
said disneyland spokesman toshiharu akiba leisure is here to 
stay unlike their parents the younger generation knows the joy of 
taking holidays and they have the knowledge time and the money to 
spend 
of the 9 million japanese who traveled abroad in 1989 about 
780000 were women aged 20 to 24 men in the same age group 
ambitious and less eager to take vacations numbered only 430000 
in a magazine survey 100 young women with office jobs in tokyo 
said they spent an average of 554 a month on clothing food and 
drink athletics language lessons and other nonessentials 
they reported spending 135 hours a week on leisure activities 
according to the may issue of travail a jobplacement magazine for 
women 
japan became an economic powerhouse partly because of its 
peoples sacrifices many japanese who grew up with long work 
weeks cramped houses and skyhigh prices are bent on raising their 
standard of living 
this follows the new national path desired by japans trading 
partners who urge the japanese to play and buy more as a way of 
reducing a 70 billion annual trade surplus with the world

john golub was selling used cars by day and 
playing comedy clubs by night when he mixed the two while selling 
a car to a deaf woman he slipped a joke into the written notes 
they were exchanging 
she laughed 
it just struck me right there that wouldnt it be great to 
make comedy accessible to deaf people he said 
since that moment 10 years ago golub has sworn off the car 
trade but he hasnt given up on comedy and he hasnt given up on 
trying to reach people who cant hear the punchline 
golub has developed an act using a sign language interpreter and 
an infrared amplification device and has brought hundreds of 
hearingimpaired people into comedy clubs for the first time 
his shows are bringing people into the mainstream of 
recreation said ruth green head of the new york league for the 
hard of hearing comedy club owners never really realized there 
was an audience they were missing 
greens organization has supported golubs efforts since he 
moved from los angeles six years ago with the leagues 
cooperation he organized comedy benefit shows every year since in 
1985 this year there are four 
golub is 32 squarely built and energetic he has a personal 
stake in the welfare of the deaf he has two sisters who cannot 
hear 
he tries to avoid making changes in his act to accommodate the 
deaf his intention he says is not to develop two different 
audiences but rather to integrate the deaf into the hearing 
audience 
when i do these shows i want it to be a show that anyone can 
enjoy deaf or hearing 
still some jokes dont translate well to the deaf and 
interpreter mara zuckerman who has worked with golub at every 
benefit says she sometimes has to explain this to the comedians 
jokes about popular culture from television or radio often do 
not work one performer parodied the theme song from the television 
show rawhide but the act would bomb with a deaf audience 
because few deaf people have ever watched the show or heard the 
theme music 
puns and rhymes dont work with the deaf nor do impressions 
theyre not going to know something sounds like cary grant 
zuckerman says 
but visual humor mime and physical impersonations such as a 
funny walk or a parody of a famous rock musician often works 
dirty jokes also get laughs she says most sexually related 
signs are very graphic so both the deaf audience and the hearing 
audience get a kick out of that 
at a recent benefit in stamford conn one comic asked an 
embarrassed couple in the audience whether they had done it yet 
oh im sorry he quickly apologized its none of my 
business but i was just interested in seeing how mara signed that 
one 
that zuckerman despite her protests often serves as the 
comedians foil is an indication of the importance of the 
interpreter 
standing off to the side of the small stage during a recent 
benefit show the blackclad zuckerman interpreted for the nights 
three comics and gave quite a performance herself even though she 
moved her feet little she used a wide range of facial expressions 
and body movements to convey humor 
always just a fraction of a second behind the comic she 
gestured quickly with her hands and arms as she translated the 
jokes 
still zuckerman stays as close as possible to the traditional 
role of interpreter despite comedys nontraditional demands 
if a comic is going to get up there and be bawdy im not 
there to change his act to make it more palatable to the audience 
or funnier or less funny she said if hes going to bomb then 
im going to let him bomb 
but sometimes she joins in the fun at the start of one show 
golub jumped on stage and quickly announced im going to talk 
really fast zuckerman reacted by glaring at golub and the two 
stared at each other for seconds 
the interpreters serve some of the hard of hearing others 
listen to what is being said with the aid of the infrared system 
often found in theaters auditoriums and churches the system 
converts the electrical signal from the microphone into infrared 
light this light is then transmitted throughout the club 
hardofhearing members of the audience wear wireless headsets that 
pick up the signal and amplify it 
golubs shows have not all been sellouts but the league for the 
hard of hearing deems them a success 
golub envisions a national comedy tour to benefit the hard of 
hearing he has a dream of making comedy accessible to all deaf 
people in the united states 
who am i he said im nobody but i think i can have 
an effect as a nobody

bill seidman can be a hard man to get along 
with but the white house may find hes even harder to get along 
without 
seidman has been both a leading man and a lightning rod in the 
savings and loan bailout while his policy dissents have made the 
administration uncomfortable his role provided political 
insulation president bush will lose that when seidman leaves 
probably in the fall 
therell be no argument over the credentials of william taylor 
the federal reserve boards bank supervisor to take over seidmans 
dual role as chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp and 
the resolution trust corp and he is likely to prove as independent 
as seidman 
but taylor will be a lot quieter about it 
seidman l william is the name on the letterhead is out 
front outspoken a very public public figure 
thats made him a popular man in congress and with the news 
media and an irksome one to some people in the administration 
among them the high command at the treasury and white house chief 
of staff john sununu 
seidman now 69 was appointed to the fdic post by president 
reagan for a term that runs until october 1991 and the franchise 
was expanded when congress passed the savings and loan bailout bill 
last year the fdic now insures both bank and savings and loan 
depositors and the resolution trust corp sells the assets of 
failing sampls closed by the government 
the chairman is appointed by the president and confirmed by the 
senate for a sixyear term once hes there hes independent the 
president cant oust him 
but there are ways seidman had said he planned to leave before 
his term was up and hoped he could do so after getting the sampl 
rescue effort off to a good beginning he also had sounded alarms 
about rising costs complained about bureaucratic delays in the 
bailout and dismissed some administration suggestions sometimes 
with a wisecrack 
and so there appeared in the washington post on may day a report 
that seidman had met with bush in midapril had said he wasnt 
going to complete his full term and had been encouraged to end it 
sooner rather than later 
from that point the script was predictable when a president 
wants somebody to leave the government it is customary that he 
praises the mans performance and says that he respects the 
fellows wish to move on 
seidman knows the way it works hes been around republican 
politics for more than 30 years and he served in the white house as 
an economic aide to president ford 
bill has indicated that hes not going to stay the whole term 
and we are interested in getting new leadership there that will 
carry out an aggressive program when the time comes white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
that stirred democratic congressional demands that bush push 
seidman to stay for his credibility and demonstrable independence 
as the chairman of a bailout in which estimated costs are soaring 
you do not solve these problems by shooting the messenger 
said rep bruce f vento dminn who heads a house task force on 
the rtc 
hey listen bush countered if all the people that 
brought bad news in here were asked to do something else it would 
be a little lonely 
bush said seidman had done a good job with grace and ability 
and had made his own decision to leave and he also said look 
i understand if you might want to put your own person in there 
the president said thursday its his initiative with me and 
today he suggested the name of a bill taylor who were very high on 
to take over 
the president inherited the savings and loan crisis and made the 
rescue bailout bill one of his earliest priorities the initial 
cost estimate was 257 billion thats now up to at least 325 
billion and probably more the general accounting office says the 
price could be 500 billion over 30 years 
thats too costly not to become a political issue at some point 
that may be hastened by seidmans departure its an inherited 
mess and both parties collaborated in letting it happen but bush 
is in charge now and when his nominee takes over as the central 
figure in the bailout his administration will have full custody of 
a nowin process 
dont be impatient seidman told a house hearing on friday 
this is a long hard job it isnt going to be accomplished any 
time soon

editors note the idea is to collect unmarketable food from 
supermarkets and distribute it to the needy the supermarket gets a

generated a network of food banks that last year distributed 846 
million worth of food but some wonder if this is a solution or

a woman scavenging in a supermarkets garbage to feed her 10 
children gave phoenix soup kitchen volunteers the idea why not 
gather wasted food and make it available to people who need it 
it was meant to be just a little emergency program taking 
pressure off social workers says john van hengel who founded 
the nations first food bank in phoenix in 1967 
today that little emergency program is a network of 200 
food banks linked by second harvest an 11yearold organization 
second only to the government in providing food to the needy 
last year second harvest food banks distributed 419 million 
pounds of food and other products worth roughly 846 million to 
39700 soup kitchens food pantries and other nonprofit programs 
there are food banks independent of this network but philip r 
warth jr second harvest president and chief executive officer 
says almost all legitimate food banks are affiliated 
if youre a second harvest food bank its as if youve got 
the good housekeeping seal of approval says catherine damato 
executive director of the western massachusetts food bank 
in some segments of the hunger community however there is 
concern pointing to second harvests dominance and its ties to the 
food industry which provides board members and financial support 
as well as food some food bankers and activists wonder whom the 
network really serves the hungry or the donors 
when somebody says were leaning more toward the industry 
well heck its their food warth says if we cant make it 
work from the industrys standpoint we sure cant make it work 
from the food banks standpoint 
reducing waste by distributing food in an efficient 
costeffective way fulfills the mandate of food banking he says 
we are not an antihunger organization we are a service 
provider helping people who fall through the cracks 
some critics however contend that some of its promotional 
materials suggest otherwise they cite for example a directmail 
brochure soliciting donations headlined hunger in america 
solutions from second harvest 
food banks are simply a mechanism to warehouse and distribute 
unmarketable food says christina walker a former board member 
of food for survival a new york food bank 
theres nothing wrong with that its in promoting food banks 
as an effective and costefficient remedy to poverty and hunger 
that a major problem arises 
warth says the brochure is accurate we feel that we are a 
solution to the symptom of hunger at the same time second 
harvest is awfully quick to say to the public as well as to 
congress that we do not hold ourselves up as having the role the 
responsibility or the wherewithal to eliminate hunger in america 
further stirring controversy about whom second harvest serves is 
the questionable nutritional value of some donations and the fact 
that roughly a fifth of its product isnt food at all 
its cleaning fluid and detergent and hand lotion its the 
way every business in america unloads stuff that isnt moving in 
the stores says nancy amidei former executive director of the 
washington dc food research and action center the leading 
research and advocacy group on hunger 
warth says second harvest was founded on the notion of 
surplus almost anything being produced by the industry would 
be of some use to the individuals and charities being served 
the toledonorthwest ohio food banks inventory recently 
included salad dressing cake mixes bread crumbs frozen pizza 
apple butter cereals mint sauce tostada shells flour crackers 
pie crust mix muffin mix soda chocolate milk butter pats 
pasta sausage cheese frozen potatoes zucchini and carrots 
it also listed calendars home permanent kits soap cold 
medicines aspirin bandages copper cleaner shoes socks toys 
underwear tshirts laundry detergent and christmas ornaments 
bill bolling executive director of the atlanta food bank 
points out that food stamps can only be used to buy food 
whenever we can get good nonfood items agencies need that he 
says 
catherine damato agrees to a point diapers are extremely 
useful wallpaper no 
warth says such products of marginal value account for a 
relatively small percentage while second harvest makes a concerted 
effort to capture nutritious foods the nature of food banking is 
such that well never get as much food as we want and well 
always be reactive 
food distributed by second harvest food banks probably amounts 
to less than onetenth of 1 percent of all the food produced in 
this country warth says compared with federal food programs he 
says second harvest accounts for about 1 percent of all food 
assistance in the nation 
even that 1 percent however makes second harvest the nations 
secondlargest provider of food to the needy 
and to j larry brown chairman of the physician task force on 
hunger in america and a leading critic the issue isnt the amount 
of food its the perception by government that it can use second 
harvest as a key player any number of members of congress who 
dont want to expand food programs point to the private system as a 
major player 
rep bill emerson rmo the ranking republican on the house 
select committee on hunger supports legislation calling for an 
additional 23 billion for food programs over the next three years 
at the same time i absolutely do see second harvest as a 
major player says emerson who wants some of that money used to 
buy surplus commodities to be distributed by food banks and other 
private agencies

while bringing hunger to the publics attention is part of 
second harvests mission warth says we are not about providing 
systemic change that has got to come from elsewhere in our 
society 
in fact second harvest largely stays out of politics he says 
if we grind too many political axes one way or another were 
going to lose the credibility of the people we work with 
brown contends that with prominence and prosperity come 
responsibility with the network and money they raise they have 
an ethical obligation to speak to the root causes of hunger 
at its downtown chicago headquarters the white walls gray 
carpets and green plants set a sleek corporate tone that mirrors 
the image second harvest presents to the food industry 
one reason for its success has been a system that makes it easy 
to donate and that emphasizes cleanliness efficiency and quality 
control critical issues to the food industry which puts a premium 
on brand protection and meticulous producthandling 
in most cases a single phone call by a manufacturer or retailer 
sets the system in motion one of second harvests 30 chicago staff 
members determines the nature and location of the donation then 
relays the information to one of three regional offices the 
product is then allocated to specific food banks which assume 
responsibility for transporting it 
of the 419 million pounds of food distributed to agencies last 
year 172 million pounds was donated by way of this national 
network the rest was donated to food banks locally 
food companies are entitled to a tax deduction equal to the cost 
of producing the goods plus half the unrealized profits adjusted 
for damage and reduced shelf life the value to the food industry 
has never been calculated 
warth calls it consequential but not compelling but says 
its not typically lucrative for companies to donate food 
in a 1989 survey 85 percent of food industry representatives 
queried said the tax break was an important factor in their 
decision to donate food 
warth says second harvest is organized along corporate lines 
because its the most efficient way to do business my board has 
made it clear that my job is to make this organization as efficient 
and effective as possible 
if that sends a reassuring message to private industry it also 
makes some food bankers uncomfortable 
theres a bunch of corporate people in there with a bunch of 
degrees that do not belong in food banking they have no idea what 
the concept is says lori waggoner office manager at the 
toledonorthwest ohio food bank 
the institution has become insensitive theyve lost touch 
with the way the rest of us worship in this religion says tom 
ferraro executive director of the genesee valley regional food 
clearinghouse a second harvest food bank in rochester ny 
im not necessarily antiwhite glove sanitation inspections or 
paperwork thats needed to be accountable and responsible not only 
for taking corporate donations but also for handling food that 
were giving people to eat ferraro says 
hes more bothered by a a kind of media slickness in second 
harvests marketing in recent years 
warth says marketing makes us successful just like anybody 
else if you cant market yourself you cant be successful its a 
fact of life that were in a very competitive environment 
but ferraro says marketing efforts have gone too far im not 
100 percent opposed to packaging some of its necessary but this 
is too much i dont know if decisions are made on the basis of 
whats right and ethical or if theyre based on what some poll 
said would be best for public perception 
at the same time ferraro acknowledges that for many food 
bankers second harvest is a convenient scapegoat 
though food banks werent designed to meet longterm nutritional 
needs rising housing costs and shrinking public programs have 
forced many americans to rely on donated food 
like many food banks damatos now buys highprotein foods such 
as peanut butter chicken and beef to supplement the kinds of items 
that are most often donated chips cookies cereal juice and ice 
cream it also grows food and makes vegetarian chili 
distributing more nutritious food is one way for food banks to 
better serve their communities says marc a thibodeau a former 
boston food bank board member zeroing in on highrisk populations 
pregnant women infants young children and old people is 
another 
i think of hunger as largely a medical problem with severe 
medical ramifications but food banking doesnt run programs 
designed to address that thibodeau says 
if volunteers are going to bother to go to all this trouble 
they should move beyond second harvests rather myopic goal of 
eliminating food waste and try to have the private sector fill in 
gaps where government doesnt reach 
ferraro is among those searching for ways to broaden food 
bankings mission hes using his rochester food banks warehouse 
to teach job skills to four disadvantaged teenagers 
the fourmonth program designed with help from local food 
companies covers shipping receiving sanitation equipment and 
computer skills graduates will go to work for participating 
companies and a new group of teenagers will begin training 
i think theres a real obligation that comes with having 
taxexempt status it means we should do some of the hard things 
doing outreach and advocacy as well as food banking makes us 
more of a comprehensive hungerfighter ferraro says adding 
employment and training really puts the emphasis on systemic root 
causes and not just on throwing dented cans at the symptoms

each wednesday morning a crowd gathers in a 
parking lot on the southwest corner of toledo outside the basement 
of our lady of lourdes 
as the church doors open bob and ginny pacholski assume their 
posts behind the soup kitchen serving counter just as they have 
every wednesday for eight years 
we thought wed do this for two or three years at the most 
until the recession ended says pacholski who opened his 
hospitality kitchen in 1982 
now though theres no end in sight 
roughly 600 men women and children make their way through the 
food line every week so many that the pacholskis must assign them 
all numbers and serve them in shifts the overflow crowd stands 
patiently outside the door waiting to be called over the 
microphone bob uses to keep things moving 
the long cafeteria tables are packed and the traffic between 
serving line tables and door is heavy the majority of clients are 
single men old women and mothers with young children although a 
number of twoparent families are here too 
we treat people with dignity says pacholski a retired real 
estate agent hes tanned and fitlooking with kindly blue eyes 
that continually sweep the tables searching for empty seats 
clinking flatware scraping chairs and the muffled roar of 
dozens of conversations fill the room once the schools let out in 
june the number of children will skyrocket and noise levels will 
increase appreciably 
like most soup kitchens the pacholskis does not require its 
clients to show identification those receiving the boxes of 
federal surplus commodities being dispensed at the far end of the 
room are required to prove need with unemployment compensation 
cards or other such documentation 
it used to be all general relief or afdc aid to families with 
dependent children now were seeing people unemployed people 
laid off pacholski says 
the first week we opened we had 23 people by that august we 
had 1013 lately in a typical month the kitchen serves 2400 
people although the numbers are once again going up 
todays menu includes barbecued pork sandwiches made of canned 
pork from the us department of agriculture as well as chicken 
spaghetti rice corn broccoli peaches rolls doughnuts and 
cookies pacholski shops at the toledo seagate food bank which 
collects edible but unmarketable food for use by nonprofit 
agencies at minimal cost 
behind the serving counter are several donated birthday cakes 
nobody seems to mind the smudged icing judging from the number of 
celebrants lining up to pick out cakes theyre very popular 
bob says with a salesmans pride 
regulars at the soup kitchen include 70yearold marcile battle 
who until recently was supporting eight children along with her 
92yearold mother on a 182 monthly social security check and 63 
worth of food stamps 
three of the children are cousins girls aged 8 5 and 3 the 
5yearold was 3 days old when she came to me the 8yearold was 2 
months says mrs battle who says shes been declared ineligible 
for welfare benefits 
the other kids had parents but they left the kids with me in 
july of 1989 they said they were going to a funeral that funeral 
never did end 
a social worker from childrens services finally picked up the 
children bringing the size of mrs battles family back down to 
five she says situations like hers arent unusual and blames them 
on toledos drug problem 
the weekly lunch at the hospitality kitchen and the carefully 
wrapped leftovers she carries home help stretch her meager food 
budget says mrs battle whose husband died three years ago no 
matter how strapped she is i always share 
food stamps buy me one trip to the grocery store and the 
groceries last til the middle of the month i cant keep up with 
the bills its hard 
though grateful for the help the pacholskis gave her mrs 
battle says she finds eating at the soup kitchen hard 
i would prefer to buy my own groceries i like to try to feed 
my own self id rather any day to help someone else than to have 
someone else helping me

detroit ap good nutrition is just what the doctor ordered 
for nearly 850000 detroit residents 
theyre enrolled in the focus hope food prescription program 
one of the oldest and biggest supplemental food programs for people 
in highrisk groups lowincome pregnant and postpartum women 
their children up to age 6 and the elderly 
each month participants push grocery carts down the aisles of 
one of five focus hope food centers stocking up on milk fruit 
meat butter vegetables cheese cereal rice dried beans peanut 
butter instant potatoes egg mix and juice 
there are six food prescriptions depending on a 
participants age having filled the appropriate one the shopper 
then passes through a checkout counter complete with a barcode 
scanner to speed things up 
similar foods are available to qualified people in two dozen 
cities under the commodity supplemental food program of the us 
department of agriculture 
but in detroit we do things differently says eleanor 
josaitis who cofounded focus hope a civil and human rights 
organization in the aftermath of the 1967 riots 
one difference in the detroit program is how it looks 
focus hope food centers resemble grocery stores we try to 
set things up where people can come in get their carts and do 
their own shopping josaitis says 
if a mother comes into the food center with a small child and 
pushes a shopping cart that child may see his mother as just going 
to the grocery store she may not have a lot of choices but if she 
wants to pick one item over another green beans say instead of 
corn she can do that its a small thing but its a symbol of 
dignity of how we like to treat people 
the food centers also are equipped with closedcircuit 
televisions that run ads encouraging people to look into other 
focus hope programs such as employment training housing day 
care and education 
agencies in a number of cities have modeled programs after 
detroits says josaitis who held a national conference two years 
ago to share information about its principles and design 
the food packages designed by a dietician are intended as 
supplements although infants are given a full months supply of 
formula the usda buys the food 
by using the national purchasing power we can provide food to 
three times as many people says josaitis she says 846613 
people filled food prescriptions last year when the program began 
in 1971 it served 85058 
senior citizens with incomes up to 130 percent of poverty 
7774 for a oneperson household and women with incomes up to 
185 percent of poverty 11063 for one are eligible 
once accepted each participant is entitled to six monthly trips 
to the food center they then must be rescreened by the state 
health department or a private doctor if their condition is 
unchanged they continue on the program another six months 
a network of 40000 volunteers provides transportation or food 
delivery to those who need it it also builds awareness of the 
hunger problem 
i believe you have to be touched by it says josaitis if 
people dont see or feel an injustice they cant be part of the 
solution

editors note hes the last survivor of the big four of the 
early civil rights movement now 70 and blind james farmer 
founder of the congress of racial equality is teaching a special 
class at a predominantly white college in virginia this is the 
first of an intermittent series called class act about prominent 
men and women in various fields who have returned to the campus to 
share their expertise

the distinguished visiting professor 
with the patch over his right eye tugs at a tweed sleeve and bends 
an ear to his chiming wristwatch 
twentyeight minutes past one james farmer announces in 
that resonant mellifluous voice to a hushed class of 40 juniors 
and seniors leaning forward pens poised over notebooks 
as i was saying those troopers were bellowing come on out 
farmer we know youre in there 
i was meant to die that night they were kicking open doors 
beating up blacks in the streets interrogating them with electric 
cattle prods i got out alive in a hearse 
it was a lovely spring day on the campus of predominantly white 
mary washington college a state institution in historic 
fredericksburg va bright sunshine slanting through the budding 
trees gave a roseate glow to the whitecolumned georgian brick 
buildings 
but the imposing black figure at the lecture desk in monroe hall 
was wrapped in the darkness of another time in another southern 
state 
he couldnt see the azaleas blushing at the windowsill or sniff 
the cherry blossoms just come into bloom around the fountain in the 
square there was too much tear gas billowing through the busted 
windows of the plymouth rock baptist church in plaquemine la and 
the splashing fountain brought back the swoosh of the fire hose 
washing hymn books and bibles down the aisle as the mob smashed 
pews and ransacked the church 
scared spitless farmer says recalling that violent summer 
night a quarter of a century ago 
one moment hes a terrified freedom rider pleading with the 
local telephone operator to put a call through to the white 
house the attorney general the fbi in new orleans 
then hes a redneck deputy snarling through jowls chockfull of 
chaw we know youre in there farmer 
next hes the spunky lady operator of the funeral parlor down 
the street telling him to play dead in the back of that hearse 
and ordering the driver to take dirt roads known only to blacks 
since plantation days 
then hes himself the founder of core the congress of racial 
equality wondering if that night in louisiana less than a week 
after the march on washington and martin luther kings i had a 
dream speech would be his last on earth 
this guy is tremendous says senior eric cooper one of the 
students in farmers course the history of the civil rights 
movement a full threecredit course in the history department 
hes a living piece of history its hard for students our age to 
imagine an america where blacks could not go into a restaurant had 
to ride in the jim crow coach next to the engine and were hunted 
down like possums or some other swamp dweller for daring to 
register to vote 
here is a man who has changed history hes seen it all and 
now the tragedy is he sees nothing 
but in the classroom the now totally blind champion of civil 
rights sees something he never saw before in his 70 years a ray 
of hope just a glimmer 
the hope for america is with these young people he says 
gathering up a bundle of their term papers their minds are not 
closed at the beginning of the semester black kids and white kids 
alike find it difficult to grasp that this is the way things were 
here 
with martin luther king roy wilkins and whitney young now dead 
farmer is the last of the big four of the civil rights movement 
we were the knights of the round table he chuckles counting 
the nine steps down to the taxi taking him home for a brief rest 
before facing an evening class of nearly 200 freshmen and 
sophomores 
farmer is now in his fifth year at the college named for george 
washingtons mother where in a student body of 3500 twothirds 
are female and 4 percent black 
the preachers kid from marshall tex who grew up on a series 
of black baptist campuses where his father a phd from boston 
university taught theology is still at it preaching teaching 
with compelling charm a nonviolent approach to racial harmony 
eloquently he drives home the fundamental lesson of the civil 
rights movement be better than your former self not better than 
the south africans and thereby make a better world 
students are awed at farmers lack of bitterness toward those 
who have wronged him and his race 
sherry brinser a spanish major from richmond says hes 
fascinating it all happened to him and yet theres no bitterness 
none how can he forgive what he cant forget 
in the eagles nest the student snack bar some compared farmer 
with the actor james earl jones the rich voice the fullbacks 
build the features borrowed from a roman coin the deep infectious 
laughter the mimics ability to play all parts 
they cited the morning lecture when he was suddenly the owner of 
a diner on us route 1 between new york and baltimore turning 
away young blacks trying to integrate eateries along what they had 
renamed freedom highway 
we dont serve negroes here 
well thats fine by us farmer replies in his own voice 
we dont eat them 
hes very expressive you think youre right there says 
patty charron a junior from springield va 
but hes a lot more than just a performer insists rich 
cooper from pittsburgh he speaks from the heart its not like 
a lecture its personal history others graduating with me agree 
his is one of the five classes you should take before leaving 
here

in his campus office surrounded by plaques awards and 19 
honorary degrees farmer says twothirds of the graduates have 
gone through my class about 500 a year a japanese girl one of my 
brightest students came here just to attend my class 
once thought of becoming a doctor he reminisces his hands 
laced behind his head couldnt stand the sight of blood thats 
another of lifes jokes considering all the busted heads ive 
seen 
instead he studied for the ministry at howard university in the 
nations capital where his father taught the new testament and 
greek but he decided against ordination because the baptist 
church like others was still segregated even today to this 
nations shame segregation is nowhere as complete as at 11 oclock 
on a sunday morning 
taking up the civil rights struggle at age 22 farmer employed 
the gandhi techniques of nonviolence to organize a sitin at the 
jack spratt coffee house in chicago in may 1942 thus began core 
a lot of soup was dumped over heads and garbage jammed into 
sandwiches he says before the movement was strong enough to 
invade the south with unarmed legions of black and white freedom 
riders 
in later years farmer was a union organizer ran for congress 
in brooklyn ny and lost to shirley chisholm went on the 
lecture circuit and engaged in a memorable debate with malcolm x 
he angered his liberal friends by serving as assistant secretary of 
health education and welfare in the nixon administration 
his personal life was never easy there was resentment among 
both his black and white friends against his devoted wife lula who 
was white and his staunchest supporter she died in 1976 after a 
long debilitating battle with hodgkins disease 
in 1979 farmer lost the sight of his right eye to retinal 
vascular occlusion a rare disease that he thinks was brought on by 
those hours of exposure to tear gas in louisiana but the doctors 
say there is no evidence in the literature 
he reached chapter 6 in lay bare the heart his poignant 
autobiography when the left eye began to go 
i had to resort to a powerful magnifying glass to go on 
writing in longhand on yellow legal pads he says 
when he began teaching he could make out vague shadowy shapes 
in the first few rows of lecture chairs now i dont see the 
students at all i just hear voices 
then with booming laughter as if the joke had just occurred to 
him he pronounces himself literally colored blind used to be i 
could tell black kids from white kids by their voices but as 
blacks move into the middle class and attend eastern colleges they 
begin talking like whites you cant tell anymore by their 
enunciation and pronunciation 
no i dont think black english will disappear blacks who 
speak downtown english still speak the ghetto language when they go 
back to visit the family or attend church 
one reason farmers classes are the most popular on campus is 
the gallery of national figures he summons up from personal 
experience 
the kennedys when the freedom riders reached montgomery and 
rioters held us virtual prisoners in the first baptist church 
bobby kennedy telephoned martin luther king to get me to halt the 
march and have a cooling off period my response was we have been 
cooling off for 350 years if we cool off anymore we will be in a 
deep freeze the attorney general was furious and that fury was 
shared promptly with his brother the president so i was never on 
good terms with the kennedys 
lyndon johnson at first i was welcome in the oval office 
from marshall doggone jim thats lady birds hometown her 
daddy had a filling station there that bond of texas engulfed us 
but i soon fell from grace when i refused to go along with a 
moratorium on demonstrations during the campaign against 
goldwater 
adam clayton powell a clever man he had more charisma than 
jesse jackson but he didnt like the naacp which we joked meant 
never annoy adam clayton powell 
louis farrakhan racism of any color is bad i hate the things 
he stands for but id fight for his right to be heard 
on the day civil rights leader ralph abernathy died april 17 
farmer told the class about encouraging abernathy to write his 
controversial autobiography and the walls came tumbling down 
but i warned him dont tell all 
he just grinned but now i wonder if his death wasnt hastened 
by the inner turmoil he must have gone through wondering if he had 
done an injustice to his dear friend dearer than a brother martin 
luther king i just wish he hadnt written those three pages about 
martins sexual escapades on his last night alive it wasnt 
needed there was nothing new it had all been written before 
in february black history month farmer is a guest speaker at 
dozens of colleges whenever an opportunity arises he encourages 
black athletes to get their diplomas before turning pro 
its not easy farmer sighs they are quick to ask hey 
professor where did it ever get you show us your new bmw 
but the professor says he learns a lot from his students 
especially from their term papers i give them a choice of a 
research paper or writing some personal experience with race 
relations more than half chose a personal experience they tell of 
having a black friend i childhood 
in most cases as they approached puberty entered middle 
school they were yanked apart by parents or neighbors who 
ostracized them and called them nigger lovers 
it came as a revelation to me that so many white kids had 
black playmates and had that traumatic experience it came up in 
paper after paper read to me their poignant childhood memories 
show that race has colored no pun intended every aspect of this 
countrys life none of us black or white is untouched by it

but i keep up the vigil anyway outside the local 
elementary school 
my 4yearold daughter rebecca schiffres is determined to 
attend lafayette with her big brother ethan but there is only 
room for 40 children in the two prekindergarten classes and if i 
leave my post under the schools portico i give up my chance to get 
one of them 
its 345 am i have been there since 830 the night before i 
stretch out on a borrowed lawn chair wrapping myself in a sleeping 
bag that had not been used for 15 years i cannot get to sleep 
all around me four dozen other parents wait a lone man paces 
on the school courtyard while someone shoots hoops on the 
basketball court around back a few people use flashlights to read 
the silence is broken by a few snores from some of those 
fortunate enough to sleep and the whispered conversations of those 
who couldnt 
i havent done anything like this since 1969 when the amazing 
mets got into the world series and i tried to get into the 
ballpark i was in high school then and staying up all night was 
pure excitement 
not anymore 
why then are we all here camping out on a rainy night hoping to 
win a cherished spot in a public elementary school in the district 
of columbia a city not known for educational excellence 
preschool programs abound in an area where the majority of 
mothers work outside the home the good ones fill up fast ask 
marty crutsinger aps economics writer who has survived four 
allnighters to get his 4yearold daughter elizabeth into a 
churchrun preschool in suburban virginia 
whats different about the lafayette vigil is that were waiting 
to get our children into a public school 
the school board has mandated that there be at least one 
prekindergarten class in each of the citys 124 elementary 
schools some schools including lafayette have added a second 
but its not always enough 
if people knew that there were enough prekindergarten 
programs for everyone then there wouldnt be the panic says 
maurice sykes the districts director of early childhood programs 
but theres not enough money to accommodate everyone he says 
sykes attributes the high demand to the second baby boom 
reaching school age the phenomena of working parents the fullday 
program and the price 
the reason those slots become coveted is because we became 
part of the day care network sykes said if you can provide a 
service for free thats when you get competitive 
as for the allnight vigils he says no one is satisfied with 
the system were trying to figure out a reasonable equitable 
solution 
three years ago when we considered signing ethan up for 
prekindergarten i arrived at 910 the morning of registration and 
got no 32 in the ensuing years parents have lined up earlier and 
earlier to guarantee themselves a slot 
last year people who showed up at dawn still got into the 
program this year panic set in 
the first wouldbe prek parent arrived at 530 pm the evening 
before registration someone soon arrived with numbers to pass out 
there was a signin sheet too just as a backstop 
my husband manny schiffres and i stopped at the school at 815 
pm as we were returning from a reception eight people were there 
we drove the three blocks to our house when we got there the 
phone was ringing and a notice was posted near the telephone get 
over to lafayette people are already there it was signed by my 
nextdoor neighbor and timed off at 730 
i changed my clothes putting on a 20yearold sweater and a 
pair of jeans my neighbor rang the bell come on we have to 
go she said grabbing a down jacket and a cup of cherry yogurt 
i returned to the school with her 
i was number 16 rebecca was in 
people milled around the courtyard spouses came with dinner and 
with kids to say goodnight a table with wine and cheese was set up 
under a newly posted sign warning that no alcohol or drugs was 
permitted within 1000 feet of the school

i sipped apple juice from a box that had been purchased for my 
sons lunch and devoured my yogurt not much of a dinner 
then the rain came and everyone ran for cover 
at 942 pm the 40th parent came anyone who arrived after 
that would be on a waiting list 
some people had alternative plans if their kids didnt get in 
we could have continued sending rebecca to gan hayeled the 
nursery school run by our synagogue in rebeccas two years there 
the teachers instilled in her a love of school along the way she 
learned her alphabet and her numbers to write her name and to get 
along with her peers 
we met the january application deadline sent in our deposit and 
even requested the same teacher that ethan had as a 4yearold 
but lafayette was part of her life too she went to the fall 
harvest festival and the spring fair she dressed up for the annual 
halloween parades and applauded at the sixthgrade shows 
im going to lafayette she would brag to anyone who asked 
her 
my husband and i spent hours debating what to do 
we knew she would fare well and learn as much at either 
school so the quality of the programs was not at issue 
the deciding factors came down to cost the lafayette program is 
free compared with 3100 for the synagoguerun school the 
convenience of having two children at the same school and rebeccas 
wishes 
and so i keep the vigil 
before midnight the schools custodian opens the building for a 
short time so parents can use the telephone or bathroom he turns 
the lights on under the portico but turns them off again when 
people protested that they want to sleep 
and people slept sitting up stretched across two chairs on 
the cold cement bodies next to bodies 
i talk to the mothers of two of ethans classmates each is 
trying to get a son into the prek program it would be great we 
say if our younger kids could be together too 
we share a pound cake and conversation a real conversation 
without interruption from one of the kids 
as temperatures drop into the 40s one of the women stuffs her 
legs into a plastic garbage bag trying to keep warm it really 
works someone had told her 
the other wears layers of borrowed clothing friends who had 
been through this before brought extra coats i go back to my chair 
and the warmth of my sleeping bag 
husbands come to relieve wives and wives to relieve husbands 
there were care packages for those who stayed brought in paper 
bags and plastic bags and kids lunch boxes my husband is home 
sleeping 
i take a bathroom break someone decreed and everyone agreed 
that you could leave for 15 minutes without losing your place on 
line but no one really keeps track 
dawn breaks and people begin awakening they stow their gear in 
car trunks and then line up according to number 
principal sandra bond wearing a tshirt declaring the 
principal is always right opens the doors to the school at 8 
am coffee and doughnuts await us courtesy of the home and school 
association 
later mrs bond would say she thought of us each time she saw a 
flash of lightning or heard a clap of thunder why then parents 
grumbled wouldnt she let us camp out in the gym or cafeteria 
there has to be a better way people said 
those that had kids in the school as i did pushed for 
preference for siblings 
those who missed the cut argued for a lottery 
others said a missed nights sleep was a small price to pay to 
get their kids in lafayette 
school personnel checked our documents birth certificates 
proof of residency and immunization records all my papers were in 
order and rebecca was accepted 
another family was not so lucky they were told they were 
ineligible because they lived outside the district 
welcome to lafayette no 41

editors note even as communism crumbles in much of the rest 
of the world robert mugabe is still adamant about establishing a 
oneparty marxistleninist state in zimbabwe formerly rhodesia 
while that makes a lot of businessmen and others uneasy few 
dispute mugabes successes in social reforms that have largely 
bettered the lot of his people

when former guerrilla chieftain robert 
mugabe led rhodesia to independence as blackgoverned zimbabwe 10 
years ago he faced a daunting task 
the economy of the former whiteled nation was in tatters 
racial tensions were rife civil war loomed in matabeleland 
stronghold of opposition leader joshua nkomo and mugabes support 
for south african guerrillas raised the risk of a backlash from 
pretorias whiteled government a break in his main trade routes 
through that country or even a military strike 
zimbabwe on april 18 celebrated the 10th anniversary of 
independence from britain with military marches and tribal dancing 
speaking to a crowd at a stadium outside harare mugabe said he 
welcomed the expiration of the 10year constitution brokered by the 
british that contained entrenched racial provisions protecting 
the interests of the 90000strong white community 
he said the second decade of independence would witness even 
greater moves toward unity peace and progress 
few dispute that during those first 10 years zimbabwe made 
remarkable progress in the areas of education and health care 
now comes the hard part 
unemployment is at record levels along with urban crime vague 
economic planning has led to rampant inflation shortages of 
essential commodities and deterioration of the national transport 
system 
and mugabes vow to transform one of africas few westernstyle 
democracies into a oneparty marxistleninist state has split the 
ruling zimbabwe african national union patriotic front and 
divided the countrys 92 million people 
it has also alarmed local businessmen and foreign governments 
some question whether the onetime schoolteacher is on the right 
political track as his old eastern european models undergo radical 
reforms 
he is obsessed with a unitary system a member of the 
partys 160member central committee told the associated press on 
condition of anonymity but by no means does he have all the 
support he needs in the party or cabinet unless he stampedes it 
through 
oneparty rule has been mugabes dream since he was held for a 
decade as a political prisoner by the last white rhodesian prime 
minister ian d smith at that time it was a fashionable system 
in eastern europe and much of the third world 
with that system largely discredited abroad mugabes own 
credibility is at stake but mugabe wont budge 
the multiparty system spells the destruction of our nation 
he said last year we believe we are one people one flag one 
identity why shouldnt we have one party 
mugabe won distinction as an eloquent chairman for three years 
of the 102member nonaligned movement of developing nations an 
alternative to the east and west power blocs 
no one ever expected the nonaligned movement to do anything 
really tangible says a western diplomat in harare but mugabe 
made all the right noises and his chairmanship was a great success 
in those terms 
the zimbabwean leader habitually clad in dark suits that match 
his businesslike manner exercises the impatient authority of an 
austere headmaster 
associates say he is sharply intolerant of those who challenge 
him but he rewards loyalty richly 
he rarely exposes his human side except on occasional visits to 
the mudandgrass hut villages in the countryside that remind him 
of his own birthplace 
a teetotaler and nonsmoker with a fondness for hot spicy 
foods mugabe enjoys watching the sedate english game of cricket 
he works out daily at state house on a static exercise bike and 
relaxes near a hifi to songs from the 1950s pat boone being a 
favorite 
a blinking stare from behind thick spectacles hides stiff 
mannerisms he sports a toothbrush mustache and in common with 
many african men his age he dyes his hair to conceal specks of 
gray 
educated at a roman catholic mission mugabe is described by 
church leaders as an ascetic with high moral principles however 
he is no longer a practicing catholic like his aged mother and his 
ghanaianborn wife sally who all attend mass regularly 
yet hes comfortable in the company of clerics according to the 
rev oscar wermter spokesman for the catholic bishops conference 
which opposes his oneparty state objective

he shares our concerns for moral and social justice wermter 
says but when it comes to the freedom of political choice as a 
fundamental human right thats where we part company 
wermter and others fear mugabe may be sealing his own fate by 
pursuing his marxist goal 
we are afraid from the african experience that oneparty 
states normally end in military coups because there is no other 
mechanism for change he says 
relations between church and state were not always cozy 
in 1984 mugabe vilified church leaders who accused north 
koreantrained zimbabwean troops of atrocities in the western 
matabeleland province where armed rebels loyal to nkomo posed a 
threat to the government 
thousands of civilians were killed wounded or driven into exile 
in operations against the dissidents 
but the remaining 120 rebels laid down their guns under an 
amnesty that followed a unity pact between nkomo and mugabe in 
december 1988 
nkomo a former political foe now turned friend is to be sworn 
in as one of two vicepresidents this year 
but his promotion from senior minister may not mollify 
supporters of nkomos defunct zimbabwe african peoples union 
which has merged with the ruling party says masipula sithole a 
ustrained professor of political studies at the university of 
zimbabwe 
some exzapu officials from the minority ndebele tribe 30 
percent of the population are already disenchanted with the 
disproportionately small role they say they play in government 
sithole says 
sithole says mugabes popularity is increasingly being viewed as 
vain moody paranoid and isolated from the people 
he has no children an only son died at age 6 while mugabe was 
in prison 
mugabe lives behind high walls capped with coils of razor wire 
he travels in a highspeed motorcade escorted by police cars with 
wailing sirens motorcycle outriders and a jeepload of soldiers 
armed with machine guns and automatic rifles 
mugabe who won several college degrees while in detention is 
an admirer of executed romanian dictator nicolai ceaucescu kim il 
sung of north korea and fidel castro of cuba he argues that 
democratic oneparty rule eliminates tribal and ideological 
divisions that hamper the development of third world nations 
it is absurd to argue that democracy exists in a oneparty 
state sithole says 
yet mugabe makes no attempt to conceal his distaste for 
opposition before recent elections he spoke darkly about reports 
that influential whites were backing opposition politicians if 
whites rear their ugly terrorist head we will chop that head 
off he declared 
but on another occasion talking about his image abroad mugabe 
smiled and said look i am not a monster i havent eaten 
anyone 
few people including the 90000 whites who remain from a peak 
of 270000 in the mid1970s dispute mugabes successes in social 
reforms that have largely bettered the lot of his people 
infant mortality dropped as some 450 new rural clinics were 
built and 70 percent of all children were immunized against disease 
high school enrollment swelled ninefold to 695000 and primary 
school attendances doubled to 12 million 
in his anniversary speech mugabe said that apart from wheat 
imports zimbabwe is selfsufficient in food he also praised local 
industries mainly in the hands of white entrepreneurs 
manufacturers generate nearly 30 percent of the gross domestic 
product of about 4 billion he said 
but today unemployment is estimated at almost 25 percent 
only western investment and effective trade liberalization will 
ease the unemployment and an inflation rate of 22 percent annually 
says leading black businessman sam gozo 
but you cant have proper investment and liberalization where 
marxism is the order of the day he says it just wont fly 
despite recent reforms in neighboring south africa and an 
easing of regional tensions with blackruled states a strong 
economic union between the two countries is unlikely while mugabe 
remains a vocal critic of apartheid and an advocate of trade 
embargoes against pretoria 
whether mugabe likes it or not our survival will go 
handinhand with the fortunes of south africa gozo says

editors note in the early days they had to be registered 
nurses then they had to be young and pretty now with the aircraft 
cabin graying as one said the nations flight attendants are 
fighting weight restrictions 
</TEXT>

there was a time when airline stewardesses were fired if they 
turned 32 got married became pregnant or had to put on eyeglasses 
stewardesses are called flight attendants now in deference to 
men who have joined their ranks and many of the restrictive rules 
have been dumped as a result of antidiscrimination laws and 
lawsuits 
some flight attendants however still are being fired for 
weighing too much 
at american airlines the nations largest employer of flight 
attendants the union is suing the company and challenging some of 
the industrys most stringent weight requirements 
the association of professional flight attendants the union for 
americans 16000 attendants says the 37yearold weight 
guidelines are an extension of age and sex discrimination 
the union contends they hearken to the coffee tea or me era 
when sexy young stewardesses were marketing tools congress had 
not yet outlawed age and sex discrimination 
national airlines urged travelers to fly me im cheryl 
braniffs sky girls wore hot pants and continental promised we 
move our tails for you 
now union officials call it an irrational and cruel policy that 
forces women in their 40s and 50s to weigh what they did when they 
were 21 
they say attendants sometimes resort to crash diets 
liposuction breast reductions and drug use and some develop 
eating disorders in an effort to stay trim 
we truly believe the flying public wants professional 
efficient and wellgroomed flight attendants safe airplanes and 
ontime service said tommie huttoblake a flight attendant from 
ridgewood nj and former union president we dont think the 
public cares if a flight attendant wears a size 6 or a size 10 
union members are wearing buttons urging patrons to weigh my 
job performance not my body billboards with similar messages 
are going up outside airports 
both sides are girding for a 1991 trial date in federal court in 
fort worth texas 
in april the federal equal employment opportunity commission 
joined the flight attendants battle filing a federal classaction 
suit in us district court in los angeles the lawsuit charges the 
weight policy discriminates against women particularly those over 
40 
american still wants their flight attendants to appeal to a 
male sexist notion of what is sexy said eeoc lawyer ralph dh 
fertig and thats thin 
he said americans policy reads that a firm trim silhouette 
free of bulges rolls or paunches is necessary for an alert 
efficient image 
we believe its in our rights to have an appropriate grooming 
standard for our employees said american spokesman ed stewart 
we want a neat attractive person representing american 
union lawyer kathleen king of san francisco said the job has 
changed since the 1950s when women like her mother became flight 
attendants on a lark before settling down and getting married 
youve got flight attendants with 20 and 25 years of seniority 
who are being thrown out the door because theyre a few pounds 
overweight she said 
last year pan american world airways ended six years of 
litigation by raising weight requirements and allowing an extra 9 
pounds as flight attendants age pan am also agreed to pay 23 
million in lost wages to 115 employees who were not allowed to work 
because of their weight 
other carriers including delta airlines and usair have less 
stringent weight charts delta and trans world airlines allow 
considerable leeway in pounds for aging flight attendants 
united airlines is proposing dropping its weight regulations 
northwest and continental have already done so 
americans weight standards are roughly tied to a 1959 
metropolitan life insurance co chart at american a 5foot5inch 
attendant may weigh no more than 129 pounds 
the same employee could weigh up to 138 pounds at delta with 4 
added pounds as she ages and up to 150 pounds at pan am plus an 
additional 9 pounds as she ages at united airlines she could 
weigh up to 137 pounds plus an extra 9 pounds as she ages 
american airlines weight guidelines were modified slightly in 
1975 after a court challenge but the union argues that 80 percent 
of the flight attendants were under 35 then american dismisses the 
argument that a woman inevitably gains weight with age children or 
menopause 
american airlines president robert crandall during a recent 
speech to about 500 employees in new york was confronted by ms 
huttoblake 
were not all young thin employees today she told him 
there has been a graying of the cabin 
by her side stood doris johnson 46 of new york who was 
suspended without pay in september after 17 years of flying she is 
5feet4 139 pounds wears a size 9 shoe has undergone a 
hysterectomy and has spent a decade fighting to stay below 125 
pounds to keep her job 
i must say in looking at you im surprised you dont look 
like you have a weight problem crandall told ms johnson she 
took a demotion last week to a ground position to avoid being fired 
but crandall insists weight standards are necessary weve got 
some people on our airplanes that are way too heavy 
in los angeles 28year veteran patt gibbs took a fouryear 
leave to become union president upon her return the 5foot3inch 
ms gibbs was 154 pounds 29 pounds over her limit 
it was pretty humiliating she said they said thats 
that youre too heavy lose the weight or you wont have a job 
she lost the weight and returned to work 
also in los angeles sherri cappello was fired the day she 
received her 25year service pin 
in march she was elected vice president by the largest number 
of votes in the unions history some measure of how the 
rankandfile think about weight standards 
in wisconsin after flying 43 years petey peterson retired two 
years before turning 65 and getting a full pension she was in the 
berlin airlift received american airlines award of valor and was 
among the last of those who started in days when flight attendants 
had to be registered nurses 
i was forced into early retirement because i could no longer 
fit the image and take the harassment of the flight attendant 
weight program as enforced by my 29yearold supervisor she says

editors note the first spring publishers list of the decade 
is loaded with books on sex and love many looking at what the aids 
threat has done to the sexual revolution with some hints at what 
the future holds here is a sampling 
</TEXT>

sex in the 1990s what are we in for 
the naughty nineties the nice nineties 
a recent spate of books on sex love and related matters about 
one title a day came out in february alone could offer hints at 
the sexual mores of the next 10 years 
but many of them look more at where we are coming from rather 
than where we are going 
in mayflower manners etiquette for consenting adults 
former madam sidney biddle barrows brings up the delicate matter of 
good breeding and condoms 
is it assumed she asks that the man will provide them 
is it therefore rude of the woman to preempt that sacred 
responsibility by producing them herself 
this is definitely a nineties question in the world war ii era 
of rosie the riveter even to hint that a woman carried a supply of 
condoms in her pocketbook was decidedly bad form it was absolutely 
unspeakable in the 1930s the decade of the censorious hays office 
in hollywood and a prudish motion picture code 
but may 6 1960 was apparently a pivotal date in the history of 
american sex on that day say jane and michael stern coauthors 
of sixties people the federal drug administration declared 
enovid the first birth control pill safe for prescription sales 
within six years one out of five women of childbearing age 
had a prescription sixties people were infatuated with the pill 
it was a prime symbol of modern life in general 
thanks to the pill carefree sex became yet another of the 
futuristic possibilities that the new decade offered a girl on the 
pill could have sex any time she pleased 
and so we find this passage in daniel mark epsteins loves 
compass a natural history of the heart which contains 
recollections of life and love in the 60s 
when madeline returned to the little college town in the 
autumn of my junior year we found each other at once i tried 
to assure madeline that i would love her as she deserved to be 
loved and in the true spirit of the 1960s we became lovers 
without further ceremony or preamble 
sex out of wedlock adds epstein was simply forbidden 
until the 1960s when we legitimized it per force majeure by 
resacralizing erotic love such an experience as ours may never be 
normal again 
for homosexuals too the world has changed in recent decades as 
many came out into the open but with aids the nineties offer the 
bleak prospect that life for gays may never be the same again 
as allan berube argues in coming out under fire gay men and 
women in world war ii the war itself thanks strangely enough 
to the growing power of psychiatrists was a setback for the gay 
community 
traditionally the military had never officially excluded or 
discharged homosexuals from its ranks says berube but in 
world war ii a dramatic change occurred as psychiatrists increased 
their authority in the armed forces they developed new screening 
procedures to discover and disqualify homosexual men 
the generation of gay men and women who served in world war ii 
grew into adulthood fighting one war for their country and another 
to protect themselves from their governments escalating 
mobilization against them 
half a century later it is a different and deadlier war for the 
nations homosexuals 
there are an estimated 12 million gay men in the united 
states many of whom seek longterm committed relationships in the 
face of the aids epidemic says the publisher of rik isensees 
love between men enhancing intimacy and keeping your 
relationships alive a clinical social worker in san francisco 
isensee deals with such things as what to do when a lover has 
aids 
could this disease in fact become the bubonic plague of the 
1990s the 20th century version of the black death that wiped out a 
third of europe in the 14th century 
more than a million americans are infected with hiv human 
immunodeficiency virus of these statistics indicate that 20 
percent to 50 percent will develop aids within five years 
according to dr alan brauer and his wife donna j brauer who run 
the brauer medical and health center in palo alto calif 
curiously the brauers dire scenario appears in their jointly 
written the eso ecstasy program which the publisher bills as 
the sensual guide for the nineties 
noting that orgasm is totally safe this hefty work explains 
step by step in relentless detail how to achieve eso extended 
sexual orgasm in a methodical 12week program of sexual exercises 
in the 13th week the reader then comes to a chapter titled beyond 
ecstasy 
another medical writer questions whether sex is really a 
necessary ingredient of love at all 
is love always sexually connected asks dr theodore isaac 
rubin md in real love what it is and how to find it he 
says the answer is no 
heterosexual men can love heterosexual men heterosexual women 
can love heterosexual women i disagree with those freudians who 
believe that there is always a sexual current or correlation 
present 
love concludes rubin the author of a couple of 
bestselling books and a frequent guest on tv shows can be 
sexual or nonsexual 
love set free at last in the 1990s from the tyranny of lust 
how much was hoped from sex how little sex can deliver 
professor camille paglia observes in her massive study sexual 
personae art and decadence from nefertiti to emily dickinson 
take as an example emily dickinson herself the new england 
poet says paglia associate professor of humanities at 
philadelphia college of the performing arts is the american 
sade she is frightening this shy victorian spinster was a male 
genius and visionary sadist a fictive sexual persona of towering 
force 
as archie bunker that amiable television bigot of the 1970s 
once said sex used to be up in the mind thats where it 
belongs

richard beymer says he had no idea how rotten 
his character would become when he was cast as the kingpin of abcs 
twin peaks 
beymer plays business entrepreneur benjamin horne in director 
david lynchs new series that offers a quirky blend of soap opera 
murder mystery and black comedy 
he says johanna ray the casting director had originally 
considered him for the role of the psychiatrist the part russ 
tamblyn plays then lynch suggested he could be benjamin horne 
i had no idea now nefarious and slimy he was going to be 
beymer says every time i got a new script he was doing this or 
that its like waking up one morning and finding yourself an arch 
villain isnt that a nightmare 
horne owns the great northern hotel a department store and 
other properties but is also conspiring with catherine packard 
martell piper laurie to acquire the packard sawmill 
the show centers on the murder of laura palmer a high school 
homecoming queen who had a mysterious link to virtually everyone in 
the picturesque lumber mill town of twin peaks near the 
washingtoncanadian border each episode slowly reveals the dirty 
secrets of its characters 
twin peaks is an acting comeback for beymer whose career 
faltered after youthful starring roles in such hit films as west 
side story and the diary of anne frank he worked mostly as a 
film editor cinematographer and filmmaker before returning to 
acting in the 1980s 
beymer was born in iowa but his family moved here when he was a 
child he began working on a local television show when he was 10 
at 13 he was in so big and went to rome for indiscretions of 
an american wife he was in diary of anne frank when he was 
19 and west side story two years later 
this summer beymer will direct a theatrical movie based on his 
adaptation of michael wolks novel the big picture 
i did four or five films after west side story beymer 
says i didnt quit things changed i went to new york and got 
into the actors studio with the encouragement of joanne woodward 
id been in pictures with joanne and paul newman and eli wallach 
and i had never studied acting 
then in early 1964 i became socially conscious and went to 
mississippi for the voter registration drive it struck me as a 
wonderful thing to document i bought a 16mm bolex camera and 
filmed everything i saw i brought the film back to los angeles and 
spent the next nine months editing it 
the documentary which became a regular bouquet was 
narrated by robert ryan it was shown on the pbs series eyes on 
the prize 
beymer later made educational films and spent six years on a 
film called innerview 
in 1984 he had a starring role in the abc series paper dolls 
thankfully they canceled it he says i ran a sportswear 
fashion company i was ready for it to be over after 13 shows it 
was totally about hair and makeup and glamour 
beymer says he wants to film the big picture as 
inconspicuously as possible in new york city he wrote the 
screenplay and will direct but will not appear in it he says the 
title will be changed because another movie has the same title 
the process is what interests me he says im not 
interested in going out with trucks and hair and makeup and 
creating a big circus i want a film that uses real people and 
integrates real situations into the film hollywood films focus on 
the star you dont get to know anyone else 
the main character in the big picture is max popper who 
writes pornography to support his other writing and becomes caught 
up in a murder 
it takes place around times square where all those wonderful 
old movie houses now show porno films

curt dempster champions the oneact play an art 
form embraced by playwrights but usually ignored by broadway 
eugene oneill wrote a lot of oneacts so did tennessee 
williams and joe orton neil simon turned out plaza suite and 
california suite david mamet still writes oneacts so do 
arthur miller harold pinter christopher durang tom stoppard and 
others 
but except for simons efforts the works rarely get to 
broadway oneact plays considered death at the box office are 
the stepchildren of the commercial theater and most of the time 
they are not part of the regular subscription seasons at the 
countrys larger regional or nonprofit theaters either 
oneact plays flourish however at festivals celebrations that 
offer everything from simple readings to fully staged productions 
and there are scores of them across the country according to the 
theater communications group a national organization for 
nonprofit professional theater 
from the tennessee williams new orleans literary festival 
oneact play contest to the minnesota oneact play festival to the 
national oneact play contest by actors theater of louisville to 
the young playwrights festival in new york they all celebrate the 
short drama 
one of the bestknown is the oneact marathon run by dempster at 
new yorks ensemble studio theater a small theater company located 
in an old west side furniture warehouse a block from the hudson 
river 
this offoffbroadway theater founded by dempster in 1971 does 
a lot of other things est with a staff of about 35 full and 
parttime employees presents fulllength works and staged readings 
each year but the jewel in its theatrical crown is its annual 
sixweek marathon of oneact plays 
this years festival began in early may and runs until june 20 
among the wellknown writers represented by the 12 oneacts spread 
over three separate evenings are mamet frank d gilroy john ford 
noonan romulus linney and joyce carol oates but there are 
newcomers too such as 24yearold paul weitz and susan kim who 
is having her first professional production anywhere 
among the oneacts being done this year are a bluestinged 
1990s version of hamlet by shel silverstein eulogy for 
mister hamm a short musical by michael john lachiusa set in a 
seedy hotel and tonight we love a comedy by romulus linney 
about love in a nursing home 
ensemble studio theater which dempster heads as artistic 
director began its oneact festival in 1978 at that time they 
were all alone dempster says now there are nearly a dozen oneact 
festivals in new york alone 
we wanted to focus attention on the neglect the oneact had 
fallen into he recalls we wanted to restore it to its place 
in literature 
most of the oneacts est performs are by its playwriting unit 
which now numbers about 60 members but the theater which has a 
yearly budget of about 800000 also looks at oneact plays sent 
in by regional theaters and unknown writers 
we get a couple thousand a year dempster says play 
readers go through them and evaluate them 
after the number is cut to about 100 the est staff reads them 
and the number is sliced to 40 after more discussions the list is 
cut to 20 finalists and then 12 plays are chosen from that group 
its a long process that takes all year to do dempster 
says theres some yelling and screaming im sort of like the 
president but have an unofficial gentlemans agreement with a 
committee of artist members they have a veto over one play that i 
may love and they hate and if i hate a play they all love i can 
veto that the plays we finally have up on stage are plays we can 
all support 
with all the material coming in the readers tend to notice fads 
or trends 
those types of plays dont tend to get into the marathon 
because they usually are plays that are topical ideas rather than 
artistic ideas dempster says like child abuse plays or plays 
about alcoholism phone sex and incest plays are big now we 
probably read 20 plays a year on incest 
if somebody writes a play now about alcoholism i say did 
you ever read come back little sheba by william inge 
dempster says thats a wonderful little realistic american 
play about a man whos an alcoholic and it says everything you can 
say about the tragedy of alcoholism if you cant do better than 
that why write one 
things looked up for the lowly oneact play in new york this 
season there were several major collections of oneacts at 
lincoln center artistic director gregory mosher paired mamets 
bobby gould in hell with the devil and billy markham by 
shel silverstein two devilishly funny oneacters 
the new york shakespeare festival currently has a big success 
with spunk a trio of plays adapted by george c wolfe from 
three stories by the black writer zora neale hurston it also is 
doing caryl churchills hot fudge pairing it with a short 
twoact play by the same playwright called what else ice 
cream and manhattan theater club revived terrence mcnallys zany 
double bill that went under the collective title of bad habits

forty years after sam walton first hung 
out his shingle waltons 5amp10 will reopen to show how a little 
rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire 
walmart stores incs visitors center opens wednesday in the 
same building on the downtown square where walton first opened for 
business on may 9 1950 
the center chronicles the rise of the nations fastestgrowing 
discount chain using displays and audiovideo presentations it 
concentrates on how the free enterprise system works and how 
walmart thrived when similar companies didnt 
the window displays date back to the stores opening with 
simplicity patterns and johnsons glocoat a box of dreft and some 
ivory snow inside an electronic map details the companys 
1500plus store chain today 
also on display at the center is the hula skirt that sam walton 
donned for his dance on wall street which he performed after 
challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pretax profit 
in 1984 the goal was accomplished and he danced 
the old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of 
the nations biggest discount retailer behind k mart corp of 
detroit 
walton and his brother bud opened the first walmart discount 
city in 1962 both will be on hand for the opening along with a 
sprinkling of other dignitaries including gov bill clinton the 
dedication speaker 
aside from the other displays and presentations the center also 
has a replica of sam waltons original office at the store 
including many fixtures he used 40 years ago 
also on display is a photograph of young sam walton a fatfaced 
baby born in oklahoma in the 1920s typical of the walmart 
outlook dust bowl oklahoma is termed a place to grow and to 
dream in a video on the walton family 
after a stint with jc penney co and the army he opened a ben 
franklin store in newport in 1945 he lost the lease on that one 
and relocated to bentonville thats where the story took off 
sam walton convinced bob bogle then a public health officer to 
take over management of his bentonville ben franklin store in 1955 
walton said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores and 
needed someone to tend the shop in bentonville while he and his 
brother built a chain of ben franklins bogle said in a recent 
interview 
thats when bogle found himself in waltons learn as you go 
training program 
i got home at 10 oclock that night after scrubbing and waxing 
the floor with sam bogle said 
inauspicious first impressions are part of the story in one 
video david glass who succeeded sam walton as chief executive of 
walmart in 1988 recalled his impressions after attending the 
opening of the second walmart discount city at harrison in 1964 
the first store at rogers opened two years earlier 
i thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discount 
store or retail store i have ever seen said glass who was 
president of a drugstore chain at the time 
and walmart vice chairman donald soderquist recalls that when 
walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to 
ben franklin headquarters in chicago officials there just really 
didnt see a future in it 
don shinkle walmarts director of corporate and public 
affairs attributed walmarts success to its associates the 
term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all walmart 
employees are partners in the company and to sam waltons 
leadership and knack for hiring the right person at the right 
time 
at the start of 1990 walmart owned 1402 stores employed 
272000 and listed sales of 258 billion sams wholesale club 
closed out the year with 123 units and walmart announced plans to 
enter the california market

four local middle school students are 
traveling 5000 miles for a hamburger and fries 
the students members of an eighth grade civics class are 
flying to the soviet union this week on an 11day tour sponsored by 
steel of west virginia inc 
theyll be free to do and see what they want in the soviet union 
and berlin with one exception 
to make sure they understand the ins and outs of world 
economics the students must visit the moscow mcdonalds 
just to drive it home to 14yearolds the only stipulation is 
that they have to stand in line at mcdonalds and buy a 
hamburger said teacher and chaperone jean mcclelland 
officials of steel of west virginia which makes custom steel 
products have been participating in a program in which local 
business officials visit ms mcclellands civics classes once a 
week to teach students about economics 
but while the other visitors have been content to provide gifts 
for a schoolsponsored auction at the end of the term steel of 
west virginias representatives opted for a more expensive present 
the company is footing the 14000 bill for the trip including air 
fare lodging and the cost of obtaining passports 
we believe that we can have an impact upon the children 
that will affect them positively for the rest of their lives 
said larry gue vice president of human affairs at steel of west 
virginia thats all were looking for 
he said the company picked the soviet union because of the 
economic lessons presented by the moscow mcdonalds the difference 
between huntingtons mcdonalds and its inexpensive fast food and 
the moscow operation where customers are willing to stand in line 
for hours to spend a substantial part of their paycheck for 
essentially the same items 
the idea is hopefully theyll understand the american free 
enterprise system gue said 
mcclelland has 25 students in her civics class the class came 
up with the criteria their teacher used in picking the four winners 
including attendance grades and willingness to go new places and 
eat strange foods 
they also were given one week for research and then asked to 
write an essay about the soviet union even the worst students gave 
it a shot mcclelland said 
i had never ever gotten essays of that quality before she 
said 
one eventual winner jason simms wrote a paper titled is the 
party over another sonja meenach wrote about communications in 
the soviet union 
its exciting and the chance of a lifetime said another 
winner sara walker 
the group flies to new york on steel of west virginias 
corporate jet wednesday then catches a flight to frankfurt west 
germany for a 5hour layover and a connecting flight to leningrad 
mcclelland and the students will tour the soviet union for a 
week then travel to berlin for three days before returning to the 
united states 
although just four students were chosen for the trip their 
fellow students have been caught up in the excitement mcclelland 
said 
the whole schools been studying the soviet union she said 
theyve been having speakers videos music classes have been 
studying russian composers health classes have been studying jet 
lag even math classes have been studying how far it is to moscow 
during their trip the students will make videotapes and attempt 
to call their classmates during class 
we wanted to share the experience mcclelland said we 
didnt want to be selfish

even the louvres curators would 
envy the masterpieces in the gallery next door to the lunch counter 
advertising a grilled cheese special 
van goghs les iris is around the corner from a few monet 
landscapes at the storefront gallery in fort lauderdale across the 
room works from the italian renaissance and the early american 
hudson river school share the same wall 
theyre all fakes theyre all for sale 
a forger yes were expert forgers you could say but we make 
no attempt to deceive we dont pretend to sell original works we 
sell reproductions said ernest thomas cummins president of 
heritage house trading group ltd 
we have all the thrill of being a forger but no risk 
with prices for original art rising into the tens of millions 
some art lovers are turning to highquality copies done by expert 
artists in addition some museums confronting skyrocketing 
insurance premiums are considering stashing the authentic pieces 
and displaying a reproduction said cummins 
no major us art museum is known to be displaying reproductions 
in place of originals such a practice would raise questions about 
why people visit museums in the first place but museum security 
has become a growing concern 
last month a man in amsterdam sprayed a rembrandt with an acid 
solution and caused minor damage in march thieves dressed as 
police officers robbed 11 paintings and other objects from bostons 
gardner museum 
bids for paintings have climbed at auction houses in 1987 
australian investor alan bond paid a record 539 million for les 
iris 
at fort lauderdalebased heritage house prices run from about 
1000 to 10000 for the paintings of paintings depending on the 
size and complexity of the original said cummins 34 a founder of 
the upscale robb report magazine heritage house which started 
producing the repainted masters in late 1987 also has opened a 
shop in carmel calif 
the heritage house works are full paintings rather than 
photographs or prints 
we deal with people who want to live with great art not just 
visit it he said 
a telephone call usually begins the three to fourmonth process 
of making a reproduction heritage house advertises in art and 
leisure publications a small classified in the wall street journal 
recently brought in dozens of inquiries said cummins 
we get all kinds of calls he said some people want 
specific paintings or copies of originals they already have to put 
in a second home on the other hand we get calls from people 
saying can you do something with a dog 
once a commitment is made cummins contacts one of the nearly 
200 european artists used by the gallery in europe where copying 
masterpieces is a centuriesold craft specially trained painters 
often use the pigments and brushes typical of the period of the 
original 
a completed painting is then placed in a frame closely 
resembling its era sometimes the gallery purchases 17th century 
furniture to use the wood for frames said cummins 
the final step is the antiquing process using chemicals and 
natural heat and humidity we can make special types of cracks 
from little spiderweb types to long splits said cummins 
to guard against misrepresentations the canvases and frames are 
stamped and the paintings contain markings only visible under an 
ultraviolet light 
were working in techniques that have been handed down for 
centuries said cummins the master copier hands down his 
knowledge to the apprentices and so on there is nothing new to 
what we are doing 
only recently however has the demand for nearperfect 
reproductions reached beyond a handful of collectors 
several european galleries now specialize in copies of priceless 
musuem works parisian gallery owner daniel delamere has gained 
status in the art world for selling repoductions and promising 
never to copy the same work again 
although delamere bills his socalled oneofakind 
reproductions as an investment that could appreciate in value 
cummins said heritage house works are merely decorations 
people want our paintings because they love art and appreciate 
a real painting as opposed to a lithograph or something he said 
thomas hoving editor of connoisseur magazine and former 
director of new yorks metropolitan museum of art said there may 
be a limited market for quality reproductions but he knows of no 
major us museum displaying copies 
some people may want these paintings in their home i do not 
see any market for museums he said 
but even known forgeries are finding a niche among art 
auctioneers last month in london bonhams gallery put on the block 
30 paintings by the late master forger elmyr de hory nearby the 
british museums exhibit fake the art of deception features 
nearly 600 skillful imitations 
international copyright laws prohibit commercial copies of 
artists works until 50 years after their death heritage house 
also does not attempt reproductions of watercolors and multimedia 
works said cummins 
cummins closely guards the identities of his copiers claiming 
many fear public disclosure would drop the prices for their 
original pieces and draw ridicule from peers 
its a very sensitive subject and most would prefer to simply 
keep it a secret he said 
still some of the artists eccentricities cannot be hidden 
we have some artists who walk around in the clothes of the 
period they are painting in said cummins sometimes we get 
letters from them written in an archaic style that you can barely 
understand its a strange business

members of the largest union at mcdonnell 
douglas corp have approved a new threeyear contract at the 
aerospacedefense giant averting a strike that union officials 
said appeared almost certain a week ago 
union members voted sunday to accept the contract 5379 to 
2463 said cassell williams president of the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers district 837 
negotiators reached agreement on the contract saturday 
following an 18hour bargaining session that began friday morning 
negotiations had been held intermittently since march 20 
williams said he was surprised by the abrupt change in contract 
negotiations last week i thought wed be on the picket line 
he said 
vince deblaze mcdonnell douglas chief negotiator said the 
vote showed the union agreed that the new contract is fair to both 
sides 
weve been through a tough round of negotiations but it all 
paid off today he said 
under the new contract workers are guaranteed a 5 percent pay 
increase in the first year followed by two annual raises of 3 
percent each williams said in addition workers will get a 4 
percent salary bonus each year he said 
hourly wages now average 14 williams said 
were happy that we dont have to strike but were unhappy 
about not getting more williams said we would have liked to 
have gotten more money for our retirees and we would have liked to 
increased benefits in our insurance and savings plans 
had a strike developed it would have been one in a series of 
blows that have been dealt to mcdonnell douglas the areas no 1 
employer with 40000 workers based in st louis 
the market for the companys jet fighters helicopters and giant 
military cargo planes has shrunk because of cuts at the pentagon 
mcdonnell douglas commercial aircraft subsidiary douglas aircraft 
in long beach calif also is losing money and the companys 
stock price has traded recently at a 52week low 
the contract vote was announced at the close of a threehour 
meeting sunday 
some union members said they had wanted more from the pact 
terra johnson who has worked at the company two years said she 
had voted against the contract because she felt the retirement 
benefits were inadequate 
most of the young people here dont think about retirement 
but im getting old enough to start worrying about it she said 
but deblaze said what you have to look at is the total 
package we came up with a package that was acceptable that had 
substantial improvements for the union 
district 837 represents 11850 of about 13000 hourly 
wageearners at mcdonnell douglas 
other mcdonnell douglas unions in st louis include two 
teamsters locals electrical workers local 1 and one representing

carl icahn took his battle with usx corp 
management to the companys annual meeting today but the corporate 
raider conceded that his plan to split the steelenergy giant in 
two could fail 
icahn usxs biggest shareholder disclosed the pessimism as he 
urged other stockholders to approve his proposal for separating the 
companys healthier marathon oil co subsidiary from its laggard 
us steel business 
about 600 shareholders packed a junior high school auditorium in 
findlay marathons hometown to hear icahn and usx management 
present their views on how to shape the future of one of the 
biggest us industrial corporations 
the vote on icahns plan is widely seen as a test of how much 
influence corporate takeover strategists still have now that much 
of the muscle to back up their threats billions of dollars in 
financing has atrophied because of a severe decline in their war 
chest the market for high risk junk bonds 
results of the vote arent expected for at least a week but 
icahn who has 133 percent of usx shares or about 34 million 
shares admitted as the meeting began that he might not have the 
crucial support needed from five or six large institutional 
investors about 200 million shares were expected to be voted 
these large institutions whom icahn didnt identify preferred 
to allow management to do it on their own he told shareholders 
under icahns plan 80 percent of us steel would be spun off 
as a dividend to shareholders each shareholder would own stock in 
us steel and marathon that icahn estimated would be worth a 
combined value of 48 
the unlikelihood of approval evidently depressed usxs stock 
price late this morning shares were trading at 3350 on the new 
york stock exchange down 50 cents from friday 
several shareholders objected to icahns plan and backed usx 
chairman charles corry who wants to keep both steel and energy 
under one roof the antiicahn shareholders said they want usx to 
remain intact so the steel and energy businesses could support each 
other when one wasnt doing well 
corry also contended that the steel businesss profitability had 
improved in recent years and that he too was frustrated by the 
companys relatively low stock price nonetheless he told 
shareholders the real question is would the specific icahn 
proposal address that 
icahns comments generally were met with polite appluse but 
shareholders calling for the defeat of his proposal got a larger 
hand from the gathering 
the meeting today was preceded by an intense lobbying effort by 
both sides to woo shareholders 
its disappointing when a management appears to reject a 
program that could do nothing but benefit all shareholders icahn 
said in an open letter in newspapers to corry last week corry 
respnded with his own open letter calling icahns proposal is 
flawed and is neither cost nor tax efficient 
even if icahns proposal doesnt garner a majority analysts who 
have followed the company and the takeover business in general 
speculated usx would have to respond if his plan received a 
substantial number of votes 
icahn chairman of trans world airlines is a veteran of wars 
with management at usx and other big companies and has learned he 
can win even in defeat he lost a fight to unseat the board of 
texaco inc two years ago but the oil giant later restructured and 
he took home a 3386 million dividend 
the usx vote represents a test of sorts on the future of 
takeover strategists stymied by a lack of financing since the 
collapse of the junk bond market last fall wouldbe dealmakers and 
corporate raiders have returned to proxy votes and shareholder 
proposals to seek control of companies or a bigger voice in 
management 
a clear loss for icahn would place into doubt how much power a 
strategist has these days 
in march investor harold simmons lost a fight to unseat the 
board of lockheed corp the big winners in that battle were the big 
institutional investors who forced lockheed management to make 
some big concessions in exchange for their support

rigs improved slightly this week increasing by three to total 930 
baker hughes inc reported monday 
the rig count showed a modest gain after posting declines for 
several weeks last week the count slipped by five to 927 
a year ago the rig count was 764 baker hughes said 
baker hughes rig count is the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity it reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oilproducing states louisiana posted the largest 
gain with eight followed by california with three michigan and 
wyoming each gained two while colorado ohio and texas had one 
more each

treasury secretary nicholas f brady said 
today the united states will support increasing the resources of 
the international monetary fund only if it agrees to crack down on 
poor countries behind in their loan payments 
bradys comments to imfs policymaking interim committee came 
one day after finance leaders of the worlds seven largest 
industrial powers endorsed a 50 percent boost in the funds 
resources to 180 billion from the current 120 billion 
brady acknowledged that the 152nation lending organization 
needs more money to meet new demand for its loans from eastern 
european countries moving from communism to capitalism as well as 
for developing nations although the united states had supported a 
smaller boost he said it has agreed to 50 percent as a compromise 
we firmly believe that the imf must have adequate resources 
to continue to fulfill its critical responsibilities in the 
world economy he said 
however he said the united states would support an increase in 
capital contributions from member nations called quotas only if 
the fund adopts a new strategy to wring 4 billion in back payments 
from 11 countries sudanzambia peru honduras guyana cambodia 
vietnam liberia panama sierra leone and somalia 
these arrears pose a fundamental challenge to the imfs 
financial integrity and its central role in the world economy 
brady said 
the group of seven finance ministers and central bank chiefs 
from the united states japan west germany great britain france 
canada and italy met sunday in an ornate caucus room in the 
capitol 
they said a 50 percent quota increase would provide the fund 
with the resources to fulfill its central responsibilities in the 
world economy 
imf managing director michel camdessus originally sought a 100 
percent increase to enable the fund to support emerging capitalism 
in eastern europe and back bradys strategy for easing the crushing 
13 trillion third world debt 
many developing countries are pushing for a bigger increase and 
70 percent of the imf membership has supported an increase of 
twothirds or more 
the issue moves today to the 22nation interim committee the 
imf policy board the increase must be approved by 85 percent of 
the funds voting power the united states with 20 percent of the 
voting power effectively has a veto on the matter 
its going to be a difficult meeting one that will take some 
time and some very sensitive listening said canadian finance 
minister michael wilson chairman of the interim committee 
currency markets often the focus of group of seven gatherings 
received less attention exchange rates have been relatively stable 
since the ministers last meeting on april 7 in paris but the yen 
remains near a threeyear low against the dollar 
in sundays statement the officials noted with satisfaction 
the recent stability of exchange markets but said they remained 
of the view that the present level may have undesirable 
consequences for the global adjustment process 
a weak yen helps boost the us trade deficit by making american 
goods more expensive in japan and japanese products cheaper in the 
united states 
also on the agenda of the session closed to reporters and the 
public were the economic efects of the reunification of germany 
and a review of progress since brady launched the new debt strategy 
in march 1989 
the group of seven gathering preceded the spring meetings today 
and tuesday of the imf and its sister lending organization the 
world bank its seal of approval is the crucial first step for the 
60 billion increase in capital contributions known as quotas the 
us share would be about 12 billion 
the increase faces opposition from members of congress skeptical 
of foreign aid programs even though the complex treatment of imf 
finances keeps the us contribution from showing up in the budget 
deficit 
at the urging of the united states the group of seven also 
agreed to link the quota increase with a plan to deal with the 11 
countries which are about 4 billion behind in loan payments to the 
imf 
money in a special imf fund would be used to help the countries 
pull their economies up however nations in arrears would lose 
their voting rights and gold roughly equivalent to their original 
contribution to the imf could be sold if they did not meet their 
obligations 
the group of 24 which represents third world countries said in 
a statement that suspending voting rights will not serve a useful 
purpose and is not acceptable 
regarding german unification the group of seven said it would 
contribute to improved noninflationary global growth and to a 
reduction of external imbalances 
however most private economists worry that plans to give the 
east german mark equal value in many instances with the west german 
mark will add to inflation worldwide pushing interest rates higher

president bush has agreed with congressional 
leaders to set no preconditions on their effort to negotiate a 
bipartisan budget compromise the white house said today 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the talks will be 
unfettered by stances from the past including bushs 
longstanding insistence that there be no new taxes 
he said new efforts to forge a compromise were motivated in part 
by anxiety over a deficit that is fighting every reduction 
attempt that we can come up with 
the participants agreed on two or three kind of basic 
operating principles one would be that there are no preconditions 
that anyone can bring up an issue for discussion and debate 
fitzwater told reporters 
they agreed that they cant negotiate a budget in public that 
it does take a lot of give and take and moving back and forth so 
well try to keep a little mystery in the marriage the spokesman 
said 
they will continue the process as long as they believe that it 
has a chance of being productive there are no deadlines he said 
asked whether bush was abandoning his refusal to consider 
raising taxes fitzwater reke over 
investigations in kashmir at least 300 people have been killed in 
the northwestern state since the government cracked down on a 
moslem separatist movement in january 
just south of kashmir bureau agents are investigating 
separatist violence by sikh extremists in punjab state 
many punjab police are virtually confined to their barracks 
because they are favorite targets of sikh extremists who have 
killed more than 5800 people in punjab since 1987 
in assam a remote northeastern state bureau agents are looking 
closely at the bodos an animist tribe that believes spirits live 
in rocks and trees the bodos want a separate state within india 
and have attacked assamese hindus 
the real work of shekhars agency however is fighting 
corruption 
indias british colonial rulers established the central bureau 
of investigation soon after world war ii to investigate links 
between indian businessmen and the government that work continued 
after independence in 1947 
of the 1200 cases filed by the bureaus 3907 agents every 
year about 1000 are corruptionrelated shekhar said 
corruption is the grease of south asias wheels 
traffic cops routinely take baksheesh small cash payments 
to ignore violations businessmen consider payoffs and kickbacks 
part of the job 
shekhar said the problem has been growing 
industrialization inflation development unemployment all 
contribute to it he said and the facets that give impetus to 
corruption are getting more and more pronounced 
preliminary charges have been filed in three cases involving 
members of gandhis government two concern alleged payment of 
bribes by europes airbus industrie consortium and 
hawaldtswerkedeutsche werft a west german submarine manufacturer 
a former highlevel civil servant was charged in connection with 
a 147 billion airbus deal for 38 planes and a former defense 
secretary was named in a case involving four west german subs worth 
334 million 
the agency also has filed preliminary charges related to a 14 
billion artillery contract with the swedish arms manufacturer ab 
bofors bureau investigators have charged bofors with cheating 
india out of 37 million and indian government officials not 
identified with criminal misconduct 
charges related to an alleged political dirty tricks campaign 
against the son of prime minster singh are expected soon 
western diplomats say the growing scope of bureau responsibily 
is a sign local police cannot cope with the level and complexity of 
crime in india 
it also indicates they say that the central government does 
not trust local officials 
under these circumstances its easy for the law enforcment 
process to break down a diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity the bureau is stretched too thin they dont have good 
relations with local police and the crooks keep committing crimes 
critics say many of the bureaus investigations are politically 
motivated 
charges of corruption haunted the gandhi administration singh 
formerly gandhis finance minister quit the government when his 
corruption investigations were stymied 
diplomats say there appears to be vindictiveness in the 
investigations and cite the one concerning the prime ministers 
son 
by forcing the bureau to concentrate on what many consider a 
minor case singhs administration is using law enforcement to 
fight its political battles another western diplomat said 
shekhar denied his bureau could be used for political purposes 
our work has nothing to with politics he said if we 
think the case is legitimate we investigate 
shekhar made his mark late in his career when he led the 
investigation of one of indias biggest bank robberies the theft 
of 335 million from the punjab national bank in 1987 
ten of the original 24 suspects wound up dead but shekhar says 
the police didnt kill them 
several others disappeared and only a few were convicted and 
jailed in the indian context the case was considered a success 
the director general looks at his current post in a similar 
light incremental steps can be taken but no major changes should 
be expected 
if we can set an example with one or two corruption cases i 
suppose we are doing our job shekhar said but then again 
nobody could pay any attention

atlantic richfield co reported monday that 
its first quarter profit declined 22 percent over a year ago 
despite firmer crude oil prices 
the oil giant said a big aftertax gain in last years quarter 
and additional provisions for future cleanup costs this year 
helped depress its latest results 
for the first three months of 1990 arco netted 547 million or 
328 per share down from earnings of 704 million or 4 a share 
in 1989 sales were up 6 percent to 421 billion from 396 
billion 
arco said the 1989 quarter included a 634 million aftertrax 
gain from the initial public offering of lyondell petrochemical 
co although that was partially offset by 345 million in charges 
for future environmental and other expenses 
in this years quarter arco adopted new accounting procedures 
resulting in a 323 million reduction in its deferred tax 
liability however that was partially offset by 233 million in 
charges for expenses such as future cleanups it said 
excluding those onetime considerations earnings would have 
risen 10 percent to 457 million from 415 million due to 
improving prices for crude oil and refined products and higher 
natural gas sales arco chairman lodwrick m cook said 
aftertax quarterly earnings for worldwide oil and gas 
operations rose 64 percent to 319 million from 195 million 
arcos average price for domestic crude oil was 1472 per 
42gallon barrel up from 1185 per barrel in the first quarter of 
1989 
average domestic natural gas prices were 189 per thousand

the soviet government on monday doubled the price 
paid to grain farmers in hopes of stimulating this years harvest 
at the risk of a substantial increase in its budget deficit 
the price paid for topquality soft grain will rise from 260 
rubles to 500 rubles per ton under mondays order from the council 
of ministers the soviet news agency tass reported 
the price paid for other grains will rise by 30 percent to 
nearly 100 percent 
but while farmers will be paid more to produce animal feed they 
will not be asked to pay higher prices for the feed they buy the 
announcement said 
that could mean a hefty increase in government subsidies and the 
90 billion ruble or 150 billion budget deficit the deficit is 
considered a factor in the countrys problems with inflation and 
extreme shortages of food and consumer goods 
farmers who raise their crops without pesticides will be paid a 
premium tass said the soviet union two years ago awoke to a 
severe problem of food contamination due to overuse of agricultural

carl icahn sounded monday like he expected 
usx corp shareholders to defeat his plan for splitting up the 
steelenergy conglomerate but he still foresaw an eventual victory 
for his campaign to boost its stock price 
well stick around to see that stock value appreciate the 
takeover strategist said usx held its annual meeting were not 
going anywhere 
icahn conceded at the meeting that he might not have the crucial 
support of several big institutional investors for his nonbinding 
proposal to spin off usxs lackluster us steel subsidiary from 
the more robust marathon oil co 
the takeover strategist wellknown for his forays against 
texaco inc and other industrial giants says the breakup would 
boost usxs stock value 
but in the face of an anticipated defeat icahn whose 133 
percent stake in usx makes him the companys largest shareholder 
already had his next move figured out 
icahn said he would continue talking with the strong nucleus 
of shareholders who he said agreed that usx management must do 
something to improve the companys stock price 
icahn said he was unlikely to make a takeover bid for usx 
because the companys poison pill defense limited the number of 
shares he could buy 
nevertheless he indicated he expected his restructuring 
strategy to win out at usx as it had at texaco even though he lost 
a fight to win control of that companys management 
icahn lost a fight to unseat texacos board of directors at the 
oil giants 1988 annual meeting but several months later texaco 
management decided to undertake a restructuring including the 
sales of billions of dollars worth of assets that icahn had 
campaigned for as a means of boosting share values 
we were right at texaco he told reporters monday 
before the usx meeting observers said icahn eventually could 
force management to restructure aggressively even if his proposal 
failed the company has said it will continue its 10yearold 
restructuring but management wants to accomplish it on its own 
terms 
there was no surge of support for icahn apparent at mondays 
gathering he received polite applause for his comments but 
shareholders who spoke in favor of management and against breaking 
up the company got a slightly more enthusiastic hand 
the three and onehalfhour meeting was attended by some 600 
shareholders most of them individual stockholders and retirees of 
usx subsidiaries 
the meeting largely was uneventful the companys biggest 
shareholders the institutional investors did not speak and many 
already had submitted their proxies results of the vote were not 
expected for at least a week 
icahn got the most support from the crowd when he complained 
about the usx stock price which he contended would improve if us 
steel were spun off and shareholders were issued separate stock for 
us steel and for marathon 
the outcome of mondays vote was being watched as an indicator 
of how much strength takeover strategists have in the 1990s now 
that the debtfinanced takeover boom has ended 
in march takeover strategist harold simmons lost a proxy fight 
that sought to remove the board of directors at lockheed corp the 
biggest winners in that battle were institutional investors who 
extracted concessions from lockheed management

it was a typical monday morning at central 
junior high school athletes pounded the boards in the gymnasium 
and sewing machines hummed in home economics classes 
but the assembly in the school auditorium wasnt a gathering of 
seventh or eighthgraders the 600 people who packed the room were 
shareholders of usx corp 
it was the first time central junior high hosted an annual 
meeting usx spokesmen said but the school was ready for its 
visitors 
in addition to the auditorium school officials turned over 
their board room which was used by reporters as a press center 
and the school cafeteria which provided hot dogs for the 
journalists lunch 
reporters wandering through the basement past the cafeteria and 
lockers said they had a sense of deja vu 
of course this all begs the question what were they doing in a 
junior high school and what were they doing in findlay 
easy it was the only place with enough space to handle the 
crowd and findlay is home to marathon oil co one of usxs 
biggest subsidiaries 
usx also was wellorganized with an army of security officers 
and ushers inside the school and attendants guiding cars to 
parking spaces 
the 3hour meeting was orderly and cordial despite the 
presence on the agenda of a proposal by takeover strategist carl 
icahn to break up the steelandenergy conglomerate 
however one shareholder peter rosko of minneapolis used 
icahns proposal to make a few jabs at usx management 
icahn has contended his plan would give shareholders a higher 
price for their stock rosko asked usx chairman charles a corry 
what the usx stock price would be in 1992 if icahns plan was 
rejected 
corry responded that he did not know and rosko later laughed as 
he told a reporter i was simply goading him 
most of the shareholders at the meeting were individual 
stockholders and most of these appeared to be retirees who make 
regular appearances at such corporate sessions 
one shareholder who did not give his name stood up toward the 
end of the meeting and complimented corry for his handling of his 
first stockholder gathering corry succeeded david m roderick as 
usx chairman last june

eastern airlines on monday announced a moneyback 
guarantee to business travelers and sharply reduced fares for 
children on some flights in the latest bid to attract passengers 
to the rebuilding carrier 
martin shugrue the courtappointed trustee running eastern 
said travelers buying certain tickets could get their money back if 
they are for any reason unhappy with the flight the fares are 
geared to business travelers 
shugrue also said that summer fares for children to nine florida 
cities would be 39 on peak days and 29 on other days normally 
children pay standard fares 
eastern has tried a variety of promotions in recent months in an 
attempt to bounce back from more than a year of financial 
difficulties related to the strike that pushed the airline into 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
the miamibased airline whose largest hub is in atlanta 
expects to lose 330 million this year and has been operating at 65 
percent to 70 percent capacity on its flights 
delta air lines and american airlines said monday they were 
reviewing easterns offers but indicated they are not likely to 
match them 
deltas position is you have to charge what it costs to 
produce the service or you go out of business spokesman bill 
berry said what weve got to look at it is does it make sense 
to match a fare thats totally unrealistic 
easterns announcement followed its recent introduction of 
ynot reduced rates for passengers who purchase firstclass 
seats 
shugrue was named last month by a federal judge in us 
bankruptcy court in new york to operate eastern during its 
reorganization he said he was not concerned the rash of special 
offers would be viewed by the public as desperation moves 
i think that prior to the change in control perhaps there was 
a feeling in the marketplace that eastern wasnt long for this 
world shugrue told a news conference at hartsfield atlanta 
international airport 
obviously what im trying to do is to put that to rest we are 
here weve got plenty of cash available to us to fund our 
operation while we go through the reorganization process he said 
shugrue shed little new light on plans for guiding eastern 
through reorganization labor talks are continuing with pilots and 
the striking machinists union he said 
shugrues appointment as trustee stripped control of eastern 
from frank lorenzo whose texas air corp still owns the airline

hal riney amp partners fired in late march as the 
advertising agency for the perrier sparkling water brand has 
resigned as the agency for several other brands handled by perrier 
group of america inc 
john yost an executive of the san franciscobased ad agency on 
monday confirmed published reports that riney had quit the 
arrowhead zephyrhills ozarka and calistoga bottled water accounts 
last week 
he said the four brands spent about 8 million last year on 
advertising that is roughly what perrier group said it spent on 
advertising the perrier brand as well last year 
it was clear they were breaking up their business into a lot 
of smaller pieces yost said and it became clear we were not 
going to be able to negotiate a satisfactory compensation 
agreement 
the moves come just weeks after perrier was reintroduced in the 
united states following a february recall some bottles of the 
trendy and expensive import were tainted with traces of benzene 
believed to cause cancer when ingested in large doses 
perrier group spokeswoman jane lazgin said no plans had yet been 
made to find a new agency for the four brands she said riney would 
continue to service the accounts until midsummer 
she said one reason riney may have left is that perrier plans to 
consolidate media buying for all 10 of its bottled water brands at 
one agency that would give it greater clout than several agencies 
buying media for one of two brands at a time 
but such an arrangement may mean less compensation for agencies 
that do only the creative work without being responsible for 
arranging media placements 
lazgin said perrier has not yet decided which agency would 
handle media buying but said spending on all 10 brands should 
amount to about 25 million a year 
in addition to perrier and the four brands handled by riney 
perrier group distributes poland spring volvic oasis great bear 
and ice mountain water 
perrier group based in greenwich conn awarded the perrier 
brand assignment to waring amp larosa inc a new yorkbased ad 
agency on march 28 several weeks before the relaunch 
riney had created the campaign that used the slogan its 
perfect its perrier for the perrier brand and had worked on 
various perrier group brands for about five years 
waring amp larosa had formerly worked on perrier advertising 
creating the slogan earths first soft drink for the brand in 
the mid1980s

stake of founder hugh hefner

nonvoting stock it would increase the number of outstanding 
playboy shares from 15 million to 375 million including 30 
million shares of nonvoting stock the company said 
the plan would not dilute the holdings of hefner who owns 706 
percent of the current outstanding common shares and said he would 
vote to approve the plan 
under its present structure playboy could not raise money by 
selling additional common stock without making the stake held by 
hefner who is chairman emeritus and playboy magazine editor in 
chief relatively smaller 
we believe that the proposed recapitalization will provide 
playboy with increased flexibility to use equity in future 
acquisitions financings and employee benefit plans without 
diluting the voting power of existing stockholders said christie 
hefner playboys chairman and chief executive officer in a 
telephone interview 
playboy stock rose 12 cents to 1287 a share in new york 
stock exchange trading 
under the plan playboy stockholders will receive half of a 
class a voting share for each of their current playboy shares 
followed by a dividend of three nonvoting class b shares for each 
of the class a shares their received in the split 
the recapitalization includes a minority protection feature 
designed to help ensure that the two classes of stock trade at 
approximately equal market prices ms hefner said the provision 
requires that anyone wanting to buy a specific voting position of 
the class a voting stock must buy a proportionate amount of the 
nonvoting shares 
some industry analysts said the plan already adopted by 
playboys board of directors reflects the publishing and video 
companys renewed financial vigor 
playboy last week reported net income of 554000 for its third 
fiscal quarter up from from 262000 a year earlier for the nine 
months ended march 31 net income was 6 million including a 48 
million gain on the sale of the assets of its boarts international 
inc subsidiary compared with 22 million in the yearearlier 
period 
i really see the recap as another building block that having 
established a base of profitability we now are looking ahead to 
the 90s with an eye to expanding internationally in both 
publishing and entertainment and doing that with other 
companies said ms hefner 
after succeeding with the playboy late night television 
series in europe playboy has begun talks with foreign and domestic 
production companies about possibly coproducing television 
programs ms hefner said 
playboy is the sole producer of playboy late night a weekly 
television magazineformat series that debuted in france last 
september and now appers in 10 countries 
playboy also is talking with potential publishing partners about 
forming an alliance similar to its link with dupont publishing 
inc she said playboy in 1988 acquired a 20 percent interest in 
the publisher of the dupont registry a monthly magazine for car 
buffs 
buzz zaino an industry analyst and managing director of trust 
co of the west in new york said the recapitalization will help 
playboy make similar deals 
it does provide her the flexibilty to expand the business with 
the use of stock either by selling stock in a public offering or 
using the stock to acquire other business he said

not disrupt financial markets or be excessively inflationary

general motors corp and chrysler corp said 
monday that new convertibles will not be introduced until after the 
prime spring buying season for the cars 
company spokesmen said vehicle quality was below a desired 
level but they did not elaborate 
chevrolet spokesman ralph kramer said it is unlikely that gm 
will market any 1990 chevrolet beretta convertibles which had been 
forecast to account for about 5000 in sales this year 
dodge spokesman scott sweeney said the introduction of a 1991 
dodge shadow convertible would be delayed by six to eight weeks 
until late summer 
kramer declined to discuss the problems but said they occurred 
after the cars were assembled as hardtops at gms wilmington del 
plant and then taken to campc inc based in brighton for conversion 
into convertibles 
such an arrangement is not unusual for manufacturing 
convertibles 
chrysler builds the dodge shadow in toluca mexico and converts 
the cars to convertibles there the cars are then brought into the 
united states for sale chrysler also builds shadows at its 
sterling heights factory

financier charles keating jr is full 
of baloney to say that bungling by federal regulators led to the 
collapse of his lincoln savings and loan association the nations 
top thrift regulator said monday 
mr keating took the view that regulators ought to stick their 
nose out of his business without recognizing that 97 percent of his 
assets were guaranteed by the federal government said william 
seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp 
he said any assertion that the thrift industrys problems can be 
traced to heavyhanded or incompetent regulation is way off the 
mark 
hes just full of baloney seidman said of keating 
seidman who also heads the resolution trust corp the federal 
agency created to oversee the sale of failed savings and loans met 
monday with two local rtc advisory committees and addressed the 
national council of savings institutions 
the advisory boards passed a resolution urging the rtc to speed 
up disposals of seized savings and loan properties 
it is clear to us that arizona is poised on the recovery of 
its realestate market said hank rivoir superintendent of the 
state banking department and chairman of the two committees all 
that is missing is a track record of sales by the rtc 
seidman acknowledged there have been delays but said the rtcs 
essential job is to market the properties it has seized 
he said the market for failed institutions is very limited 
and that the agency generally has not been able to sell them as 
whole and going operations 
the next step is to take the institutions apart and sell them 
by parts he said 
the resolution passed by the advisory boards called on the rtc 
to come up with alternatives to appraisals as a means of selling 
thrift assets including options such as public auctions and 
acceptance of sealed bids to eliminate the backlog of real estate 
awaiting sale in arizona 
the committees also called on seidman to move quickly to appoint 
a director of the rtcs phoenix field office 
seidman told reporters that several candidates are being 
interviewed and someone would be appointed before too many more 
weeks 
responding to reporters questions about the seizure of lincoln 
sampl last year seidman said the inevitable happened after the 
thrift experienced three or four years of explosive growth and 
invested its profits in highrisk enterprises 
he said the rtc has run into numerous difficulties with the 
thrift since the seizure and he blamed those problems on keating 
saying keating had carefully constructed lincoln as a series 
of bankrupt subsidiaries of a bankrupt holding company 
it has been slow and difficult because it was set up to be 
that way seidman said 
asked about keatings claim that federal regulators improperly 
wrote down the value of its assets seidman said that if keating 
can sell those assets for what he claims they are worth well 
give him a commission

an air force official said permissive 
managers are contributing to widespread production problems at 
douglas aircraft co including instances where tools and stray 
parts have been left inside finished planes 
col kenneth tollefson the air forces top representative at 
the company said separately that the many contractor deficiency 
reports issued by his office suggest douglas problems are 
widespread 
douglas a unit of mcdonnell douglas corp of st louis lost 
84 million last quarter and has begun eliminating 3000 
whitecollar jobs in an attempt to rein in costs major programs 
include the md80 and md11 passenger jets and the c17 military 
cargo jet 
air force officials have issued 34 deficiency reports against 
the c17 program and also have written more serious letters of 
concern to senior douglas executives the los angeles times 
reported monday 
the reports and letters of concern are issued when the air force 
finds a company out of compliance with regulations or beset with 
serious problems that affect cost schedule or product performance 
the times also said it had obtained a memo from douglas 
president john capellupo that criticized a lack of discipline among 
whitecollar and bluecollar workers 
the memo said douglas total quality management program 
instituted during a reorganization last year to encourage worker 
participation had led to a permissive system 
the air forces tollefson agreed in an article in douglas 
employee newsletter 
the lack of leadership which includes the failure to 
recognize the difference between participative and permissive 
management is the biggest problem facing douglas aircraft co 
he wrote 
the c17 is at least 10 months behind schedule and is now 
expected to fly in june 1991 defense secretary dick cheney last 
week recommended slicing 119 billion from the 418 billion c17 
program by cutting back the number of planes to be produced from 
210 to 120 
douglas spokesman don hanson acknowledged the program has had 
problems but said the company is striving to correct them 
if you look around you find that most contractors have some 
outstanding contractor deficiency reports on any program at any 
given time he said the objective is to have none but since 
we are human there are some 
one problem involves stray parts tools and other foreign 
objects left in planes air force officials bagged and sent to 
senior douglas officials 40 pounds of such objects left inside the 
wing of one c17 the times reported 
on at least one occasion the c17 line had to be shut down to 
clean up debris the newspaper said now the production line is 
vacuumed at the end of each shift

japan sought to assure world financial leaders 
monday that its stock and money markets are sound and it will 
continue efforts to cut its huge trade surplus 
there was no major movement of capital out of the stock and 
bond markets despite this uneasiness over sharp market declines 
earlier this year yasushi mieno governor of the bank of japan 
told the 22nation interim committee of the international monetary 
fund 
there has been no change in the basic soundness of japans 
fundamentals the central bank chief said in fact the markets 
are now considerably more stable than they were earlier this year 
the key index of the tokyo stock market plunged more than 25 
percent early this year as interest rates shot up and the yen lost 
roughly 10 percent of its value against the dollar 
the stock market has stabilized in recent weeks and the index 
has rebounded more than 10 percent from its low 
mieno also said he is confident that the current account 
surplus will continue to come steadily down provided the yen 
doesnt weaken further the yens decline has made japanese exports 
cheaper and imports more expensive 
the current account surplus should be reduced by a combination 
of strong growth in japans domestic demand and promotion of 
adjustments such as expanding overseas production by japanese 
firms he said 
but realizing that the yens depreciation may well put a 
damper on such promotion of adjustments i believe it is important 
for the exchange rate of the yen to be stabilized in such a way 
that better reflects japans economic fundamentals mieno said 
in effect advocating a stronger yen 
mieno told a news conference sunday he is not advocating a 
specific yendollar exchange rate but would prefer some 
strengthening of japans currency 
japans current account surplus fell from 797 billion in 1988 
to 572 billion last year or 2 percent of gross national product 
he said 
the world economic outlook is for continued firm growth 
mieno said still there will be a slight decline in the growth 
rate this year he predicted adding that the sweeping change in 
east europe and german unification have brought unprecedented 
uncertainties 
the sudden need for massive new investment in europe along with 
continued capital for the third world makes it imperative for 
industrial countries as a whole to increase their savings to 
prevent a global upsurge in interest rates and to support sustained 
global economic development mieno said 
he predicted japanese consumer prices would rise only 16 
percent this year with real economic growth of 4 percent and 
domestic demand up 46 percent

consumer prices rose a record 863 percent on 
average in the third world last year spurred by a 350 percent rise 
in latin america the international monetary fund reported monday 
among 22 industrial countries prices rose 45 percent up from 
the 34 percent of 1988 the increases ranged from 11 percent in 
the netherlands to 208 percent in iceland japan had 23 percent 
and west germany 28 percent 
the united states the worlds largest economy was a little 
above the average at 48 percent 
the fund gets figures from its member countries but calculates 
on its own basis to make them comparable so rates for individual 
countries sometimes differ from those published by governments 
themselves 
latin american average prices were influenced heavily by runaway 
inflation in two of the areas most important countries argentina 
which had inflation of 3079 percent and brazil at 1287 percent 
the argentine figures meant the price of a basket of goods rose 30 
times during the course of the year 
peru had an even higher inflation rate of 3398 percent 
mexico which has adopted a strict austerity program saw its 
inflation rate drop to 20 percent from 114 percent in 1988 
the fund classifies 130 of its members as developing 
countries including those in eastern europe the soviet union 
does not belong and the fund gives no figures for it 
for its seven european members outside the industrial group the 
inflation rate rose in 1989 to an average 232 percent the average 
reflected yugoslavias 1239 percent inflation rate and polands 
rate of 244 percent 
a fund official said polands inflation rate has dropped sharply 
this year because of the new noncommunist governments shock 
program to shift away from central planning to a market system the 
program has abolished subsidies and cut back government spending 
annual figures for africa and the middle east were incomplete 
many middle east countries have not been reporting in recent years 
among those that have israels inflation rate rose to 202 percent 
last year from 163 percent in 1988 and egypts rose to 213 
percent from 177 percent 
africas average appeared steady 189 percent in 1988 and 212 
percent in the third quarter of 1989 the african average masked a 
wide range from zambias annual 186 percent rate last october to 
small price reductions in several countries including chad togo 
and the central african republic 
only asia showed a decline in the inflation rate for 21 
countries in that region the annual average inflation rate dropped 
to 102 percent last year from 118 percent in 1988 
chinas rate declined to 163 percent from 207 percent and 
indias also was falling from 94 percent in 1988 to an annual 
rate of 62 percent in the third quarter of 1989

the bush administration on monday proposed 
changes in antitrust law that would relax restrictions on joint 
production ventures between us companies to produce new 
technologies 
the measure intended to enable us companies to better compete 
in the global marketplace would reduce the amount of damages that 
plaintiffs in antitrust suits could collect from companies involved 
in the joint ventures 
the legislation unveiled by attorney general dick thornburgh 
and commerce secretary robert mosbacher would also require courts 
to consider the effects of a joint venture on competition in 
foreign as well as domestic markets when determining if there is an 
antitrust violation 
antitrust restrictions on joint research and development 
ventures were relaxed by congress in 1984 the administration bill 
would extend the concept to joint production ventures 
the bill would help us firms face unprecedented worldwide 
challenges by bringing important research from the laboratory to 
the marketplace efficiently cost effectively and with less risk 
mosbacher said in a statement 
under the proposal plaintiffs could not collect treble damages 
from an antitrust judgment against companies that participate in a 
cooperative joint venture the bill would allow plaintiffs to 
collect only the money they lost as a result of the 
anticompetitive practice 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio chairman of the judiciary 
committees antitrust subcommittee said the proposal was 
unnecessary and could be harmful 
i say to the president show me which deals are being lost due 
to fears of antitrust suits metzenbaum said 
the real reason american companies are falling behiond is 
because they have been too busy trying to devour the competition 
with mergers lbos leveraged buyouts or management takeovers with 
borrowed money and hostile takeovers

a federal judge has allowed two former 
northrop corp employees to proceed with portions of their lawsuit 
against the defense firm that the justice department declined to 
include when joining the suit 
us district judge david v kenyons ruling monday means former 
northrop manager david peterson and engineer jeff kroll can pursue 
claims that could net them as much as 60 million in damages said 
attorney phillip e benson 
its a novel issue and precedentsetting benson said 
peterson and kroll allege in their whistleblower suit that 
northrop committed more than 100 million in fraud in the 
production of the mx missile guidance systems 
the suit accuses the firm of falsifying tests and mischarging 
the government for tests and parts used in the inertial measurement 
units on the missile which are vital parts in the guidance systems 
the justice department announced last year it was picking up 
substantial portions of the suit northrop had sought to 
dismiss the claims that the government declined to join 
those remaining claims involved specific instances of alleged 
mischarging and test falsification 
but kenyon said monday the former employees will be permitted 
to pursue the claims which were not adopted by the government 
even though those claims will be dropped from the joint 
governmentemployee lawsuit 
kenyon said he would call another hearing to determine whether 
the severed claims could be included in a separate lawsuit 
northrop attorneys declined to comment 
in related rulings kenyon rejected northrops contention the 
employees lawsuit was unconstitutional but he agreed with the 
company that the government failed to be specific enough in 
alleging wrongdoing 
the judge gave the government 30 days to file a tighter version 
of the suit

the american medical association said it has 
asked nutrisystem inc to stop using the amas name in advertising 
for the weight loss program a recent target of lawsuits by people 
claiming health problems 
the american medical association does not endorse that 
companys or any other diet plans an ama statement said monday 
neither the ama nor nutrisystem could provide details about the 
ads though ama spokesman john hammarly said he believed the ads 
began in february and ran in both broadcast and print media 
commercially administered weightloss programs should be 
appropriate for the individuals physical condition says an 
ama report on treating obesity in adults drafted two years ago by 
the ama council on scientific affairs 
the report which the ama cited in its statement says such 
programs should offer proper medical supervision by physicians 
who have knowledge of the metabolic consequences of the prescribed 
regimen 
the ama is thus particularly concerned by recent published 
reports alleging a failure of proper medical supervision in 
connection with the nutrisystem program the ama said in a may 4 
letter to nutrisystem 
nineteen women in florida filed separate lawsuits against 
nutrisystem earlier this year alleging they were inadequately 
supervised under the program and that it caused them to develop 
gallstones most required gallbladder surgery the gallbladder 
produces and stores bile used in digestion 
the company has said the lawsuits are without merit suggesting 
that the gallstones in the plaintiffs occurred coincidentally and 
that the risk of gallbladder disease among the obese can be reduced 
by prudent dieting 
nonetheless nutrisystem has complied with the amas 
request said tim hermeling a spokesman for nutrisystem in 
willow grove pa 
we are reviewing the letter he added nutrisystem meets 
the guidelines of all leading health organizations and wed be 
pleased to discuss the issue with the ama 
the ama also notified us rep ron wyden dore chairman of a 
congressional subcommittee holding hearings on the nations 33 
billion annual weightloss industry that it had asked nutrisystem 
to leave the ama out of its advertising 
nutrisystem with nearly 1600 weightloss centers in all 50 
states canada britain and australia offers a 1000to 
1500calorieaday meal program that can cost several hundred 
dollars to enroll in depending on wightloss goals and special 
promotions offered
