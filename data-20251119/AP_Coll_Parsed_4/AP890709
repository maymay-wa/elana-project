the new government sunday 
announced economic austerity measures that included a 53 percent 
devaluation of the currency and massive utility rate increases in an 
allout effort to halt soaring inflation 
earlier sunday president carlos menem said argentines must brace 
for a very tough period as the government tries to halt 
inflation approaching 1 million percent a year 
we have to conduct major surgery without anesthesia menem 
said as he arrived at government house the morning after he was 
sworn in if not argentina has no future 
in a televised speech economy minister miguel roig said that 
beginning monday the austral will sell for 655 per 1 he also 
announced that natural gas rates will rise by 650 percent for 
industrial users and 200 percent for homeowners 
natural gas is the principal source of energy for home heating in 
argentina 
stateset rates for electricity public transportation and other 
public services will also increase substantially roig said in his 
20minute address but he did not specify amounts or say when they 
would take effect 
public works minister roberto dromi said saturday that gasoline 
prices would increase by 500 percent 
to help argentines cope with the increases the government will 
roll back the price of bread and other basic foods and set price 
guidelines roig said in addition most workers next week will get 
a special onetime payment equivalent to about 13 
businesses raised the price of bread and milk by more than 150 
percent on thursday and friday in anticipation of government price 
controls roig did not say how long the government price guidelines 
on a variety of supermarket items would be in effect 
argentines stocked up at supermarkets when they received monthly 
salaries at the end of june and car owners lined up at gas stations 
all weekend to top off their tanks 
roig said the government utility rates were absurdly low and 
that new rates would be very stiff 
menem who attended a mass sunday morning at the national 
cathedral and presided over a military parade said argentina will 
have to endure a very tough period in order to emerge from this 
crisis 
the inflation and the worst recession in argentinas 173year 
history have severely hurt real wages in this south american nation 
of 31 million low monetary reserves and a 60 billion foreign debt 
leave menem little room for easy solutions 
the 12month costofliving increase based on junes inflation 
rate of 1145 percent amounts to a staggering 948597 percent 
in his inauguration speech saturday menem called for national 
unity he has gone out of his way since he was elected may 14 to 
placate the military smooth relations with the roman catholic 
church and coordinate plans with labor unions business groups and 
rival political parties 
it remains to be seen however how argentines who have tightened 
belts for several months will react to the measures and whether 
menem will carry them out in the face of public resistance 
labor unions staged general strikes against former president raul 
alfonsin when he tried austerity measures last year the measures 
triggered looting and rioting in several cities 
the central bank is virtually without foreign reserves except 
for an estimated 1 billion in gold and tax revenue has shrunk 
menem will find it hard to borrow from abroad as alfonsin did 
because the country is about 45 billion behind in interest 
payments on the foreign debt

jo ann smith is a beef person she grew up on 
it and remains a great fan of the standing rib roast she was the 
first woman ever to head the national cattlemens association she 
is a fifthgeneration cattle raiser 
now she regulates the industry she once promoted but she rejects 
the idea that as assistant secretary of agriculture for marketing 
and inspection services she might someday have to choose between 
her loyalties to beef and her responsibilities to government 
meat has been topic a all her life her husband cedric also 
comes from a cattlemans heritage both she and her husband come 
from families that have raised cattle for generations she is no 
stranger to blue jeans and hard work 
while she had to separate herself from the operation to accept 
the 80700 presidential appointment earlier this year her husband 
and son still run a 500head 4500acre ranch near wacahoota fla 
she was an equal partner i always knew what cedric was paying 
for corn she once told an interviewer 
she was a conservative democrat she underscores the 
conservative until 1988 when she campaigned for president 
bush she ran twice for the florida legislature as a democrat but 
lost both races 
then mrs smith 50 became involved in beef politics as head of 
the cattlemens association one of the most powerful agricultural 
lobbies she helped drag a reluctant industry toward feeding and 
breeding changes that produced leaner meat but it was a struggle 
we were very slow to respond she says you could see the 
train coming 
i really do enjoy beef she says and usually eats it once a 
day 
i am not a great lover of fishfish she says she has come 
to accept it but wont cook it too messy shell eat it when 
cedric cooks it which she says he does well 
her new job puts her in the midst of a dozen arguments including 
controversies over meat inspections the reagan administration 
wanted the industry to do more and the government less and over 
americas consumption of red meat 
the health side of government says americans eat too much of it 
the national academy of sciences in a study that came out last 
march concluded in the most comprehensive evaluation ever of the 
effects of diet on health that this country consumes too much fat 
and gets too much of it from meat 
the study advised eating lean meat in smaller and fewer 
portions 
no i dont think we consume too much mrs smith said in an 
interview she said the beef industry already has addressed the fat 
issue by putting leaner beef on the market 
were producing a product that does not have the fat it once 
did she said we recognized that it was the fat that was the 
culprit not the product and we have addressed that in genetics and 
breeding you can buy lean meat 
at the same time mrs smith endorsed labeling the fat content of 
meat a position that could raise hackles among cattlemen 
labeling has certain strong advantages she said the 
consumer wants to know the only way theyre going to know is to be 
able to read something that says this is what the product has in 
it 
it is a sensitive issue anne winslow director of nutrition 
policy for mrs smiths old organization the 35000member 
cattlemens association said it will be discussed at the groups 
meeting in columbus ohio this month 
proud producers might view the issue as a positive opportunity 
to highlight the nutritional density of the product beef said 
ms winslow adding that her own recommendation will be for labels 
that show how much fat remains after cooking after fat has been 
trimmed and drained away she said the stress on fat has turned 
attention away from the high iron zinc and vitamin b12 contents of 
beef 
mrs smiths prolabel stand and her support for federal 
inspection of seafood an issue on which the agriculture department 
has yet to take a stand wins applause from the evervigilant 
consumer movement 
for an industry person shes more of an activist than youd 
expect says ellen haas of public voice for food and health 
policy she has an understanding about what can be done she has 
been out front on fish inspection 
but on some other food issues in her domain mrs smith tends 
toward caution 
she is waiting for more study to be conducted before taking a 
stand on whether meat producers who give their cattle no hormones or 
other growthenhancing drugs should be able to label their product 
organic or natural 
some cattlemen who have been using a natural label and who 
have found a market among healthconscious consumers say the 
government has been trying to get them to drop the label 
mrs smith said her discomfort with the label is that we have 
never defined natural remember that every animal in order to be 
bred has hormone in it the problem that has arisen is does the 
consumer understand this you want to know that your label is 
truthful 
on veal issues mrs smith dodged questions saying she wasnt 
familiar with them the center for science in the public interest 
and other consumer groups contend that the way some veal calves are 
raised kept in dark pens so small the calf cant turn around and 
fed only a liquid diet to keep the meat lightcolored are inhumane 
high residues of antibiotics have been found in veal the 
centers dan howell told a congressional subcommittee on june 6 
mrs smith said she knows nothing about raising veal calves and will 
have to do her homework on that

the president on sunday gave foreign minister giulio 
andreotti a mandate to create the nations 49th postwar government 
and it appeared the fivetime premier would easily form a coalition 
italy has been without a government since may 19 when premier 
ciriaco de mita resigned following criticism of his leadership by 
the no 2 party in the governing coalition the socialists 
after president francesco cossiga summoned him sunday morning to 
receive the mandate andreotti said he would begin trying to form a 
government however he said his task might be delayed by 
preparations for this weeks meeting of the seven major 
industrialized nations in paris 
andreotti like de mita belongs to the christian democrats who 
have dominated italian politics since world war ii the de mita 
coalition apparently fell because of jockeying by the socialists 
led by popular former premier bettino craxi 
craxi said he would not oppose andreotti newspapers reported 
craxi and andreotti have worked closely in several governments 
de mitas policies would likely continue in an andreotti 
government the editor of the rome daily la repubblica eugenio 
scalfari noted in a frontpage editorial that andreotti and the 
leader of the christian democrats arnaldo forlani now hold the 
same positions as they did 17 years ago 
we are therefore about to turn back the clock of politics he 
said 
andreotti said he would work to revive the coalition of christian 
democrats socialists republicans liberals and social democrats 
that has governed in recent years 
he said he was particularly concerned that italy be ready for 
1992 when european community members are to eliminate all trade 
barriers among themselves 
andreotti is considered to come from the conservative wing of 
the christian democrats while de mita is a liberal however 
the labels can be misleading 
for example while andreotti is considered close to the roman 
catholic church the premierdesignate also has very good relations 
with the communists italys secondlargest party which has been in

a turtle who had the misfortune to be run 
over was at least lucky enough to be the victim of a veterinarian 
who got a dentist to mend its broken shell 
the vet dr joanna mccoy said she injured the painted turtle 
with her car recently near the animal hospital where she works 
examining the turtle she found its undershell broken into two 
pieces but didnt know how to fix it 
a dentist who by chance was at the hospital for a rare 
consultation on root canal work on a dog overheard ms mccoy 
discussing her problem 
he stepped in and came to the rescue 
that was just what he needed some dental acrylic said 
dr anthony j calabro he splinted the shell and glued it back 
together with a babyblue substance normally used for making 
dentures and repairing teeth 
the turtle was up and about in no time and sent on its way 
getting hit by a car going to the vet going to the dentist 
thats a pretty scary day calabro said

six months after he defected to america by jumping 
off a polish ship 42yearold wieslaw albinski is doing just fine 
in america thanks hes even got a new job at a computer company 
in my wildest dreams i never anticipated having this kind of 
job said albinski whose english is coming along but who spoke 
with the help of an interpreter i had heard that there were 
opportunities here but i had no idea how much 
albinski was one of 48 sailors who fled from three different 
polish vessels in boston harbor over several days in january all 
said they were members of the thenbanned solidarity union 
albinski and the 47 others have applied for but not yet received 
asylum in a political climate that is changing almost daily 
president george bush left sunday for a trip to hungary and poland 
it will include a twoday stop in warsaw where he was to address a 
newly elected parliament nearly half of whose members belong to 
solidarity an outlaw just six short months ago 
poland and hungary are nations on the threshold of a new era 
nations where the spirit of freedom is strong bush said sunday 
before leaving from andrews air force base 
but albinski says he likes it here 
there is absolutely no question that i would defect again he 
said during an interview last week at the polishamerican club as 
he sat smoking marlboros wearing blue jeans reeboks and a tshirt 
he said he loves his new job testing computer modules at teradyne 
inc in boston but like the other sailors he worries about his 
immigration status and whether his wife and two children in poland 
will be permitted to join him 
the 48 have almost all been interviewed by officials with the 
immigration and naturalization service but have yet to hear whether 
theyll be granted asylum said cathryn macinnes the city adviser 
on immigrant rights who handled the poles applications 
many of them have found jobs in the fishing industry in new 
bedford and maine while others are working at hotels and factories 
in greater boston said jack kowalski the mayors liaison to the 
polishamerican community 
kowalski said the new arrivals got help from the community and a 
local church and had no trouble finding jobs 
they went off to work right away they refused any type of 
government assistance kowalski said 
at least five of the polish sailors are working as machinists at 
varian associates a vacuum products company in lexington making up 
to 9 an hour production manager gerry grenon said 
they have a terrific work ethic the oldfashioned work 
ethic said grenon the one problem is the language problem but 
weve provided them some englishasasecondlanguage training and 
theyre coming along 
albinski was a radio operator aboard the kantar which pulled 
into boston harbor just a few days after polish sailors had jumped 
another ship nervous about the potential for more betrayals the 
kantars captain was ordered not to dock but to pump fuel aboard 
from another ship 
albinski and the others defected by jumping aboard the refueling 
ship 
as the sailors prepared to leave the captain stood in front of 
them and warned them of the ramifications albinski explained 
through kowalski 
as i looked beyond him and saw the skyline of the city i was 
thinking about what my future would be he said 
he jumped 
albinski said his american coworkers are sympathetic and 
helpful but cannot conceive of how difficult life is in poland 
most surprising he said is the absence of paranoia in the 
workplace 
i come and go as i please he said i can speak freely 
to my coworkers i can speak freely to you 
and in america albinski can let another secret off his chest he 
took the shipboard job only for the money 
im not a seaman he said and im really not partial to 
the sea 
but the merchant seamens fate depends on whether us officials 
believe they are freedomseekers or mainly just interested in better 
economic opportunity 
timothy whelan deputy director of the immigration and 
naturalization service in boston said at the time of the defections 
that officials would consider polands political climate as well as 
the lengths the sailors had to go to to leave their homeland

about 500 residents returned to their 
homes early sunday after being evacuated for several hours when a 
nitric acid leak sent a vapor cloud over a wide area 
the leak in a containment tank at a construction site in southern 
poplar bluff was discovered by a security guard at 845 pm 
saturday the evacuations were ordered when authorities feared wind 
might carry fumes from the acid to residents homes 
the leak was caused by a loose fitting in the 4000gallon tank 
at the site where a factory is under construction said hercell 
williams civil defense director 
workers put lime on the acid to neutralize it and the 
evacuations were called off about 6 am sunday williams said 
the tank had been filled friday and workers were transferring 
1500 gallons from the outside tank to another tank inside the plant 
when the leak occurred a plant spokesman said 
the guard who discovered the leak sam cole 34 was in stable 
condition sunday at doctors regional medical center no other 
injuries were reported 
in an interview at the hospital cole said he was finishing his 
second round of the nearly completed factory when i noticed a 
steam coming out of the ground outside it looked like something 
bubbling out of the concrete 
cole said the vapors smelled like battery acid 
i got a pretty good hit backed off and just fell down cole 
said it burned my throat and i started coughing i was ok until i 
lit a cigarette that made me dizzy and got the dry heaves 
ron sheeley an environmental emergency specialist with the 
missouri department of natural resources said that nitric acid is 
extremely corrosive 
its corrosive to the skin and the fumes are noxious and can 
cause tissue damage sheeley said it can react to other 
substances that burn 
most residents in the area left willingly and planned to stay 
with friends and relatives 
but at the c amp w corral lounge owner brenda brown said when 
we learned of the spill we called the police and they said for us to 
evacuate the bar 
all of the customers left quickly except for two who wanted to 
be locked inside the bar they finished their beers before leaving 
poplar bluff a city of about 20000 is 160 miles south of st

for the first time in almost 
11 years southeast asian countries and major western allies are 
seriously thinking about a world with cambodia at peace 
though major barriers remain last weeks meeting of 12 foreign 
ministers here underlined that virtually all the major outside 
players are determined to bring about peace they showed their 
commitment to finding a settlement despite differences among warring 
factions in cambodia 
they pinned high hopes on talks among the cambodians starting 
july 24 in paris and on an international peace conference starting 
in paris on july 30 
in brunei foreign minister wong kan seng of singapore said the 
cambodian conflict which has preoccupied the region was winding 
down 
we have already begun to look beyond cambodia to economic 
issues he said after the conference ended saturday 
to examine new directions foreign minister siddhi savetsila of 
thailand proposed a summit of the group the association of 
southeast asian nations for next year 
the important thing is that there has been a strong show of 
consensus of asean and its dialogue partners on the need for a 
comprehensive settlement in cambodia said a senior us state 
department official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the dialogue partners or allies included the united states 
japan and the 12nation european community 
nations at the brunei conference said the pullout of vietnams 
troops from cambodia must be internationally supervised the 
cambodian factions must share power in a provisional government 
leading to elections and an international body must also guarantee 
the peace vietnam has pledged to withdraw all 60000 to 70000 
troops by sept 30 
regional leaders are trying to avoid what they call an 
afghanistantype settlement 
the soviet army pulled its last soldiers from that country in 
february but the sovietarmed government is still fighting the 
usbacked guerrillas 
vying for power in cambodia are the vietnaminstalled government 
of prime minister hun sen and the guerrilla coalition led by prince 
norodom sihanouk which includes the communist khmer rouge 
the danger of prolonged civil war after a vietnamese withdrawal 
is very real hun sen refuses to allow the khmer rouge in even a 
provisional government the khmer rouge with up to 40000 fighters 
reportedly has stocked arms for a major assault after vietnamese 
troops leave 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when it 
ruled cambodia from 1975 until vietnams 1978 invasion ousted it 
from power 
on wednesday sihanouk again refused hun sens calls to make a 
separate peace without the khmer rouge 
hun sens side is very uncompromising so there is no reason 
for us to be compromising the prince said at his home in beijing 
still outsiders feel guarded optimism because of the momentum of 
diplomatic initiatives over the past two years many of these were 
undertaken by vietnamese reformers intent on rebuilding their own 
countrys economy and ending its international isolation 
china which arms the rebels has also grown more conciliatory on 
the issue in recent years especially in toning down its backing for 
the khmer rouge 
the soviet union which is vietnams major ally has told 
washington it supports a major un role in cambodia even though 
vietnam opposes it according to secretary of state james a baker

the exxon valdez responsible for polluting 
hundreds of miles of alaskan shoreline will have an 
environmentalist at the controls tuesday when it enters san diego 
bay for repairs 
capt edward j silva jr the chief san diego harbor pilot who 
will steer the damaged tanker to a national steel and shipbuilding 
co dock is a member of the sometimes militant environmental group 
greenpeace 
silva is a critic of many oil company maritime policies but on 
tuesday his primary focus will be to bring the crippled valdez 
safely into port the ship that caused the nations worst oil spill 
was towed from alaska by tugs but for greater maneuverability silva 
will bring it through the bay under its own power 
exxon officials said they have no problems with silvas 
membership in greenpeace 
hes entitled to his opinion said carrie chassin a 
spokeswoman for exxon shipping co there are people in exxon who 
belong to the sierra club im sure hell drive that ship in as 
professionally as he knows how 
silva a seaman for 42 years said he comes from a family of 
mariners his grandfather and father also were sailors and his 
concern for the oceanic environment developed naturally 
he believes the risk of oil spills has increased with crew 
reductions in recent years on the more sophisticated tankers 
you can build the strongest ship in the world but if you dont 
do the job right and you have an accident youre going to have an 
oil spill period silva said where youre going to stop it is 
by making sure the people operating these ships are operating them 
safely and have enough people to do the job 
the former captain of the valdez has been accused of drinking on 
the job 
silva also said he believes the valdez accident would never have 
occurred if a qualified pilot had been aboard to guide the ship 
through the sound the pilot who had helped guide the ship through 
prince william sound had left it a few miles before the accident 
occurred march 24 as regulations allowed 
i may be biased but there should have been an alaskan pilot on 
board silva said theyre more familiar with the area i 
guarantee you if there had been one on it wouldnt have happened 
silva said the coast guard will take him out to the valdez by 
helicopter monday so he can familiarize himself with the ship and 
its handling 
given that the ship is damaged im not really sure how its 
going to handle he said suppose there is a jagged piece of 
steel down there someplace i dont know about it could have an 
effect on how the ship steers 
im doing it just to be absolutely certain in my own mind 
that the ship can handle ok he said 
theres no one more interested in trying to keep this area 
clean than i am believe me

police trying to cram thousands of soccer fans into 
a section of lenin stadium in 1982 created a human mincer that 
killed as many as 340 people a newspaper said in disclosing details 
of the worlds worst soccer disaster 
sovietsky sport the official newspaper of the governments 
sports committee accused authorities of covering up the disaster 
and said it was disclosing the tragedy now so as not to forget 
people who loved sports until the grave 
the oct 20 1982 incident had been reported before but a death 
toll and other details were never released in the soviet union 
a frontpage investigative story in sovietsky sport on saturday 
said parents believed there were as many as 340 deaths at lenin 
stadium in moscows luzhniki section the newspaper repeated that 
figure sunday in another article about the incident 
according to our information and no other information has 
been provided to the public a human mincer at luzhniki on that day 
pulverized 340 lives in the twinkling of an eye interior troops 
and police cordoned off the stadium and also quickly surrounded the 
tragedy the newspaper said 
the account said that because only 10000 tickets had been sold 
to the match between moscow spartak and haarlem of the netherlands 
in the 100000seat stadium management decided to cram all the fans 
into one section 
police ringed the section and all but one staircase was locked 
to save trouble to the police cleaners the newspaper reported 
police pushed fans toward the exit a few minutes before the end 
of the game to prevent a jam at the nearby subway station it said 
but when the final and only goal was scored some fans tried to 
return and collided with outgoing fans on stairs that had become 
covered with ice in the 14degree weather 
it was something terrible volodya andreyev who survived the 
accident told the newspaper we couldnt move from where we were 
standing and the crowd was pushing from above and below it was no 
longer possible to control the people who had gone crazy 
sovietsky sport said the parents of fans who failed to return 
home after the match received no information from police and had to 
search hospital morgues themselves the bodies were not released for 
burial for 13 days the newspaper reported 
five days after the disaster the associated press quoted 
semiofficial soviet sources as saying more than 20 people died and 
dozens were injured in a collision of fans on a ramp a soviet 
newspaper reported casualties at the time but did not specify 
whether people were killed or injured and did not give a number 
sovietsky sport reported on april 18 three days after 95 soccer 
fans were killed in a crush at hillsborough stadium in sheffield 
england that dozens of people were trampled to death in the 1982 
moscow incident 
the biggest loss of life previously reported at a soccer match 
was on may 24 1964 when rioting left nearly 300 dead in lima 
peru in a game between argentina and peru 
the worst singleincident sports disaster in modern history 
occurred when an estimated 604 people were killed after stands at 
the hong kong jockey club racecourse collapsed and caught fire in 
february 1918 
sovietsky sports said a minor stadium official was blamed for the 
1982 tragedy and sentenced to 18 months of corrective work but 
mostly the victims were blamed for alleged unruly behavior 
ever since the disaster no soccer matches have been held in 
lenin stadium at the end of october because authorities are afraid 
survivors will place flowers on the field as a sign of protest 
readers suggested a committee be set up to investigate the 
tragedy and that a meeting be held at the site oct 20 to 
commemorate the tragedy the newspaper said sunday 
the account was the latest disclosure by a soviet media that has 
seized upon president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness to report long hushedup soviet disasters

a court sentenced a local communist party official 
to death for selling a fake namebrand liquor a report said sunday 
dramatizing the partys determination to root out corruption that 
students recently protested 
six other officials were expelled from the party in separate 
corruption cases as the ruling party tried to clean up an image 
badly tarnished by nepotism bribetaking and black marketeering 
the beijing daily said a court in the southeastern province of 
guizhou gave tongren district party secretary peng jingxing the 
death sentence for selling fake maotai a fiery sorghum liquor the 
paper said peng earned staggering profits of 50800 
at least 26 people have been executed since the army cracked down 
on prodemocracy protesters whose demands included an end to 
official corruption peng was the first party official to be 
sentenced to death under a new anticorruption campaign announced 
after the crackdown 
other such campaigns in recent years have failed partly because 
offenders usually were disciplined by the party rather than put on 
trial 
the protests that shook china from april until june gave the 
party a strong incentive to try again the student slogan that won 
the most sympathy from the public was down with corruption and 
the posters that were most copied were those detailing examples of 
nepotism among top leaders 
the party newspaper the peoples daily said two party members 
were expelled in fujian province and several others were put under 
supervision or criticized for arranging prostitutes for visiting 
businessmen 
in another case it said four men who had been party members for 
more than 40 years were expelled in heilongjiang province for 
profiteering and bribetaking 
there were no new reports of arrests connected with the protests 
according to a count by the associated press more than 2000 
arrests have been reported nationwide by the official media but 
chinese sources said they believed that many had been arrested in 
the capital alone 
the official media blasted western suggestions that with time 
china will move away from socialism and it lectured its citizens 
that the best way to improve their lives is by raising production 
in a harsh halfpage commentary the peoples daily accused the 
us governmentrun voice of america radio of supporting the 
protesters 
this is yet another odious demonstration of americas crude 
interference in chinas internal affairs it said and of the 
revival of the old dream of the american anticommunist monopoly 
capitalist class of promoting a peaceful evolution in china toward 
capitalism 
such venemous criticism of the united states was common during 
the 1960s when revolutionary leader mao tsetung repeatedly claimed 
that washington planned an attack but it has not been seen in the 
chinese media for years 
other political phrases from the 1960s also have reappeared the 
peoples daily commentary said the protests showed that class 
struggle still exists in china other newspapers have urged students 
to learn from the workers peasants and soldiers three good 
classes

a little more than a year ago government 
riot police attacked striking steelworkers led by the banned 
independent solidarity trade union last week the leader of that 
strike took a seat in parliament 
polands communist government struggling with a dire economic 
situation has been pushed into an amazing political aboutface that 
still has people shaking their heads in disbelief 
it is not that the economic situation is getting worse from 
year to year or quarter to quarter wrote journalist tomasz 
jezioranski but by now we have reached the state where it is 
deteriorating almost from week to week 
some might say day to day as they list what is not available in 
the market how much egg prices increased or how long an assembly 
line has been idled for lack of a simple machinery part 
whether viewed in terms of the 39 billion national debt to the 
west or the lack of a medicine for a sick child the economic crisis 
has fueled a year of tumult in poland 
election victories by solidarity have given the union a big voice 
in determining who will assume polands new presidency in the coming 
weeks polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski his ally interior 
minister czeslaw kiszczak or some other communist candidate 
there is also a possibility that lech walesas solidarity will 
accept the prime ministers post with the job of forming the next 
government a noncommunist cabinet functioning in what remains 
constitutionally a communist state 
these decisions are to be taken soon after president bushs visit 
to the country monday and tuesday 
the communist government and the opposition now find themselves 
looking together for ways to address a mindboggling range of 
economylinked fiscal social and environmental problems 
polands golden age was in the 16th century when it controlled a 
vast swath of central europe from the baltic to the black sea but 
undermined by successive wars and a weak government structure it 
eventually fell victim to autocratic neighbors 
russia austria and prussia divided up poland among themselves 
and the polish state ceased to exist for 123 years from 1795 until 
the end of world war i in 1918 recreated for a brief but warmly 
remembered interwar independence poland next suffered more than any 
other nation in world war ii losing 6 million people including 3 
million jews killed in the nazi holocaust 
already weighed down by the rubble of massive wartime 
devastation poland under communist rule has fallen further and 
further behind the european standard of its past 
the workers state revolted in 1980 with solidarity emerging as 
the first legal independent trade union in the soviet bloc but the 
burst of freedom and the surge of creative economic and cultural 
energy that accompanied it did not last 
jaruzelski with the threat of a general strike and the hint of 
potential soviet intervention declared martial law on dec 13 
1981 solidarity was repressed and its leaders imprisoned 
the west cut investment in poland the nations spirit sagged 
and the economy stagnated 
during a second wave of strikes in august 1988 the government 
proposed roundtable talks with the solidarityled opposition 
realizing it could not hope to solve polands problems without the 
opposition it had so long sought to crush 
the communist leadership decided in a story january plenum that 
solidarity could be legalized again clearing the way for talks that 
culminated with a historic april reform accord 
the agreement provided for unprecedentedly democratic elections 
with independents allowed to vie for 161 of the 460 seats in the 
existing parliament or sejm and all 100 seats in a new senate 
solidarity won all but one of the seats 
now oncejailed solidarity activists are legislators and the 
formerly underground press has a sanctioned daily newspaper 
roadblocks to private economic enterprises are coming down and the 
borders are open to foreign ventures encouraged by the atmosphere 
of reform the west has renewed contact that the polish government 
hopes will lead to help with restructuring of the debt 
there is some cautious optimism among the 38 million poles but 
there is also a painful awareness that even with political freedom 
inflation is now at an unofficial 100 percent or more annually 
meaningful purchases are more likely transacted in us dollars than 
the national currency and the national budget deficit is likely to 
grow to six times the planned 1 trillion zlotys

the cuban supreme court on sunday turned down 
an appeal for mercy from a decorated war hero condemned to die 
before a firing squad for drug trafficking the official news agency 
prensa latina said 
the court also upheld the death sentences of three other former 
officers and the prison sentences of 10 other defendants accused of 
smuggling tons of cocaine and marijuana into the united states 
the only avenue of appeal left is the council of state prensa 
latina monitored in mexico city said the council had agreed to 
hear the appeal because of the severity of the sentences 
a courtmartial friday condemned former division gen arnaldo 
ochoa 57 to death also sentenced to die were three men identified 
as among ochoas closest collaborators excol antonio de la 
guardia exmaj armado padron and excapt jorge martinez 
the military tribunal handed out prison sentences ranging from 10 
years to 30 years to 10 other defendants in a case that reached into 
the highest levels of the cuban military and government 
ochoa is a veteran of the cuban revolution who went on to receive 
his nations highest medal hero of the republic of cuba for his 
service as a field commander in ethiopia in 1978 and in angola in 
19871988 
he headed cubas military advisory mission to nicaragua in 
19851986 
in addition to the drug charges ochoa was accused of corruption 
during his command of troops in africa and of smuggling ivory 
diamonds and other contraband 
he and the others were accused of betraying president fidel 
castro and the moral standards of cubas communist revolution all 
were stripped of their rank and decorations and expelled from the 
military and the communist party 
prensa latina has said the defendants admitted their guilt but 
asked for mercy because of their records 
the cuban government has said it would make an example of ochoa 
and his cohorts and it has portrayed their illicit activities as an 
aberration it also admitted that the case came to light in part 
because of persistent us allegations cuba had become a way station 
for drug traffickers 
us customs surveillance aircraft watched a plane drop bales of 
cocaine to a speedboat in cuban waters friday the day ochoa and the 
others were sentenced 
two mig fighters came onto the scene and protected the cuban 
airspace said patrick obrien us customs special 
agentincharge for south florida 
the next day us agents found the 37foot speedboat abandoned 
in biscayne bay south of miami obrien said it had nearly 1600 
pounds of cocaine worth about 10 million aboard 
ochoa and the others allegedly arranged for colombias medellin 
drug cartel to fly cocaine into cuba for transfer to boats bound for 
the united states

the british are coming this time on cspan 
which believes the sometimes raucous doings of the british house of 
commons may prove entertaining to television viewers in the united 
states 
if youre into what do you call it shock television it may 
just be your cup of tea says neville trotter a member of 
commons all tv viewers may see is a lot of arguing disruptive 
noisy behavior and namecalling to their colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle 
beginning in november the cablesatellite public affairs network 
plans to begin televising action in the house of commons feeding 
the parliamentary deliberations live on occasion to the united 
states by satellite 
while some might say the decision is just another manifestation 
of americas longheld fascination with things english cspan 
chairman brian lamb sees it differently 
one of our reasons for even doing this except for the fact 
that what the british do is interesting is an opportunity for us to 
take a look at comparative government lamb said in an interview 
last week 
but lamb agreed with trotter that us cable audiences accustomed 
to cspans nofrills gaveltogavel coverage of congressional 
debate committee hearings callin and talk shows and news 
conferences may experience some shocks 
i think americans are going to love it he said they use 
humor a lot more than our congress does in our debating i think 
theyll be surprised how informal some of the remarks are 
for example cspan viewers will likely get to witness british 
prime minister margaret thatchers trips to the commons where as 
leader of the majority conservative party she must submit to 15 
minutes of questioning each tuesday and thursday by the leader of 
the opposition labor party 
the equivalent here would be turning on the tv and finding 
president bush being grilled on government policy by the leading 
democrat in the house rep thomas s foley 
mrs thatcher resisted the move to allow televising of commons 
nonetheless its members approved the plan overwhelmingly on june 
12 even though it took 22 years to debate the matter 
some british pundits suggested mrs thatcher was reluctant 
because her voice tends to become a bit shrill when shes under the 
lash in commons she also wears glasses during those appearances 
and observers claimed she feared it would not be good for her image 
being seen on the telly with specs 
but she also could win a sympathy vote among viewers if the 
mostly male labor party members are openly derisive according to 
the pundits 
like congress the british lawmakers have decreed that the 
cameras shall not pan away from the speaker to show occasions of 
grave disorder or demonstrations in the galleries 
even so the offcamera noises may be considerable british 
lawmakers tend to be much more rowdy than their american 
counterparts 
some of our members are very badly behaved said trotter 
and i think that they will continue to be perhaps even worse 
as a result of television 
as washington post writer david broder observed in a recent 
dispatch the members of the opposing parties face each other 
across a very narrow aisle and as the leaders exchange barbs the 
backbenchers often bellow what are politely called animal noises 
at opposition speakers 
in a recent callin show on cspan trotter said he finds the 
us congress much more genteel and orderly 
if you listen to the participants on the floor of your house 
you see civilized organized men making wellintended 
wellthoughtout statements he said if you listen to the 
average british debate you will notice an obvious antagonistic tone 
in the members voices if one side says one thing a member of the 
other side will automatically jump to his feet to challenge the 
other member 
cspan covered queen elizabeth iis speech at the opening of 
british parliament last year and now provides regular coverage of 
canadas house of commons this year it also will cover the opening 
of the french parliament in paris on oct 46 and the european 
parliament in strasbourg france oct 911 
lamb expects the foreign coverage to cost between 250000 and 
500000 in a years time a pittance in comparison with what the 
major us television networks would spend

antiapartheid leaders said 
sunday they were encouraged by a meeting between between president 
pw botha jailed black leader nelson mandela but a spokesman for 
mandelas wife was skeptical 
at long last a head of state was heeding the calls of those who 
are interested in negotiations anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
told a cape town news conference 
in some ways you could say it is the outgoing president meeting 
someone who is going to succeed him in tuynhuys he said 
referring to the official residence where botha talked with mandela 
for 45 minutes wednesday 
tutu said there was more to be gained than to be lost in 
meeting with botha who is after all still the state president he 
still does call the shots 
botha is to step down after elections in september 
mandela imprisoned since 1962 is serving a life term for 
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whitedominated government 
he is regarded as the leader of the outlawed african national 
congress and many black south africans want him to be their 
president other black leaders refuse to negotiate with the 
government until he is freed 
the anc has not made any comment on the meeting 
colin eglin former leader of the nowdefunct antiapartheid 
progressive federal party said the meeting appeared in part an 
attempt to get white south africans used to the idea that the anc 
leader will be released from prison soon 
mandelas public image is being changed from that of the enemy 
to someone who visits the president at his home eglin said in an 
interview 
but at a news conference at winnie mandelas home the rev frank 
chikane secretarygeneral of the south african council of churches 
said the government is taking advantage of the position of mr 
mandela trying to give the impression to the world that they are 
negotiating with him when they are the only ones who have access to 
him 
if a leader is put in a situation where he is not able to 
consult the people he represents the people are not able to 
indicate they have any hope in what has happened he said 
chikane said his comments reflected the views of community 
leaders who met at mrs mandelas home but he did not name any of 
them 
mrs mandela let chikane speak for her answering only one 
question about whether she thought the meeting meant mandela would 
be freed soon 
we havent the slightest idea it is impossible to analyze the 
present indications she said 
leaders of major antiapartheid groups ostracized mrs mandela in 
february because of what they called a reign of terror by her 
bodyguards in soweto the black township outside johannesburg since 
then she has made few appearances 
zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi who is preparing for 
negotiations with exiled anc president oliver tambo to end fighting 
between black political groups in natal province said all men of 
goodwill will applaud the meeting between these two sons of south 
africa 
zulu youths who oppose buthelezi and support anc policies cheered 
when the bothamandela meeting was mentioned during a durban rally 
sunday that drew 6000 people 
the rally was called by the congress of south african trade 
unions involved in the peace negotiations with buthelezis inkatha 
organization to stop violence that has taken some 2000 lives in 
natal in the past three years

florida gov bob martinez who favors calling a 
special session of the states legislature to enact new restrictions 
on abortions said sunday he expects very aggressive lobbying by 
both sides but hopes there will be no resort to violent tactics 
i believe there is a compromise that can be reached between the 
rights of the unborn and the rights of women said martinez 
himself an abortion opponent 
the republican governor appearing on abcs this week with 
david brinkley program said areas of possible compromise include 
permitting abortions in cases of rape incest or where the mothers 
health is threatened 
although he has not yet made a final decision martinez said he 
prefers calling a special session of the legislature in october 
also interviewed on the program was vermonts democratic gov 
madeleine kunin who criticized the supreme courts decision last 
week upholding a missouri statute restricting abortions 
what the supreme court has really done is created a different 
standard in each state she said its created turmoil where 
there was an uneasy truce and its wrenched open a very very raw 
wound the kind of emotional and antagonistic debate that has 
erupted is going to be very very tough 
gov kunin called the missouri laws ban on using taxpayer 
dollars to fund abortions a dangerous restriction because so many 
women are dependent on public funds 
and when you take away public funds she said you really 
take away their choice as to whether and when they want to have a 
child

thousands of sunbathers were trapped on 
south beirut beaches for hours sunday as rival shiite moslem 
militiamen battled with machine guns mortars and rocketpropelled 
grenades in nearby neighborhoods police said 
syrian troops in charge of security in beiruts moslem sector 
arranged a onehour mercy ceasefire at sundown and evacuated 
the trapped beach goers said a police spokesman 
it was like a horror movie flocks of people ran in every 
direction as grenades and gunfire burst in the air said massara 
kahwaji a homemaker who joined an evacuation convoy as she returned 
to west beirut from a weekend in south lebanon 
also sunday syrian gunners in north lebanon fired sporadic 
barrages at the christian enclaves coast to prevent a ship 
suspected of carrying arms from docking 
the syrian guns opened up again in late afternoon shelling the 
christian residential districts of baabda yarzi and hazmiyeh 
southeast of beirut police said two people were wounded 
by police count 403 people have been killed and 1576 wounded 
since the march outbreak of the christiansyrian confrontation 
three people were killed and nine were wounded in the militia 
violence in south beirut said the police official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
that brought the overall toll to 11 killed and 37 wounded in the 
current confrontation which erupted nine days ago between the 
prosyrian mainstream amal militia and the iranianbacked 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god 
the militias are vying for power over lebanons 1 million shiite 
moslems 
the fighting blocked all escape routes from south beiruts ouzai 
and jnah districts and stranded thousands of people on the sand 
throughout the day 
syrian armored personnel carriers took many evacuees to coastal 
villages south of the capital while others were escorted back to 
west beirut as sniper fire crackled overhead 
in beirut syrian and christian troops traded sniper fire along 
beiruts dividing green line forcing a onehour closure of the only 
open gateway between the moslem and christian sectors of the city 
the hostilities were evidence that arab league troubleshooter 
lakhdar ibrahimi had failed to make headway in his four days of 
talks with christian and moslem leaders in beirut 
ibrahimi wound up two days of talks with the army leader gen 
michel aoun and other christian leaders in east beirut on saturday 
on sunday he met with moslem parliament members in west beirut 
one parliamentarian requesting anonymity said ibrahimi was 
trying to arrange a meeting of the lebanese parliament outside 
lebanon to draw up political reforms that would give moslems an 
equal share of power with the christians 
the christians have dominated the government army parliament 
and judiciary since lebanon gained independence from france in 1943 
when christians were thought to be the majority 
according to experts moslems are now the majority of lebanons 4 
million people they have been fighting in the 14yearold civil war 
for political equality 
parliament has been unable to meet in beirut since september 
when president amin gemayels term expired with no successor elected 
the source said ibrahimi contends that once political reforms are 
drafted chances will improve for holding a parliament session in 
beirut to elect a new president who would form a national coalition 
cabinet to carry out the reforms 
minutes before stepping down gemayel named aoun a maronite 
catholic like himself prime minister of a military caretaker 
cabinet 
moslems rejected aouns appointment and pledged allegiance to 
syrianbacked acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem who 
governed under gemayel 
the split splintered the army and police along sectarian lines 
and eventually led to the outbreak of the current christiansyrian 
confrontation

the castro government is allowing 
increasing numbers of older cubans to visit the united states and 
us officials say the reason is clear money the cubans charge a 
fee of 700 and up for the privilege 
in the last six months the number of cuban citizens being 
allowed to visit relatives in the us has jumped dramatically 
the sunsentinel quoted an unidentified us official in havana as 
saying 
the number of b2 tourist visas issued by the us interests 
section in havana that the cuban government has allowed to be used 
jumped from 230 a month in october to 1823 a month in march to 
about 3000 a month in june the newspaper reported sunday 
at the present rate by years end about 30000 cubans will have 
entered or be eligible to visit the united states 
no figures are kept on the number who seek asylum said eileen 
convy assistant immigration and naturalization service district 
director in southern florida 
the united states approves most visa requests from cubans 
consular officials said 
however the cuban government restricts the use of the visas to 
men over 65 and women over 60 and requires them to pay a fee of 
700 to 1000 cuban exiles in the united states mail their 
relatives the money for the fee 
all you have to do is multiply 3000 by 700 try to determine 
how much the cuban government is keeping and youll see its in the 
millions of dollars an unidentified consular official told the 
newspaper all those dollars are paid by the relatives in the 
states 
the us interests section which handles us affairs in havana 
because the nations lack full diplomatic relations said the numbers 
will continue to grow if the cuban government allows it 
the cuban government is very excited about this steppedup b2 
program because it represents a lot of money for them which they 
always need they have even talked of lowering the age of those 
eligible to travel from 60 to 50 years and that would create more 
business the newspaper quoted a us official as saying 
told of the increase in tourist visas from cuba state department 
spokesman frances jones said i guess we are being caught by 
surprise by this increase our people in havana have not informed us 
yet 
relatives of francisco carbonell 70 who had not seen him for 
nearly 30 years recently brought him to miami 
he wanted to come and we thought maybe this would be the last 
time we would see each other said eduardo heria 65 one of 
carbonells cousins 
six relatives contributed 720 so carbonell could pay the fee for 
a 20day visit an additional 225 would have extended his stay to 
40 days 
each visitor is allowed to return to cuba with 100 pounds of 
luggage only clothes and food items are allowed jewelry and 
electrical appliances things that can be resold are not permitted 
returning travelers must pay four cuban dollars for each pound 
brought back they must also declare any us dollars they have 
those dollars may be spent only at a tourist store on the island 
i would normally not want to give money to castros 
government said heria an exile for 25 years but i wanted my 
cousin to taste america at least once in his life so i gave castro 
a few dollars it was a dilemma

it took 1900 tons of dirt and rock and 
10 hours of labor into the night but workers triumphed over a 
20foot sinkhole threatening to devour john and betty priests 
house although they did lose the front lawn its good being 
back priest said saturday theres nothing like it 
the couple had to be evacuated last week when flood waters caused 
ridley park lake to overflow and opened the sinkhole 
borough engineer james kelly who ordered the evacuation thought 
any more rain might cause the hole to widen and possibly destroy the 
home but then he and pennsylvania department of transportation 
officials came up with the plan to fill the hole 
workers using several trucks friday worked almost nonstop 
hauling fill materials of dirt and rocks to the priest home the 
stuff had been excavated at a nearby highway construction site and 
was unneeded officials said 
volunteers from nearby fire companies kept roads open for the 
trucks and provided lighting that allowed the filling to continue 
after dark 
i never saw anyone work like those guys did priest said 
when i read in the papers about people who were flooded out and 
lost everything we were lucky he said we didnt lose anything 
but the front lawn there wasnt a drop of water in the house

as c everett koop closes out a sevenyear 
highprofile stint as the nations surgeon general officials in the 
bush administration are wrangling over whether they want his 
successor to enjoy the same visibility 
though he possessed very little statutory power koop used the 
office as a bully pulpit to hammer at the hazards of smoking raise 
the nations awareness of aids and become as he puts it the 
health conscience of america 
although technically his office is within the department of 
health and human services koop was an independent surgeon general 
at times a little too independent to suit some conservatives in the 
reagan white house 
im not clear that office will ever again hold the stature it 
did under koop said jean mcguire director of the aids action 
council 
its not clear whether the bush administration wants it to 
while the white house is collecting names of possible nominees 
for the job some in the administration want its profile lowered 
according to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
thought has even been given to simply adding surgeon general to dr 
james masons title as assistant hhs secretary for health a move 
that is not without precedent 
chase untermeyer personnel director for president bush declined 
to speak directly to the varied opinions circulating but he said 
were proceeding on the assumption that it will be separate from 
dr mason 
about 15 names are on a list of people who have indicated they 
are interested in the job or have been recommended by others 
untermeyer said refusing to identify any of them 
the names have been coming in on their own since it was made 
public in early may that koop would be leaving he said 
burton lee the presidents personal physician said he is 
pushing for a woman to get the job and has recommended the names 
of several he believes are qualified he declined to identify any of 
them but said none is a wellknown public figure 
its turned out to be quite a political job lee said and 
will probably become even more so with the supreme courts ruling 
last week giving states more authority to limit access to abortions 
no matter who you get theyre going to be the subject of a lot 
of criticism he said 
one name that has surfaced is dr james h red duke a noted 
trauma surgeon at the university of texas medical school in houston 
and host of pbs bodywatch 
supporters of the 60yearold cowboy doctor say hes got the 
same kind of charisma and communications skills that worked so 
successfully to make koop an american folk hero 
a name mentioned by conservative groups is dr robert redfield 
chief of retroviral research at walter reed army institute of 
research 
but gary bauer a former reagan white house aide who now heads 
the family research council said conservative groups are only now 
beginning to focus on the vacancy and realize its an important 
post 
aids activists who heap kudos on koop for taking the lead on 
aids and speaking openly about condoms and sex education to prevent 
its spread are also watching to see who his successor will be 
they are heartened that lee who served on the president 
reagans aids commission has bushs ear as the presidents 
personal physician 
a strong person with moral persuasions on this issue could be a 
real problem the aids action councils mcguire said koop 
helped break down the moral impediments around aids my biggest 
fear would be someone who would build them up again 
as for koop the 72yearold pediatrician will step down this 
week and begin writing his memoirs and looking for media 
opportunities to continue preaching his health messages 
in a recent session with reporters koop said his activism and 
independence strengthened the office of surgeon general and give his 
successor a better opportunity of accomplishing things 
asked how he would advise his successor koop said recently 
dont try to copy me or anybody else do what you can do and 
be who you are to the very best of your ability thats exactly what 
i did

more than 24 hours after reporting that communist 
party chief erich honecker was suffering from a gallbladder ailment 
east germanys staterun media on sunday remained silent on the 
76yearold leaders condition 
honecker was forced to return home early from a warsaw pact 
summit in bucharest romania on saturday the official news agency 
adn said then he was suffering from an acute gallbladder 
ailment it did not say if honecker had been hospitalized and gave 
no other details 
it said however that honecker congratulated premier willi stoph

two palestinians reportedly were fatally shot by 
troops on sunday and soldiers blew up the home of a palestinian 
accused of killing 14 people by forcing their bus to crash 
police in jerusalem dispersed a crowd of israelis who chanted 
death to arabs and stoned arab cars in anger over the bus 
attack on thursday the deadliest event in the 19monthold 
palestinian uprising 
police on horseback charged the stonethrowing israelis mostly 
orthodox jews in black hats and long coats when rioting erupted 
after the funeral of moshe shapiro 74 one of the bus victims 
police said 11 israelis were arrested sunday bringing to 27 the 
number arrested since the violence over the bus attack broke out on 
friday 
israeli officials criticized the three days of antiarab 
violence which left one palestinian dead and nine wounded 
former prime minister menachem begin broke a threemonth silence 
and condemned the violence 
it is selfevident that this despicable crime carried out 
against bus passengers caused deep pain in the hearts of every 
citizen of israel the 75yearold begin said in a statement 
released by his spokesman yehiel kadishai 
but the responses we have seen in the last few days will only 
sharpen hatred between the two nations and it must be prevented 
he said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said sunday on israels arab 
television news im sorry for the attacks these are 
irresponsible acts that do not help anyone bring chaos to our land 
and do not hurt the arabs in the end 
finance minister shimon peres leader of the labor party said 
his centerleft party would decide monday whether to pull out of the 
coalition government led by shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
several labor ministers have called for such a move saying 
principles adopted by likud last week could discourage palestinians 
from agreeing to israels plan for elections in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
a labor pullout could topple the government seven months after 
israels elections 
israel television reported sunday that highranking us 
officials were urging labor not to leave the government 
a highranking us state department delegation plans to visit 
israel in 10 days to discuss the future of the governments proposal 
for elections in the occupied lands 
foreign minister moshe arens summoned us ambassador william 
brown on sunday to complain that the united states failed to condemn 
the bus attack as terrorism a ministry statement said 
the statement said arens also told brown the palestine liberation 
organization has long ago broken the conditions set by the us 
government for continuing the usplo dialogue in tunisia 
the us embassy had no comment on the statement 
on sunday a senior police official said that investigators 
believe the bus attacker acted on his own palestinian sources said 
he apparently was avenging the beating of a brother by soldiers last 
month and the arrest of other relatives during the uprising 
soldiers blew up the home of the suspect abdel hadi salman 
rassem ghanem in gazas nusseirat refugee camp on sunday the 
government often destroys or seals homes to punish palestinians 
suspected of violent attacks 
the united states has condemned the practice as a violation of 
due process rights because most suspects have not faced trial when 
their homes are destroyed 
ghanem 23 was in the hospital ward of an unidentified prison 
sunday recovering from head and chest injuries suffered when the bus 
plunged into a deep ravine police say ghanem grabbed the steering 
wheel from the driver and forced it to crash killing 14 people 
including 10 israelis and injuring 27 
in the west bank village of ramin near nablus 20yearold ayman 
hamad was shot in the chest and killed when soldiers opened fire on 
masked palestinians building a roadblock to stop troops from 
entering the village arab hospital officials said 
in madana also near nablus fayez yousef 21 was killed by a 
gunshot wound to the chest when troops opened fire on a group of 
youths who stoned an army patrol arab reports said 
a military spokesman said the army had hospital reports of a 
death in ramin but was still investigating the circumstances he 
said he had no reports of the madana incident 
the deaths would bring to 552 the number of palestinians killed 
in the uprising thirtythree israelis have been killed 
seven other palestinians were reported shot and wounded sunday in 
clashes with the army 
under shamirs election plan palestinians in the west bank and 
gaza would choose representatives to negotiate with israel on 
limited selfrule 
shamir maintains the principles voted by likud on wednesday do 
not affect the plan but us secretary of state james a baker iii 
criticized the partys action as not helpful to the peace 
process 
likud said no elections would be held until the uprising ends and 
that a program of building jewish settlements in the occupied 
territories will go forward

a former state police detective who investigated 
sen edward m kennedys 1969 accident at chappaquiddick is suing 
the author of a book on the incident claiming the author never paid 
for his information 
bernard j flynn the police detective lieutenant claims that 
author leo damore promised him 50000 for his cooperation when 
damore was writing senatorial privilege an account of the 
accident in which the senators 28yearold passenger mary jo 
kopechne was killed 
this is a contract that is oral in nature flynns attorney 
gary a nickerson told the boston sunday herald however there 
are some written memorandums that reflect the existence of an oral 
contract 
the fatal chappaquiddick accident which also helped to kill 
kennedys hopes of being president occurred 20 years ago this 
month on july 19 1969 
flynn told damore that he met secretly on at least two occasions 
with kennedys brotherinlaw stephen smith and lawyer herbert j 
miller to pass along information about the district attorneys 
probe into the accident 
damore said he paid flynn 1000 to cover expenses but said he 
never promised the investigator any money 
i told him you cant be paid for this information damore 
said youll hurt yourself and youll hurt the credibility of the 
information i said to him as far as money is concerned forget 
it there was no contract here none 
damore has filed to dismiss the lawsuit but said that if it goes 
to trial he might be forced to subpoena kennedy smith and miller 
that alone is worth 50000 said the author 
the book was published in 1988 by regnery gateway a conservative 
publishing house based in washington after it had been rejected by 
a number of new york publishers damore of old saybrook conn is 
a former cape cod resident who has written several books including 
a flattering account of john f kennedys years on the cape 
one of the chappaquiddick books most controversial revelations 
was an allegation that kennedy wanted to tell police that kopechne 
had been driving alone on the night of the crash that account was 
based on interviews with kennedy associate joseph gargan who went 
with the senator and another friend paul markham to try and rescue 
kopechne after the accident

thousands of ethnic moldavians and opponents from 
nonnative groups gathered sunday in a tense demonstration soviet 
tv reported 
today in kishinev there was a flaming tinder but there was no 
explosion due to the balanced steps taken by law enforcement 
bodies a correspondent reported from the moldavian capital in the 
western soviet union 
it did not say what steps authorities took to calm the situation 
members of groups demanding more rights for ethnic moldavians 
carried tricolor nationalist flags and banners and shouted slogans 
such as moldavia to moldavians and get out occupiers the 
correspondent said on the evening news program vremya 
one huge red banner visible amid the thousands of people on 
kishinevs main square read we arent guests we are home that 
appeared to be a slogan of nonethnic moldavians who are members of 
a largely russian group interfront and feel threatened by the 
nationalists demands 
soviet tv said kishinev officials had authorized sundays rally 
but wanted it to be a forum for dialogue between opposing groups 
instead the demonstrators heckled a moldavian representative to the 
national parliament the congress of peoples deputies according to 
the television report 
ethnic moldavians have been agitating for months with strikes and 
demonstrations to have their native language restored to its 
original form they also have complained about crime and 
environmental problems 
moldavia has long retained close ties with romania its neighbor 
to the west despite repeated attempts by moscow to link it more 
closely with russia 
the region of 42 million people has passed from turkish to 
russian to romanian and back to soviet control over the past century 
moldavian and romanian are the same spoken language but the late 
dictator josef stalin imposed the cyrillic alphabet on the 
moldavians after soviet troops occupied the region during world war 
ii 
moldavian communist party chief semyon grossu in february 
condemned nationalist activists for going too far but endorsed some 
of the language demands draft legislation that would gradually 
reinstate the latin script still used in neighboring romania has 
been published for public discussion

president bush on a delicate and historic 
mission to accelerate renaissance in poland and hungary told the 
polish people sunday the world is inspired by their struggle but 
cautioned it will require further sacrifices 
history which has so often conspired with geography to deny 
the polish people their freedom now offers up a new and brighter 
future for poland bush said upon his latenight arrival in warsaw 
after a ninehour flight from washington 
he did not elaborate on his prediction of sacrifice ahead for the 
polish people but administration officials have made clear any us 
aid will be tied to economic austerity measures by the poles 
themselves 
the poles declined to approve a severe economic austerity program 
two years ago that would have raised food prices and put other 
pressures on their already lean economic existence 
officials said at the time the program would send prices for such 
consumer services as rent and heating up as much as 200 percent and 
that the price for basic food items such as milk bread and meat 
might double 
bush was greeted by polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski and 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski as he came down the ramp of 
his airplane 
also present was andrzej wielowieyski deputy speaker of polands 
new freely elected senate and an adviser to solidarity leader lech 
walesa it was the first time a solidarity representative has been 
included at an official polish state welcome 
after inspecting a military honor guard and shaking hands with 
dignitaries invited to the airport ceremony bush and jaruzelski 
strode to a speakers platform for their brief remarks 
before leaving his own capital bush had made clear he is 
sensitive to the two warsaw pact nations need to transform 
themselves without antagonizing the soviet union which borders both 
it is not our role to dictate to them what they should be doing 
or the refinements of the system he said at a departure ceremony 
in poland bush said winds of change surely have touched the 
land here where so much has happened since my last visit two years 
ago as vice president 
poland has started a long and ascending path of democratic 
change he said this climb is accelerating but will not always 
be easy and will require further sacrifices but if followed it 
will lead to a renaissance for this remarkable nation 
these are great days for poland bush continued solidarity 
is again legal the beginnings of a free press now exist a new 
parliament is in place the polish senate has been restored through 
free and fair elections poland is making its own history and 
america and the world is watching 
the world is inspired by what is happening here he said 
here in the heart of europe the american people have a fervent 
wish that europe be whole and free 
tactfully bush promoted jaruzelski the countrys communist 
leader who was at the airport when the us presidents plane 
touched down 
the government of poland and you mr chairman have shown 
vision and courage in taking the path of the roundtable accords 
the president said he made no mention of jaruzelskis role in 
trying to break solidarity and in imposing martial law in december 
1981 
the polish leader greeted bush as an outstanding politician and 
statesman the leader of the great american people with which the 
poles are linked by lively ties of friendship based on long 
tradition 
jaruzelski said warsaw residents who have come in such great 
numbers to see you and greet you this summer evening are giving an 
expression of this 
despite the late hour thousands of people scattered in groups 
along bushs 45 mile motorcade route cheered and waved as he rode 
past some of them waved huge american flags as bush pulled out of 
the airport a large crowd waved and many people shouted 
solidarity 
in his departure statement in washington bush had said poland 
and hungary were on the threshold of a new era and that europe 
a continent cruelly divided for more than four decades now dreams 
of being whole and free 
in a conciliatory gesture toward moscow that signalled his 
determination to end the cold war era the president said his task 
was to see that we mend old divisions that we fulfill the 
decadesold dream and that the new europe emerges secure 
prosperous peaceful and free 
bushs 10day trip also will take him to a summit meeting in 
paris with the leaders of britain canada france italy japan and 
west germany and include a side trip to the netherlands the first 
official visit by a us president to americas oldest diplomatic 
partner 
but the emphasis will be on bushs visits to poland and hungary 
the two soviet bloc countries with the most pronounced trend toward 
a westernstyle economy and a democratic political system 
the symbolism of it all is immense no us president has visited 
a warsaw pact nation since jimmy carter went to warsaw in 1977 and 
never has a us president been to hungary 
bushs goal is to wean poland and hungary from moscows orbit and 
toward a more independent foreign policy but the president is being 
careful not to couch his mission in competitive terms nor to 
exhort poles and hungarians into reckless actions that could 
backfire 
in a television interview aired as the bush party was flying 
across the atlantic white house chief of staff john sununu said 
bushs offer of economic aid to poland will be a measured 
response 
the one thing that might create a wedge rather than a 
continued movement of reciprocal progress would be to put such a 
large package in there that the poles would perceive that we are 
trying to replace the soviet unions support with support from the 
west he said on cbstvs face the nation 
thats not our intention sununu said we are not trying to 
replace what we are trying to do is augment 
as for challenging soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who 
barnstormed in west germany last month and has just completed a 
visit to france bush disavowed any intention of being provocative 
i think if we went there with hot rhetoric and our goal was to 
complicate things for mr gorbachev yes there would be a danger 
bush said just before air force one took off from andrews air force 
base and headed toward a sun just climbing above the eastern horizon 
but i think i know enough about it and others upon who im 
relying know enough about it and know thats not going to 
happen he told reporters 
at the same time bush vowed im not going to back off my 
principles because it might offend mr gorbachev im not going to 
try to put him in a box by throwing strains on the warsaw pact i 
will give my aspirations for a europe whole and free what we want 
to do is encourage them 
jaruzelski in an interview on cnns newsmaker sunday 
program said bushs visit was taking place at a very important 
moment in history and that is why i see president bushs visit 
as an element that would favor the positive processes which are 
already taking place and which are bringing east and west closer 
together 
recalling the talks that were held when bush visited warsaw as 
vice president two years ago jaruzelski said he recognized then 
that polands matters are very close to him bush and understood 
by him

the investigation of the deaths of four 
children seemed to have hit a dead end seven years ago until a 
newspaper reporters questions led an officer to read through the 
file and reopen the case 
now martha ann johnson 34 who originally blamed her childrens 
deaths on bad luck has been accused of killing them in separate 
incidents from 1977 to 1982 formal charges were filed last week in 
three of the deaths and police say she has confessed to the fourth 
death 
police say mrs johnson smothered the children at least twice 
after fights with her thenhusband but at the time of the deaths 
they did not have solid evidence to back their suspicions and bring 
charges 
authorities have said the case originally fell through the cracks 
when officials failed to communicate with one another police 
social and medical agencies in fulton and clayton counties were 
involved 
the cracks did result in part from the number of agencies and 
crossing jurisdictional lines clayton district attorney robert e 
keller said but youve got to acknowledge also there were flaws 
in what was done 
a few hours before her arrest last monday police say mrs 
johnson confessed to investigators from neighboring clayton county 
to killing 2yearold james william taylor in 1977 and 11yearold 
jennyann wright in 1982 
she was indicted thursday in clayton county on charges of 
murdering jennyann and also 3monthold tibitha janeel bowen in 
1980 and 3yearold earl wayne bowen in 1981 james died in fulton 
county and that case will be handled there said fulton county 
district attorney lewis slaton 
the case was placed on no lead status in 1982 leaving it 
dormant because there just wasnt enough to go with said 
clayton county police maj jerry robinson the deaths of tibitha and 
james for example were originally attributed by medical examiners 
to sudden infant death syndrome 
the investigation was reopened in december after an inquiry about 
the case by a reporter from the atlanta journalconstitution who was 
doing a story on how government agencies handle deaths of juveniles 
robinson said county police director ronnie clackum reviewed the 
case file and decided to reopen the investigation he said 
what we did when we reopened the case we went back to square 
one robinson said he would not comment on specific evidence but 
said the new investigation included interviews with people who were 
not included in the first investigation 
we wanted to make sure everything was in line before we 
interviewed mrs johnson robinson said since the time of the 
last death she had remarried and moved to locust grove a town of 
about 2000 some 45 miles south of atlanta 
mrs johnson and her new husband do not have children of their 
own 
jennyann reportedly asked for help from her natural father and a 
social worker but was returned to her mother after being placed for 
a time with another relative she was found feb 21 1982 face down 
on her mothers bed dead from what medical examiners at the time 
called unexplained asphyxia 
youd have to say the system failed in this keller said 
police have refused to say how mrs johnson allegedly killed the 
children though the atlanta newspaper reported that in at least two 
cases she is suspected of having smothered them with her body 
it seems that every time that she would get into an argument 
with her husband and he would leave something would happen to one 
of the children robinson said 
during the first investigation robinson said there were real 
strong feelings that a crime had been committed and pathologists 
reports at the time made note of the previous deaths he said 
but he noted that to arrest someone there must be probable cause 
that a crime was committed after the children died he said police 
went to the prosecutors that were handling this case and presented 
what they had to them it was just a general feeling that there just 
wasnt enough to go with

results of last weeks elections in five states and the returns 
favored the governing institutional revolutionary party the 
opposition accused the party of vote fraud 
in the border city of ciudad juarez the conservative national 
action party or pan alleged massive irregularities and pulled out 
of the vote count 
the ruling party known as the pri had proclaimed victory all 
week in the overwhelming majority of state and local races held on 
july 2 
the exception was baja california where the pri gave up a 
governors seat for the first time in its 60year history 
despite that defeat and pans allegations of fraud the pri had 
repeatedly insisted it had maintained control of the state assembly 
and bajas city halls 
in the northern state of chihuahua the state election commission 
said sunday the pri had won all 67 city hall races including the 
one in ciudad juarez and 17 of the 18 state assembly races 
on the yucatan peninsula the campeche state election commission 
announced a pri sweep of the state assemby races the election 
commission in the northern state of zacatecas did the same 
elsewhere the official count continued and results in some areas 
were not expected for days 
in the central state of michoacan contested campaigns by the pri 
and its archrival the leftist democratic revolutionary party were 
followed by competing claims of victory and charges of fraud and 
voter intimidation 
we wont give up a single vote the pri chairman in michoacan 
state fausto vallejo said sunday as the state election commission 
continued to tally the vote 
the michoacan elections were seen as a key contest between the 
pri and its leftist opposition

sheets made by poll officials who counted the ballots on election 
day in the two most hotly contested states baja california and 
michoacan opposition parties had representatives watching the 
actual ballot count at most polling places 
the parties say their victory claims are based on the tallies 
reported by their poll watchers and election workers 
pris historic concession in the baja governors race dominated 
the news here and abroad drawing praise for president carlos 
salinas de gortari and his move toward democratic reform it also 
overshadowed other races and the opposition charges of fraud 
in 60 years of unbroken pri rule that stretched from local 
election commissions to the tiniest city halls to the presidency 
vote fraud had become so common that a whole vocabulary of slang 
arose to describe ways to rig elections

the supreme court decision giving states new 
authority to restrict abortions means a new round of fights in the 
states about the contentious issue two women on opposite sides of 
the dispute agreed sunday 
its the voters who are going to hold the candidates to a new 
level of accountability and theyre going to lose their jobs said 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion rights 
action league 
susan smith associate legislative director for the national 
right to life committee disagreed weve proven that the prolife 
margin is enough to help elect prolife representatives 
but ms michelman disputed that saying no no no no no 
the debate occurred on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
the disagreement by the women mirrored comments a week ago in the 
wake of the 54 supreme court decision which said the states could 
have new authority to restrict abortion representatives of both 
sides said the fight would now turn to state legislatures 
ms smith said were going to do what weve been doing for the 
past 16 yearssince the 1973 supreme court decision legalizing 
abortions 
we have a very strong grassroots organization in place which 
has been very active in helping to pass protective legislation the 
kind of legislation thats finally been upheld by the supreme court 
after years of striking down even minimal restrictions 
there are a lot of people out there who for many years now have 
felt that they have been unable to do anything about this issue 
she said what the supreme court did was to return aspects of this 
issue back to the democratic processes and the people 
but ms michelman said you know the lives and health of women 
should not depend on the accident of their residency any more than 
the right of the freedom of the press should depend on where a 
newspaper is published 
we may have lost faith in five justices of the court but we 
have not lost faith in the american public she said 
she said one target will be florida gov bob martinez who said 
he is willing to call the florida legislature into special session 
to write new restrictions on abortion 
martinez said he expects intensive lobbying from both sides 
i suspect that it will be very aggressive no question about 
it from both sides he said i would hope that we each enjoy 
the freedom of speech but do it without harm to anyone without 
damaging public or private property that we communicate our 
thoughts and be as aggressive as you like i know its an aggressive 
kind of issue 
gov madeleine kunin of vermont said i hope we can develop 
another way that we dont have to just respond emotionally that we 
can realize the world has changed and women have become used to the 
idea that our present day other choices of freedom include the idea 
of choosing when whether they want to have children

three former government housing officials 
reaped millions in unjustified profits and increased costs in 
two troubled housing programs through a mortgage company suspended 
from government work because of questionable business practices a 
federal audit says 
the three including philip winn now ambassador to switzerland 
are among those who capitalized on their knowledge of the housing 
programs and the lenders lax enforcement of government regulations 
they formed a joint development venture after working briefly at 
the department of housing and urban development that venture was 
called winn and associates which according to another hud audit 
was the development company involved in one of the projects 
the mortgage on the project was insured by a company known as 
benton mortage 
the audit by huds inspector general detailed how the trio used 
paper corporations to increase their profits and how benton 
mortgage used improper calculations to inflate mortgages and rent 
subsidies paid by the government 
the audit does not accuse the three former officials of criminal 
wrongdoing but recommends internal administrative sanctions against 
benton mortgage 
a company spokesman said bentons loan portfolio is sound that 
it has not defaulted on any hud coinsured loans and that the company 
has already filed a 2500page response to the hud audit 
the inspector general audited 14 projects in the agencys 
moderate rehabilitation program financed and coinsured by benton 
mortgage located in knoxville tenn and found that in none of the 
cases did the lender follow hud rules or prudent underwriting 
practices 
three of those projects were developed by companies partly owned 
by winn who served one year as an assistant hud secretary and 
federal housing commissioner before being appointed ambassador to 
switzerland by former president reagan 
two other former hud officials philip abrams and j michael 
queenan were partners with winn in one of the projects the 
160apartment sierra pointe complex in las vegas nev 
the report which did not name the owners of the development 
companies said benton manipulated rents and appraised values to 
get the highest allowable mortgage for the sierra pointe project 
according to the report benton overestimated sierra pointes 
anticipated rents and the propertys value by including the 
government assistance and overstating the sales prices of two 
comparable properties 
that resulted in a bentonapproved coinsured mortgage for sierra 
pointe that the audit said was 25 million more than it should have 
been 
a house subcommittee headed by rep tom lantos dcalif is 
investigating a number of hud activities including whether the 
moderate rehabilitation program has been used in some projects to 
jack up the mortgage value 
the moderate rehabilitation and mortgage coinsurance programs are 
among four that recently have been suspended revised or restricted 
by hud secretary jack kemp after inspector generals reports 
revealed evidence of widespread abuse and mismanagement during the 
reagan administration 
our portfolio is sound benton spokesman tom reid told the 
associated press adding the company has not defaulted on any of its 
hud coinsured loans 
hud faces about 650 million in coinsured loan defaults from 
several mortgage companies whose practices now are under review 
we specialize in lowincome housing and the people we financed 
just happened to be those guys reid added 
reid said the company already had made a 2500page 
fourvolume response to the igs audit which he would not discuss 
further 
another winn group project was singled out as an example of 
bentons aiding in the pyramiding of profits by contractors and 
subcontractors through contrived identities of interests and paper 
conduit companies 
in that instance sundance housing associates ltd a company 
winn listed as part of his holdings on a 1988 financial disclosure 
form owned 25 percent of the sierra vista apartments in arapahoe 
county colo the form also showed the company was formed and then 
sold in 1987 after the project was completed 
sundance housing selected mead associates inc as the contractor 
to rehabilitate sierra vista mead then formed ma builders inc as 
a construction company with common ownership sundance housing and 
ma builders then formed sundance builders inc 
sundance builders then became the general contractor and mead a 
subcontractor 
property owners and developers with common interests are eligible 
for certain profit and risk allowances in huds coinsurance program 
however the agency doesnt allow for the added profit or 
overhead costs when a subcontractor appears to be a paper 
corporation a company with no demonstrated ability in the field or 
no significant business outside its sphere of interest 
investigators determined that all three prohibitive conditions 
existed on the sierra vista project and four others and concluded 
that unjustified profits totaled 1442296 for the five 
projects 
a 202unit project at the windsong apartments in tulsa okla 
another winn group project also was among the five cited for the 
paper corporations scheme in the audit 
the arrangements should not have been approved the auditors 
concluded 
other names and projects connected with alleged 
influencepeddling and favoritism in the moderate rehabilitation 
program show up in bentons portfolio of questionable coinsured 
loans cited by the inspector general 
they include the 316unit pebble creek apartments project 
developed by gerald carmen former director of the general services 
administration and the four seasons apartments in gastonia nc 
joseph strauss former executive assistant to thenhud secretary 
samuel pierce and judith siegel a developer who paid former 
interior secretary james watt 300000 as a consultant on one 
project were paid 123000 as consultants on the four seasons 
project 
the siegelwatt project at the kingsley park apartments in essex 
md was also among those that used paper corporations to build 
in excessive profits and overhead to the tune of 336373 
the inspector general found actions by the knoxville lender 
resulted in material misrepresentation of mortgage amounts and 
rents that will force the government to overpay rent subsidies 
estimated at 37 million for the 15year life of the housing 
assistance contracts 
in addition mortgages to moderate rehabilitation projects 
coinsured by benton and the government were excessive by 22 
million the report said 
the inspector general recommended huds mortgage review board 
take appropriate sanctions against benton 
the company has been barred from making additional loans under 
the coinsurance program until nov 1 and hud spokesman jack flynn 
said the review board is expected to take up the benton case in 
midjuly 
although inspector general paul adams had said last week benton 
was under grand jury investigation pat neri assistant inspector 
general for investigations said hud has shared its audit 
information with the justice department which would decide whether 
there is evidence of any criminal wrongdoing

gasoline prices continued an uncharacteristic 
summer decline caused by increased oil and gasoline supplies an 
analyst said sunday 
the nations average retail price for a gallon of gasoline was 
11676 on july 7 a decrease of 167 cents since early june said 
trilby lundberg publisher of the biweekly lundberg survey of 12000 
gas stations 
the price has dropped because refiners terminal operators and 
importers had increased supplies to meet new federal cleanair 
regulations lundberg said 
the drop reflects efforts on the part of the oil industry to 
step up their gasoline production and imports of gasoline during may 
and june in order to avoid any supply tightness or shortage 
lundberg said 
lundberg said that higher demand by summer drivers and policy 
changes in other oil producing nations could still push prices 
higher later this year 
gasoline reached its peak average price of 11843 per gallon on 
may 19 a sharp rise at the time from the average price of 9804 
cents in early january the survey found 
at the selfservice pump july 7 regular unleaded gasoline cost 
an average of 10678 per gallon while premium cost 12252 per 
gallon and regular leaded was 10612 per gallon 
for fullservice gasoline the average cost for unleaded was 
13211 per gallon premium cost 14403 per gallon and regular 
leaded was 1305 per gallon

waters resisting efforts to herd it back to sea was found dead 
sunday in the hudson river nearly 50 miles north of here 
the bottlenose dolphin was found floating off the town of 
garrison on the east side of the river said marine biologist samuel 
sadove of the okeanos ocean research foundation which rescues 
stranded sea mammals

interview 
an autopsy was to be performed on the gray 5footlong animal at 
an okeanos laboratory in hampton bays on long island where the 
organization is based 
sadove declined to speculate on what caused the animals death 
but said it was not unexpected he said last week that its condition 
had noticeably deteriorated the dolphins skin was peeling due to 
the lack of salt in the hudson 
the dolphin of the same species as the dolphin that appeared in 
the television show flipper was first spotted june 20 in the 
east river off manhattan 
it stayed in the river for 11 days attracting a steady stream of 
curious onlookers 
the dolphin resisted efforts by biologists who tried to herd it 
back into the atlantic ocean by banging on pipes in the water 
two weeks ago it headed north up the hudson scientists had 
planned to capture the dolphin tuesday and take it to the sea

the widely publicized allstar revival of 
twelfth night by the new york shakespeare festival is bawdy 
boisterous even boorish an idiosyncratic often low comedy 
jokefest that sacrifices love not to mention shakespeare for 
laughs 
the reason there are a lot of stars on stage at the delacorte 
theater in central park where twelfth night opened sunday and 
director harold guskin has encouraged them to revel in their own 
eccentricities no matter what it does to the play 
because of that directive the production belongs to the 
strongest performers in this case gregory hines a consummate song 
and dance man hines dressed to look like a mummer in a 
philadelphia new years day parade plays feste the fool 
feste dominates the evening even making the quartet of lovers 
viola and orsino olivia and sebastian seem like supporting 
characters out the window goes much of the plays ideas about 
romance particularly concerning sexual identity and illusion as 
well as its more thoughtful moments about death and reconciliation 
viola dressed as a boy still pines for orsino who longs for 
olivia who sighs for the young man viola pretends to be and violas 
longlost twin brother sebastian still arrives to straighten out the 
mess but they all seem secondary to the comic business at hand 
most of that business fortunately concerns hines who has the 
grace style and personality to get away with just about anything 
even dropping his pants or dancing with surprised female members of 
the audience 
hes helped in the comic antics by john amos a gruff 
inarticulate sir toby belch and fisher stevens as the effete sir 
andrew aguecheek stevens displays a goofy charm accentuated by a 
strawblond wig that makes him look like a dissipated breck shampoo 
girl 
jeff goldblum gives the productions strangest performance 
playing malvolio olivias villainous steward and wouldbe suitor 
goldblum scampers around the large stage as if he were auditioning 
to replace mikhail baryshnikov as the cockroach in 
metamorphosis his speaking voice is even stranger oozing 
insincerity he affects a singsong stopandgo cadence that 
obliterates any sense of shakespeares language 
michelle pfeiffer a wan indifferent olivia also tramples many 
of her speeches rushing through them before she finds herself out 
of breath there is more life and feel for the language to be 
found in charlaine woodard as olivias sprightly maid maria 
stephen collins as a stuffy even sexist orsino and graham winton 
as sebastian are adequate but bland the best member of the quartet 
of lovers is mary elizabeth mastrantonio she conveys violas sense 
of sexual confusion and desperation in great comic style but the 
actress doesnt neglect the music to be found in shakespeares 
moonstruck poetry 
director guskin has set the play at the turn of the century in a 
mediterranean country not unlike monaco it allows costume designer 
jeanne button to provide some elaborate costumes and set designer 
john lee beatty has conjured up a peachcolored marble gazebo that 
dominates one side of the stage with a tiny replica of olivias 
house perched on a rocky cliff on the other side of the playing area 
twelfth night ends with a wistful song by feste delivered by 
hines with great feeling it releases a wide range of emotions that 
are missing from the mostly onenote relentless buffoonery that 
precedes it

a lightningsparked fire raged out of 
control sunday along a 20mile front in northwestern nebraska 
threatening the community of crawford and forcing evacuation of a 
hospital a nursing home and a park 
gov kay orr issued an emergency declaration for the area making 
state money available and ordered about 30 national guardsmen to 
help an estimated 150 firefighters battle the blaze 
the blaze also threatened the site of a former army cavalry post 
where sioux chief crazy horse was killed 
the fire burned to within 1 miles of the city of 1300 and 
authorities feared a shift in the wind could endanger the town 
the fire started saturday on the west side of fort robinson state 
park and park superintendent vince rotherham estimated that 10000 
to 12000 acres trees scrub and grassland in the 22000acre parks 
rugged canyons had burned it also had charred part of an adjoining 
wildlife refuge and private land 
it looks really bad a lot of those trees are 150 years old 
it will take 100 years to rebuild it rotherham said 
the blaze grew to about 20 miles long and six miles wide had 
burned 50000 to 100000 acres and was far from contained said 
deputy state fire marshal jerry larson 
we could see whole lines of trees exploding said marc 
anthony a state game and parks commissioner who flew over the fire 
a mushroom cloud of smoke could be seen from scottsbluff about 90 
miles away 
its not a pretty sight said mrs orr who flew along the 
perimeter of the blaze theres so much only so much that can be 
done and theyre doing everything humanly possible 
in addition to a rugged landscape of buttes as high as 4900 feet 
and long narrow canyons temperatures around 90 degrees and 
variable wind complicated firefighting efforts officials said 
everything was against us rotherham said its been 
extremely hot when it hit it just kind of exploded things this 
area is extremely rough they couldnt get to it 
about 150 firefighters from about 25 to 30 departments from 
nebraska south dakota and wyoming were fighting the blaze he said 
about midday the fire inside the park was within onehalf mile 
of historic fort robinson the former cavalry post where crazy horse 
was killed by guards in 1877 rotherham said 
larson said an undetermined number of private cabins had burned 
in the sparsely populated area 
crawford hospital treated several people for minor injuries said 
nursing supervisor jacqueline skavdahl 
earlier the four patients at the hospital were taken by bus to 
the chadron community hospital because of the smoke and closeness of 
the flames said kathy wigington chadron director of nursing 
services and about 25 residents of the ponderosa villa nursing home 
were taken to a dormitory at chadron state college 
the elderly people are at higher risk they dont breathe as 
well said kathy owen director of nursing services at the nursing 
home 
more than 600 visitors were evacuated from the campgrounds lodge 
and cabins at fort robinson state park because of the shifting wind 
and smoke although authorities said there was no immediate danger 
to the tourist facilities said rotherham 
it was extremely smoky just so you could just about breathe 
rotherham said 
state sen sandy scofield who lives on a ranch near chadron 
said the fire was the worst she has seen in the area 
there have been three big fires out here in 15 years and right 
now i think that this is probably the worst of all of them she 
said sunday 
scofield said the rough country will hamper firefighting efforts 
i dont know how they can go about fighting a fire like that 
she said its been very dry out here

six of the 10 richest people in the world are 
japanese but the united states still leads the world in the total 
number of billionaires according to estimates compiled by forbes 
magazine 
for the third straight year yoshiaki tsutsumi led forbes list 
of private billionaires even though his wealth wasnt quite as much 
as it had been 12 months earlier 
tsutsumi head of japans seibu railway group has a personal net 
worth of at least 15 billion nearly 4 billion less than 
estimated last summer due mainly to a rise in the value of the 
dollar against other major currencies forbes said sunday 
the estimate was far greater than the 28 billion that fortune 
magazine placed as tsutsumis worth in its september 1988 ranking of 
those it considered the worlds richest people 
in last years list forbes estimated tsutsumis net worth as 
189 billion 
the magazine reports in its july 24 issue that tsutsumi edged out 
secondranked taikichiro mori by less than 1 billion 
mori a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings 
in tokyo has an estimated net worth of 142 billion in last 
years survey forbes placed moris worth at about 18 billion 
the thirdrichest on the list was american sam moore walton 
founder of the thirdlargest retailer in the united states walmart 
stores inc walton and his family are worth an estimated 87 
billion up from forbes 1988 estimate of 65 billion 
after the waltons came canadas reichmann brothers owners of the 
olympia amp york real estate empire with a combined net worth of 
about 8 billion 
the rest of the 10 richest people in the world their country and 
industries according to forbes were shin kyukho south korea 
candy real estate 8 billion hirotomo takei and family japan 
publishing real estate 78 billion kitaro watanabe japan real 
estate hotels 7 billionplus haruhiko yoshimoto and family 
japan real estate 7 billion hans and gad rausing sweden 
liquids packaging 7 billion and eitaro itoyama japan land 66 
billion 
forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the 
world with personal assets worth more than 1 billion 
the united states was the country with the most billionaires 
with 55 individuals qualifying for that title japan ranked second 
with 41 and west germany was third with 20 
american also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988 
survey 47 followed by japans 32 and west germanys 16 
among the richest of the worlds rich are people who didnt 
necessarily come by their money in an honest way 
colombias cocaine barons for instance are still putting away 
piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit 
margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years 
three of them made forbes world billionaires list including 
pablo escobar gaviria leader of the notorious medellin cocaine 
cartel with an estimated personal net worth of 3 billion the 
other cocaine kingpins on the list were the ochoa family worth more 
than 2 billion and gonzalo rodriguez gacha with more than 1 
billion 
in compiling its list forbes does not consider royal families 
and heads of state because their wealth derives more from 
political heritage than from economic effort theirs are feudal 
fortunes not capitalistic ones 
the magazine also excludes dictators such as cubas fidel castro 
or north koreas kim il sung

a few memorable names such as the eastern 
airlines airshuttle the first womens bank and gulf amp western inc 
disappeared from corporate record books in the first half of the 
year 
but overall the number of us companies that changed their 
names fell 18 percent in the first six months of 1989 compared with 
a year ago the first such decline in four years according to a 
survey for release monday 
the identity consulting firm anspach grossman portugal inc 
attributed the decline to a slower pace of business merger activity 
than a year earlier 
the firm said 767 american companies changed their names in the 
january through june period down from a record 931 name changes in 
the first six months of 1988 it was the first such decline since 
1985 
despite the slower pace of merger activity mergers and 
acquisitions remained the most frequently cited reason for name 
changes in the latest period accounting for 351 changes or 46 
percent of the total 
corporate downsizing spinoffs and asset sales accounted for 177 
of the name changes or 23 percent of the total 
the airshuttle for instance was renamed the trump shuttle 
after developer donald trump bought it from troubled eastern 
the survey said there were 139 elective name changes or 18 
percent of the total included among these were the home group 
incs adoption of the name ambase corp middle south utilities 
incs change to entergy corp and american hoist amp derrick cos 
switch to amdura corp 
the remaining name changes were done to reflect corporate 
restructuring or reorganization changes to a holding company and 
other assorted changes in legal status 
joel portugal a principal at anspach grossman portugal said 
some companies are finding value in sticking with their names or a 
shortened version of them rather than creating entirely new names 
he said they have found an existing name can have real value 
like any other corporate asset 
he said fw woolworth co appeared to be following that strategy 
by streamlining its name to woolworth corp and eastern gas amp fuel 
associates did so by changing to eastern enterprises 
even gulf amp western which became paramount communications inc 
last month turned to an old hollywood name many people recognize 
portugal said 
new england apple products co inc a maker of bottled fruit 
drinks capitalized on its major brand name by changing to veryfine 
products inc and austin rover cars of north america became 
sterling motor cars 
the number of thrifts banks and other financial institutions 
that changed their names fell to 195 in the latest sixmonth period 
down from 254 a year earlier the survey stated 
it said an increasing number of thrifts dropped the sampl from 
their names in favor of bank possibly reflecting recent 
concerns about the large number of thrifts that have required 
federal assistance 
one of the more unusual name changes by a bank was the decision 
by the first womens bank to change its name to first new york bank 
for business the new yorkbased bank which formerly catered 
almost exclusively to women customers said the change reflected 
its belief that women no longer were discriminated against by other 
banks and by a decision to expand into middle market commercial 
lending 
overall anspach grossman portugal said the number of 
manufacturers changing their names outpaced changes by financial 
institutions for the first time 229 to 195 
the next most frequent changes by industry were 64 in 
communications 57 in technology and 37 in retailing

ford motor co has dropped its estimate of 
the number of cars and light trucks likely to be sold this year 
industrywide by up to 300000 vehicles further evidence of a 
softening car market 
ford chairman donald petersen on friday lowered the companys 
estimate to about 147 million from about 15 million cars and 
trucks an estimate the company held for months 
chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca last month predicted a sales 
year of 135 million to 14 million vehicles with roughly two cars 
being sold for every light truck general motors corp has held to 
its 15 million vehicle estimate with the same breakdown between car 
and truck sales 
petersen backed away from the cartotruck ratio saying he 
expected truck sales this year to remain at last years level of 
about 5 million units that means the reduction in sales volume 
would come from the car market 
im sure the june sales numbers were the thing that knocked 
them off their pedestal so to speak said auto analyst joseph 
phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
earlier this week ford reported its domestic car sales during 
june were running 123 percent behind the pace during the same month 
last year general motors corps june car sales were 124 percent 
lower than last years and chrysler corps were down 175 percent 
but sales during june of last year were exceptionally strong 
mostly because of attractive incentives 
this june incentives also were offered but they didnt generate 
the same kind of buying interest as they did in 1988 a fact 
petersen acknowledged friday 
last year was the secondbest sales year in industry history 
with 158 million cars and light trucks driven off dealership lots 
the 163 million vehicles sold in 1986 made that year the best in 
history 
although he expected lower sales volume for the industry 
petersen said it would still be a good year 
the auto industry has been coming down gradually since its peak 
in 1986 petersen said after receiving an award as manager of the 
year from the national management association 
weve had quite a run here phillippi said of the past five 
years of vehicle sales we have been due for a correction 
while gm and chrysler have been losing market share during the 
past year ford has been gaining 
also on friday petersen said more plant closings and layoffs are 
possible during the third quarter beyond the normal breaks for 
summer vacation and model changeovers however he addedm that he 
didnt think the layoffs would be significant or longlasting

a greek bank whose usbased officers are charged 
with racketeering bilked depositors of hundreds of millions of 
dollars an attorney alleged sunday 
the depositors plan to file a classaction lawsuit monday seeking 
15 billion in damages from the national mortgage bank of greece 
and 14 of its officers said constantine kangles lead attorney in 
the lawsuit 
the bank is the subject of a racketeering investigation by 
federal authorities who on june 21 raided branches in four states 
seizing documents and arresting the officers 
a federal complaint filed in us district court in new york 
charges the bank with illegally accepting more than 700 million in 
deposits from customers in the united states and sending the money 
overseas to avoid taxes 
you had widows investing all the money they had to get the 
higher interest rates offered by the greek bank kangles said 
theres nothing they can do theres a deep feeling the moneys 
not there 
bank officers told customers that interest as much as 18 
percent a year would be paid in greek drachmas and would not be 
subject to us taxes kangles said 
he said about 300 people were party to the lawsuit and that their 
ranks could swell to as many as 3000 he said the 15 billion 
represented treble damages based on a conservative estimate of about 
500 million in deposits 
the national mortgage bank of greece is a separate entity from 
the national bank of greece which also operates in the united 
states the national bank of greece owns about 47 percent of the 
mortgage bank federal authorities say 
phone numbers for the mortgage banks chicagobased officers were 
unlisted and calls sunday to the two chicagoarea branches went 
unanswered 
according to court documents the bank advertised in 
greeklanguage newspapers promising that the accounts would be 
secret 
they put it in the newspaper kangles said almost 
everybody believes what they read in the newspaper 
the seven branches in illinois massachusetts new york and 
pennsylvania were not even legally authorized to accept money from 
customers in the united states authorities say rather the 
branches were opened with the ostensible purpose of encouraging 
investment in greece 
kangles said some depositors had gone to greece to try to get 
their money back and were told accounts were frozen 
some of the depositors could face criminal charges if it is shown 
they willfully sought to evade taxes kangles said but he said most 
of the people did not report the money on their tax returns because 
they believed the banks claims of taxfree status 
part of the damage award the depositors are seeking would go to 
pay penalties the depositors would owe the internal revenue service 
kangles said

maverick labor organizer ray rogers met with about 
200 striking eastern airlines flight attendants sunday urging them 
to broaden their battle beyond the picket lines and target the 
airlines stockholders and other investors 
these workers have tremendous skills that can be put to use 
whether its canvassing neighborhoods putting together mailings 
or speaking to the media rogers 45 said after the meeting at a 
hotel at logan international airport 
theyve got to be mobilized theyve got to be transformed into 
a powerful economic and political force that can go out and build 
economic and political support he said 
with the strike in its fourth month the transport workers union 
of america hired rogers last week to try to bring the strike to a 
successful end rogers said he and the union will hold a miami news 
conference wednesday to name specific actions they will take in the 
next phase of their strike 
once union leaders realize that everybody can become involved 
in a campaigns strategy and tactics then they can win he said 
rogers who has incurred the wrath of some union leaders for his 
maverick style said his organization corporate campaign inc is 
working without a fee to help beat frank lorenzo chairman of 
eastern parent texas air corp and a man considered one of unions 
most formidable foes 
this guy is a tough nut to crack rogers said of the man who 
has come out on top in past union struggles with continental 
airlines another unit of texas air corp i think we can play an 
important role in making this a successful struggle 
rogers said he will contact 65000 to 90000 community and union 
leaders nationwide and push for their support not only against 
eastern but also against corporations that are investing in the 
carrier 
rogers refused to name any specific actions hed take against 
eastern investors 
in past strikes rogers has caused controversy by forging ahead 
in spite of the reservations of union leaders 
ray has a tremendous talent as an organizer particularly in a 
strike situation to get members involved and enthusiastic said 
alan zack spokesman for the united food and commercial workers 
union where he has a problem is that he sometimes tends to 
substitute his judgment for that of the elected leadership 
the flight attendants union hired rogers because they have faith 
in his leadership abilities said judith a coughlin the unions 
financial secretary 
weve had thousands of people ask us what can we do she 
said we werent able to give them the kinds of jobs which we 
would like to have given them now we can 
we hired ray rogers the organizer not ray rogers the 
renegade she said

strikebound and financially troubled eastern 
airlines may face a new problem with immigration officials who say 
the carrier is doing little to stop illegal aliens from flying into 
this country 
perry rivkind district director of the us immigration and 
naturalization service said eastern has been warned repeatedly to 
tighten up checks of aliens taking flights to the united states 
rivkind said of particular concern has been an increase in cuban 
nationals arriving at miami international airport on eastern flights 
from panama and other latin countries 
fortyseven cubans were arrrested saturday for immigration 
violations he said 
rivkind said he plans to meet monday with a federal prosecutor to 
discuss possible charges against eastern and air panama air panama 
may be linked to a phony passport operation rivkind said 
the airlines have got to become much more responsible in that 
area rivkind said saturday eastern is very slack on this and 
always has been 
eastern spokesman james ashlock denied the airline was lax in 
checking documents but he said there has been a problem with forged 
papers 
airlines must check immigration papers before issuing a ticket to 
a foreign national to come to the united states 
we do admit and i think weve explained this to ins were 
coping with a flood of forged documents no question about it its 
an ageold problem in our business ashlock said 
we will certainly study whatever complaint he plans to bring 
up ashlock added 
some cubans arrested last week told the ins they bought passports 
in panama used them to board their flight then gave the passports 
to a panamanian official before takeoff 
apparently in panama it appears that the panamanian government 
is condoning and actually arranging for cubans to get on flights 
rivkind said possibly both eastern airlines and air panama staff 
may have full knowledge of this 
ashlock said he had heard nothing about passports collected on an 
eastern plane 
im going to vigorously pursue this with the attorney 
general rivkind said saying easterns flight crew would had to 
have known about the activity

carl ledbetter former president and 
chief executive officer of the control data corp supercomputer 
subsidiary that was closed in april has left control data to form 
another company 
ledbetter who headed eta systems in st paul said he briefly 
explored the possibility of purchasing etas assets from control 
data but he and former eta executive al moschner decided to start a 
new twin cities company he said 
the new company will make specialpurpose highperformance 
computers ledbetter said friday adding that its product line will 
not resemble a generalpurpose supercomputer which was the eta 
product 
ledbetter who presided over control datas effort to challenge 
minneapolisbased cray research in the world supercomputer market 
was removed from the helm of eta last october in a restructuring 
that folded eta into the parent company 
he was reinstated at eta in february when control data reversed 
its earlier plan that prompted speculation that eta was for sale or 
seeking an investor and that ledbetter was a key ingredient in that 
strategy eta was closed following losses of more than 100 million 
last year 
while eta fell victim to its own technological delays and to 
control datas worsening financial problems ledbetter became 
wellknown in the supercomputer industry and was credited with 
having fought an uphill battle to make eta a competitor

ford motor co exploited loopholes to avoid paying 
200 million in gas guzzler taxes during the 1986 model year a 
consumer advocacy group claims 
clarence ditlow of the center for auto safety said that ford 
substituted its 1986 thunderbird for several larger less 
fuelefficient cars in compiling projections to determine which 
models would be subject to the gasguzzler tax a special levy 
placed on models that fail to meet fuelefficiency standards 
by slipping this wolf into sheeps clothing ford avoided up to 
200 million in gasguzzler taxes ditlow wrote in a letter to 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly 
the epa said ford did nothing illegal but appeared to have 
violated the spirit of the complex gasguzzler tax law robert 
maxwell director of the epas certification division said he could 
not confirm the 200 million figure 
ford acknowledged that the epa questioned its methods for 
figuring tax liability but said it had done nothing wrong 
ford said that in the future it would take special care to 
avoid this situation said donald r buist director of the 
automakers automotive emissions and fuel economy office 
in a similar case chrysler corp was cited in epa documents for 
using loopholes to avoid paying 29 million in gasguzzler taxes in

ual corp the parent of united airlines again 
may be a takeover target and trading in its shares closed out the 
week with plenty of loft 
ual was the most active issue traded friday on the new york stock 
exchange soaring by 1350 a share to close at a new high of 166 
nearly 19 million shares changed hands friday and the 166 
eclipsed the previous 52week high of 15250 set the previous day 
in a court ruling released friday us district judge james b 
zagel of chicago sided with the air line pilots association by 
invalidating parts of a ual contract with the machinists union 
these provisions gave the machinists the right to reopen their 
contract and strike if the airline were acquired 
united pilots argued that the provisions amounted to illegal 
antitakeover measures aimed at blocking the 110pershare bid for 
the company they first proposed in 1987 
we have never abandoned our pursuit of the company said rick 
dubinsky head of the united pilots unit those covenants were 
impediments to our financing and now theyre apparently out of the 
way 
dubinsky said the union is considering a revised bid for the 
airline 
even before news of the court ruling reached the market there 
was a buying surge earlier friday attributed by analysts to 
speculation that an offer for ual might come from its management 
a ual spokesman declined to comment on the developments

the explosion of a major pipeline in the ural 
mountains decreased the countrys gas supply by 20 percent forcing 
cuts in gas exports and supplies to domestic factories and 
consumers a government official said 
gas minister viktor s chernomyrdin also said soviet consumers 
should conserve gas used in kitchen stoves and brace for shortages 
of rubber and plastic goods made from the petroleum products the 
pipeline carried 
a 1153mile pipeline carrying a mixture of benzine propane and 
butane from western siberia to chemical factories and kitchen stoves 
in the countrys center burst june 4 as two passenger trains were 
passing 
a spark from the transsiberian railroad trains touched off an 
explosion and fire incinerating more than 600 passengers 745 miles 
southeast of moscow 
president mikhail s gorbachev said workers noticed a drop in 
pressure caused by the leak but increased the flow instead of 
shutting the line down 
on the day of the accident a gas ministry spokesman told the 
associated press the gas flow from the region was quickly diverted 
to an alternate pipeline and that no significant disruption 
occurred it was not immediately possible to explain the discrepency 
in the two officials assessments 
chernomyrdin told the government daily izvestia in an interview 
published saturday that the pipeline carried 13500 tons of the 
17000 tons of liquefied gas that western siberia supplies daily to 
the countrys center he said the accident caused a daily production 
shortfall of 5000 tons 
izvestia did not say how many tons of gas the nation produces 
but it said the accident caused a 20 percent reduction in gas 
supplies in june 
chernomyrdin said many petrochemical factories are either idle or 
working at half strength because of the gas shortfall he also said 
raw petroleum products supplied to industry will be cut by 25 
percent in the third quarter of the year causing losses in the 
millions of rubles 
the gas shortage and decreased plastic and rubber supplies will 
affect soviet consumers already grappling with shortages of meat 
butter toothpaste sugar and matches chernomyrdin said gas 
supplies to the 41 million stoves in the soviet union will be cut 6 
percent in the third quarter 
the minister urged people to conserve gas in their homes and use 
alternate fuels in country houses 
the disruption also is hurting the nations attempts to obtain 
foreign currency badly needed in gorbachevs drive to modernize 
domestic industry 
the soviet union is the worlds largest oil and gas producer 
chernomyrdin said the loss of the pipeline would force a 60 
percent reduction in gas exports in the third quarter depriving the 
country of 125 million in foreign currency income 
because it wont be able to fulfill some contracts with foreign 
customers the soviets will have to pay 16 million in fines and 
spend 312 million in foreign currency on repair equipment in all 
he said repairs will take half a year and cost more than 156 
million 
natural and manmade disasters have hampered the gorbachev 
administration 
the nation spent millions to clean up and rebuild after the 1986 
chernobyl nuclear power plant accident and the december 1988 
earthquake in armenia
